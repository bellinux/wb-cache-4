25|$|A {{philosophical}} {{issue in}} the study of mysticism is the relation of mysticism to morality. Albert Schweitzer presented the classic account of mysticism and morality being incompatible. Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs. Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality. Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is not as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
500|$|The clubs {{met again}} five weeks {{later in the}} League Cup quarter-finals at Old Trafford and despite both sides fielding {{weakened}} teams, the match was not short of drama. David Bellion gave United the lead in just 19 seconds, but tempers boiled over in the second half; a late tackle by Robin van Persie on Kieran Richardson resulted in a fracas between both sets of players, which concluded with both protagonists getting booked by referee Mark Halsey. The game finished 1–0. In the reverse league fixture, club captains Keane and Vieira had to be separated in the tunnel before the match by referee Graham Poll. Keane accused the Arsenal midfielder of intimidating his teammate Gary Neville, telling the press afterwards: [...] "I said, 'Come and have a go at me'. <b>Simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>that.</b> If he wants to intimidate some of my team-mates then let's have a go {{at some of the}} other players. I think Gary Neville's an easy target. I wasn't having it." [...] Vieira gave Arsenal the lead in the eighth minute of the match but United ran out 4–2 winners.|$|E

Les's wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), struggles with this and ends their marriage. In one of several attempts to win Pam back, Les burns all of Christine's belongings.

Badland said that Babe is [...] "quite Dickensian in the way that she finds things and slips them into her pocket to use against people!" [...] The storyline was revisited in May 2016 when Babe begins anonymously blackmailing Les and Pam in exchange for her silence. Of Babe's motivation to blackmail the Cokers, Badland said that [...] "Babe hasn't got any respect for Pam and Les and she's using them to get money. It's as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> really." [...] She also said that she [...] "resents seeing [...] and Pam together as a unit" [...] after he rejects her romantic advances, because she has [...] "never had what they have".|$|E

Later in the month, Lawn gave further backing to McCall, who was coming under pressure from the club's fans following a run of one win in nine games; during the run McCall was also charged by The Football Association for the first time of his managerial career after he had contested a refereeing decision during a game with Luton Town. McCall signed a new contract in February, which extended his deal by another two years and would have kept him at the club until 2011. He set himself the goal of earning two promotions to put City in the Championship. However, less than a month later, McCall offered to resign if they did not reach the play-offs after his side lost 4–1 to Bournemouth – their fifth consecutive away defeat. [...] "Nobody is hurting more than me but it's as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>that,</b> if we miss out I don't deserve to be here," [...] he said. City eventually missed out on promotion, but McCall decided to stay on as manager and took a voluntary pay cut in the process because of the club's budget being reduced.|$|E
