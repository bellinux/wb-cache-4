A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.|$|E

This, in combination with masonry thoroughness, led Incan buildings to have a peerless seismic resistance thanks to high static and dynamic steadiness, absence of resonant frequencies and <b>stress</b> <b>concentration</b> points.

Failure of safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire {{in the case of}} cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines. Chlorine-induced cracking of acetal resin plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties, especially in the USA in the 1990s. Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked vulnerable polymers in the plastic plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded. Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a serious <b>stress</b> <b>concentration.</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> around broken fibres are {{a crucial}} part of {{strength}} models for unidirectional composites. These <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> are often calculated from the solution of a single broken fibre and then linearly superposed to obtain the <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> around multiple broken fibres. By using the finite element method, this paper shows that the linear superposition may be inaccurate for predicting the <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> around multiple broken fibres. The discrepancy increases with decreased distance between the broken fibres. In the case of two broken fibres, the relative error is limited to about 5 %. However, with more than two broken fibres, linear superposition becomes increasingly inaccurate. It was also confirmed that linear superposition is not suitable for predicting <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> if a matrix crack is present. These results demonstrate the need for an improved superposition principle to increase accuracy of strength models for unidirectional composites. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Certain conditions, such as low {{concentrations}} of oxygen or high {{concentrations of}} species such as chloride which complete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy's ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, {{almost all of the}} surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause <b>stress</b> <b>concentration</b> to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys, but it can be prevented by control of the alloy's environment.|$|E
500|$|On 19 October 1954, the Cohen Committee was {{established}} to examine {{the causes of the}} Comet crashes. [...] Chaired by Lord Cohen, the committee tasked an investigation team led by Sir Arnold Hall, Director of the RAE at Farnborough, to perform a more detailed investigation. [...] Hall's team began considering fatigue as the most likely cause of both accidents, and initiated further research into measurable strain on the aircraft's skin. With the recovery of large sections of G-ALYP from the Elba crash and BOAC's donation of an identical airframe, G-ALYU, for further examination, an extensive [...] "water torture" [...] test eventually provided conclusive results. This time, the entire fuselage was tested in a dedicated water tank that was built specifically at Farnborough to accommodate its full length. Stress around the window corners was found to be much higher than expected and stresses on the skin were generally more than previously expected or tested. The windows' square shape caused <b>stress</b> <b>concentration</b> by generating levels of stress two or three times greater than across the rest of the fuselage. In 2012 a finite element analysis was carried out to find the stress values in a digital model of the Comet's cabin window loaded to a pressure differential of 8.25 psi. In this model the maximum stress level at the margin of one of the outer row of rivet holes near the corner of the window was almost five times greater than in the areas of skin remote from the windows.|$|E

40|$|Thin-walled tubular joints, bonded end to end, are {{commonly}} used specimens to measure the mechanical properties of thin adhesive layers subjected to uniform shear stress distributions. Unfortunately, the application of an axial loading to this geometry leads to strong <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{at the edges of}} the adherend–adhesive interface. This drawback undermines the use of this test for characterizing adhesives under biaxial stress conditions. With the aim of removing these <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations,</b> this paper suggests the introduction of stress relieving grooves on the internal and external surfaces of the tubular adherends. The optimal shape of the groove is identified following the Taguchi robust optimization technique. Via finite element analyses, the <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{at the edges of the}} adherend–adhesive interface are calculated. Many geometries are examined for different adherend and adhesive properties (noise factors) in order to identify the groove shape that minimizes the <b>stress</b> <b>concentrations</b> for all experimental conditions.

In this first attempt, attention has been focused on the stress-invariant based approaches in the high-cycle fatigue regime. The multiaxial damage evaluation is obtained by analysing the full loading path of the Crossland 5 -dimensional invariant deviatoric stress in Euclidean space by means of the variance reference frame. Explicit analytical solutions of the proposed criterion are given in the case of biaxial sinusoidal loads.
