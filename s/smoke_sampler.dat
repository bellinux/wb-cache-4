40|$|Measurements {{of black}} smoke (BS), total {{suspended}} particulates (TSP) and selected trace element concentrations were made at two locations (four sites) in London, UK. One location was in Ealing, West London, the other was in Wood Green, North London. At each location, a residential and commercial roadside site was identified and monitored. The black smoke measurements were taken over 24 -hour periods via a British standard 8 -port <b>smoke</b> <b>sampler</b> situated inside a mobile laboratory. The TSP measurements were taken during peak traffic periods and 24 -hour periods using glass fibre filters and high volume sampling pumps. At one site (the residential site at Wood Green), the TSP samples were analysed for 17 elements Pb, Zn, Br, Mg, Al, V, Fe, Sb, Mo, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ba, Sn and Pt. After gravimetric analysis, the trace elements were extracted from the filter papers and analysed using inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry. Two methods of extracting the trace elements were investigated, and the most efficient technique, the ''nitric-perchloric'', was used. Quantitative determinations of BS were made {{for a total of}} 98 and 115 days at the Ealing and Wood Green locations respectively during 1991 / 92. The average concentrations determined at the residential locations were 18. 3 (Ealing) and 20. 5 (Wood Green) µg/m³, respectively, and for the commercial sites the corresponding values were 30. 6 and 69. 5 µg/m³. The daily TSP values at the four sites are also reported and compared with measurements taken during the morning and afternoon rush hours. The particulate values reported here are discussed and compared with previously reported measurements in the UK. A total of 55 filter papers from the residential site at Wood Green were extracted for trace element analysis and the results are reported. Sufficient samples were collected to allow the data to be divided into morning, afternoon and 24 -hour time periods, allowing comparison of the trends with the TSP data. The total and individual contributions of the trace elements to the particulate mass have been calculated and the most abundant trace elements (Zn, Pb, Br, Fe, Al, Mg) identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{infrared}} spectra of crystalline minerals predicted in theoretical condensation sequences {{do not match}} the astronomical observations. Since the astronomical spectra are a closer match to glassy silicates, the authors undertook a study to measure the {{infrared spectra}} of glassy silicates that have compositions similar to silicate minerals predicted in theoretical condensation sequences. The data should support observations aimed at elucidating condensation chemistry in dust forming regions. The authors measured the mass absorption coefficients, from 2. 5 to 25 microns, of ground samples of olivine, diopside, and serpentine and also <b>smoke</b> <b>samples</b> that were prepared from these minerals. The <b>smoke</b> <b>samples</b> prepared in this way are predominantly glassy with nearly the same composition as the parent minerals. The crystalline samples consisted of pure olivine ((Fe(0. 1) Mg(0. 9)) (2) SiO(4)), serpentine, diopside. Sample purity was confirmed by x ray diffraction. Each mineral was ground for 10 hours and a measured mass of the powder was mixed with KBr powder for absorption measurements using the method of Borghesi et a. (1985). The <b>smoke</b> <b>samples</b> were prepared from the same samples used for grinding by vaporizing the minerals using pulsed laser radiation in air. The <b>smoke</b> <b>samples</b> formed by condensation of the resulting vapor. The smoke settled onto infrared transparent KRS- 5 substrates and onto a quartz crystal microbalance used to obtain mass measurements. A description of the preparation method is given in Stephens (1980). The glassy diopside showed only diffuse electron diffraction peaks and hence was nearly amorphous, while the serpentine smoke showed a weak diffraction pattern corresponding to MgO. The smoke from olivine showed a weak diffraction pattern corresponding to Fe 2 O 3 and/or Fe 3 O 4.

Samples were collected in smoke plumes of burning savanna and in regional haze. A known artifact, produced by the adsorption of organic gases on the quartz filter substrates used to collect the particulate matter samples, comprised {{a significant portion of}} the TC collected.

For example, the estimated aerosol coalbedo (1 - single scattering albedo (SSA)), which is a measure of aerosol absorption, of the biomass <b>smoke</b> <b>samples</b> is 60 % larger using corrected OC concentrations.
