The program requires less than 4 kb of random access memory (RAM); it is rapid, and not restricted {{by the size of}} the molecule ion. To calculate the experimentally observed peaks of bovine insulin within 2 % error required 30 s on an IBM PC-XT 286 microcomputer fitted with a math coprocessor; similarly, all peaks of the <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomer</b> took 68 s on a Commodore 10 -II personal computer.

40|$|Several systems, {{containing}} up to 10 mol % ionic co-units, {{were investigated}} by dynamic mechanical techniques, primarily above the glass transition. The ionic units in quaternized poly(styrene-co- 4 -vinylpyridine) mildly retard chain diffusion. In contrast, the rubbery plateau of blends of poly(styrene-co-styrene-sulfonic acid) and poly(ethyl acrylate-co- 4 -vinylpyridine), compatible above ca. 4 mol % co-unit content, is greatly extended, independent of co-unit content. It is postulated that the kinetics of ion dissociation and reassociation in the blends are faster than chain diffusion, effectively trapping chain entanglements for comparatively long times. Time-temperature reducibility applies {{to both the}} cationic ionomers and the blends. It fails at high plasticizer contents for poly(styrene-co-sodium methacrylate), of 5 mol % ion content, plasticized by a <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomer.</b> Two relaxation processes are evident in this system.

40|$|One of the {{polymers}} enabling successful {{application of}} organic solvent nanofiltration membranes is silicone {{or more precisely}} poly(organosiloxane). This thesis includes a study on silicone based membranes, as to their chemistry, their separation performance in organic solvents and influence of introduced functional groups. The performance of a silicone based membrane was first compared to membranes based on polyimide and PIM- 1 (polymers of intrinsic microporosity). The tests were made in heptane and acetone to underlie {{the difference in the}} separation properties of the tested membrane materials. Further, the development of a predictive model for multicomponent mass transport through a silicone membrane was made. The applied modelling approach can be differentiated in a Flory-Rehner based model to estimate membrane swelling and a simplified Maxwell-Stefan mass transport model. The prediction accuracy of developed modelling approach was compared to the measured values for eleven pure solvents. The predicted values of <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomer</b> rejection curves in these solvents were also compared to the measured values. The production and performance of composite membranes made from acrylatefunctional and epoxy-functional silicones in styrene oligomer/heptane mixture were also investigated.

40|$|AbstractHere, we {{conducted}} in vitro genotoxicity tests {{to evaluate the}} genotoxicity of <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> extracted from polystyrene intended for use in contact with food. <b>Styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> were extracted with acetone and the extract was subjected to the Ames test (OECD test guideline No. 471) and the in vitro chromosomal aberration test (OECD test guideline No. 473) under good laboratory practice conditions. The concentrations of styrene dimers and trimers in the concentrated extract were 540 and 13, 431 ppm, respectively. Extraction with acetone provided markedly higher concentrations of <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> compared with extraction with 50 % ethanol aqueous solution, which is the food simulant currently recommended for use in safety assessments of polystyrene by both the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority.

40|$|Part I of this {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the use of supercritical CO 2 as a blowing agent to produce microcellular foams. The goal of this research was to determine the origins of observed differences between the foaming behavior of commercial materials and those materials produced in our laboratory. It was shown that polymer molecular weight and polydispersity are not important factors in determining cell size and are not responsible for the disparity in cell sizes observed. This disparity was, however, a result of the presence of a very low molecular weight component (∼ 270 g/mol) found the commercial samples. Extraction of this component reduced the cell diameter of resulting foams to that of the NMW distribution samples. Addition of a <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomer</b> (285 g/mol) to a NMW distribution sample resulted in foams with larger cell diameters. Varying the concentration of this oligomer allows control of cell size in foams. ^ Part II concentrates on the adsorption behavior of end-functionalized polymers to monochlorosilane-modified silica surfaces. Chemically grafted tris(trimethylsiloxy) silyl (sub) monolayers (tris(TMS)) were prepared on the native oxide of silicon by the vapor phase reaction of the monochlorosilane at elevated temperatures. By exploiting the inherently sluggish kinetics of the silanization reaction, the grafting density of the tris(TMS) (sub) monolayer can be tuned. Unreacted silanol groups on the substrate surface were used as adsorption sites for carboxylic acid end-functionalized polystyrenes (PS-COOH). The thickness of the adsorbed layer could be controlled by the tris(TMS) surface coverage, adsorbing solvent, and polymer molecular weight. The topography of the adsorbed layers was investigated by AFM. ^ Part III probes the absorption behavior of a specific protein, albumin, to monochlorosilane-modified silica surfaces. Covalently attached monolayers were prepared on the native oxide of silicon by reaction of various chlorosilanes at room temperature. Both one-component (pure) surfaces and two-component (mixed) surfaces were investigated. The adsorption of albumin to these surfaces was carried out under physiological conditions, and ellipsometry was used to determine the total adsorbed amount of protein to these surfaces. The adsorption of albumin closely follows the surface energy of the substrate as seen by plotting adsorbance (Γ) versus the cosine of the water contact angle. The morphology of the adsorbed albumin layer was examined by AFM and was correlated to the mode of adsorption of the albumin molecule as directed by the surface chemistry. ...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to conducting controlled free radical polymerization in water-borne organic dispersions using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) has been studied. The novel approach {{in this study}} focused on eliminating monomer and oligomer transport and comprised two fundamental steps: the synthesis of dithiobenzoate-end-capped <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> in bulk followed by emulsification of these oligomers to yield a polymerizable water-borne dispersion. Dithioesters that act as chain transfer agents in the RAFT process were synthesized in situ. The free radical polymerization of the dithiobenzoate-end-capped <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> in the water-borne organic dispersion proceeded in a controlled manner: molar mass increased in a linear fashion with increasing conversion, while polydispersities remained low. The familiar red layer formation associated with RAFT polymerization in conventional emulsions was not observed under these conditions.

In the MCF- 7 cell proliferation assay, styrene trimers (ST- 1, ST- 3, ST- 4, and ST- 5) {{had the highest}} proliferative activities of the compounds tested. The relative potency of these chemicals was 0. 0002 - 0. 0015 %, which was comparable with that of bisphenol A (0. 0001 - 0. 0025 %), and their relative proliferative effect was 51 - 104 %. Styrene dimers (SD- 3 and SD- 4) also significantly increased the cell yields. However, SD- 1, SD- 2, ST- 2, ST- 6, and ST- 7 had insignificant proliferative activities. The competitive binding assay revealed the binding affinity of some <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> for hER[alpha]. The order of their binding potency for hER[alpha] was as follows: ST- 4 > ST- 2 > ST- 3 > ST- 5 > ST- 1 > SD- 3 > SD- 4 > SD- 2 > SD- 1. ST- 6 and ST- 7 {{did not appear to}} bind to hER[alpha].

40|$|Polystyrene (PS) plastic marine {{pollution}} is an environmental concern. However, {{a reliable and}} objective assessment {{of the scope of}} this problem, which can lead to persistent organic contaminants, has yet to be performed. Here, we show that anthropogenic <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> (SOs), a possible indicator of PS pollution in the ocean, are found globally at concentrations that are higher than those expected based on the stability of PS. SOs appear to persist to varying degrees in the seawater and sand samples collected from beaches around the world. The most persistent forms are styrene monomer, styrene dimer, and styrene trimer. Sand samples from beaches, which are commonly recreation sites, are particularly polluted with these high SOs concentrations. This finding is of interest from both scientific and public perspectives because SOs may pose potential long-term risks to the environment in combination with other endocrine disrupting chemicals. From SOs monitoring results, this study proposes a flow diagram for SOs leaching from PS cycle. Using this flow diagram, we conclude that SOs are global contaminants in sandy beaches around the world due to their broad spatial distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{coefficients of}} oligomeric radicals in monomer-polymer systems {{have a major}} influence on properties such as polymerization rates and molecular weight distributions. The present work reports the results of an extensive set of studies of diffusion coefficients of rubbery ternary systems comprising polymer, diluent, and oligomer, determined by pulsed-field-gradient NMR, at 25 and 40 degrees C. Oligomers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and of butyl methacrylate (BMA) were synthesized by using a catalytic cobalt chain transfer agent to produce macromonomers with a terminal double bond. Where necessary, these were fractionated by preparative GPC to obtain samples ranging from dimeric to decameric; typical polydispersities were 1. 08. Pulsed-field gradient NMR is facilitated by being able to monitor the proton NMR of the CH 2 hydrogens on the double bond. Matrixes used were high molecular weight polyMMA and polyBMA, the weight fraction of polymer (w(p)) being varied by adding appropriate amounts of diluent (the saturated equivalents of MMA and BMA, viz., methyl isobutyrate and butyl isobutyrate). Above c* (the concentration at which chains start to overlap), all data for diffusion coefficients Di of an oligomer of degree of polymerization i could be fitted with acceptable accuracy by D- 1 (w(p)) /D-i(w(p)) = i(0. 664 + 2. 02 wp), for both BMA and MMA oligomers in both MMA and BMA matrixes; the same relation also fits earlier data on <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> in polystyrene. If more accurate scaling parameters are obtained experimentally for smaller oligomers, these can be used to predict data for higher oligomers with even better reliability.

40|$|Polystyrene is {{frequently}} used in resins, and the styrene dimers and trimers eluted from polystyrene {{have been reported}} to have estrogenic activity (1). We have performed a number of in vitro and in vivo tests [i. e., estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor binding assays, thyroid hormone receptor binding assays, human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 proliferation assays (E-SCREEN), uterotrophic assays in immature and ovariectomized rats, Hershberger assays, and prolactin release assays and steroidogenesis] and found no effects of styrene dimers or trimers on sex hormones in any of these assays (2 – 7). These results are supported by Fail et al. (8), who reported that mixtures of <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> did not show any estrogenic activity in the immature rat uterotrophic assay and the reporter gene assay. In addition, the Japan Environment Agency referred to their studies (9) and removed the styrene dimers and trimers from their list of endocrine disruptors (9). However, Ohyama et al. (10) reported that high concentrations of certain styrene dimers and trimers showed estrogenic effects in an ER binding assay and in the E-SCREEN assay. Recently, several assay systems have been used to assess endocrine-disrupting effects, but a few of these assay systems can cause false-positive reactions when test compounds are at high concentrations (11). To assess the accuracy of the ER binding assay system and the results of Ohyama et al.

40|$|Monitoring the coil-stretch {{transition}} of polymers in transient extensional flow fields provides a unique possibility {{to observe the}} stress distribution between polymer and solvent even for very dilute solutions (with sub-ppm concentrations). It is generally accepted that for concentrations below the critical concentration (c/c* < O(1)) the steric and frictional interactions of neighboring polymer coils are negligible and the rheological response of the fluid is solely governed by the solvent and the weak hydrodynamical interactions of the isolated polymer coil and the solvent. However, this definition of diluteness is only applicable close to the equilibrium state of polymer coils. Especially in extensionally-dominated flow fields, the coil-stretch {{transition of}} a polymer coil leads to an increased interaction volume of the polymer and therefore to polymer-polymer interactions even for concentrations of c/c* < O(1). The term “ultradilute” solution has been introduced recently to describe systems that remain truly dilute even when the polymer chains are in a highly stretched and deformed non-equilibrium state. The Capillary Break-up Extensional Rheometer provides a convenient means for probing chain-chain interactions {{as a function of}} polymer concentration through measurements of the characteristic time-scale of the fluid in a strong extensional flow However, in order to analyze the dynamics of the capillary break-up process it is necessary to answer the question of how much stress is carried by the polymer and how much by the solvent? In other words, under what physical conditions does a coil-stretch transition on the molecular scale occur and affect the resulting macroscopic fluid dynamics so {{that it is possible to}} detect a really “ultradilute” solution? In this paper we will present recent investigations on the capillary break-up behavior of a series of polystyrene solutions with narrowly-distributed molecular weight that are progressively diluted in solvents with different viscosities (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Radius vs. time in a capillary break-up extensional rheometer experiment for solutions of polystyrene (Mw= 1. 9  106 g/mol, Mw/Mn= 1. 03) in <b>styrene</b> <b>oligomers</b> at different concentrations. (end plate diameter 6 mm, initial separation distance 3 mm final distance 10 mm separation time 50 ms). We show that there exists a critical dilution concentration below which the dominant stress resisting breakup is carried solely by the solvent. This observation is supported by numerical simulation of the stress evolution using a multimode FENE-P mode algorithm based on the one-dimensional analysis of Entov and Hinch for transient extensional flows (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Force balance for a collapsing liquid bridge of a dilute polystyrene solution (Mw= 1. 9  106 g/mol, c= 250 ppm, stresses in Pa).
