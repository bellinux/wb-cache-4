40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the {{utilization}} of magnetic nanoparticles in biological systems, {{it is important to}} develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions that take place between the two systems. Magnetic nanoparticles are of particular interest for applications such as transfection, biodetection, and targeted drug delivery to name a few. The goal of this research was to study the effect iron oxide nanoparticles have on cellular growth and function, as well as to improve the particles' stability and biocompatibility in aqueous and biological media. Particle synthesis consisted of producing magnetite using the Massart method. Composite iron oxide nanoparticles produced under combustion synthesis were also studied. Previous results indicated that the inorganic nanoparticles formed small aggregates in microbial growth media, thus influencing particle stability. To mitigate this problem, a stabilizing polymer known as gum arabic was tested to control particle size and prevent further agglomeration in aqueous and growth media. Results showed that gum arabic greatly improved particle stability. Growth studies measured the influence of the nanoparticles on cell proliferation using both M 9 and Luria Bertani media to track growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in minimal and rich growth conditions. In addition to E. coli, prostate carcinoma cells (cell line DU 145) were cultured {{in the presence of the}} treated nanoparticles to determine whether gum arabic improved the uptake of the particles in mammalian cells. Fluorescent microscopy was incorporated to detect the location of the nanoparticles in or about the cells by labeling the gum arabic with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The results illustrate the potential use of gum arabic as a <b>surface-modifying</b> <b>agent</b> to improve magnetic particle stability, as well as to promote nanoparticle uptake by mammalian cell cultures...|$|E
40|$|A dialkyldithiophosphate {{modified}} MO & nanoparticle LB {{film was}} prepared on copper substrate. The tribological {{behaviors of the}} film against steel were evaluated using a one-way reciprocating frictiontester. The structural changes of the film during the rubbing process were investigated with a Fourier transform infrared microscope and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It {{was found that the}} nanoparticle LB films decreased the friction coefficient and increased the vvear resistance of the copper substrate significantly. Analyses indicate that formation of a transferred film on the steel counterface. and the occurrence of the tribochemical changes during friction process. mainly involved disordering and partial decomposition of the <b>surface-modified</b> <b>agent.</b> The nucleus of the MO & nanoparticle plays a role in load carrying and antiwear. especially after partial decomposition of the <b>surface-modified</b> <b>agent</b> with increased friction times. A shearing effect was mainly responsible for exciting the tribochemical change. 0 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|As {{summarized}} above, wetting {{properties of}} porous alumina surfaces have been modified by different chemicals including silanes. Silane molecules react strongly {{with the free}} surface hydroxyl groups of alumina, and {{they are among the}} most popular <b>surface-modifying</b> <b>agents.</b> Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) is a silane whose chemical activity derives from the presence of a highly reactive nitrogen atom within the compound. High silanization power of HMDS on various hydroxyl-bearing surfaces, including alumina has been demonstrated in a number of studies [21 – 26].|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of addition of various <b>surface-modifying</b> <b>agents</b> to EDTA solution on the bond strength of an epoxy-based sealer to the root canal dentin. Materials and Method: Sixty single-rooted human mandibular premolars were decoronated and instrumented using rotary system.

40|$|Proteus mirabilis is {{not killed}} by {{polymyxin}} B, normal serum, or sodium deoxycholate. Exposure to polymyxin B renders the cells susceptible to killing {{by the latter}} two agents. The data suggest that this synergism is due to polymyxin B-induced surface changes. The results point out an inadequacy of existing methods of screening for antibiotics; they fail to detect agents which, while showing no in vitro effect on growth, may alter a resistant organism so that it becomes more susceptible to other antimicrobials or host defense mechanisms. A method is described {{which can be used}} to detect such cell <b>surface-modifying</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{reported}} studies {{are related to the}} aqueous graphene oxide and graphene suspensions. Organophilic graphene oxide and graphene nanosheets are important for the application in graphene-based composite materials, while only a few papers presented the methods to produce hydrophobic graphene oxide and graphene nanosheets [16]. For example, graphene oxide sheets could be modified by isocyanate [17], which was well dispersed in polar aprotic solvents. The long alkyl chains (such as octadecylamine) [18] were always used as the <b>surface-modified</b> <b>agents</b> and the alkyl-chain-modified graphene sheets that could be dispersed in organic solvents after sonication [19]. Wang et al. [9] reported the synthesis of hydrophobic graphene oxide nanosheets by a solvothermal method, and then they prepared organophilic graphene nanosheets by reacting with octadecylamine [20].|$|R
40|$|Context: Nanocarriers {{possessing}} long-circulating abilities {{could take}} advantage of the pathophysiology of tumor vasculature to achieve spatial placement. To attain such qualities, the drug carriers should possess suitable physicochemical properties such as size and surface hydrophilicity. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} prepare poly(ε-caprolactone) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with vinorelbine bitartrate (VB) and to modify its steric properties using polyethylene glycol and poloxamer. Furthermore, the influence of surface modification of NPs on their physicochemical and cell interactive properties was evaluated. Materials and Methods: NPs were prepared by double emulsion solvent extraction–evaporation technique. The prepared NPs were evaluated for their physicochemical properties, in vitro protein adsorption and cell cytotoxicity. Results and Discussion: The NPs were < 250 nm with an entrapment efficiency ranging between 40 % and 52 %. The zeta potential of the NPs varied from − 7. 52 mV to − 1. 27 mV depending on the surface modification. The in vitro release studies exhibited a biphasic pattern with an initial burst release followed by controlled release of the drug over 72 h. The protein adsorption studies revealed that the ability to resist protein adsorption was influenced by the concentration of <b>surface-modifying</b> <b>agents</b> and the amount of proteins available for interaction. The surface-modified NPs produced cell cytotoxicity comparable to free VB at higher concentrations owing to sustained release of the drug into the cellular environment. Conclusion: The results emphasize that surface modification of nanocarriers is an essential and effective tool to dodge opsonization and phagocytosis in the physiological milieu...|$|R
