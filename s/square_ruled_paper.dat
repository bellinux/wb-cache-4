5000|$|But just at {{this time}} an {{incident}} of far greater importance changed the aspect of affairs. Cavaignac, {{in spite of his}} self-assurance, had nonetheless been agitated by the doubts expressed on all sides as to the authenticity of certain documents in his dossier. In order to ease his mind he ordered a general review and a reclassification of the secret dossier. In the course of this operation , working by artificial light, noticed an alarming peculiarity in the [...] "Henry document": the lines on the paper—which was ruled in squares—were not of uniform colour. When he looked at the document supplied by Lieutenant-Colonel Henry himself for comparison he found, by comparing the <b>ruled</b> <b>squares,</b> that the heading and {{the lower part of the}} document did not match, the note being a composite of two papers, one dating from 1894, the other from 1896. Much alarmed by his discovery, Cuignet apprised the chief of the cabinet (General Roget) and the minister, Cavaignac. The conviction of these two, hitherto unshaken by the nonsense and the improbability of the [...] "Vercingétorix document"—as Esterhazy had called it—gave way before the mismatch of the <b>squares</b> <b>ruled</b> on the <b>paper.</b> Cavaignac, for motives still unknown, kept the matter secret for a fortnight. Then, as Henry was passing through Paris, he summoned him to the War Office and questioned him in the presence of Generals de Boisdeffre, Gonse, and Roget. Henry began by swearing that the document was authentic, then got entangled in confused explanations, suggesting that he had completed certain parts of it [...] "from oral information"; in the end, conquered by the evidence against him, he admitted that he had forged the document. Generals de Boisdeffre and Gonse, who in 1896 had accepted this forgery without question, now kept a frigid silence. Abandoned by the chiefs who had tacitly driven him to the crime, Henry gave way entirely.|$|R

[...] The Scout may move any number of spaces in a straight line (such as the rook in chess). In the older versions of Stratego the Scout could not move and strike in the same turn; in newer versions this was allowed. Even before that, sanctioned play usually amended the original Scout movement to allow moving and striking in the same turn because it facilitates gameplay.

50|$|As {{with many}} other sailing {{handicap}} and construction <b>rules,</b> the <b>Square</b> Metre <b>rule</b> fell in popularity as its weaknesses were discovered. However, in its revised form it {{has proved to be}} enduring and new boats following the rule are still built today. The internationally most active classes are the 22m² and 30m². Larger classes are mostly boats built prior to the 1925 rule and generally only found in the Baltic, where they are dutifully cared for by enthusiasts. Although it was never quite as widespread as the International <b>Rule,</b> the <b>Square</b> Metre <b>rule</b> has a devoted following in many countries. Strongholds of the rule have traditionally been Sweden, Finland and Germany, which also had national <b>Square</b> Metre <b>rule</b> boats, known as Seefahrtkreuzer. Many German square metre boats were confiscated by the British during and after World War II and transferred to Britain, where they became known as 'Windfall' yachts.|$|R

The D'Nealian writing style is a well-known teaching method that makes use {{of this type of}} paper ruling. Another educational institution, A Beka Book, utilizes this ruling along with a house metaphor (upstairs, downstairs, and basement) to help young children learn where parts of each letter should be written.

50|$|For {{even more}} precise {{location}} mapping, two additional digits were proposed and ratified as an extended locator, making it altogether eight characters long, and dividing subsquares into even smaller ones. Such precision has uses in very short communication spans. Beyond this, no common definition exists {{to extend the}} system further into even smaller squares. Most often the extending is done by repeating alternating subsquare and <b>square</b> <b>rules</b> (base numbers 24 and 10 respectively). However, other bases for letter encodings have also been observed, and therefore such extended extended locators might not be compatible.|$|R

Other than inductive and abductive logic programming, research into data mining from knowledge bases has been almost non-existent, because contemporary methods involve inherent procedurality which is dicult to cast into the declarativity of knowledge base systems.
