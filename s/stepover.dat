500|$|Cena {{was drafted}} to the Raw brand on June 6, 2005, {{becoming}} the first wrestler selected in the annual draft lottery. Cena immediately entered a feud with Eric Bischoff, after refusing {{to participate in the}} [...] "war" [...] against the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) roster at One Night Stand. With Bischoff vowing to make Cena's stint on Raw difficult, he hand picked Jericho to take Cena's championship from him. During their feud, even though Cena was portrayed as the [...] "face" [...] (hero) and Jericho as the [...] "heel" [...] (villain), a vocal section of live crowds, nonetheless, were cheering Jericho during their matches. Crowds started to heavily boo Cena during his next feud with Kurt Angle, who took over as Bischoff's hand-picked number-one contender after Cena defeated Jericho in a You're Fired match on the August 22 Raw. Cena held on to the WWE Championship through his feud with Angle, losing to him by disqualification at Unforgiven and pinning him at Taboo Tuesday, in a match also involving Shawn Michaels, and Survivor Series. The feud with Angle also saw Cena add a secondary, submission based, finishing maneuver – the STFU (a <b>stepover</b> toehold sleeper, though named for a <b>stepover</b> toehold facelock) – when he was put into a triple threat submissions only match on the November 28 episode of Raw.|$|E

30|$|The surface {{ruptures}} generally appeared along previously recognized fault traces, but did {{not always}} follow them precisely (Figs.  1 c, 3 a, 4 a, 5 a). Large dextral strike-slip displacements of about 200  cm occurred along the 12 -km-long central section of the Futagawa segment, accompanied by significant normal slip in the middle part of the section. Surface ruptures of the southwestern and northeastern sections of the Futagawa segment were characterized by arrays of releasing <b>stepovers</b> 7 – 8  km long and 2.5  km wide that diverged toward {{the ends of the}} segment, unlike the continuous curvilinear traces that were previously mapped there (e.g., Ikeda et al. 2001) (Fig.  4 a). Especially in the southwestern section, <b>stepovers</b> of the ruptures appeared where fault traces were indistinct in the previous fault maps. This reflects the difficulty of mapping active faults where their distribution is complex.|$|R
50|$|When a strike-slip {{fault is}} offset along strike such as {{to create a}} gap i.e. a left-stepping bend on a sinistral fault, a zone of {{extension}} or transtension is generated. Such bends are known as releasing bends or extensional <b>stepovers</b> and often form pull-apart basins or rhombochasms. Examples of active pull-apart basins include the Dead Sea, formed at a left-stepping offset of the sinistral sense Dead Sea Transform system, and the Sea of Marmara, formed at a right-stepping offset on the dextral sense North Anatolian Fault system.|$|R
5000|$|Horizontal T, also {{referred}} to as a horizontal cordon: Branches are trained horizontally along evenly spaced wires. Start with a V shape where a third bud is trained straight up to another wire. Train other two branches to <b>stepover.</b> In spring of second year prune the vertical stem to the second wire and again train to a V shape, etc. It takes one year per each level.|$|E
50|$|An {{analysis}} of the propagation speed indicates that the rupture propagated at a normal velocity along the original segment, but increased in velocity to above the S-wave velocity after the jump across the extensional <b>stepover</b> and continued at that speed until propagation stopped. This makes the Kunlun earthquake the best documented example of a supershear earthquake. It {{has been suggested that}} the unusually wide zone of co-seismic deformation {{is a direct result of}} the supershear rupture propagation.|$|E

The San Andreas Fault runs roughly parallel to the northeastern margin of Lake Cahuilla, where it moved at a rate of [...] over the last 45,000-50,000 years. Earthquakes are documented in sediments from Lake Cahuilla, but this southern segment has not ruptured in historical time. Tectonic extension occurs at the points where the fault forms <b>stepovers,</b> although the extensional structures are still relatively immature.|$|R
40|$|The {{geometry}} of Turkish strike-slip faults is reviewed, showing that fault geometry {{plays an important}} role in controlling the location of large earthquake rupture segments along the fault zones. It is found that large earthquake ruptures generally do not propagate past individual <b>stepovers</b> that are wider than 5 km or bends that have angles greater than about 30 degrees. It is suggested that certain geometric patterns are responsible for strain accumulation along portions of the fault zone. It is shown that fault geometry plays a role in the characteristics of earthquake behavior and that aftershocks and swarm activity are often associated with releasing areas...|$|R
25|$|Figo is {{regarded}} as one of the greatest players of his generation, and one of the greatest Portuguese players of all time. At his physical peak, Figo was a quick, elegant, highly skilful player with a dribbling ability that allowed him to frequently take on and beat defenders in one on one situations. He would often employ feints to beat opponents, such as <b>stepovers.</b> Figo was usually deployed as a winger in his early career, where he was capable of providing several assists, due to his ability to provide curling crosses to teammates from the flank, or cut inside, link-up with midfielders, and create goalscoring opportunities. He has made the second most assists in La Liga history behind Lionel Messi.|$|R

40|$|Because most large-magnitude {{earthquakes}} along reverse faults {{have such}} irregular and complicated rupture patterns, reverse-fault segments defined {{on the basis}} of geometry alone may not be very useful for estimating sizes of future seismic sources. Most modern large ruptures of historical earthquakes generated by intracontinental reverse faults have involved geometrically complex rupture patterns. Ruptures across surficial discontinuities and complexities such as <b>stepovers</b> and cross-faults are common. Specifically, segment boundaries defined {{on the basis of}} discontinuities in surficial fault traces, pronounced changes in the geomorphology along strike, or the intersection of active faults commonly have not proven to be major impediments to rupture. Assuming that the seismic rupture will initiate and terminate at adjacent major geometric irregularities will commonly lead to underestimation of magnitudes of future large earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present results}} on {{evolving}} geometrical and material properties of large strike-slip fault zones and associated deformation fields, using 3 -D numerical simulations in a rheologically-layered {{model with a}} seismogenic upper crust governed by a continuum brittle damage framework over a viscoelastic substrate. The damage healing parameters we employ are constrained using results of test models and geophysical observations of healing along active faults. The model simulations exhibit several results {{that are likely to}} have general applicability. The fault zones form initially as complex segmented structures and evolve overall with continuing deformation toward contiguous, simpler structures. Along relatively-straight mature segments, the models produce flower structures with depth consisting of a broad damage zone in the top few kilometers of the crust and highly localized damage at depth. The flower structures form during an early evolutionary stage of the fault system (before a total offset of about 0. 05 to 0. 1 km has accumulated), and persist as continued deformation localizes further along narrow slip zones. The tectonic strain at seismogenic depths is concentrated along the highly damaged cores of the main fault zones, although at shallow depths {{a small portion of the}} strain is accommodated over a broader region. This broader domain corresponds to shallow damage (or compliant) zones which have been identified in several seismic and geodetic studies of active faults. The models produce releasing <b>stepovers</b> between fault zone segments that are locations of ongoing interseismic deformation. Material within the fault <b>stepovers</b> remains damaged during the entire earthquake cycle (with significantly reduced rigidity and shear-wave velocity) to depths of 10 to 15 km. These persistent damage zones should be detectable by geophysical imaging studies and could have important implications for earthquake dynamics and seismic hazard...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} {{knockout}} round Roma were drawn against Lyon, {{who had already}} won 6 consecutive French championships and were the favourites to pass the round; however, after a 0-0 draw at the Stadio Olimpico (with many controversial decisions by English referee Mike Riley, who yellow carded eleven players), Roma won 2-0 in the Stade de Gerland with goals from Francesco Totti and Mancini, the latter of whom scored a sensational goal, performing {{a total of five}} <b>stepovers</b> in front of Lyon's dazed defender Anthony Réveillère.In the quarter-finals Roma faced Manchester United. They won the first leg 2-1 with goals from Rodrigo Taddei and Mirko Vučinić, but, in the second leg, having been undefeated in 10 games in all competitions previously and having the then-best performing defense of the tournament, they suffered an amazing 7-1 defeat at Old Trafford.|$|R

50|$|The {{earthquake}} rupture {{began on}} a relatively small strike-slip fault segment at {{the western end of}} the Kunlun fault in the region of the mountain Buka Daban Feng. The rupture propagated to the east via an extensional <b>stepover</b> before following the main strand of the Kunlun fault. The region of co-seismic deformation (i.e. that occurred during the earthquake) is unusually large, with significant faulting being observed up to 60 km from the main rupture trace. This deformation occurs in two swathes, ca. 20 and 60 km from the main fault trace. Pre-existing lineaments and geomorphological features suggest that this earthquake-triggered displacement occurred on existing faults.|$|E

40|$|The {{core of the}} Tauern {{tectonic window}} (Eastern Alps) {{consists}} of dominant pre-Alpine granitoids (∼ 295 Ma) that were metamorphosed and deformed during the Alpine orogenesis (at ∼ 30 Ma). Ductile deformation at peak conditions (550 - 600 ̊C and 0. 5 - 0. 7 GPa) was followed by cataclastic faulting (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007). Both deformation phases occurred in a fluid-rich environment with formation of veins filled with quartz- calcite-biotite-feldspar and quartz-chlorite-epidote-adularia-calcite, respectively. Faults are typically low displace- ment strike-slip structures (offset < 1 m) organized in en-echelon arrays at different scales with a stepping geometry consistent {{with the sense of}} fault slip (e. g. left-stepping for dextral slip). Fault <b>stepovers</b> include pervasive frac- turing dominated by a set of antithetic faults (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2013). These faults were locally exploited by episyenitic alteration which represented the "last" event of fluid-rock interaction in the Tauern meta- granitoids.

40|$|Novel P- and S- wave seismic {{reflection}} datasets integrated by topographical, geomorphological, stratigraphic data {{provide new}} elements to interpret structure {{and evolution of}} a hazardous sector of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), next to the westernmost segment activated by the 1999 earthquakes. The study area is the Hersek Peninsula, located at the southern margin of Marmara Sea. Multi-component seismic reflection data image the late glacial erosion surface unconformity and overlying sedimentary sequence. The integration with geomorphological data shows two distinct domains: a deltaic system that evolved from south to north with a progressive rotation towards west and a northern sector of the peninsula underlain by an anticline, resulting from tectonic transpression {{which is responsible for}} the uplift and tilting of the northern tip. An 8 ° bend of the NAF in this sector is responsible for transpression and uplifts, as validated also by numerical and analogue simulation. Such structural features match those observed in the evolution of strike-slip fault system, that evolve from large shear zone with fault <b>stepovers,</b> to en-echelon faults and pull-apart basins and finally to localized ruptures. Concentration of stress in single rupture zones can be used as an indicator of increasing seismic hazard...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Probabilistic {{seismic hazard}} {{assessment}} is requiring an increasingly broad compilation of earthquake sources. Fault systems are often divided into char-acteristic ruptures based on geometric {{features such as}} bends or steps, though {{events such as the}} 2002 M 7. 9 Denali, and 2011 M 9. 0 Tohoku-Oki earthquakes raise the possibility that earthquakes can involve subsidiary faults and/or rupture through iden-tified geometric barriers. Here we introduce a method to discriminate among a wide range of possible earthquakes within a large fault system and to quantify the prob-ability of a rupture passing through a bend or step. We note that many of the conditions favoring earthquake rupture propagation can be simulated using a static Coulomb stress change approximation. Such an approach lacks inertial effects inherent in a full dynamic simulation but does capture many of the empirical observations drawn from examining past ruptures, such as continuity of rake and strike, as well as distance across gaps or <b>stepovers.</b> We make calculations for a test region in northern California and find that the method provides a quantitative basis for ranking possible ruptures within localized fault systems...|$|R
