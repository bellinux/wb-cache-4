5|$|The NY9N {{designation}} {{was originally}} created {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to replace New York State Route9W, a route assigned to an alternate routing of US9 from Elizabethtown to Keeseville.

5|$|The {{northern}} sandy {{land of the}} municipality, Aguçadoura, Navais, and Estela is {{the farming}} area of Póvoa de Varzim, supplying the European markets with horticultural goods.

5|$|The {{order to}} build an {{aqueduct}} to carry water from <b>springs</b> <b>in</b> Dingli and Rabat to the capital was issued on 19 October 1596. That year, Grand Master Grand Master Martin Garzez brought in the Jesuit Padre Giacomo to design the watercourse. His design was accepted and work was begun, but construction was suspended soon afterwards due to financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} increased {{again in}} November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur {{began to appear}} in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water <b>springs</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma.|$|E

5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by <b>springs</b> <b>in</b> the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot <b>Springs</b> <b>in</b> Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the <b>springs</b> <b>in</b> his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E

50|$|Mammoth Spring is a large, first {{magnitude}} karst <b>spring</b> {{that arises}} <b>in</b> the Ozark Plateau {{within the state}} of Arkansas.

Mammoth Spring is the seventh-largest natural <b>spring</b> <b>in</b> the world.|$|R

5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The geothermally heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot <b>springs</b> <b>in</b> their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Senator Roberts {{sponsored}} HB08-1157, a {{bill that}} sought to create a state legislative youth advisory council in Colorado. Prior to the 2008 legislative session, Senator Roberts had met {{with a group of}} high school students from Cortez, Durango, and Pagosa <b>Springs</b> <b>in</b> order to gauge the scope of the soon to be legislation as well as the group that would form after the legislation had been passed. The bill was passed in May 2008, creating the Colorado Youth Advisory Council also known as COYAC.|$|E
5|$|Natural <b>springs</b> <b>in</b> the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water {{collected}} is {{routed through}} stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system. Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E
