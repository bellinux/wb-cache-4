5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy {{that he is going to}} let this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the bronze}} medal series, Rytas faced BC Neptūnas, {{who was now}} {{considered}} the favorite due to problems internally in Rytas. Rytas started the series with a 79–60 win in Vilnius, to shut up all critics. After losing in Klaipėda 70–83, Rytas won the third game in Vilnius 71–54, again taking a series lead. The last two games were thrillers - lead by Chris Lofton, Neptūnas tied the series in Klaipėda at 2–2 apiece with a 70–65 win, leading to a decisive Game 5 {{in the next few}} days. Led by Gailius and Baron, former Neptūnas players who hit many clutch baskets in the deciding minutes, Rytas won the game 74–66 and the series 3–2, ending the season with a bit more positive note and avenging the 2016 loss to Neptūnas. The season ended with international scandal for the team, however, as club president Gedvydas Vainauskas made a controversial statement about black players of the team who severely behaved unprofessionally (<b>saying</b> <b>no</b> more than 2 players should play in the team and that more are like a gang), drawing negative attention to the team all over the world.|$|E

However, in a statement from production company Grundy Television, the producers said that they [...] "made every effort to accommodate Minogue", including filming the cameo anywhere in the world, but that their offer was turned down.

The finish, three circuits around the town of Wetteren, was flat; Defilippis, unlike Simpson, was a sprinter and was expected to win. One kilometre from the finish, Simpson launched a sprint; he eased off with 300m to go, tricking Defilippis into thinking he was exhausted. As Defilippis passed, Simpson jumped again to take victory, becoming the first Briton to win a [...] "monument" [...] classic. Defilippis protested that the finishing banner had been blown down, {{and he did not}} know where the finish was; however, the judges noted that the finish line was clearly marked on the road itself.

500|$|McCarthy claimed Rachelle was {{responsible}} for the death. McCarthy's lawyer objected to claims made by Rachelle Bond's defense and stated that his client had no knowledge of Bella's death, <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> sufficient evidence exists to indicate otherwise. [...] They have also claimed that he had moved out of Rachelle Bond's residence before Bella's death. McCarthy claimed he had left after witnessing Rachelle's negative treatment of Bella, which included emotional and physical abuse. His defense also cited that Rachelle's statements could not be confirmed and that she was more likely to have killed her daughter because of her drug history. The claim of Bella being beaten to death was also challenged, as the autopsy did not indicate any signs of injuries consistent with what Rachelle described. Other claims exist that accuse Rachelle Bond of fabricating the story as a way to avoid being charged with murder. It was announced that McCarthy had sent Rachelle a text message that said [...] "don't tell them you have a daughter. We don't want [...] getting involved".|$|E
500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever <b>saying</b> <b>no.</b> I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E
500|$|... "Half of Me" [...] is {{a chamber}} pop and R song which lasts for a {{duration}} of three minutes and twelve seconds.

Students and alumni protested the change, <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> vote was taken on the matter. A bill, sponsored by Senator Wentworth, was passed and on September 1, 2003, the school officially became known as Texas State University–San Marcos.

[...] Nero also commended consistent vocals as a plus, and complimented the eclecticity of the songs, <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> tracks are unlistenable. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said that Songz continued his tradition of inconsistent albums, commenting that the album is best is when it departs from the R. Kelly template. Lewis recommended that the album needed to be trimmed down and included with some from his mixtape Anticipation for what could have been, [...] "the black pop record of the year." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave to the album a dud (...) rating, indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible". Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes called the album often [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] noting how Songz's work on freestyles and work ethic proves how the album could be better. Mangat did overall compliment the album, [...] "While Ready is far from a perfect album, it seems Trey is learning how to inspirit his original works with the charm and inventiveness found in his freestyles and covers." [...] The album earned Songz a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R Album in 2010.|$|E

Bush, who has lost the 2004 election, has returned to Texas which has seceded from the United States, {{along with the rest}} of the southern United States, reforming the Confederate States of America, resulting in a second Civil War. Brian insists that things will still be better in the end, but when they travel five years into the future they find a computer generated post-apocalyptic future caused by nuclear attacks all across the United States which results in the deaths of over 17 million people (including Cesar Millan much to Brian's horror). Admitting that he made a mistake, Brian asks how the situation can be resolved. The two then return to prevent Brian from telling his past self about the attacks. They then return to the present, whereupon Stewie learns that Brian has taken false credit for the Harry Potter series. Seeing that Brian has learned nothing from his warnings, Stewie says they have to repair this by again trying to prevent themselves from telling any future events. This causes hundreds of Stewies and Brians to appear, however, to prevent them from telling the future. This number includes one Brian and Stewie with their Peter who says he [...] "just came for the can", another Brian and Stewie trapped in barber shop twirls, one Brian and Stewie dressed up in their banana outfits, and a Stewie who arrives with his Brian whose throat is slit. Having had enough of this, one Stewie tells all of his and his Brian's numerous future selves to decide whether or not to prevent 9/11, which results in the majority <b>saying</b> <b>no,</b> not to for tell any future events, and to return to their time and stay there. All the Brians and Stewies do it as they are told. From there, Stewie takes Brian back a minute before their past selves arrive and forces them at gunpoint to return to their time. After initial confusion resulting with the Brian that just arrived being shot in the leg, they comply. With that, the altered timeline ceases to exist along with its corresponding Stewie and Brian.|$|E
