50|$|The {{first step}} of {{analyzing}} actual results with the budget is to enter effective figures for the previous year (the forecast {{at the time the}} budget was established). If the effective figures divide too far away from the forecast figure, the budget may be not achievable (e.g. the available cash is too low for fixed investments even). Then the current year figures are added, following the same structure as budget (four <b>stages</b> <b>for</b> income, four <b>stages</b> <b>for</b> expenses, and five <b>stages</b> <b>for</b> cash).|$|R
