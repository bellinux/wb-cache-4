5000|$|In {{contract}} law, a <b>severable</b> <b>contract</b> is {{a contract}} that is actually composed of several separate contracts concluded between the same parties, so that failing (breaching) one part of such a 'severable' contract does not breach the whole contract. Therefore, the other party must still honor the other subparts and cannot cancel the whole agreement. A <b>severable</b> <b>contract</b> generally must contain a [...] "severability clause" [...] that allows certain clauses and aspects of the contract to be [...] "severed" [...] without affecting {{the validity of the}} rest of the contract.|$|E

50|$|The banks {{attempted}} {{to establish that}} the statute is inapplicable to the charges in question. The essence of the argument submitted was that the charges are remuneration for the service provided by the bank (supplying a bank account) and so these particular contractual terms are not <b>severable</b> from the <b>contract</b> as a whole. This argument {{was rejected by the}} High Court.|$|R
