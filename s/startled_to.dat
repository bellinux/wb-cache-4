2500|$|Fritz Efaw, a Chapter Representative of VVAW, stated: [...] "The {{claims that}} the WSI {{hearings}} contained falsified testimony from men who were not veterans is an old one, and it's definitely false. [...] The testimony was startling even {{at the time it}} took place: <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> the general public, <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> the military and the Nixon administration, and <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> those who participated because each of them knew a piece of the story, but the hearings brought a great many of them {{together for the first time}} and provided a venue in which they could be heard for the first time. It's hardly surprising that those on the other side would set out almost immediately to discredit them." ...|$|R

The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them.
