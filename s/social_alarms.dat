The World Health Organization reports that {{injuries}} due to falls are the third most common cause of chronic disability. We propose an automated monitoring system that identifies faces in a given area, collects data such as speed of movement, and triggers an alarm if these data suggest the person has fallen. Our system does not suffer the problems with the existing commercial devices such as <b>social</b> <b>alarms,</b> e. g., a wristwatch with a button that must be activated by the subject and wearable fall detectors comprising accelerometers and tilt sensors...|$|E

So, some assisted technologies are being utilized into the elderly home care, such as wireless health monitoring systems, mobile robotic assistants, <b>social</b> <b>alarms,</b> and fall detection. New assistive devices should be introduced based on the analysis of each person's needs and capabilities of using the devices. In many cases, multiple devices are used at the same time. In addition, the devices are connected to different information systems as part of health care processes, and manufacturers have noticed that offering only assistive devices is insufficient--a service package that includes types of assisted devices and attached services is more lucrative alternative.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{established}} that <b>social</b> <b>alarm</b> signals trigger learning about discrete stimuli {{present at the}} same time. Such learning facilitates, for example, acquisition of responses to novel predators and has the functional advantage that individuals avoid exposing themselves to a potentially risky situation. Avoidance of potential danger might equally apply to learning about risky places, but would require <b>social</b> <b>alarm</b> signals to trigger learning about contextual cues, rather than discrete stimuli. Here, we tested this hypothesis by analysing the behaviour of experimental observer Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis, {{both before and after}} they had watched demonstrator mynahs showing alarm behaviour at a foraging site where observers were accustomed to feeding. To isolate changes specifically attributable to the behaviour of demonstrators, we compared this group's post-training behaviour with that of a control group, which watched social companions foraging at the feeding site. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence that experimental observers became more wary of the feeding site after observational training relative to control observers, suggesting that <b>social</b> <b>alarm</b> signals do not trigger learning about the location in which an alarmed individual is observed. In light of previous work in our laboratory showing that Indian mynahs become more wary in a place in which they have observed a predator attack on a social companion, we suggest that social learning about places may require observation of both <b>social</b> <b>alarm</b> and its cause...|$|R

40|$|Background Technological {{innovations}} {{are strongly}} promoted {{to meet the}} demands posed by increased pressure on home care services and to assist ageing in place in western societies. Although heavily advocated as plug and play solutions, technologies have proven difficult and unpredictable when integrated into home care services. We need greater insight into what happens when technologies are integrated into caring practices. All technologies come with expectations as to their function. This study explores how actors who are involved with the <b>social</b> <b>alarm,</b> which is an established technology innovation, relate to, perceive and articulate these expectations of the technology in everyday living. Methods The article presents results from a two-case study, using a triangulation of qualitative methods in order to gain an in-depth understanding of technology in use in home care services through “thick descriptions”. The study was conducted in Norway and data were analysed using a stepwise deductive-inductive analysis. Results The empirical findings demonstrate that expectations regarding the <b>social</b> <b>alarm,</b> even though it represents a simple and well-established technology, are complex and multidimensional. The notion of script and domestication provided relevant tools for exploring these expectations and for understanding how actors interpret and adapt their practices of using the technology. This enabled a more comprehensive understanding of how technology opens up for different interpretations and puts values in play. Conclusions This article suggests exploring technology in use as scripted in multidimensional script, and offers a frame for doing so. It also reveals how technology scripts and articulation prove important for understanding the complex reality when integrated into home care practices, thus identifying how using the technology leads to the taming and unleashing of both technology and actors. The study offers an increased understanding of how and why technology is unpredictable and works differently in different contexts. Moreover, it stresses the importance of avoiding expectations of plug-and-play in a reality of complex interactions between different actors...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDiscriminating among {{individuals}} {{is a critical}} social behavior in humans and many other animals [1 – 3] and is often required for offspring and mate recognition, territorial or coalitional behaviors, signaler reliability assessment, and social hierarchies [4 – 9]. Being individually discriminated is more difficult in larger groups, and large group size may select for increased individuality–signature information–in social signals, to facilitate discrimination [4, 10 – 14]. Small-scale studies suggest that more social species have greater individuality in their social signals, such as contact calls [4,  12, 13]. However, this relationship has not been evaluated in a broader-scale evolutionary context or in social signals other than contact calls. It is not yet known whether social group size {{may be viewed as}} a general evolutionary driver of individuality. Here we show a strong positive evolutionary link between social group size in sciurid rodents and individuality in their <b>social</b> <b>alarm</b> calls. <b>Social</b> group size explained over 88 % of the variation in vocal individuality in phylogenetic independent contrasts. Species living in larger groups, but not in more complex groups, had more signature information in their calls.

Activities of single males guenons {{did not differ significantly}} from those of the colobus with which they associated. Moreover, both species performed simultaneously the same activities more often than expected by chance. Interspecific grooming occurred on several occasions.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{the vocal}} {{repertoire}} of nonhuman primates is strongly constrained by genetic, {{a growing number}} of studies evidence socially determined flexibility. According to Snowdon et al. [Social Influences on Vocal Development (University Press, Cambridge, 1997), pp. 234 - 248], calls with a higher social function (affiliative or agonistic) would be expected to show more flexibility than lesser social calls. Owren and Rendall [Evol. Anthropol., 10, 58 - 71 (2001) ] nuanced this by defending a structure-function relationship. Calls with particular acoustic properties, which directly influence the listener's affect, would be less individually distinctive than calls involved in an affective conditioning process. These hypotheses were tested in Campbell's monkeys using telemetric recordings. This is the first detailed description of female Campbell's monkeys' vocal repertoire emphasizing a possible relationship between social function and flexibility level. The vocal repertoire displayed an "arborescent" organization (call type, subtype, and variants). The highest number of subtypes and the greatest acoustic variability, within and among individuals, were found in calls associated with the highest affiliative social value. However, calls associated with agonism were the most stereotyped, whereas less <b>social</b> <b>alarm</b> calls were intermediate. This only partially validate the hypothesis of Snowdon et al.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>alarm</b> calls alert {{animals to}} {{potential}} danger and thereby promote group survival. Adult laboratory rats in distress emit 22 -kHz ultrasonic vocalization (USV) calls, {{but the question}} of whether these USV calls directly elicit defensive behavior in conspecifics is unresolved. The present study investigated, in pair-housed male rats, whether and how the conditioned fear-induced 22 -kHz USVs emitted by the 'sender' animal affect the behavior of its partner, the 'receiver' animal, when both are placed together in a novel chamber. The sender rats' conditioned fear responses evoked significant freezing (an overt evidence of fear) in receiver rats that had previously experienced an aversive event but not in naïve receiver rats. Permanent lesions and reversible inactivations of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus effectively blocked the receivers' freeezing response to the senders' conditioned fear responses, and this occurred in absence of lesions/inactivations impeding the receiver animals' ability to freeze and emit 22 -kHz USVs to the aversive event per se. These results [...] that prior experience of fear and intact auditory system are required for receiver rats to respond to their conspecifics' conditioned fear responses [...] indicate that the 22 -kHz USV is the main factor for social transmission of fear and that learning plays {{a crucial role in the}} development of social signaling of danger by USVs...|$|R

It is known that for assessing the levels of electromagnetic field in a particular place or around a given source (thus assessing the potential risk for the population nearby living) should be campaigns to measure or apply the theoretical methods (analytical or numerical). The Municipality of Reggio Calabria in 2006 started a project having as its main purpose the development of a GIS (Geographic Information System), capable of "storing " the results of measurement campaigns and also to apply a theoretical model for developing scenarios of exposure to electromagnetic field.

Major technological advances, represented here as telemedicine and telecare (the information and telecommunication technology (ICT) applications for health care) have opened up a wide array of possibilities for the care sector. However, except for <b>social</b> <b>alarm</b> systems and Internet as a means of acquiring information, there have, to date, been few successful practical initiatives in telemedicine and telecare. Insufficient technical infrastructure and a lack of scientific data on the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine and telecare may be potential obstacles.

The key to a wider implementation of telemedicine and telecare is providing stakeholders (i. e. insurers, health-care professionals, patients and government) with robust data on the practical implications of initiatives. This can be followed by assessment to see if claims that telemedicine and telecare combine a high quality of care with lower costs and a lower human resources input are justifiable.
