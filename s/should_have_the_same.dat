5|$|The Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act, first {{tentative}} {{draft in}} 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, {{was a result}} of work by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the Harrison Act in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose. As a result of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics encouraged state governments to adopt the act. By the middle of the 1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.|$|E

25|$|A royal warrant of 6 November 1663, {{regulated}} {{the use of}} the triple-tailed flag, to be {{used only}} as a state flag and military ensign. According to the same royal warrant, merchant ships were only allowed to fly square-cut city flags in their respective provincial colors. In practice, however, the merchant fleet began using a square-cut civil ensign of the state flag. In a government instruction of ship building of 1730, this civil ensign <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proportions and colors as the state flag, with the notable difference of being square-cut. In 1756, the use of pennants by private ships was prohibited.|$|E

Karthik Bala, CEO of Vicarious Visions felt strongly that the PSP version <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> gameplay as the consoles. [...] "One of our main goals [...] was to really bring the depth and detail of the console game over to portable form on the PSP." [...] Four new exclusive characters were added to the PSP version along with nine new side missions. The control system had to be modified to accommodate the PSP's fewer buttons. Online play is available on the PSP, both in ad-hoc and infrastructure modes. Bala stated that it was a priority for his team. SuperVillain Studios was brought on to the project to focus on the online component of the game. Beenox ported X-Men Legends II to Microsoft Windows.|$|E

He was dux of the school in 1880. At Scotch College McCay first met John Monash, who would be dux the following year, and would later become a close friend. McCay entered Ormond College at the University of Melbourne in 1881, the year that the college first opened, and commenced studying for his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. McCay left the university without completing his degree in 1883 and {{took a job as a}} teacher at Toorak Grammar School. In 1885, he bought Castlemaine Grammar School. The school was co-educational; McCay believed that girls <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> opportunities as boys. Among its students who attended university with McCay's encouragement and support was Sussanah Jane Williams, who later became principal of Janet Clarke Hall at the University of Melbourne, and The Women's College at the University of Sydney.

500|$|In 1913, the Met {{had refused}} a merger {{proposal}} {{made by the}} UERL and it remained stubbornly independent {{under the leadership of}} Robert Selbie. The Railways Act 1921, which became law on 19 August 1921, did not list any of London's underground railways among the companies that were to be grouped, although at the draft stage the Met had been included. When proposals for integration of public transport in London were published in 1930, the Met argued that it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> status as the four main-line railways, and it was incompatible with the UERL because of its freight operations, although the government saw the Met in a similar way to the District as they jointly operated the inner circle. After the London Passenger Transport Bill, aimed primarily at co-ordinating the small independent bus services, was published on 13 March 1931, the Met spent £11,000 opposing it. The bill survived a change in government in 1931 and the Met gave no response to a proposal made by the new administration that it could remain independent if it were to lose its running powers over the circle. The directors turned to negotiating compensation for its shareholders; by then passenger numbers had fallen due to competition from buses and the depression. In 1932, the last full year of operation, a [...] per cent dividend was declared. On 1 July 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), was created as a public corporation and the Met was amalgamated with the other underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators. Met shareholders received £19.7 million in LPTB stock.|$|E
500|$|Hawley's {{first thought}} when [...] "looking at the genre {{is if we}} remove the genre, is there a {{compelling}} show {{you want to watch}} there?" [...] He decided to center the series on the [...] "idea of this epic love story and then putting the genre back into it" [...] and layering elements such as mental illness and special abilities on that foundation Hawley's initial script for Legion was described by Donner as [...] "less fractured", [...] "cohesive [...] much more regular." [...] However, he quickly reconceived the series [...] "and decided more Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Terrence Malick, more whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction." [...] This was in part due to Hawley's desire to depict a [...] "more existential exploration" [...] and a [...] "surreal or dreamlike quality where it's not just about running and kicking." [...] He was inspired by the works of David Lynch to have the series' structure reflect the content of the story. Explaining, Hawley noted that the series' protagonist [...] "doesn't know what's real and what’s not real, [...] the audience <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> experience". Hawley added that [...] "there is this Alice in Wonderland quality to it, of a story within a story." [...] To acclimatize audiences to the different style of the series, taking into consideration that the show was given a late airtime and so [...] "it’s on {{at the end of their}} very long day", Hawley had several of the early episodes begin with a [...] "hypnotic quality ... often [...] a little ethereal voice-over, to give the sense that we are not rooted in a physical time and place." [...] The intent was to put audiences [...] "in the state of mind to watch Legion." ...|$|E
