25|$|Winter {{boots are}} made with depilated soles of bearded <b>seal</b> and <b>leg</b> {{sections}} of haired ringed or spotted seal. Decorative red yarn is worked into the sole seam around the toe and heel. In the past, boots used for dancing were also used as winter boot. The leg section was made from young caibou-leg skins and the soles were made from depilated skin of bearded seal. Today many dances are held indoors, so some women make the soles of their dance boots with lighter-weight materials sucj as ringed seal. Moose-leg skins are used when they are available. Commercially tanned calfskin is used by contemporary seamstresses.|$|R

Earlier Wade {{clinched}} his place in the final in Blackpool with a clinical demolition of Adrian Lewis. Wade hit 70 per cent of his checkouts, including four of over 100, as Lewis failed to build on Thursday's thrilling quarter-final win over Raymond van Barneveld. Eight successive <b>legs</b> <b>sealed</b> it for Wade, who hoped to go one better than last year when he was vanquished by Taylor in the final.|$|R
25|$|While it was {{excellently}} {{adapted to}} swimming and diving, Baptornis {{is thought to}} have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was flush against the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without toppling over. As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to slide on its belly or galumph like an earless <b>seal,</b> Baptorniss lower <b>leg</b> was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it would have found it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Vincent van der Voort {{produced}} a second successive 11-10 win {{to reach the}} final by beating Colin Osborne in the semi-final whilst defending champion Raymond van Barneveld had a more comfortable win 11-4 over Colin Lloyd - meaning he'd beaten his two rivals {{in the top three}} of the world rankings on the same day. In the final, van Barneveld raced to a 4-0 win hitting his double on the first attempt each time before van der Voort managed to get two legs on the scoreboard. Van Barneveld then took the next four legs, then further extended his lead to 13-5. Van der Voort tried to stay with van Barneveld and took three of the next five legs but a double top in the 24th <b>leg</b> <b>sealed</b> a second successive UK Open title for van Barneveld.|$|R
5000|$|His {{successful}} {{first year}} in the PDC earned him Â£19,500 on the Pro Tour Order of Merit which saw him claim the third of 16 spots on offer to non-qualified players for the 2015 World Championship. Van de Pas faced Paul Nicholson in the opening round and made a dream start by throwing a 180 in his first visit {{and went on to}} take the first set without reply. The match would go into a deciding set in which Van de Pas won all three <b>legs,</b> <b>sealing</b> it with a 109 finish. He continued his progress by twice coming from behind against world number eight Dave Chisnall to defeat him 4-2. However, Van de Pas' run came to an end in the third round as Robert Thornton whitewashed him 4-0. After his {{first year in}} the PDC he was ranked world number 42, the second highest of all the new players on tour. During the fifth Players Championship event, Van de Pas threw his first nine-dart finish on the PDC tour and went on to lose in the last 16.|$|R
5000|$|Queen Warrior Albinass - Albinass is who {{coordinates}} the group's attacks, she {{acts as the}} group's {{voice of}} reason and to remind them that they fight for Hadlar. While she is considered the only female of the group she has stated that the group members have no gender and that each is powerful in they own way. She treats every battle as a game of chess going as far as calling those fighting [...] "pieces". She attacks using needles (called Needle Thousand) which are hard to dodge since they cover a very large area; the only flaw is that Albinass cannot or does not move when using it, making her a sitting duck for anyone lucky enough to escape her attack. She normally keeps her arms and <b>legs</b> <b>sealed</b> under her metallic cloak, when she does use them her speed and strength increase dramatically. Additionally with her arms unsealed she uses her magic in a compressed ball (called Thousand Ball) for more precise attacks in place of her normally wide range needle attack. Her loyalty to Hadlar is second to none, {{even to the point}} of being mistaken for loving devotion. Albinass was killed by Maam.|$|R
