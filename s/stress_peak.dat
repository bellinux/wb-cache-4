40|$|The {{anomalous}} <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> {{has been}} examined in Fe- 40 %Al single crystals compressed along a direction near [001]. A sharp <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> is observed at 525 oC with anomalous strengthening found only about 25 oC {{on each side}} of the sharp peak. Deformation by superdislocations at low temperatures is made more difficult near the <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> as the dislocations react to produce short, essentially immobile segments and as edge superdislocations decompose to and dislocations, poorly mobile at such temperatures. There is no evidence of superdislocation pinning by extensive cross-slip, by climb, or by interaction with vacancy loops. At temperatures immediately above the <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> and dislocations move, while at higher temperatures dislocations alone ensure deformation. The flow stress falls because of the thermal activation of glide and because of the limited possibilities for dislocation pinning through intersections and reactions as deformation occurs by dislocations alone. Many processes have been observed in the temperature range encompassing the <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> and deducing the critical mechanisms is difficult. The role of the orientation of the applied stress in determining the relative rate of dislocation interactions and glide is emphasized. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

To {{determine}} whether percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) with a clinically relevant amount of bone cement {{is capable of}} causing <b>stress</b> <b>peaks</b> in adjacent-level vertebrae. Summary of Background Data. It is often suggested that PVP of a primary spinal fracture causes <b>stress</b> <b>peaks</b> in adjacent vertebrae, thereby leading to additional fractures. The in vitro studies that demonstrated this relationship, however, use bigger volumes of bone cement used clinically. Methods. Ten fresh-frozen vertebrae were loaded until failure, while registering force and displacement {{as well as the}} pressure under the lower endplate. After failure, the vertebrae were augmented with clinically relevant amounts of bone cement and then again loaded until failure. The force, displacement, and pressure under the lower endplate were again registered. Results. <b>Stress</b> <b>peaks</b> were not related to the location of the injected bone cement. Both failure load and stiffness were significantly lower after augmentation. Conclusion. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that vertebral augmentation with clinically relevant amounts of bone cement does not lead to <b>stress</b> <b>peaks</b> under the endplate. It is therefore unlikely that PVP, in itself, causes detrimental stresses in the adjacent vertebrae, leading to new vertebral fractures...|$|R

An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} microstructure development and stressstrain behavior during high temperature deformation of aluminum (Al) single crystals was made by using X-ray Laue technique and the electron backscatter pattern (EBSP) technique.

The mean Voronoï polyhedra volume and the disorder inside the polymer increase until the <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> observed below the glass transition. High mobility regions are present before the <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> that may act as nucleation sites for cavitation.

40|$|The {{inner surface}} of {{ferritic}} steel reactor pressure vessels (RPV) is clad with strip welded {{austenitic stainless steel}} primarily to increase the long-term corrosion resistance of the ferritic vessel. The strip welding process used in the cladding operation induces significant residual stresses in the clad layer and in the RPV steel substrate, arising both from the thermal cycle and from the very different thermal and mechanical properties of the austenitic clad layer and the ferritic RPV steel. This work measures residual stresses using the deep hole drilling (DHD) and neutron diffraction (ND) techniques and compares residual stress data obtained by the two methods in a stainless clad coupon of A 533 B Class 2 steel. The results give confidence that both techniques are capable of assessing the trends in residual stresses, and their magnitudes.

The complete period of diastole was studied using indexes of isovolumic relaxation (T-), early filling (LV +dD/dt), and stiffness (myocardial stiffness and chamber stress/diameter ratio). During developing hypertension, increased LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic <b>stress,</b> <b>peak</b> filling rate, myocardial stiffness, and the stress/diameter ratio increased (p< 0. 05); the time constant x was not changed. These changes were associated with preserved baseline levels of coronary blood flow (radioactive microspheres) but an impaired coronary vasodilator response to adenosine.

The anomalous stress rise has been found to show little strain-rate dependence, while the <b>stress</b> <b>peak</b> temperature and the high-temperature range of falling stress {{has been shown to be}} highly strain-rate dependent. There is no clear change of dislocation structure as the yield stress increases, and the stress fall is sometimes associated with 〈 111 〉 superdislocations and other times with 〈 100 〉 dislocations, depending on the strain rate considered. Such 〈 100 〉 dislocations appear to be created as mobile 〈 111 〉 superdislocations of different Burgers vector react together, which happens more readily at higher temperatures and lower strain rates, and this probably affects work hardening behaviour and flow stress levels after yield, but not the yielding process itself.

Methods: The stereo lithography interface format of a 4 -unit (from canine to first molar) fixed dental prosthesis designed by a conventional dental CAD process was converted into a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model.

Therefore, a demand for innovative joining methods arises. Under load a complex stress distribution and <b>stress</b> <b>peaks</b> become apparent in FRP joints. Two different approaches to handle such peaks are investigated. The first approach uses adhesive bonding with an epoxy adhesive. To reduce the emerging <b>stress</b> <b>peaks,</b> an elastomer layer is locally introduced into the laminate {{that is to be}} joined. The second approach is the application of multi-loop carbon roving rosettes to reinforce bolt-loaded open-hole laminates. These multi-loop rovings consist of turns around the hole and free slings in the design area around the hole; they are applied onto the laminate. To experimentally determine the impact of the elastomer as well as the rosette application, quasi-static as well as fatigue tests have been conducted. On this basis, characteristics of the new approaches are compared to reference joints. For local elastomer integration, experiments show that for joints of carbon FRP with aluminium the bearable load cycle number is raised. The rosettes significantly increase local bearing capacity.
