40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the design and}} analysis of a high common-mode input auto-zero comparator {{for use in a}} Hot Swap controller. Comparators are essential building blocks within the current limit detection schemes of Hot Swap controllers. However, the current limit detection scheme places a <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> in the current path, burning static power. Reducing this power consumption while maintaining the overall accuracy of the detector can be done by decreasing the full scale sense voltage across the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor,</b> decreasing the size of the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor,</b> and increasing the overall accuracy of the comparator. This is realized by using an auto-zero comparator designed in Linear Technology's 0. 6 [mu]m BiCMOS process. The overall topology uses the closed loop offset storage with an auxiliary amplifier scheme. The input and auxiliary amplifier are based on the fully differential folded cascode topology with some key changes. The comparator is a typical PMOS comparator with internal hysteresis and additional circuitry added to maintain symmetry for as long as possible. A Widlar bandgap-based circuit provides the necessary internal reference. The comparator was designed and verified using LTspice and Linear Technologys in house models. The resulting design has an absolute accuracy better than +/- 200 [mu]V over temperature, increasing the relative accuracy with the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> value halved from previous designs. Additionally, the comparator can handle inputs from zero to sixty volts and settles to a new offset sample in less than 3 [mu]s. by Anders Wen-Dao Lee. Thesis: M.

40|$|Switching power {{converters}} are an indispensable {{part of every}} battery-operated consumer electronic product, nourishing regulated voltages to various subsystems. In these circuits, sensing the inductor current is not only necessary for protection and control but also is critical {{to be done in}} a lossless and accurate fashion for state-of-the-art advanced control techniques, which are devised to optimize transient response, increase the efficiency over a wide range of loads, eliminate off-chip compensation networks, and integrate the power inductor. However, unavailability of a universal, integrable, lossless, and accurate current-sensing technique impedes the realization of those advanced techniques and limit their applications. Unfortunately, use of a conventional series <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> is not recommended in high-performance, high-power switching regulators where more than 90 % efficiency is required because of their high current levels. A handful of lossless current-sensing techniques are available but their accuracies are significantly lower than the traditional <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> scheme. Among available lossless but not accurate techniques, an off-chip, filter-based method that uses a tuned filter across the inductor to estimate current flow and its accuracy is dependent on the inductance and its equivalent series resistance (ESR) was selected for improvement because of its inherent continuous and low-noise operation. A schemes is proposed to adapt the filter technique for integration by automatically adjusting bandwidth and gain of an on-chip programmable gm-C filter to the off-chip power inductor during the system start-up through measuring the inductance and its ESR with on-chip generated test currents. The IC prototype in AMI s 0. 5 -um CMOS process achieved overall DC and AC gain errors of 8 % and 9 %, respectively, at 0. 8 A DC load and 0. 2 A ripple currents for inductors from 4 uH- 14 uH and ESR from 48 mOhm to 384 mOhm when lossless, state-of-the-art schemes achieve 20 40 % error and only when the nominal specifications of power component (power MOSFET or inductor) are known.

40|$|To {{provide enough}} light output for various {{lighting}} applications, high-power LED nowadays is commonly driven at 350 mA, with this number continuously moving upward. Accompanying this trend comes {{the need for}} power-efficient drivers that can deliver and regulate the LED-current, better yet, provide dimming capability. Existing high-power LED drivers rely on a <b>sensing</b> <b>resistor</b> placed in series to the LED to provide a feedback voltage for LED-current regulation.
