The court also found that the HV left accessible escape routes for civilians. According to the judgement, Serb civilians fleeing their homes, as well as those remaining in UN protected areas, were subject to various forms of harassment by both the HV and Croatian civilians.

The Court stated in its judgment:Having carefully examined the evidence presented before it, and taken note of that presented to the ICTY, the Court considers {{that it has been}} established by fully conclusive evidence that members of the protected group were systematically victims of massive mistreatment, beatings, rape and torture causing serious bodily and mental harm during the conflict and, in particular, in the detention camps. The requirements of the material element, as defined by Article II (b) of the Convention are thus fulfilled. The Court finds, however, on the basis of evidence before it, that it has not been conclusively established that those atrocities, although they too may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, were committed with the <b>specific</b> <b>intent</b> (dolus specialis) to destroy the protected group, in whole or in part, required for a finding that genocide has been perpetrated.|$|E

The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputedCroatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. During and after the offensive, 150,000–200,000 Serbs—or nearly the entire Serb population of the area formerly held by the ARSK—fled {{and a variety of}} crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later tried three Croatian generals charged with war crimes and partaking in a joint criminal enterprise designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia, although all three were ultimately acquitted and the tribunal refuted charges of a criminal enterprise. In 2010, Serbia sued Croatia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that the offensive constituted a genocide. In 2015, the court ruled that it was not genocidal, and it affirmed that the Serb population fled {{as a direct result of}} the offensive, although Croatia did not have the <b>specific</b> <b>intent</b> to displace the country's Serb minority, nor was it found that ethnic cleansing or civilian targeting took place.

Nowadays, every kind of architecture or structure in the city is part of an expanded scenic backdrop suitable to perform spectacular acts expressing either ephemeral or permanent values. Mutating faster than its architecture, the urban scenario becomes the archetype of social and cultural changes. The contemporary city is the favored place for any kind of communication or intensive propagation of ideas and “suggestions”. Its spaces are contended by art and advertising which, through interventions and a constant crossover process, find a confluence in their <b>specific</b> <b>intents.</b> While the artistic act often exploits urban space for social or promotional purposes, trying to give more visibility to the city’s abandoned or deteriorating places, instead advertising exploits the city’s most visible spots for commercial purposes. But all over the years art and advertising have changed, too.

Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could even begin to match, especially since he had no other source of income.

40|$|Diversity, {{intent and}} {{aggregated}} search are three core retrieval concepts that receive significant attention. In search result diversification one typically considers {{the relevance of}} a document in light of other retrieved documents. The goal is to identify the probable "aspects" of an ambiguous query, retrieve documents {{for each of these}} aspects and make the search results more diverse. By doing so, {{in the absence of any}} knowledge of users' context or preferences, the chance that the user will find at least one of these results to be relevant to their underlying information need is increased. Those probable "aspects" of a query may refer to lexical ambiguity (e. g., flash [...] Adobe Flash, flash light, flash gordon, flash airlines, flash mob, [...] .) or to intentional ambiguity (e. g., pizza [...] how to make one, where to buy one, images, nutritional value, background, restaurant, [...] .). The automatic discovery of query intent has become an active research area, with a range of observational and algorithmic studies as outcomes. Understanding the likely intents behind a query can help search engines to automatically route the query to the corresponding vertical search engines so as to obtain particularly relevant results, thus greatly improving user satisfaction. In aggregated search the task is to search and assemble information from a variety of sources and to organize the resulting material within a single interface. The result page of a modern search engine often goes beyond a simple ranked list. Many <b>specific</b> <b>intents</b> are addressed by aggregated search solutions: specially presented documents, often retrieved from specific sources, that stand out from the regular organic search results...|$|R
