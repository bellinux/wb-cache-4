5|$|On August 1, 2017, at the 135th annual Supreme Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson {{announced}} a new uniform of the Fourth Degree to include a blue blazer with the emblem as a patch and on the buttons, a white shirt, a Fourth Degree tie, dark gray <b>slacks</b> <b>and</b> a beret with the emblem. According to some Catholic news sources, the new uniform is considered controversial by some of its members, drawing criticism for its attempt to make its members appear (at first glance) to be military veterans {{as opposed to a}} fraternal religious group.|$|E

25|$|The kitchen area {{reflects}} {{the original design}} concept; it includes separate stations for baking and pastries and was never reduced when the original project was downsized. High quality kitchen appliances were installed so the hotel could compete with fine dining establishments, and the facility was specifically constructed to handle special events and functions. The wood beames {{in the dining room}} are actually hollow, with steel beams going through them for fire safety reasons. Every detail was carefully thought out. The alcove window {{at the end of the}} room perfectly framed Yosemite Falls when the hotel was completed. The dining room is 130 feet long and 51 feet wide, with a 34-foot ceiling supported with rock columns creating a cathedral like atmosphere. While the dress code for the park is usually very casual, the Ahwahnee Dining Room used to require a jacket for men, but it later relaxed that tradition. Now collared shirts for men are allowed and women may wear either a dress or <b>slacks</b> <b>and</b> a blouse.|$|E

25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black <b>slacks,</b> <b>and</b> clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
500|$|The noted New York fashion {{house of}} Mainbocher {{designed}} the uniforms. Their design services were secured, without cost, {{through the efforts}} of Mrs. James V. Forrestal, wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The winter uniform was made from navy blue wool, worn with a white shirt and dark blue tie. [...] The jacket was single breasted and unbelted, with a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a brimmed hat; black gloves; black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. The summer uniform was much the same as the winter uniform, however, it was lighter in weight, made of white material and worn with white shoes. [...] Later, a gray and white striped, seersucker work uniform for summer was added, along with the wearing of <b>slacks</b> <b>and</b> dungarees when appropriate.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{entrepreneurial}} orientation, which emerges {{with the development}} of strategic management, refers to entrepreneurship orientations of businesses. The businesses need resources in other words organizational slack in order to develop their entrepreneurial trends. The organizational slack consists of three slack type. These slack types are available <b>slack,</b> recoverable <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> potential <b>slack.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether organizational slack in the businesses has an effect on entrepreneurial orientation. The relationship between organizational <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurial orientation was investigated through 20 companies that were traded in Borsa Istanbul Corporate Governance Index for 2010 - 2014 period using panel data analysis method. The results of the study indicate the existence of a statistically significant relationship between <b>and</b> the available <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> the recoverable <b>slack</b> with the entrepreneurial orientation in the businesses.

2500|$|When Temple was {{transferred}} by Arrow to Kitchener, Ontario in 1933, {{he became president}} of the local CCF organization. [...] His employer disapproved of Temple's socialist activism and told him to choose between politics and his job. Temple chose politics, putting himself out of work when the Depression was at its worst. Temple borrowed $5,000 from his sister and went to England, where he obtained samples of cashmere sweaters, Dack <b>slacks</b> <b>and</b> Burberry coats, and returned to Canada to find retail outlets. His import business continued until the war, when he enlisted in the RCAF.|$|E

"It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{excellent}} provisions of Nature" [...] he wrote in a chapter for the warmest time of the year [...] "that chub are to be angled for on hot summer afternoons ...

You will see them and you will think they have not seen you". His writing and contacts among anglers saw the president of the Piscatorial Society, Sir Robert Saundby, asking Hargreaves to organise the Society's library. With typical thoroughness the collection was removed to Jack's home, leaving it fully catalogued with not a volume unread. This was when he became sceptical about the opinion of the immortal 17th century author of The Compleat Angler, Izaak Walton, as to the culinary qualities of the chub – a dish Hargreaves described as [...] "eating cotton wool full of pins and needles".|$|E

2500|$|During the post-WWII {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1950s, many parents were able to give their teenage children much higher weekly allowances, signaling {{a shift in the}} buying power and purchasing habits of American teens. During the 1940s bobby soxers had idolized Frank Sinatra, but the buyers of his records were mostly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two. Presley triggered a lot of demand for his records by near-teens and early teens aged ten and up. Along with Presley's [...] "ducktail" [...] haircut, the demand for black <b>slacks</b> <b>and</b> loose, open-necked shirts resulted in new lines of clothing for teenage boys whereas a girl might get a pink portable 45 rpm record player for her bedroom. Meanwhile, American teenagers began buying newly available portable transistor radios and listened to rock 'n' roll on them (helping to propel that fledgling industry from an estimated 100,000 units sold in 1955 to 5,000,000 units by the end of 1958). Teens were asserting more independence and Presley became a national symbol of their parents' consternation.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his capture}} {{outside the city}} of Monterrey, Nuevo León, the drug lord was flown to Mexico City where U.S. federal agent took him on a private plane to Houston, Texas. Wearing <b>slacks</b> <b>and</b> a striped shirt, García Ábrego was {{immediately}} extradited to the United States where he was interviewed by a FBI agent, and confessed to have [...] "ordered people murdered and tortured," [...] bribed top Mexican officials, and smuggled tons of narcotics into the United States. His prosecutors, however, tried García Ábrego as an U.S. citizens because he also had an American birth certificate, although Mexican authorities claimed the certificate was [...] "fraudulent." [...] He also had an official birth certificate that claimed García Ábrego was indeed born in Mexico. According to The Brownsville Herald, García Ábrego went into the courtroom grinning and talking animatedly with his lawyers who helped him translate his words from Spanish into the English language. Hours after the judge told García Ábrego {{that he was going}} to spend the rest of his life in prison, the death penalty was out of the question for the prosecutors.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects of the {{organizational}} <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> acquisition experience on acquisition behavior across varying environmental conditions. Drawing from behavioral theory and the threat-rigidity hypothesis, the paper explores firm acquisition behavior, in terms of type of acquisitions, before and during the recent economic downturn. Design/methodology/approach – Using data on 385 acquisitions in Italy in the period 2007 - 2010, the paper tests hypotheses on how organizational <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> acquisition experience influence the likelihood of cross-border and diversifying acquisitions relative to domestic, non-diversifying acquisitions prior to and during the economic downturn. Findings – Results suggest that the availability of financial resources and acquisition experience both have an important influence on acquisition behavior. Firms with greater <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> acquisition experience were more likely to make diversifying and/or cross-border acquisitions, compared to domestic non diversifying acquisitions, particularly during an economic downturn, than firms with lower levels of <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> acquisition experience. Originality/value – The paper extends behavioral theory and threat-rigidity hypothesis, highlighting their applicability to acquisition behavior across varying economic conditions. <b>Slack</b> resources <b>and</b> acquisition experience appear to be particularly salient during challenging economic times...|$|R
