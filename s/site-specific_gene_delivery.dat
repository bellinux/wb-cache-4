40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Site-specific</b> <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> {{requires}} vectors {{that combine}} {{stability in the}} delivery phase with substantial biological activity within target cells. The use of biological trigger mechanisms provides one promising means to achieve this, and here we report a transfection trigger mechanism based on intracellular reduction. METHODS: Plasmid DNA was condensed with thiolated polyethylenimine (PEI-SH) and the resulting nanoparticles surface-coated using thiol-reactive poly[N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (PHPMA) with 2 -pyridyldisulfanyl or maleimide groups, forming reducible disulphide-linked or stable thioether-linked coatings, respectively. RESULTS: Both sets of polymer-coated complexes had similar size and were stable to a 250 -fold excess of the polyanion poly(aspartic acid) (PAA). Reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT) allowed complete release of DNA from disulphide-linked coated complexes, whereas complexes with thioether-linked coating remained stable. Disulphide-linked complexes showed 40 - 100 -fold higher transfection activity than thioether-linked ones, and activity was selectively further enhanced by boosting intracellular glutathione using glutathione monoethyl ester or decreased using buthionine sulfoximine. The chloroquine- and serum-independent transfection activity of disulphide-linked coated complexes suggests this system may provide a viable trigger mechanism to enable site-specific transfection in complex biological settings. CONCLUSIONS: Linkage of hydrophilic polymer coating to PEI/DNA complexes via reducible disulphide bonds offers a means of fulfilling the contradictory requirements for extracellular stability and intracellular activity...|$|E

The native tropism of Ads must {{be modified to}} achieve disease <b>site-specific</b> <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> by Ad vectors and this {{should be done in}} a programmable way and with technology that can realistically be scaled up. To this end, we applied the technologies of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) and ribosome display to develop a DARPin that binds the knob domain of the Ad fiber protein with low nanomolar affinity (K(D) 1. 35  nM) and fused this protein with a DARPin specific for Her 2, an established cell-surface biomarker of human cancers. The stability of the complex formed by this bispecific targeting adapter and the Ad virion resulted in insufficient gene transfer and was subsequently improved by increasing the valency of adapter-virus binding. In particular, we designed adapters that chelated the knob in a bivalent or trivalent fashion and showed that the efficacy of gene transfer by the adapter-Ad complex increased with the functional affinity of these molecules. This enabled efficient transduction at low stoichiometric adapter-to-fiber ratios. We confirmed the Her 2 specificity of this transduction and its dependence on the Her 2 -binding DARPin component of the adapters. Even the adapter molecules with four fused DARPins could be produced and purified from Escherichia coli at very high levels. In principle, DARPins can be generated against any target and this adapter approach provides a versatile strategy for developing a broad range of disease-specific gene vectors...|$|E

DAC micelles were then chemically linked onto the PAA-BP-modified stents by using N-succinimidyl- 3 -(2 -pyridyldithiol) -propionate (SPDP) as a crosslinker. Rhodamine-labeled DNA {{was used to assess}} the anchoring of DAC micelles, and radioactive-labeled antibody was used to evaluate binding capacity and stability. DAC micelles (encoding green fluorescent protein) were tethered onto the PAA-BP-modified stents, which were assessed in cell culture. The presence of a PAA-BP molecular monolayer on the steel surface was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscope analysis. Results: The anchoring of DAC micelles was generally uniform and devoid of large-scale patches of defects. Isotopic quantification confirmed that the amount of antibody chemically linked on the stents was 17 -fold higher than that of the physical adsorbed control stents and its retention time was also significantly longer. In cell culture, numerous green fluorescent protein-positive cells were found on the PAA-BP modified stents, which demonstrated high localization and efficiency of gene delivery. Conclusion: The DAC micelle-immobilized PAA-BP-modified stents were successful as a gene delivery system. Gene delivery using DAC micelle-tethered stent-based PAA-BP functionalization should be suitable for a wide array of single or multiple therapeutic gene strategies, and could be used on cardiovascular metallic implants for achieving efficient gene therapy.

40|$|The {{clinical}} use of metallic expandable intravascular stents {{has resulted in}} improved therapeutic outcomes for coronary artery disease. However, arterial reobstruction after stenting, in-stent restenosis, remains an important problem. Gene therapy to treat in-stent restenosis by using <b>gene</b> vector <b>delivery</b> from the metallic stent surfaces has never been demonstrated. The present studies investigated the hypothesis that metal–bisphosphonate binding can enable <b>site-specific</b> <b>gene</b> vector <b>delivery</b> from metal surfaces. Polyallylamine bisphosphonate (PAA-BP) was synthesized by using Michael addition methodology. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PAA-BP resulted {{in the formation of}} a monomolecular bisphosphonate layer on metal alloy surfaces (steel, nitinol, and cobalt–chromium), as demonstrated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface-bound PAA-BP enabled adenoviral (Ad) tethering due to covalent thiol-binding of either anti-Ad antibody or a recombinant Ad-receptor protein, D 1. In arterial smooth muscle cell cultures, alloy samples configured with surface-tethered Ad were demonstrated to achieve site-specific transduction with a reporter gene, (GFP). Rat carotid stent angioplasties using metal stents exposed to aqueous PAA-BP and derivatized with anti-knob antibody or D 1 resulted in extensive localized Ad-GFP expression in the arterial wall. In a separate study with a model therapeutic vector, Ad-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) attached to the bisphosphonate-treated metal stent surface via D 1, significant inhibition of restenosis was demonstrated (neointimal/media ratio 1. 68 ± 0. 27 and 3. 4 ± 0. 35; Ad-iNOS vs. control, P < 0. 01).

The nanocarrier is prepared by conjugating gold nanorod (GNR) with multiple disulfide cross-linked short PEIs to harness the advantageous properties of GNR based near infrared (NIR) laser induced photothermal heating and intracellular stimuli-triggered degradability of disulfide cross-linked short PEIs (DSPEI). The DSPEI is further grafted with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) section to afford high carrier stability in cell cultures and a terminal RGD peptide for specific targeting of cancer cells. The nanocarrier is found to effectively condense plasmid DNA to form a highly stable GNR-DSPEI-PEG-RGD/DNA complex with tumor cell-targeting ability that can be efficiently uptaken by cancer cells. Moreover, the loaded genes can be effectively released from the complex triggered by the high intracellular glutathione content and/or by photothermal effect of NIR irradiation at 808 nm. Interestingly, the GNRs-based complex can easily escape from intracellular endo-/lyso-somal compartments and release the gene load into the cytosol upon exposure to NIR irradiation, resulting in significantly improved gene transfection efficiency. Our new gene carrier exhibits high gene transfection efficiency, comparable to or even better than that of high MW PEIs, but with a much lower cytotoxicity. Additionally, neither the GNR-based carrier nor the laser treatment shows any significant evidence of cytotoxicity. This work demonstrates a promising strategy for intracellular stimuli triggered, photothermal controllable <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> system, which can be further applied to many other nanomedicine fields...|$|R

The commercial availability of the native CDs in three different sizes, their axial symmetry and the possibility of position- and face-selective functionalization allow a strict control of the valency and spatial orientation of the recognition motifs (glycotopes) in low, medium, high and hyperbranched glycoclusters, including glycodendrimer-CD hybrids. >Click-type> ligation chemistries, including copper(i) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), thiol-ene coupling or thiourea-forming reactions, have been implemented to warrant full homogeneity of the adducts. The incorporation of different glycotopes to investigate multivalent interactions in heterogeneous environments has also been accomplished. Not surprisingly, multivalent CD conjugates have been, and continue to be, major actors in studies directed at deciphering the structural features ruling carbohydrate recognition events.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a novel {{technique}} of DNA-polymer coating for gene transfer. A proprietary DNA polymer solution {{was used for}} thin-layer coating on a chromic gut suture as a model study. The coated sutures were characterized for physical properties such as coating thickness, mass of the DNA deposited on the suture, surface characteristics as determined by scanning electron microscopy, and in vitro DNA release characteristics under simulated physiologic conditions. The in vivo gene transfection using DNA-coated sutures was demonstrated in rat skeletal muscle and in canine atrial myocardium. A heat-stable human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) plasmid {{was used as a}} marker gene. Incisions of 1 to 1. 5 cm were made in the rat skeletal muscles or the canine atrial myocardium. The sites were closed with either the DNA-coated sutures or control sutures. Two weeks after the surgery, the tissue samples adjacent to the suture lines were retrieved and analyzed for AP activity. The DNA-coated sutures demonstrated a sustained release of the DNA under in vitro conditions, with an ∼ 84 % cumulative DNA release occurring in 26 days. An agarose gel electrophoresis of the DNA samples released from the suture demonstrated two bands, with the lower band corresponding to the input DNA (supercoiled). It seems that there was a partial transformation of the DNA from a supercoiled to an open circular form due to the polymer coating. The tissue sites, which received the DNA-coated sutures, demonstrated a significantly higher AP activity compared with the tissue sites that received control sutures. In the rat studies, the mean AP activity (square root of cpm/ µg protein) was 43. 6 ± 3. 3 vs 20. 6 ± 2. 1 (p = 0. 001) at the control sites. Similarly, in the canine studies, the AP activity was 73. 6 ± 7. 4 Vs 21. 6 ± 1. 4 (p = 0. 0009) at the control sites. Thus, our studies demonstrated a successful gene transfer using our DNA-polymer coating technique. This technique could be useful for coating sutures used in vascular and general surgery, and also for coating medical devices, such as stents, catheters, or orthopedic devices, to achieve a <b>site-specific</b> <b>gene</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> to be {{clinically}} acceptable, {{a number of}} crucial developments {{need to be made}} to existing vectors. Significant advances {{have been made in the}} identification of novel platform vectors that possess modified tropism to the native vector, directing infectivity away from nontarget tissues such as the liver. In order to fully optimize these detargeted platform vectors, they need to be retargeted toward a chosen, defined site, which will be defined according to the disease studied. The successful transition of targeting peptides identified using in vitro screening protocols to an in vivo disease model may be compromized by the complexity of delivery into an intact biological system. To this end, peptides identified using in vivo biopanning may prove to be of greater clinical significance given that they were identified in the disease model of choice and so should translate more successfully to the intact preclinical model.

More than 1 million arterial bypass procedures are performed annually in the United States, where either autologous veins or synthetic grafts are used to replace arteries in the coronary or peripheral circulation.

An overview of the synthesis and preparation of cationic polymers is provided along with their inherent bioactive and intrinsic therapeutic potential. In addition, cationic polymer based biomedical materials are covered.

40|$|Most in vivo gene therapies {{will require}} cell-specific {{targeting}}. Although vector targeting through ligand attachment {{has met with}} success in generating <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> particles {{that are capable of}} specific cellular interactions, little attention has been given to the possible effects of such ligands on subsequent intracellular processing. In this study, we examine the impact of targeting two distinct endocytic routes-the caveolar and clathrin pathways-on polyethylenimine-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> in HeLa cells. Targeting complexes to the caveolar pathway with folic acid and the clathrin pathway with transferrin yields enhanced <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> relative to unmodified polyethylenimine. Colocalization studies with caveolin- 1 and clathrin heavy chain indicate that the ligands successfully deliver their cargo to the intended pathways. However, inhibition of only the caveolar pathway-whether through the use of small molecule drugs or RNA interference-reduces <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> efficiency, suggesting that successful polyethylenimine-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> proceeds via a caveolar pathway in HeLa cells. Transfections in the presence of chloroquine and pH tracking studies suggest that a contributing factor {{to the success of the}} caveolar pathway is avoidance of lysosomes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that uptake mechanism and subsequent endocytic processing are important design parameters for <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> materials...|$|R
40|$|Human kallikrein <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> {{protects against}} gentamycin-induced {{nephrotoxicity}} in rats. The tissue kallikrein-kinin {{system has been}} shown to play important roles in cardiovascular and renal function. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate potential protective effects of kallikrein <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> in gentamycin-induced nephrotoxicity. Rats were injected subcutaneously with gentamycin daily for 10 to 14 days. Adenovirus, Ad. CMV-cHK carrying the human tissue kallikrein gene or Ad. CMV-LacZ carrying the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, were delivered intravenously on the first day of gentamycin administration. The expression of human tissue kallikrein mRNA was identified in the kidney, aorta, heart and liver and immunoreactive human kallikrein levels were measured in the serum and urine of rats receiving kallikrein <b>gene</b> <b>delivery.</b> Adenovirus-mediated kallikrein <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> significantly increased the renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rates, and urine flow while it attenuated renal tubular damage, cellular necrosis, lumenal protein casts and reduced ventricular weight and cardiomyocyte size. Kallikrein <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> caused a decrease in blood urea nitrogen levels and increases in urinary kinin and nitrite/nitrate levels. This study shows that kallikrein <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> exhibits protection against gentamycin-induced nephrotoxicity, and raises the potential for kallikrein gene therapy to treat drug-induced renal diseases...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesUltrasound-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> can be {{amplified by}} {{acoustic}} disruption of microbubble carriers that undergo cavitation. We hypothesized that endothelial targeting of microbubbles bearing cDNA is feasible and, through optimizing {{proximity to the}} vessel wall, increases the efficacy of gene transfection. BackgroundContrast ultrasound-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> is a promising approach for <b>site-specific</b> <b>gene</b> therapy, although there are concerns with the reproducibility of this technique and the safety when using high-power ultrasound. MethodsCationic lipid-shelled decafluorobutane microbubbles bearing a targeting moiety were prepared and compared with nontargeted microbubbles. Microbubble targeting efficiency to endothelial adhesion molecules (P-selectin or intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]- 1) was tested using in vitro flow chamber studies, intravital microscopy of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) –stimulated murine cremaster muscle, and targeted contrast ultrasound imaging of P-selectin in a model of murine limb ischemia. Ultrasound-mediated transfection of luciferase reporter plasmid charge coupled to microbubbles in the post-ischemic hindlimb muscle was assessed by in vivo optical imaging. ResultsCharge coupling of cDNA to the microbubble surface was not influenced {{by the presence of}} targeting ligand, and did not alter the cavitation properties of cationic microbubbles. In flow chamber studies, surface conjugation of cDNA did not affect attachment of targeted microbubbles at microvascular shear stresses (0. 6 and 1. 5 dyne/cm 2). Attachment in vivo was also not affected by cDNA according to intravital microscopy observations of venular adhesion of ICAM- 1 –targeted microbubbles and by ultrasound molecular imaging of P-selectin–targeted microbubbles in the post-ischemic hindlimb in mice. Transfection at the site of high acoustic pressures (1. 0 and 1. 8 MPa) was similar for control and P-selectin–targeted microbubbles but was associated with vascular rupture and hemorrhage. At 0. 6 MPa, there were no adverse bioeffects, and transfection was 5 -fold greater with P-selectin–targeted microbubbles. ConclusionsWe conclude that ultrasound-mediated transfection at safe acoustic pressures can be markedly augmented by endothelial juxtaposition...|$|R
