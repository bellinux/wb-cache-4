5|$|A {{version of}} deep-fried butter {{on a stick}} debuted at the Iowa <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> 2011, which was {{prepared}} using frozen butter that is dipped in a honey- and cinnamon- flavored batter, deep-fried until browned, and then topped with a confectioner's sugar glaze. This concoction on a stick was invented by Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> have also been prepared and served formed as balls. Deep-fried butter has also been served on a stick at the <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Deep-fried {{butter is}} a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is {{coated with a}} batter or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it is}} served worldwide. It has a significant buttery flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY48 {{was assigned to}} a previously unnumbered roadway between downtown Syracuse and Oswego. From Van Buren north to Oswego, NY48 roughly followed its modern alignment; south of Van Buren, NY48 was routed on <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> Boulevard and Geddes Street to terminate at NY5, then routed on Erie Boulevard. The route was realigned slightly within Syracuse between 1938 and 1940 to use portions of Hiawatha Boulevard and West Genesee Street (as well as a new portion of <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> Boulevard) to meet NY5 at the modern intersection of Erie Boulevard and Genesee Street.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture in {{the area}} was spurred by food and fodder {{shortages}} during the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916. Fairbanks businessmen also encouraged the growth of farming. Wickersham provided more funding for the experimental farm, the Tanana Valley Railroad provided free grain seed acquired from an experimental farm in Sweden, and William Fentress Thompson, editor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, wrote frequent editorials {{in favor of more}} farming. Prominent Fairbanks businessmen formed the Alaska Loyal League, a group that encouraged farming. Farmers also created the Tanana Valley <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> in 1924 to demonstrate their agricultural success. It is Alaska's oldest <b>state</b> <b>fair</b> and still operates today. Despite these moves, the agriculture movement in Fairbanks had only limited success. A farmers' bank established in 1917 to provide loans for equipment purchases went out of business two years later, and although the Alaska Railroad allowed for cheaper shipment of tractors and other agricultural equipment, it also permitted a steady supply of food shipments to Fairbanks. In 1929, Alaska farms met only about 10 percent of the state's food demand. By 1931, the University of Alaska had grown {{to the point that the}} experimental farm was annexed by the school.|$|E

Kentucky Kingdom is now open under new operators as of May 24, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Leonard Arrington {{was born}} in Twin Falls, Idaho on July 2, 1917, the third of eleven children.

For his FFA independent project, he raised several hundred Rhode Island Red chickens and won a prize for them at the Idaho <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> in 1934.

In 2007, another proposal, also unsuccessful, was to designate the Tilt-A-Whirl as the state's official amusement ride. It was invented in Faribault in 1926, and debuted at the Minnesota <b>State</b> <b>Fair</b> a year later.|$|E
