As to the number <b>of</b> <b>Stations,</b> however, there is general agreement that in order to emphasise the complementarity between the <b>Stations</b> <b>of</b> the Cross and the <b>Stations</b> <b>of</b> the Resurrection there should be fourteen <b>Stations</b> <b>of</b> the Resurrection, as is traditionally the case with the <b>Stations</b> <b>of</b> the Cross.|$|R
