50|$|In a {{time where}} {{passenger}} rail transport was scrutinized for cost efficiency, the LHB prototypes were relatively expensive vehicles, not least because of their more intricate interior and their lower capacity of 88 seats compared to the n carriages, which provided eight more. Hence, the Bundesbahn did not order a larger series due to the cost, and the prototypes remained the only vehicles built of this type. Instead, the n carriages were built until 1980 in a <b>slighly</b> improved style.|$|E

50|$|Duncan (2002) {{argued that}} Malcolm came to marry Thorfinn's widow because he spent {{some or all}} of the period of MacBeth's reign in Orkney or Caithness at Thorfinn's court. Thorfinn and Malcolm were both {{descendants}} of Malcolm II, daughter's son and daughter's grandson respectively, and both had good reason to be hostile to MacBeth and his Moray kinsmen. Malcolm Canmore became king of Scots c. 1058 and the Orkneyinga Saga records that he and Ingibiorg had a son, Duncan who was later king. There is some circumstantial evidence that Ingibiorg may have backed Malcolm's claim to the kingship which adds further weight to a <b>slighly</b> earlier death date for Thorfinn, although the evidence for her marriage to Malcolm is not entirely convincing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{anatomy of}} a typical {{mammalian}} respiratory system, below the structures normally listed among the [...] "upper airways" [...] (the nasal cavities, the pharynx, and larynx), {{is often described as}} a respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree (figure on the left). Larger airways give rise to branches that are <b>slighly</b> narrower, but more numerous than the [...] "trunk" [...] airway that gives rise to the branches. The human respiratory tree may consist of, on average, 23 such branchings into progressively smaller airways, while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13 such branchings. Proximal divisions (those closest {{to the top of the}} tree, such as the trachea and bronchi) function mainly to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions such as the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli, are specialized for gas exchange.|$|E
50|$|Crack {{initiation}} and propagation accompany fracture. The manner {{by which}} the crack propagates through the material gives great insight into the mode of fracture. In ductile materials (ductile fracture), the crack moves slowly and {{is accompanied by a}} large amount of plastic deformation around the crack tip. The crack will usually not extend unless an increased stress is applied. On the other hand, in dealing with brittle fracture, cracks spread very rapidly with little or no plastic deformation. The cracks that propagate in a brittle material will continue to grow and increase in magnitude once they are initiated. In a part made of a ductile material, the crack may progress to a section of the part where stresses a <b>slighly</b> lower and stop due to the blunting effect of plastic deformations at the crack tip. Another important mannerism of crack propagation {{is the way in which}} the advancing crack travels through the material. A crack that passes through the grains within the material is undergoing transgranular fracture. However, a crack that propagates along the grain boundaries is termed an intergranular fracture.|$|E

5000|$|The name Vega Baja in Spanish means [...] "low plains" [...] Geographically, the North of Puerto Rico {{goes down}} lower or <b>slighly</b> {{higher than the}} level of the Atlantic Ocean and Vega Baja is a coastal town. Other historians {{believed}} that as Vega Baja comes from [...] "La Vega" [...] and Vega is a last name of one of the families that were originally in the foundation of Vega Baja, they took it to name the land.

50|$|The heads share a {{basic pot}} like {{formation}} with subtle {{differences in the}} way they were each shaped. The base formed at the bottom of all the heads was completed like the rim of a pot. Parts of the rim are rounded, however some parts of the base reflects a flat squared shape. While the Basal rings may be incised or moulded the neck rings above these basal rings contain diagonally incised rings that circle the entire neck. The incised pattern constitutes hatch marks that alternate in direction producing a herringbone pattern. While the specimens are similar in manufacture, they also have varying characteristics. Some specimens are better preserved than others, {{as in the case of}} the ears. The ears were all manufactured in the same way. A plate of clay was moulded to the side of the specimen where the ear would be anatomically. The outer edge of the ears were rounded and sloped down and <b>slighly</b> forward. Ear lobes are not presented in any of the specimens however there is a small peg of clay placed above the area where the ear attached to the head. This clay peg is postulated to represent the cartilaginous projection usually found in the a normal human ear. Each head features similar notched ridges made by applying wet strips of clay and incising lines before the clay had dried. These notches vary in position and shape along the face. Other similar features include the eyes, mouth and nose; these characteristics are detailed below.|$|E
5000|$|Bill soon did {{get another}} job at an {{advertising}} agency, but unfortunately this new job required many hours and days away from his family and Selby Flats (although Bert was thrilled when {{they were able to}} afford to buy the Hollywood Hills home formerly occupied by Ray and Charlotte Brandon, and Papa moved out of Selby Flats and in with them.) Bert started relying more on Papa's sage advice and actually started feeling as his daughter as Papa had said for years she was to him.A young, <b>slighly</b> SORASed Michael though was another issue. With Bill spending so much time alone, Michael started feeling as though he was abandoned by his father. He even started telling Bert and Papa that he had no father and that he had died, which greatly hurt and confused the two of them. Bert took Michael to a child psychologist, despite Papa saying he had enough of advice to help, but the psychologist could do nothing but agree with Papa that Michael was headed for many problems down the road, unless Bill spent more time with him, soon. Bill finally on persuasion of Papa and Bert, took Michael on one of his advertising agency trips and in the hotel Bill made a game out of Michael trying to find his father, which Michael did and soon he and Bill bonded and became best of pals and Michael never spoke of his father being dead, again. (Well, at least not until the summer of 1969.) On New Year's Eve 1954, Bert gave birth to her and Bill's second son, named, William Edward or at the time [...] "Billy" [...] for short (later in the 1960s, when he got older, he'd refer to himself as Edward or [...] "Ed" [...] for short.) Coming from Arizona to help out was Bert's recently widowed mother, Elsie Miller, who Michael took an instant disliking too and acted up around, but Michael had every reason to do so, because Elsie herself started to turn the Bauer household upside down! Even Bill and Papa started to dislike her and her demands. And eventually even Bert became fed up with her own mother! Fortunately Elsie was soon taken care of when the new man in her life, that she was actually escaping, Albert Franklin, came for a visit and quickly broke down her defenses and she and Albert soon married and left the Hollywood Hills home for Arizona. For a time, peace reigned in the Bauer household, but not for long, as Michael who was soon to go by the name of Mike was to face SORASing yet, again, and quickly become a teenager by the end of 1957! ...|$|E
