She is the only singer to have achieved the longest-running album as a country female recording act in the Billboard200 history. Swift is now ranked fifth {{on the list of}} solo female artists with the longest-running number-one album in Billboard history, tied with veterans Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Other albums with extended chart runs include Jack Johnson's fifth studio album, <b>Sleep</b> <b>Through</b> the Static, and Metallica's ninth studio album, Death Magnetic; each spent three straight weeks on the chart. Three soundtrack albums topped the chart in 2008: Juno, Mamma Mia! and Twilight.|$|E

The three make camp and <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E
40|$|Using two {{longitudinal}} {{and nationally}} representative datasets, this study employs a cross-cohort analysis to examine age, cohort and period {{effects in the}} prevalence of <b>sleep</b> loss <b>through</b> worry for people {{over the age of}} 50 in the UK. The likelihood of reporting <b>sleep</b> loss <b>through</b> worry is calculated at two time-points for 7785 respondents from the Health and Activity Survey (HALs) and 21, 834 respondents from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), with baseline information on <b>sleep</b> loss <b>through</b> worry. Descriptive statistical methods were applied to determine the prevalence rates in <b>sleep</b> loss <b>through</b> worry at each survey within both datasets. The results of analysis reveal that <b>sleep</b> loss <b>through</b> worry declined with age, but this pattern was tempered by a temporary increase in the early 1990 s. The contemporary economic downturn is suggested as a possible explanation for the significant increase in the prevalence of <b>sleep</b> loss <b>through</b> worry in 1991.

25|$|Habituation – This is {{a process}} in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, {{meaningless}} stimuli while remaining sensitive to others. A good example of this is a person who can <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> loud traffic in a large city, but is awakened promptly due to the sound of an alarm or crying baby.

He is usually on guard duty and never on active missions due to his age, but sometimes proves crucial to missions.

25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> the night (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, {{and that they should}} not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E
25|$|The Crucible is {{the final}} test in recruit training, and {{represents}} the culmination {{of all of the}} skills and knowledge a Marine should possess. Designed in 1996 to emphasize the importance of teamwork in overcoming adversity, the Crucible is a rigorous 54-hour field training exercise demanding the application of everything a recruit has learned until that point in recruit training and includes a total of 48 miles of marching. It simulates typical combat situations with strenuous testing, hardship and the deprivation of food and sleep. Two recruits are given three MREs (a self-contained, individual field ration), each usually taking one, then splitting the third up how ever is agreeable between the two. The recruits are only allowed six hours of <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> the entire 54-hour event. Recruits are broken into squad-sized teams (possibly smaller) and placed under the charge of one drill instructor. West Coast recruits are returned to Edson Range for the Crucible.

25|$|Despite the {{dramatic}} {{ways in which}} they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species, the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful. In Idaho, adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78% of daylight, whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85% of the day. During the peak of summer in Utah, hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9:00 and 11:00 am and 4:00 and 6:00 pm, with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting. When conditions are heavily anticyclonic, there is less soaring during the day. During winter in Scotland, golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion. In the more wooded environments of Norway during autumn and winter, much less aerial activity is reported, since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour-hunting rather than looking for carrion. Golden eagles are believed to <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> much of the night. Although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs, exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual guard down and perch together. The largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter’s night in eastern Idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles.|$|E

500|$|Although {{not much}} is {{revealed}} about Stacy's early life, {{it is said}} in [...] "Acceptance" [...] {{that she is a}} Duke University graduate. Presumably ten years before the events of House, at a [...] "Doctors vs. Lawyers" [...] paintball game, she met Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) with whom she started a romantic relationship. Five years later, during a game of golf, House suffered an infarction in his right leg. He was admitted at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After he was put into a chemically induced coma to <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> the worst of the pain, Stacy, his medical proxy at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, which caused their relationship to end.|$|E
