Many universities and corporations have put efforts in this field. However, there has been lack of emphasis on educational front of this important area. We believe that simulation systems designed for research purposes in the <b>smart</b> grid <b>security</b> should also be incorporated in education. Hence, this paper presents an integrated learning environment for the education of <b>smart</b> grid <b>security.</b> The core components of this environment are smart grid simulator and a learning website. Based on this learning environment, we design course projects and learning materials in teaching, so that students can better grasp the knowledge of <b>smart</b> grid <b>security...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This report {{describes}} {{the state of}} <b>smart</b> grid <b>security</b> in Europe, specifically the Netherlands, and the cyber security of substations in particular. The focus {{of this study is}} the perception of risks and threats in <b>smart</b> grid cyber <b>security</b> and the international standards implemented in smart grids. The created overview is based on semi-structured interviews with 13 experts originating from eight different European countries. These participants are employed at electricity producers, grid operators, technology consultants and technology providers in the utilities sector. Their expertise ranges from information security to electricity grids, specifically <b>smart</b> grid <b>security.</b> Some of them are members of <b>smart</b> grid <b>security</b> related standard committees. The key results of the state of practice are the following: 1. The interconnectivity of the smart grid with multiple stakeholders and European colleagues is indicated as the biggest threat to the <b>security</b> of the <b>smart</b> grid. 2. Another often mentioned threat is awareness. The experts generally indicate that awareness within top management is high.
