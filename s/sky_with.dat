5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> tornadoes, {{and though}} the phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E

5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest bright stars in the <b>sky,</b> <b>with</b> a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the more}} massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, {{the brightest star}} in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is by far}} the {{brightest}} object in the Earth's <b>sky,</b> <b>with</b> an apparent magnitude of −26.74. This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of −1.46. The mean distance of the Sun's center to Earth's center is approximately , though the distance varies as Earth moves from perihelion in January to aphelion in July. At this average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 19 seconds, while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life on Earth by photosynthesis, and drives Earth's climate and weather.|$|E

5|$|The game {{contains}} {{three types}} of clouds: white clouds, which follow the avatar; gray, neutral clouds, which become white when touched; and black clouds, which may be combined with white clouds to cause rain, dissolving both clouds. A large number of white clouds more easily dissolves {{a small number of}} dark clouds than an equal number, and vice versa. White clouds stop following the avatar if the player moves too quickly and they resume following if approached again. Each of the four missions in Cloud has a different objective, including forming patterns in the <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> clouds, eliminating black clouds, and creating rain over each of the islands.|$|E
5|$|While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is {{bitten by}} a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is {{attacked}} by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an anti-aircraft gun was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail marshalling yards, all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled the <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> flak bursts.|$|E
5|$|On March 10 at Lockdown, Kim unsuccessfully {{challenged}} Sky for her Knockouts Championship, {{after being}} assaulted by referee Taryn Terrell, who Kim slapped during the match. Afterwards, Kim attacked Terrell backstage during an interview. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Terrell {{was placed on}} probation due to her actions. Later that night, Kim and Tara were defeated by Mickie James and Velvet Sky in a match officiated by Terrell, after Terrell violated her probation by slapping Kim. On the March 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Terrell was terminated as Knockouts referee by Brooke Hogan, who then immediately signed Terrell to the Knockouts roster, after which Terrell attacked Kim. On the April 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim and Tara defeated Terrell and <b>Sky,</b> <b>with</b> Kim pinning Terrell for the win due to a fast count by special guest referee Joey Ryan. Terrell defeated Kim in singles competition on the April 11 episode of Impact Wrestling. The rivalry between Kim and Terrell culminated in a Last Knockout Standing match on June 2 at Slammiversary XI, which Terrell won.|$|E
5|$|The Skidi {{people of}} Native Americans saw {{the stars of}} Corona Borealis {{representing}} a council of stars whose chief was Polaris. The constellation also symbolised the smokehole over a fireplace, which conveyed their messages to the gods, {{as well as how}} chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance. The Shawnee people saw the stars as the Heavenly Sisters, who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth. Alphecca signifies the youngest and most comely sister, who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a field mouse to get close to her. They married though she later returned to the <b>sky,</b> <b>with</b> her heartbroken husband and son following later. The Mi'kmaq of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as Mskegwǒm, the den of the celestial bear (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris).|$|E

5|$|The first {{philosophical}} cosmologists reacted against, {{or sometimes}} built upon, popular mythical conceptions that had {{existed in the}} Greek world for some time. Some of these popular conceptions can be gleaned from the poetry of Homer and Hesiod. In Homer, the Earth {{was viewed as a}} flat disk afloat on the river of Oceanus and overlooked by a hemispherical <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> sun, moon, and stars. The Sun (Helios) traversed the heavens as a charioteer and sailed around the Earth in a golden bowl at night. Sun, earth, heaven, rivers, and winds could be addressed in prayers and called to witness oaths. Natural fissures were popularly regarded as entrances to the subterranean house of Hades and his predecessors, home of the dead.* K. Algra, The Beginnings of Cosmology, 45 Influences from other cultures always afforded new themes.|$|E
5|$|The {{left-hand}} wing {{depicts the}} Crucifixion. It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling {{about in the}} mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> a view of Jerusalem in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.|$|E
