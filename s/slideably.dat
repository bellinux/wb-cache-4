A first set of blades in the bore engage grooves formed in the leading end of the control wire and {{a second set of}} blades engages the sheath to prevent sheath retraction. A cam displaces the second set of blades away from the sheath for sheath introduction and removal, and toward the sheath to prevent sheath retraction. The tip is removed through the umbilicus and the tool is removed through the abdominal incision when the surgery is completed...|$|E
40|$|A low friction, object guidance, and {{gripping}} finger {{device for}} a robotic end effector on a robotic arm is disclosed, having {{a pair of}} robotic fingers each having a finger shaft <b>slideably</b> located on a gripper housing attached to the end effector. Each of the robotic fingers has a roller housing attached to the finger shaft. The roller housing has a ball bearing mounted centering roller located at the center, {{and a pair of}} ball bearing mounted clamping rollers located {{on either side of the}} centering roller. The object has a recess to engage the centering roller and a number of seating ramps for engaging the clamping rollers. The centering roller acts to position and hold the object symmetrically about the centering roller with respect to the X axis and the clamping rollers act to position and hold the object with respect to the Y and Z axis...|$|E
40|$|A {{coupling}} {{for use in}} {{an apparatus}} for connecting a prosthesis to the bone of a stump of an amputated limb is described which permits a bio-compatible carbon sleeve forming {{a part of the}} prosthesis connector to float so as to prevent disturbing the skin seal around the carbon sleeve. The coupling includes a flexible member interposed between a socket that is inserted within an intermedullary cavity of the bone and the sleeve. A lock pin is carried by the prosthesis and has a stem portion which is adapted to be coaxially disposed and <b>slideably</b> within the tubular female socket for securing the prosthesis to the stump. The skin around the percutaneous carbon sleeve is able to move {{as a result of the}} flexing coupling so as to reduce stresses caused by changes in the stump shape and/or movement between the bone and the flesh portion of the stump...|$|E
