500|$|As {{late as the}} Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists {{could still}} believe in their {{eventual}} victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised {{the independence of the}} American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783.

6000|$|... 'How d'you think Harvey's coming on?' I <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{rubbed the}} brute's gulping neck. The vet had warned {{me of the}} {{possibilities}} of spinal trouble following distemper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} going out, sir," [...] I <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> set a chair for him, [...] "to speak to Mr. Robert Nicholson about a very {{extraordinary}} circumstance--" ...|$|E
