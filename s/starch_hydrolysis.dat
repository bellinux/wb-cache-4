5000|$|Amylases are a {{group of}} {{extracellular}} enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) that catalyze the hydrolysis of starch into maltose. These enzymes are grouped into three classes based on their amino acid sequences, mechanism of reaction, method of catalysis and their structure. [...] The different classes of amylases are α-amylases, β-amylases, and glucoamylases. The α-amylases hydrolyze starch by randomly cleaving the 1,4-a-D-glucosidic linkages between glucose units, β-amylases cleave non-reducing chain ends of components of starch such as amylose, and glucoamylases hydrolyze glucose molecules from the ends of amylose and amylopectin. Amylases are critically important extracellular enzymes and are found in plants, animals and micro-organisms. In humans, amylases are secreted by both the pancreas and salivary glands with both sources of the enzyme required for complete <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Gibberellins are {{involved}} in the natural process of breaking dormancy and other aspects of germination. Before the photosynthetic apparatus develops sufficiently {{in the early stages of}} germination, the stored energy reserves of starch nourish the seedling. Usually in germination, the breakdown of starch to glucose in the endosperm begins shortly after the seed is exposed to water. Gibberellins in the seed embryo are believed to signal <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> through inducing the synthesis of the enzyme α-amylase in the aleurone cells. In the model for gibberellin-induced production of α-amylase, it is demonstrated that gibberellins (denoted by GA) produced in the scutellum diffuse to the aleurone cells, where they stimulate the secretion α-amylase. [...] α-Amylase then hydrolyses starch, which is abundant in many seeds, into glucose that can be used in cellular respiration to produce energy for the seed embryo. Studies of this process have indicated gibberellins cause higher levels of transcription of the gene coding for the α-amylase enzyme, to stimulate the synthesis of α-amylase.|$|E

Cassava starch was the most susceptible to enzyme displaying 20. 9 % of <b>hydrolysis,</b> whereas potato <b>starch</b> was the most resistant with 5. 9 %. The granule average size varied from 10. 8 to 23. 4 &# 956;m for Peruvian carrot and potato starches, respectively. With the use of SEM, a smooth granule surface was observed for all native starches.

40|$|A {{physical}} model of <b>starch</b> structure during <b>hydrolysis</b> is presented. The model states that various crystalline {{states of the}} constituent starch molecules are present {{throughout the course of}} degradation. These crystalline states are associated with the natural state of the strach granule as well as with recrystallized states caused by retrogradation. In order to properly describe enzymatic starch liquefaction, these crystalline states must be accounted for. ^ An appropriate means of determining the macromolecular size and molecular size distribution of <b>starch</b> during <b>hydrolysis,</b> aqueous size exclusion chromatography, is developed. The method employs a strong alkaline mobile phase and porous gel chromatographic supports which are stable to the basic solutions. The separation range of molecular sizes can be extended by coupling size exclusion chromatographic columns in a manner that will maintain linearity in molecular size separation with elution volume. Although separation efficiency is mass transfer limited, efficiency of separation can be increased by controlling eluent flow rate and gel particle packing size and packing size distribution. ^ Although the size exclusion chromatographic system cannot be calibrated directly using well characterized starches due to their non-availability, secondary calibrants can be used for this purpose. Commercially available polyelectrolytes (sodium polystyrene sulfonates) and polysaccharides (dextrans) are appropriate calibrants for aqueous size exclusion chromatography, provided the basic phenomena governing separation are understood. Molecular size in solution, as measured by hydrodynamic volume, controls separation by size exclusion. Excluded volume effects are incorporated into the calculation of the molecular hydrodynamic volume. The electrostatic interactions present in polyelectrolytes are modeled as an excluded volume effect. When the hydrodynamic volume of the two secondary standards is determined using these concepts, a common calibration curve results for moderate to high ionic strength alkaline solutions. Other effects dominate for basic solutions of low ionic strength and for eluents with different co-solutes. ^ Monitoring enzymatic starch depolymerization by aqueous size exclusion chromatography shows that molecular size distribution, reaction extent and reaction rate strongly depends upon the crystalline state of the substrate and the activity of the enzyme. The susceptibility of <b>starch</b> to <b>hydrolysis</b> by (alpha) -amylase is closely related to the crystalline states of the substrate. Starch crystals are present both in the natural granule structure and in retrograded starch; retrogradation lowers reaction extent. Due to thermal deactivation, the highest overall conversion achieved for a given amount of enzyme is obtained at temperatures below the upper limits of the gelatinization range of starch. The initial rate of the reaction is greatest at temperatures above the gelatinization range. The rate and extent of depolymerization is increased by increasing the enzyme concentration within the reactor or by the addition of certain stabilizing agents. ...|$|R

Using lentils {{as an example of a}} legume known to be slowly absorbed in vivo, we examined factors that could potentially modulate the rate of formation of glucose from the starch in lentils in vitro. The slow rate of hydrolysis of lentil starch does not appear to be due to increased viscosity (or the presence of gelling fibers) since 1) the rate of release of free glucose from a dialysis sac into the dialysate was not affected by the presence of lentils, and 2) the rate of hydrolysis of lentil starch was not affected by increasing the shaking rate of the incubation vessel from 0 to 150 oscillations per minute.

HPAEC-ED analyses of the hydrolyzed starch solutions revealed 14 and four major sugar and oligosaccharide components when the hydrolysis was carried for 1 and 8 days, respectively. There was a good linear relationship between glucose content and hydrolysis time (R > 0. 992). Oligosaccharide components (dp ≥ 2) attained highest levels and then decreased with further increase in hydrolysis time. For hydrolyzed Hi-maize starch solution, the highest levels were 35. 9, 12. 4, 8. 3, 7. 6, 2. 8, 2. 3, and 2. 0 mg/ml for glucose (dp 1), maltose (dp 2), maltotriose (dp 3), maltotetraose (dp 4), maltopentaose (dp 5), maltohexaose (dp 6), and maltoheptaose (dp 7), respectively. Similarly, hydrolyzed Hylon VII starch solution contained the highest levels at 31. 8, 12. 7, 7. 2, 5. 6, 4. 3, 2. 7, and 2. 2 mg/ml for glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose, respectively. The critical times (rapid to slow transition) for hydrolysis of Hylon VII and Hi-maize starches should be between 5 and 6 days under the present conditions for preparation of microcrystalline <b>starch.</b> The <b>hydrolysis</b> process also significantly increased amylose content of microcrystalline starch. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Holstein steers (775 lbs) were surgically {{fitted with}} abomasal and ileal cannulae, portal and {{mesenteric}} venous catheters, and an elevated carotid artery. These steers {{were used to}} study starch digestion in the small intestine. Glucose, corn starch, and corn dextrin were infused into the abomasum at various levels and ileal digesta samples were collected. Disappearance of carbohydrate (CHO) in the small intestine was determined using Cr:EDTA as an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected from the portal vein and carotid artery during carbohydrate infusion. Blood flow was determined, and net glucose absorption across the small intestine was calculated. Glucose infusions resulted in higher arterial glucose concentrations and increased net glucose absorption than either starch or dextrin infusions. Increasing infusion rates above 20 g/h for both starch and dextrin {{resulted in no further}} increases in net glucose absorption. Even though the enzymatic processes for <b>starch</b> and dextrin <b>hydrolysis</b> became saturated at a low infusion rate, the amount of starch and dextrin disappearing in the small intestine increased with higher infusion rates. This was accompanied by an increased volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration in the ileal fluid with starch and dextrin infusions, but not when glucose was infused. Data from these experiments support two concepts: (1) microbial fermentation is involved in small-intestinal starch appearance and (2) <b>starch</b> and dextrin <b>hydrolysis</b> in the small intestine of steers is more rate limiting than glucose absorptive capacity...|$|R
