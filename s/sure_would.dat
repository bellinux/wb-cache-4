Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{discovery}} Ritchie resolved {{to continue as}} ordered. He took the precaution of sending Helmuth to the harbour entrance to cover the withdrawal, and gathered together several small boats moored in the harbour. These he secured around his launch, providing added buoyancy in case it received fatal damage in the engagement he was <b>sure</b> <b>would</b> ensue. With preparations complete, one of Ritchie's boats (from the cruiser HMS Fox) moved to the harbour entrance. There it was met with a hail of fire from the shore, where the hidden German crews and town garrison had lain in wait. The Helmuth was also attacked, but despite sustaining severe damage both craft were able to limp to safety, carrying several wounded. From outside the harbour Fox and Goliath responded with a heavy barrage, demolishing several streets in the town, including the Governor's Palace. Ritchie, aboard the only remaining British boat in the harbour, attempted to pick up one of his officers who had earlier gone aboard the German hospital ship SS Tabora to conduct a medical inspection. This effort was unsuccessful, and on leaving the harbour Ritchie's launch came under sustained fire from machine guns, rifles and light artillery.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in Paris, a {{more liberal}} {{government}} under the Vicomte de Martignac took office in January 1828, after an election in which the Bourbon kingdom of France's tiny electorate of 74,000 mainly aristocratic voters turned against the ultra-conservative faction. Eager to court popularity, de Martignac announced in April 1828 that, {{in view of the}} failure of diplomatic efforts, France would despatch an expeditionary force of 13,000 elite troops to expel the Egyptian and Ottoman forces from the Peloponnese. The news was greeted with wild enthusiasm by the Parisian public. As urgent preparations began in France's Mediterranean ports, Ibrahim Pasha told his father that he felt confident he could repel the French. But since the sinking of his expensive modern fleet, Ali had lost all appetite for military confrontation with the Great Powers. Ibrahim's motley force of Egyptian peasants and Albanian mercenaries, he felt <b>sure,</b> <b>would</b> stand no chance against the French professionals, who were largely officered by battle-hardened veterans of Napoleon's army. Ali now engaged in serious negotiations with Codrington, who had been despatched by London to Alexandria to try to forestall the French intervention. In August, Ali agreed terms with Codrington for the withdrawal of his forces from the Peloponnese. Ibrahim initially refused to comply with his father's evacuation orders, but gave way shortly after the French troops landed in Navarino Bay at the end of August, to a jubilant reception by the Greeks. The Egyptians finally left in October 1828, a year after the naval battle. The French proceeded to clear the remaining Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese, which offered only token resistance, by the end of 1828. In the subsequent months, Greek forces regained control of central Greece in a lightning campaign.|$|E

[...] In 2002, Gossard said, [...] "It was 'over-rocked', we were novices in the studio and spent too long recording, doing different takes, and killing the vibe and overdubbing tons of guitar. There's a lot of reverb on the record." [...] In 2006, Vedder said, [...] "I can listen to the early records [...] the first record...it's just the sound of the record.

500|$|The main Klingons {{are portrayed}} by Christopher Plummer as Chang, David Warner as Gorkon, and Rosanna DeSoto as Azetbur. Plummer and Shatner had {{performed}} together in various productions in Montreal. Meyer wrote the role for Plummer, who was initially reluctant to accept it. The role of Gorkon was initially offered to Jack Palance. Warner {{had appeared in}} Meyer's first film, the 1979 science-fiction film Time After Time, and had played a human ambassador in [...] The actor's make-up was made to resemble Abraham Lincoln, as another way of humanizing the otherwise alien Klingon leader.

500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>would</b> work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E
500|$|The album, {{released}} {{on the same}} day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK, but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was <b>sure</b> <b>would</b> leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's Grapefruit books. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of their Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: [...] "They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that... people might buy this." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol [...] "were on the [...] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that." ...|$|E

500|$|In his dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia {{argued that}} the majority's opinion was a [...] "freedom-destroying cocktail." [...] Although he {{recognized}} anonymous tips may sometimes be reliable, he rejected the majority's conclusion that [...] "anonymous 911 reports of traffic violations are reliable {{so long as they}} correctly identify a car and its location." [...] He wrote, [...] "his is not my concept, and I am <b>sure</b> <b>would</b> not be the Framers’, of a people secure from unreasonable searches and seizures." [...] Justice Scalia argued that anonymous tips are inherently unreliable, because anonymous tipsters can [...] "lie with impunity." [...] While he admitted 911 calls are, in fact, easily traceable, Justice Scalia {{argued that the}}re was no evidence the 911 caller knew they could be identified when they placed the call. Additionally, Justice Scalia distinguished the tip in this case from the tip in White, where [...] "the reliability of the tip was established {{by the fact that it}} predicted the target’s behavior in the finest detail — a detail that could be known only by someone familiar with the target’s business." [...] He argued that the general details provided in this case's 911 call were unreliable, because [...] "everyone in the world who saw the car would have that knowledge, and anyone who wanted the car stopped would have to provide that information." [...] Likewise, Justice Scalia argued that there was no evidence that the report of being run off the road was actually true.|$|E
500|$|Ketèlbey was financially {{successful}} {{enough to}} leave Columbia Records in 1926 {{to spend more time}} composing, although he continued to conduct for them on an occasional basis, particularly between 1928 and 1930 when he conducted sixteen of his own works with the company, published as Ketèlbey Conducting his Concert Orchestra. He spent his time undertaking annual conducting tours and composing, and in 1927 he published By the Blue Hawaiian Waters and the suite In a Fairy Realm, while in the following year he wrote another suite, Three Fanciful Etchings. His works continued to sell well, and in the October 1929 issue of the Performing Right Gazette his publisher described him as [...] "Britain's greatest living composer"; when the advertisement was mentioned in The Musical Times, the anonymous writer wrote [...] "we sympathise with Mr Ketèlbey in being thus raised to a pinnacle which he himself, we are <b>sure,</b> <b>would</b> be very far from claiming." [...] Sant writes that Ketèlbey subsequently became Britain's first millionaire composer. In February 1930 he began what became an annual series of concerts at the Kingsway Hall, conducting a new work, The Clock and the Dresden Figures. In a review of the 1933 concert, the critic S.R. Nelson wrote that [...] "as a descriptive writer Ketèlbey really does take some beating.

Instead, the US policy moved to launch on warning, where they would respond to an attack {{as soon as it was}} clear one was in the making. This was not ideal, as it required them to maintain a high alert level that increased the risk of an accidental launch.|$|E
