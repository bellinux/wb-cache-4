25|$|A family story {{initially}} recounts {{an actual}} historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned {{with time and}} re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally {{take the form of}} an anecdote and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales. A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence. Another family tells how the young couple got stuck {{at the top of a}} Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either <b>say</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> jump. Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.|$|E

Jackson said of this: [...] "Instead of being known for my {{basketball}} skills, all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see." [...] She posed nude in an Australian magazine, Black+White, that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its [...] "artistic" [...] approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, [...] "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision.

2500|$|Sackville-West {{loved to}} travel, {{frequently}} going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia, and these trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse with its theme of longing {{for someone who}} is not there was inspired partly by the frequent absences of Sackville-West. Woolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write one of her most famous novels, , featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West's son Nigel Nicolson as [...] "the longest and most charming love-letter in literature." [...] Unusually, Woolf documented the moment of the conception of Orlando: she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: [...] "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other" [...] (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband Leonard Woolf). Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write Orlando, asking in a letter: [...] "But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind...Do you mind, <b>say</b> <b>Yes</b> <b>or</b> No?" [...] Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. [...] Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves to too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. [...] Orlando, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world. After finishing Orlando, Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: [...] "For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of Orlando-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity passim". In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: [...] "Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting...I'm not so sure...I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks".|$|E

5000|$|It {{is often}} said falsely that Welsh has no words at all for yes and no. It has [...] and [...] However, these are used only in {{specialized}} circumstances and are {{but some of the}} many ways in Welsh of <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no. As in Finnish, the main way to state <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. So the answers to [...] "" [...] ("Is Ffred coming?") are either [...] "" [...] ("He is (coming).") or [...] "" [...] ("He is not (coming)"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with [...] As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned yes means in response to a negative question. While a yes response to the question [...] "You dont like strawberries?" [...] is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response [...] has no ambiguity.

40|$|AbstractQuestions {{tend to be}} {{the most}} {{productive}} tool for obtaining information, knowledge, test taking, health-care, justice, criminal investigations, fun, etc. Whenever two people meet, the simplest form of contact might be ‘Hi!’ which is an inbuilt question directed by the addresser to the addressee to tell the latter that s/he means something to him/her. The two basic types of questions in English are information questions ‘also called wh-questions’ and yes/no questions ‘also called polarity questions’. This paper deals with the second type, viz. yes/no questions in English from a pragmatic standpoint. The ultimate goal is {{to find out if the}} syntactically oriented term ‘yes/no questions’ is also pragmatically valuable, or needs to be approached differently. Concerning the term ‘yes/no question’, no such questions start with either <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no. They normally start with an operator ‘main or auxiliary verb’, but are supposed to be answered with either <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no. Hence, starting from the semantic perspective, one might claim that such questions are not specifically yes/no questions, but rather ‘questions that are responded to with <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no’. This implies a lack of precision in the term. This study covers yes/no questions addressed to Barak Obama, President of United States of America, in six randomly selected press conferences, and how he decides to answer in any other way or using any term, but rarely <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no. The study ends with a suggestion of an alternative term to ‘yes/no questions’ in English from a pragmatic perspective...|$|R

40|$|In the Ultimatum Game {{players are}} to {{distribute}} 100 units among themselves {{according to the}} following rules. Player I is the allocator and player II the responder. Player I proposes a division of that sum between the two players. Player II responds by <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no. If the response is yes, the proposed division is implemented. If the response is no, both players get nothing. In game theory, we shall {{find out what the}} two players are to do in this situation by applying solution concepts. The Ultimatum Game being a game in extensive form and of perfect information, the appropriate solution concept is subgame-perfect Nash-equilibrium. Accordingly, player I is to propose a 99 : 1 division; and since one is more than zero, player II is better off accepting this radically unequal distribution of the sum than receiving nothing. This result is so counterintuitive, that the game has been on the agenda of experimental studies for almost twenty years. In their first report on Ultimatum Game experiments Güth, Schmittberger and Schwarze (1982) found that player I would not infrequently propose a fifty:fifty share, and that she in fact would be unwise to demand more than about two thirds of the sum, since then she would stand about half a chance of being refused. The difference from the subgame-perfect prediction is so robust that it led to a large number of papers, which argu...|$|R

40|$|The author {{contrasts}} command-and-control regulation (tight {{control of}} water purification, for example) with more flexible forms, including incentive regulation (such as price cap regulation), potential regulation (providing for closer scrutiny if enough customers complain), and reactive rather than proactive policies (the firm proposing actions, the regulatory <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no). He contrasts informing regulation (for example, requiring that consumers be informed about {{ingredients in a}} product) and enforcing regulation (for example, prohibiting the use of certain chemicals in foods). A country's institutional structure can limit the regulators'potential for commitment, he says [...] especially if regulators are limited {{in their ability to}} deliver rewards or penalties. The scope and function of regulation may also be fairly limited when technological conditions allow competition to discipline producers. Sophisticated buyers with economic power may reduce the need for regulatory control, and rapid technological change can render comprehensive command-and-control regulation ineffective or debilitating. Many forces operate simultaneously, making regulatory design a complex undertaking. Inertia is one such influence. Regulatory policies that once served an important purpose sometimes persist even though they no longer serve that purpose [...] sometimes because they favor a constituency that convinces the regulator to keep the control in place. Subsidies and tariff protection often continue long past the time needed to promote the development of an infant industry, for example. When there is limited public outcry against continuing the special treatment, and the affected firms strongly urge its continuance, the regulator may be convinced to continue special treatment that no longer serves the public interest. Regulation may also be affected by the regulators'personal ambition. When regulators are"captured"by regulated firms [...] diverted from the goal of protecting consumers through the promise of personal rewards for favorable treatment of the firms [...] regulation may not serve society's best interest. Even if regulators are not motivated by self-interest, their ideas of what is best for society may differ from those of other government officials or of society at large. When that happens, which goals are pursued depends largely on the autonomy regulators that are granted and on the balance of power among government bodies. Regulation should be viewed in this large context to be understood fully.
