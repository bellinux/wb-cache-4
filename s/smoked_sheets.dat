We make inferences about the choice of production of Ribbed <b>Smoked</b> <b>Sheets</b> (RSS) for selling.

We find that significant spatial relations exist {{in the production of}} sheet rubber and there are considerable amounts of spillover effects. The overarching issues of product choice are the availability of physical resources and the lack of proper grading system. Our findings reveals the possibility of central processing to overcome resource limitations, significant reductions in extension efforts in promoting good manufacturing practices by taking stock of the ‘neighbourhood’ effect present in farmer choices and the necessity of proper grading and quality management system to win producer trust...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: There is a {{substantial}} amount of literature in favor of models in the ARCH/GARCH family as premier class of models for modeling financial and economic returns are of nonlinear form. However, there are many gaps in nonlinear model diagnosis and none of the nonlinearity tests are in wide acceptance.

40|$|Due {{to higher}} demand of {{petroleum}} and petroleum based synthetic rubbers, {{the price of}} Ribbed <b>Smoked</b> <b>Sheets</b> (RSS) has been gone up. Therefore, local rubber industries, particularly re-treading tyre industry has started replacing RSS grade partly with a cheaper scrap grade of Natural Rubber (NR) in their re-treading tyre compounds, in arbitrary ratios without considering the quality of tyre treads. In the project work, the tyre re-treading compounds based on blends of (RSS) and scrap grade in different proportions are investigated to identify the most suitable blend for obtaining optimum technical properties. The first step of the study reveals that the blend having RSS and scrap rubber in the ratio 80 : 20 is the most suitable economical blend to obtain a balance of technical properties. To get the optimum technical properties of the re-treading tyre compounds, {{the amount of carbon}} black should be added separately into the two types of rubber and prepared in the form of master batches, prior to mixing the two types of rubber together. Different weight. ratios are used for the two portions and correspondingly different compounds are prepared. The second step of the project work reveals that the addition of carbon black-oil mix should be made separately into each grade of rubber (of the chosen formulation from the first step of the project work), preferably 80 % by weight t~ RSS and 20 % by weight to scrap rubber, for optimum quality tyre treads Further increase of carbon black in scrap rubber is observed to give deleterious effects on both, cure and vulcanisate properties, due to non uniform dispersion of carbon black in scrap, possibly due to higher loading of carbon black in scrap rubbe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{global climate}} has been {{changing}} with the elevated CO 2 in the atmosphere; hence identification of effective measures to mitigate or combat {{the adverse effects}} of climate change is at uttermost importance. The goal of Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) for planting 40, 000 ha of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) in the Uva province may partly address this issue sequestering the key greenhouse gas (GHG), CO 2. Farmers in the area usually practice intercropping sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) under immature rubber plants for extra income during the initial period of rubber cultivation. In the process of valuing rubber cultivation in mitigating the climate change effect, information on net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from rubber/sugarcane intercropping system is required. Being scanty of such knowledge, this study was aimed to estimate the carbon footprint in the cultivation of rubber/sugarcane intercropping system in Sri Lanka. GHG emissions from the cultivation of rubber and sugarcane were calculated using the information available in the smallholdings having rubber/sugarcane intercropping in Monaragala district (IL 2). GHG emission resulting from raw rubber processing, i. e. Ribbed <b>Smoked</b> <b>Sheets</b> (RSS) and Crepe Rubber (CR), was assessed using the data available in Kumarawatta Estate, Monaragala and Dartonfield Estate, Agalawatta, respectively. Also, GHG emission resulting from processing refined sugar was gathered from Palwatta Sugar Industries (Ltd), Monaragala. Carbon sequestration capacities of both crops were adopted from previous studies. Guidelines of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used in the estimation of carbon footprint. GHG emission in the process of cultivating rubber for its lifespan (30 years) was 65. 15 CO 2 -eq ton/ha. When sugarcane was cultivated in rubber lands for four year period as a rubber/sugarcane intercropping system, GHG emission increased only by 9. 72 CO 2 -eq ton/ha. Processing of RSS throughout the lifespan was responsible for additional 93. 49 CO 2 -eq ton/ha emission whilst that for processing CR was limited to 50. 14 CO 2 -eq ton/ha. Processing of refined sugar during four year intercropping period was accountable only for 0. 62 CO 2 -eq ton/ha emission. In conclusion, carbon footprint (Net GHG emission) of cultivating rubber/sugarcane intercrop to produce CR and refined sugar was - 1537. 02 CO 2 -eq ton/ha/ 30 yr whilst that for RSS and refined sugar was - 1493. 73 CO 2 -eq ton/ha/ 30 yr. Increase in carbon footprint by intercropping sugarcane was only ca. 0. 5 % over mono cropping rubber. Potential application of this information in developing carbon trading projects is discussed...|$|E

Besides industrial activities in the rubber mills, the agricultural activities in rubber tree plantation are taken into account. The overall emissions from the production of concentrated latex, STR 20, and RSS amount to 0. 54, 0. 70, and 0. 64 ton CO 2 -eq/ton product, respectively. This is for the case that rubber plantations have been located on cultivated lands for more than 60 years, which is current practice in most of Thailand. Emissions are largely associated with energy use and the use of synthetic fertilizers. We also quantify emissions for the case that tropical forests have been converted to rubber plantations relatively recently, which is a recent trend in Thailand. In this case the emissions are much higher because of carbon loss from land conversion: 13, 13, and 21 ton CO 2 -eq/ton product for concentrated latex, STR 20, and RSS, respectively.

As borrachas SMR- 20, GEB- 1 e STR são semelhantes e no composto final isto pôde ser observado. Na análise dinamométrica, o módulo de alongamento à 100 % e tensão de ruptura foram mais altos para o composto com a borracha RSS- 3, porém com menor dispersão em comparação às demais. A Borracha GEB- 1 apresentou um desvio padrão maior entre as várias análises efetuadas. O alongamento à ruptura ficou menor com a borracha RSS- 3. A borracha RSS- 3 conferiu maior viscosidade ao composto final, já esperado uma vez que sua viscosidade e PRI são maiores que as outras três borrachas estudadas. Concluindo que para obtenção dos mesmos valores de viscosidade, que é um parâmetro importante no processamento do composto, o ciclo de confecção deste composto deveria ser alterado, para isto é aconselhado um novo estudo. Para todas as borrachas a densidade apresentou valores semelhantes, com dispersão também uniforme, concluindo que a mistura dos compostos em todos os casos estavam homogêneas e que o ciclo de confecção utilizado foi suficiente para garantir a boa mistura. A partir dos resultados obtidos conclui-se que nos períodos de entre-safra pode-se utilizar outras borrachas em substituição à indisponível, desde que o ciclo de confecção seja alterado e que uma pequena alteração das características do composto final sejam permitidasAbstract: The present {{research}} concerns the characterization and comparison among the main natural rubber used in tires, GEB- 1, STR, SMR- 20 and RSS- 3, utilizing one compound and altering only the rubber. Both characterization and comparison {{were made by}} measuring the mechanical properties (dynamometric, rheometric, burning, viscosity, density and hardness). The studied compound was a typical mixture containing natural rubber, carbon black, plasticizing oil, processing auxiliaries, antioxidants, adhesives, accelerants and vulcanizer, all in a specific pre-established quantity. Prior to initiating {{the process of the}} mixture of the compounds, a characterization of the used rubbers was carried out. In the course of this characterization it was observed that the RSS- 3 rubber (Ribbed <b>Smoked</b> <b>Sheet)</b> differs from the others, mainly due to its viscosity and by the PRI, which are higher. The MST- 20, GEB- 1 and STR rubbers are similar, fact which was observed in the final composition. In the dynamometric analysis, the stretch module at 100 % and load of rupture were higher for the RSS- 3 compound, although with a lower dispersion if compared with the other rubbers. The GEB- 1 rubber presented a standard deviation, the highest among the several analyses that were performed. The stretch to the rupture was lower with the RSS- 3 rubber. The RSS- 3 rubber presented more viscosity to the final composition, which was expected since its viscosity and PRI are higher then the other three studied rubbers. Therefore, in order to obtain the same values of viscosity, which is an important parameter in the compound process, the cycle of confection of this compound must be altered. Such alteration would require a new study. The density presented similar results to all rubbers, also with a uniform dispersion, concluding that the mixture of the compounds in all cases were homogenous and that the cycle utilized was sufficient to guarantee a good mixture. From the obtained results one concludes that during the between-harvest seasons one can use other rubbers as a substitution to the available one, as long as the cycle of confection is modified and that a small alteration of the characteristic of the final composition be allowe...|$|R

50|$|Thailand {{ranks as}} the world's largest rubber {{producer}} and exporter, producing around 4.3 million tonnes per year, while consuming only 519,000 tons. It provides about 40 percent of the world's natural rubber, mostly used in aircraft and automobile tires. But the rubber industry has faced a series of challenges. Alongside drought in 2015-2016, Thailand was hit hard by an oversupply in international rubber markets. Following a record harvest in 2011, Thailand increased rubber acreage by 45 percent. Other top producers in the region followed suit. Concomitantly, China's demand for rubber decreased by 10 percent. China is the world's largest natural rubber consumer, using 4,150,000 tons in 2013. At one point {{the price of the}} world's benchmark <b>smoked</b> rubber <b>sheet</b> dropped as low as US$1.27 per kilogram, or 80 percent below the record high of US$6.40 per kg in February 2011. Similarly, rubber futures in Shanghai have dropped by 22 percent and the export price of Thai rubber by 23 percent. Then, as prices began to rebound, the southern provinces of Thailand, where two-thirds of the Thai rubber plantations are located, were hit by torrential rains and flooding {{at the peak of the}} rubber-tapping season. The Rubber Authority of Thailand forecasts that output will drop 7.6 percent in 2017. Farmers, unable to harvest rubber sap due to high water, are unable to take advantage of the highest rubber prices in four years. Largely due to the flooding, prices for unsmoked USS3 rubber sheets in Nakhon Si Thammarat have increased steadily and reached 84.32 baht (US$2.38) per kilogram in January 2017 and will likely go higher. Rubber growers face an even greater danger: rubber trees die after 20 days when inundated by flood waters.|$|R

It is certainly easier to <b>smoke</b> with the <b>sheet</b> fastened; but I had never before weighed a comfortable pipe of tobacco against an obvious risk, and gravely elected for the comfortable pipe. It is a commonplace, that we cannot answer for ourselves before we have been tried. But it is not so common a reflection, and surely more consoling, that we usually find ourselves a great deal braver and better than we thought. I believe this is every one's experience: but an apprehension that they may belie themselves in the future prevents mankind from trumpeting this cheerful sentiment abroad. I wish sincerely, for it would have saved me much trouble, there had been some one to put me in a good heart about life when I was younger; to tell me how dangers are most portentous on a distant sight; and how the good in a man's spirit will not suffer itself to be overlaid, and rarely or never deserts him in the hour of need.

40|$|According to {{recommendations}} from the Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a common engineering approach to isolation room design {{is to maintain}} the air ventilation rate at a minimum of 12 {{air changes per hour}} (ACH) for mixing and dilution, and a negative pressure in the room to direct airflow inwards, instead of leaking outwards. In collaborations with physicians in the Respiratory Division and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), a series of experiments were carried out to verify the ventilation performance of an All room at the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH). Experiments investigated the effects of ACH, the control of airflow direction, the air tightness of the automatic swing door and the application of positive pressure ventilation procedures, such as high flow rate oxygen masks, jet nebulizers and NPPV. These were extensively tested in two different isolation rooms of the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and PMH, under common clinical circumstances and environmental conditions. Many patients with severe respiratory infection require supportive therapy for respiratory failure. Common interventions involve supplemental oxygen to improve tissue oxygenation. In the worst scenario, mechanical ventilation via non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may be required. Since a large amount of aerosols is generated during these interventions, there is a great risk of spreading infectious aerosols from the respiratory tract of the patient to the surrounding environment. The aerodynamic data in this thesis infonns architects and engineers on how to improve the hospital ward ventilation design so as to avoid aerosol and ventilation leakage. Ultimately, it is hoped that this work {{may play a role in}} preventing devastating nosocomial outbreaks in the future. The design of airborne infection isolation (AII) room has become one of the major research domains following the emergence of the global concern of acute respiratory diseases in this century. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, H 5 N 1 avian influenza, and pandemic influenza H 1 N 1 in 2009. All of which have claimed thousands of lives. Even with the current stringent design and practice guidelines, nosocomial infection of healthcare workers (HCWs) and inpatients continues to occur. This implies that there might be limitations in current isolation ward designs. The experiments implemented a high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS) which could be programmed with different lung breathing conditions and oxygen flow rate settings. The patient exhaled air dispersion distances and airflow patterns were captured in detail with a non-intrusive, laser light <b>sheet,</b> <b>smoke</b> particle scattering technique, designed for this thesis. Thin laser light sheets were generated by a high energy YAG laser with custom cylindrical optics. Smoke concentration in the patient exhaled air and leakage jets was estimated from the intensity of light scattered, which was then expressed as nonnalized particle concentration contours using computer programs developed for this study. The study quantitatively revealed the distinctive patient exhaled airflow patterns and the extent of bioaerosol, generated directly from the patient source with the application of different oxygen delivery interventions for different patient lung conditions and oxygen flow rates. It was found that contamination was more critical during the administration of oxygen therapies, which is common in clinical circumstances. Source control is therefore the most efficient and effective approach to the reduction and even elimination of patient exhaled bioaerosol contaminants. Thus, when working in an isolation room environment, full preventive measure should be taken and it is essential to consider the location of mechanical vents and the patient exhaled airflow patterns. It has also been shown in experiment that applications of bacterial viral filter could be a solution to the problem. Chow, Ka Ming. Advisers: Puay Peng Ho; Jin Yeu Tsou.
