The 118-passenger, [...] vessel, named Rich Passage 1, was built in Bellingham by All American Marine and uses a lightweight composite body and hydrofoil to reduce weight and minimize wake. During the vessel's sea trials near Bellingham in 2010, it lost its hydrofoil during high-speed operation, setting the project back until a new hydrofoil was rebuilt in 2011. Testing in Kitsap County began in October 2011, and a passenger <b>service</b> <b>trial</b> was conducted in summer 2012. Rich Passage 1 performed 35-minute crossings between Bremerton and Seattle, traveling through Rich Passage at [...] {{and the rest of the}} route at [...] to reduce fuel consumption; the vessel reportedly created a wake [...] "half that" [...] from a larger automobile ferry and was found to have successfully operated without damaging beaches and bulkheads during full-speed tests. The passenger service did not attract expected ridership, blamed on the $7 fare without monthly passes, leading Kitsap Transit to consider a sales tax to subsidize service.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from some}} 18 months in 2001 and 2002, when {{the line was}} cut by damage to bridges, the railway was in service until 2005 when the company {{operating}} it filed for bankruptcy. Between 2010 and 2012, the contractor Comsa, hired by the Arica port authority EPA, rehabilitated the infrastructure and removed soil contaminated by lead and other mineral residues from land surrounding the railway in Arica, especially in the Chinchorro freight yard. Work undertaken by Comsa has included laying 67 km of rail on 73 000 timber sleepers to enable freight trains to operate at up to 40 km/h. The {{total cost of the}} rehabilitation was estimated at $US 45m. By the Railway's centenary, 13 May 2013, the line was in operational order {{all the way up to}} the frontier with Bolivia; the Bolivian section had remained in a serviceable condition, being used by a local rail-bus <b>service.</b> <b>Trial</b> trains have been run over the line.|$|E

5000|$|The National Institute for Trial Advocacy (referred to as [...] "NITA") is a not {{for profit}} {{organization}} that was initially formed in 1969 {{in an effort}} to provide lawyers with better trial skills training, and was spurred on by criticisms within the judicial system of the apparent lack of trial preparation occurring within law schools. This initial group of law professors and lawyers worked with the intention of addressing this problem and {{came to the conclusion that}} learning-by-doing trial training was the best approach. This group spent two more years improving their trial material and in 1972 NITA's inaugural National Session was held at the University of Colorado in Boulder. This program brings together participants from all across the country who are taught through a learning by doing approach how to better represent their clients in the courtroom. The national session has been held every year since 1972 and NITA has since expanded its scope, holding public <b>service</b> <b>trial</b> training sessions in a variety of specialties across the country as well as other skills courses including deposition and courtroom technology skills.|$|E

50|$|In {{the initial}} <b>service</b> <b>trial,</b> {{broadband}} coaxial cable lines initially linked Berlin to Leipzig. After {{a period of}} experimentation the system entered public use and was soon extended another 160 km (100 miles) from Berlin to Hamburg, and then in July 1938 from Leipzig to Nuremberg and Munich. The system eventually operated with more than 1,000 km (620 miles) of coaxial cable transmission lines. The videophones were integrated within large public videophone booths, with two booths provided per city. Calls between Berlin and Leipzig cost RM3½, approximately one sixth of a British pound sterling, or about one-fifteenth of the average weekly wage. The video telephone equipment used in Berlin was designed and built by the German Post Office Laboratory. Videophone equipment used in other German cities were developed by Fernseh A.G., partly owned by Baird Television Ltd. of the U.K., inventors of the world's first functional television. During its life the German system underwent further development and testing, resulting in higher resolutions and a conversion to an all-electronic camera tube transmission system to replace its mechanical Nipkow scanning disc. While the system's image quality was primitive by modern standards, it was deemed impressive in contemporary reports of the era, with users able to clearly discern the hands on wristwatches.|$|E
50|$|On 23 January 1946, the XR-8 was {{accepted}} for <b>service</b> <b>trials</b> with its original, non-rigid rotors in place.
