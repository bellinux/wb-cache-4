40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for separating monaural au-dio {{signals by}} non-negative tensor factorisation of modulation spectrograms. The modulation spectrogram {{is able to}} repre-sent redundant patterns across frequency with similar features, and the tensor factorisation is able to isolate these patterns in an unsupervised way. The method overcomes the limitation of conventional non-negative matrix factorisation algorithms to utilise the redundancy of sounds in frequency. In the proposed method, separated sounds are synthesised by filtering the mix-ture signal with a Wiener-like filter generated from the esti-mated tensor factors. The proposed method was compared to conventional algorithms in unsupervised separation of mixtures of speech and music.

The network is trained with the low-level of features (i.e., MV and ILD/IPD) extracted from a training dataset of observed speech signals. In the separation stage, the trained network is used to estimate the orientations (i.e., directions of arrivals) of the target and interferers which is further exploited to derive the source occupation probability (and thereby the mask) at each T-F unit of the mixture. Our experimental results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the GMM/EM-based baseline method [7] in terms of both <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>ratio</b> (SDR) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ).|$|E

40|$|A judicious {{combination}} of dictionary learning methods, block sparsity and source recovery algorithm {{are used in}} a hierarchical manner to identify the noises and the speakers from a noisy conversation between two people. Conversations are simulated using speech from two speakers, each with a different background noise, with varied SNR values, down to - 10 dB. Ten each of randomly chosen male and female speakers from the TIMIT database and all the noise sources from the NOISEX database are used for the simulations. For speaker identification, the relative value of weights recovered is used to select an appropriately small subset of the test data, assumed to contain speech. This novel choice of using varied amounts of test data results in an improvement in the speaker recognition rate of around 15 % at SNR of 0 dB. Speech and noise are separated using dictionaries of the estimated speaker and noise, and an improvement of <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>ratios</b> of up <b>to</b> 10 % is achieved at SNR of 0 dB. K-medoid and cosine similarity based dictionary learning methods lead to better recognition of the background noise and the speaker. Experiments are also conducted on cases, where either the background noise or the speaker is outside the set of trained dictionaries. In such cases, adaptive dictionary learning leads to performance comparable to the other case of complete dictionaries. Comment: 12 page...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{existing}} links between two approaches of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), projection pursuit and Infomax/maximum likelihood estimation, and the Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), mainly {{used in the}} Generalized Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA), to tackle the Blind Source Separation (BSS) of instantaneous mixtures problem. If ICA methods suit well for overdetermined and noiseless mixtures, SCA (via GMCA) has demonstrated its robustness to noise. Using the "synthesis" point of view to reformulate ICA methods as an optimization problem, we propose a new optimization framework, which encompasses both approaches. We show that the algorithms developed to minimize the proposed functional built on SCA, but imposing a numerical decorrelation constraint on the sources, aims to improve the Signal to Inference Ratio (SIR) of the estimated sources, without degrading the <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>Distortion</b> <b>Ratio</b> (SDR) ...|$|E
40|$|Singing voice {{separation}} {{based on}} deep learning {{relies on the}} usage of time-frequency masking. In many cases the masking process is not a learnable function or is not encapsulated into the deep learning optimization. Consequently, most of the existing methods rely on a post processing step using the generalized Wiener filtering. This work proposes a method that learns and optimizes (during training) a source-dependent mask and does not need the aforementioned post processing step. We introduce a recurrent inference algorithm, a sparse transformation step to improve the mask generation process, and a learned denoising filter. Obtained results show an increase of 0. 49 dB for the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>ratio</b> and 0. 30 dB for the signal to interference ratio, compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches for monaural singing voice separation...|$|E

These two components are weighted, en-abling the gate to be controlled by a single parame-ter. It is shown that the improvement in the SDR can be obtained when the two components of the SDR are approximated, enabling the optimal settings to be cal-culated from the noisy signal and a single kick drum hit.

40|$|Binaural {{features}} of interaural level difference and interaural phase difference {{have proved to}} be very effective in training deep neural networks (DNNs), to generate timefrequency masks for target speech extraction in speech-speech mixtures. However, effectiveness of binaural features is reduced in more common speech-noise scenarios, since the noise may over-shadow the speech in adverse conditions. In addition, the reverberation also decreases the sparsity of binaural features and therefore adds difficulties to the separation task. To address the above limitations, we highlight the spectral difference between speech and noise spectra and incorporate the log-power spectra features to extend the DNN input. Tested on two different reverberant rooms at different signal to noise ratios (SNR), our proposed method shows advantages over the baseline method using only binaural features in terms of <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>ratio</b> (SDR) and Short-Time Perceptual Intelligibility (STOI) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the past}} years many {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} that target the separation of polyphonic music material into independent source signals. Due to lack {{of information on the}} original signals it is currently practically impossible to extract the original waveforms from their mixture. Thus all of the approaches target the reconstruction of signals that are at least in some way close to the original. For that purpose common features of harmonic sounds are usually exploited. This paper proposes a system that uses frequency-domain instrument models as prior knowledge for reinserting information needed for the separation. The system provides over 18 dB <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>Distortion</b> <b>Ratio</b> for two simultaneous notes, which slowly degrades as the level of polyphony increases.

40|$|In real environments, the {{presence}} of room reverberations seriously degrades the quality in sound capture. To solve this problem, multiple beamforming [1], which forms directivity {{not only in the}} direction of the desired sound source but also in the direction of reflection images, was proposed by J.

However, it is difficult to apply this method practically in real environments, since this application requires that the distortion of reflection sound signals by wall impedances be equalized. This paper proposes a new multiple beamforming algorithm that equalizes the amplitude-spectrum and phase-spectrum of reflection signals by a cross-spectrum [2] method. Evaluation experiments are conducted in real environment. In a SDR (<b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>Distortion</b> <b>Ratio)</b> evaluation, the proposed multiple beamformer achieves signal distortion reduction more effectively than the conventional single beamformer and the conventional multiple beamformer without equalization.

40|$|Abstract—Suppression of late reverberations is a {{challenging}} problem in reverberant speech enhancement. A promising recent {{approach to this}} problem is to apply a spectral subtraction mask to the spectrum of the reverberant speech, where the spectral variance of the late reverberations was estimated based on a frequency independent statistical model of the decay rate of the late reverberations. In this paper, we develop a dereverberation algorithm by following a similar process. Instead of using the fre-quency independent model, however, we estimate the frequency dependent reverberation time and decay rate, and use them for the estimation of the spectral subtraction mask. In order to remove the processing artifacts, the mask is further filtered by a smoothing function, and then applied to reduce the late reverberations from the reverberant speech. The performance of the proposed algorithm, measured by the segmental signal to reverberation ratio (SegSRR) and the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>ratio</b> (SDR), is evaluated for both simulated and real data.
