5|$|The Darkside, which derives {{its name}} {{from a lack of}} street lights when {{students}} first began to move to the area, is bounded by Stewart Street to the south, Brown Street to the west, Woodland Cemetery to the east and Wyoming Street to the north. Traditionally, the Darkside has served as housing for juniors. This is not due to any university policy, but rather the preference of <b>seniors,</b> <b>who</b> select houses first in the student housing lottery due to their larger number of credit hours.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies' loss to Kansas {{lowered its}} bowl winning {{percentage}} since 1993 to 40percent. In the 15bowl games played between the 1993 Independence Bowl and the 2008 Orange Bowl, the Hokies amassed {{a record of}} sixwins and ninelosses. Despite the loss to the Jayhawks {{and the loss of}} several graduating players, Virginia Tech was a popular pick to repeat as ACC champions heading into the off-season. The <b>seniors</b> <b>who</b> graduated following the Orange Bowl game were the winningest team in Virginia Tech history, becoming one of just three teams in Division I to win at least 10 games each of the previous four years. Junior Sean Glennon's second consecutive failure to win a bowl game, however, re-opened the question of whether he or Tyrod Taylor would be the Hokies' starter at quarterback in 2008.|$|E

25|$|After college, Turner {{was invited}} to a free agent camp in Utah—a camp where college <b>seniors</b> <b>who</b> are under the radar go and try to {{continue}} their careers.

Later that summer, Turner {{received a call from}} Chester Jets coach Robbie Peers. He told Turner that he would sign him if his first choice, former NBA player Loren Meyer, fell through. Meyer did sign with them, and so the search continued. After a 15-game stint in Puerto Rico with Capitanes de Arecibo, where he averaged 10.7 points and 5.3 rebounds, Turner received a call from Irishman Frankie O'Loane on September 10, 2000.
