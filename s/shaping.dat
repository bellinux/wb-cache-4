A <b>shape</b> model is divided in two parts: fixed <b>shape</b> and active <b>shape.</b> The fixed <b>shape</b> is a user-predefined simple <b>shape</b> {{with only a few}} landmarks which can be easily and accurately located by machine or human. The active one is composed of many landmarks with complex <b>shape</b> contour. When searching an active <b>shape,</b> pose parameter is calculated by the fixed <b>shape.</b> Bayesian inference is introduced to make the whole <b>shape</b> more robust to local noise generated by the active <b>shape,</b> which leads to a compensation factor and a smooth factor for a coarse-to-fine <b>shape</b> search.

40|$|This study evaluates {{methods used}} for granule <b>shape</b> characterization. The {{aim is to}} {{identify}} an optimal combination of <b>shape</b> factors to measure granule <b>shape</b> and roughness. Granules were prepared from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), alpha-lactose, microfine cellulose (MFC), and dextrin, using a small-scale high-shear mixer. Granule <b>shapes</b> were analysed by measuring weight, by microscopic analysis, and by sedimentation analysis in olive oil. A comparison was made among (1) the aspect ratio, (2) the circularity, (3) a new projection <b>shape</b> factor defined in this paper, (4) the <b>shape</b> factor e(R), (5) the radial <b>shape</b> factor, (6) One-Plane-Critical-Stability (OPCS), (7) the Stokes' <b>shape</b> factor, and (8) a new mass <b>shape</b> factor defined in this paper. Besides {{the evaluation of the}} <b>shape</b> factors, (9) a roughness factor R is defined. When the <b>shape</b> of granules is evaluated, there can be effects of both <b>shape</b> and surface roughness. The scale of scrutiny of the measurement determines whether or not a <b>shape</b> factor is affected by surface roughness. We chose to call a protrusion smaller than 60 mum a roughness, and a larger protrusion a <b>shape</b> effect. The best evaluation of granule <b>shape</b> is obtained when <b>shape</b> and roughness are described by different parameters. The aspect ratio, the mass <b>shape</b> factor, OPCS, e(R) and the radial <b>shape</b> factor could not significantly discriminate between some of the different <b>shapes.</b> The other three <b>shape</b> factors give distinct differences in value for all different <b>shapes</b> used in this study. Of these factors, Stokes' <b>shape</b> factor was rejected because of the high viscosity of the oil needed, which results in a significant temperature dependency. Circularity and the new projection <b>shape</b> factor both work very well for our granules. The combination of the roughness factor with the new projection <b>shape</b> factor will provide a good description of granule <b>shape</b> and roughness.

We develop a novel formulation for the notion of <b>shape</b> differences, aimed at providing detailed information about the location and na-ture of the differences or distortions between the two <b>shapes</b> being compared.

The approach is intrin-sic and is based on a linear algebraic framework, allowing the use of many common linear algebra tools (e. g, SVD, PCA) for study-ing a matrix representation of the operator.
