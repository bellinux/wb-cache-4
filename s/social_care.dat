Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General <b>Social</b> <b>Care</b> Council and the <b>Social</b> <b>Care</b> Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the United States {{inpatient}} generalist {{social workers}} in discharge planning roles work alongside specialist palliative <b>care</b> <b>social</b> workers to <b>care</b> for patients. As a result two social workers may concurrently {{be involved in the}} same patient’s care. Previous studies identifying components of effective collaboration, which impacts patient outcomes, care efficiency, professional job satisfaction, and healthcare costs, were conducted with nurses and physicians. The components of effective collaboration for generalist social workers’ interactions with specialist palliative <b>care</b> <b>social</b> workers are unknown. Aim: To explore inpatient generalist social workers’ views of what facilitates or hinders collaboration with specialist palliative <b>care</b> <b>social</b> workers. Methods: Using a grounded theory approach, qualitative interviews with inpatient generalist social workers (n= 14) were systematically analysed to develop a theoretical model of generalist social workers’ collaboration with specialist palliative <b>care</b> <b>social</b> workers. Results: The emerging theoretical model of collaboration consists of: 1) trust, which is comprised of a) ability, b) benevolence, and c) integrity, 2) information sharing, and 3) role negotiation. Effective collaboration occurs when all pieces of the model are present. Collaboration is facilitated when generalists’ perceptions of trust are high, pertinent information is communicated in a time-sensitive manner, and a flexible approach to roles is taken. Conclusion: Trust is increased when generalist social workers’ perceive the specialist palliative <b>care</b> <b>social</b> worker has the necessary skills to identify and address patient needs, manage interactions with the multidisciplinary healthcare team, support the generalists’ roles, and adheres to social work professional values. Opportunities for formal and informal communication boost collaboration, along with regular access to the specialist palliative <b>care</b> <b>social</b> worker. At the organisational level effective collaboration is hindered by a lack of clarity regarding roles. Research about specialist palliative <b>care</b> <b>social</b> workers’ perceptions of what facilitates or hinders collaboration with generalist social workers is needed...|$|R

5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area's health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> capacity have moved into the area. Demographic changes, Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.|$|E
