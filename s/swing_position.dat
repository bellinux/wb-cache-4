30|$|Next to {{improving}} passive dorsiflexion with flexed knees, this ‘positional’ bracing also prevented deterioration in passive dorsiflexion with the knee in extension in 76  % {{of the children}} (13 of 17). The average dorsiflexion gain of 4 ° with extended knees marginally failed to reach significance. In the past, below-knee serial casts have {{also been shown to}} only increase passive dorsiflexion with flexed knees [8]. Based on the progressive loss of passive dorsiflexion during CP childhood [6], these results appear to be a beneficial outcome for children with CP! More importantly, from a functional perspective, the children walked faster and their ankle kinematics improved primarily in <b>swing.</b> <b>Positioning</b> the foot better for landing can be vital to avoid tripping and to prevent mid-foot break deformities.

40|$|The STOKES Monte Carlo {{radiative}} transfer code {{has been extended}} to model the velocity dependence of the polarization of emission lines. We use STOKES to present improved modelling of the velocity-dependent polarization of broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei. We confirm that off-axis continuum emission can produce observed velocity dependencies of both the degree and position angle of polarization. The characteristic features are {{a dip in the}} percentage polarization and an S-shaped <b>swing</b> in the <b>position</b> angle of the polarization across the line profile. Some differences between our STOKES results and previous modelling of polarization due to off-axis emission are noted. In particular we find that the presence of an offset between the maximum in line flux and the dip in the percentage of polarization or the central velocity of the <b>swing</b> in <b>position</b> angle does not necessarily imply that the scattering material is moving radially. Our model is an alternative scenario to the equatorial scattering disk described by Smith et al. (2005). We discuss strategies to discriminate between both interpretations and to constrain their relative contributions to the observed velocity-resolved line and polarization.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{golf swing}} {{involves}} a complex sequence of body movements which adjust {{according to the}} demands of a given shot. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine common characteristics and essential elements of the golf swing under various conditions. The swing patterns of thirteen elite professional golfers were analyzed using three-dimensional kinematics to determine the essential elements of optimal movement patterns for distance (DS; 1 W), accuracy (AS; 8 I), and intermediate (IS; 3 I) shots, and a general model of golf swings. Two high-speed video cameras (250 frames per second) recorded frontal and sagittal views of the golf swings. Three-dimensional data were subsequently normalized across; (a) duration of each swing (N 1) and (b) range of values and duration (N 2). For these normalized data sets, F and t-tests were calculated for each kinematic variable for each point in normalized time across conditions. An ensembled plot was created for each data set and commonality and uniqueness analysis techniques were used to determine the essential elements of the golf swing. Despite similarities in the temporal characteristics of the golf swing across conditions, significant differences were observed in the top of <b>swing</b> <b>positions</b> (TOS). Lower body TOS preceded upper body TOS which preceded club TOS (pIS>AS, p<. 05). Adjustment in the rotations depended upon the club selection and was proportional to the duration of the swing and the range of motion of the three segments. Commonality analysis results indicated that an optimal golf swing may be represented by a single model rather than a specific model for each golf club. The critical element during the swing was the constraint of the right knee and hip during the take away phase. During take away, the lower body rotated about the right leg while the upper body rotated about a point near mid-shoulders. For all clubs, the "wind up motion" initiated the downswing phase and was perhaps responsible for an initial delay of wrist uncocking during this phase...|$|R
