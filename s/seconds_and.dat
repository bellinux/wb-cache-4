5|$|At Northwestern State, Delaney also {{starred in}} track.

5|$|He won the 1943 AJC Two-year-old Handicap, the AJC Kirkham Stakes and the 1944 AJC Sires' Produce Stakes {{over seven}} furlongs. During the season he had seven race starts for three wins, three <b>seconds</b> <b>and</b> one unplaced run.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from injury a month later, Bolt {{asserted}} himself with a 100 m win at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne (9.82 <b>seconds)</b> <b>and</b> a victory over Asafa Powell at Meeting Areva in Paris (9.84 seconds). Despite this run of form, he suffered only the second loss {{of his career in}} a 100 m final at the DN Galan. Tyson Gay soundly defeated him with a run of 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97 <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> the Jamaican reflected that he had slacked off in training early in the season while Gay had been better prepared and in a better condition. This marked Bolt's first loss to Gay in the 100 m, which coincidentally occurred in the same stadium where Powell had beaten Bolt for the first time two years earlier.|$|E

Phillips ranked ninth out of the 16 semifinalists, and advanced to the final round. In the August 21 final round, Phillips finished in seventh place {{with a time of}} 13.60seconds. Jackson Quiñónez of Spain ranked eighth (13.69 <b>seconds)</b> <b>and</b> fellow Jamaican Maurice Wignall ranked sixth (13.46seconds), while Dayron Robles took gold (12.93 seconds), David Payne took silver (13.17 <b>seconds),</b> <b>and</b> the United States' David Oliver took bronze (13.18seconds).|$|E

5|$|Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., {{developed}} a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, {{which was used}} in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365°F sunflower oil for around 40 <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off {{in the event of}} a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Cielo {{won four}} gold medals: in the 50 and 100-metre {{freestyle}}, {{and in the}} 4×100-metre freestyle and medley relay.

5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Olympics, Lidiane Lopes was the {{youngest}} ever competitor for Cape Verde at the Olympics, aged 17. She competed in the 100 meters on 3 August. Lopes was drawn into heat four and ran a time of 12.72 <b>seconds</b> <b>and</b> finished fourth in her preliminary heat, 1.12 seconds behind the winner, Toea Wisil. She finished 17th out of 33 athletes overall and was 0.48 seconds behind the slowest athlete who progressed to the heats. Therefore, Lopes did not progress to the heats.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 <b>seconds</b> <b>and</b> its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E
