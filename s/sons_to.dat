What greater pain <b>to</b> a good <b>son</b> than <b>to</b> see his father dishonoured, and put down below him? But what is the love of an earthly <b>son</b> <b>to</b> an earthly father, {{compared}} to the love of The <b>Son</b> <b>to</b> the Father?

5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017.

Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it is also possible that they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous <b>sons</b> <b>to</b> bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|Gefjon appears {{prominently}} as the allegorical {{mother of}} Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in the forty-page Swedish Romantic poem Gefion, a Poem in Four Cantos by Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll (1770–1835).
