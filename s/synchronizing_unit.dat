The C.202 was lightly armed {{by the standards of}} the time carrying the same armament as the C.R.32, a 1933 design. The C.202 carried as standard two 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns. The Breda design was as heavy as the Browning M2, the model from which it was derived. The Breda fired 12.7x81 mm [...] "Vickers" [...] ammunition — while its cartridges were longer than the 13 x 64 mm rounds of its German rough equivalent, the MG 131, the 81 mm Italian rounds were still shorter than the standard 12.7x99 mm rounds of the American [...] "Ma Deuce"; with the result that the energy at the muzzle was 10,000 joules vs. 16,000. The rate of fire was about 18 rounds/second (1,080 rounds per minute) or 0.63 kg (1.39 lb).Initially, all the armament was fitted within the nose of the Macchi. Ammunition carried was up to 800 rounds (standard: 700 rounds). An additional pair of Breda 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns was fitted in the wings in the VII series onward, but these, along with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, added 100 kg (220 lb) to the aircraft's weight and were typically removed by pilots to save weight, since they were relatively ineffective against most enemy aircraft in 1942. A <b>synchronizing</b> <b>unit</b> allowed the nose guns to fire through the propeller disk, but with a 25% loss in ROF (Rate of Fire). A [...] "San Giorgio" [...] reflector gun sight was fitted.|$|E

However, one effective and highly accurate biometric authentication method, palmprint recognition, has not been popularly applied as it should have been, which could be {{due to the lack of}} small, flexible and user-friendly acquisition systems. To expand the use of palmprint biometrics, we propose a novel palmprint acquisition system based on the line-scan image sensor. The proposed system consists of a customized and highly integrated line-scan sensor, a self-adaptive <b>synchronizing</b> <b>unit,</b> and a field-programmable gate array controller with a cross-platform interface. The volume of the proposed system is over 94 % smaller than the volume of existing palmprint systems, without compromising its verification performance.

40|$|In this project, an H∞ {{controller}} {{is proposed}} as a DC voltage regulator for the predictive current controlled pulse with modulated (PWM) three-phase power converter {{to compensate the}} uncertainty caused by the predictive current controller. The H∞ theory has its unique approach to the uncertainty issue, its design method allows both the stability robustness and performance robustness to be considered at the design stage. The design of the H∞ voltage regulator {{is based on the}} worst case scenario where the converter is subject to a load disturbance and its operation mode is changed from the rectifying to the regeneration, consequently, parameters and structure of the original plant transfer function derived, vary significantly. The proposed H∞ (DC) voltage regulator is to overcome the uncertainty problem and to work with the predictive current controller to achieve robust control of the entire system. The combined control scheme is simulated using MatLab/SIMULINK environment. The simulation results show that the closed-loop system is capable of achieving performance robustness and stability robustness for the worst case scenario. The output DC link voltage is stable and nearly sinusoidal, while the line currents are delivered with a unity power factor. A computer controlled three-phase PWM converter of lOkVA is developed and tested in the open-loop condition, and the performance of the power converter is examined. An INTEL industrial PC- 486 single chip computer is used as a digital controller. For a given modulation index and output frequency, switching intervals are calculated using the space vector PWM algorithm, and are down loaded to a PWM generator board which synthesizes gating pulse to six switching devices (IGBT). There is a on-board <b>synchronizing</b> <b>unit</b> which synchronizes the fundamental frequency of the gating pulses with the mains.

A biometric system authenticates people's identities using biological and/or behavioral traits. Various biometric applications have been developed, and a vast amount of people have bene. ted from the convenience of biometrics. The applications of biometrics in everyday life have expanded dramatically. In the meantime, there are new challenges to biometric systems when being used by the general public. In this work, the focus is to investigate the methodology of conventional biometrics design, to improve current biometrics, to practice new biometrics design methodology, and to create new biometrics. Palmprint recognition is the foundation of this improvement. Palmprint recognition is a hand-based biometrics with excellent performance for the large region of interest, stable and unique features, and fast feature extraction and matching method verified by researchers all over the world. However, the applications of palmprint recognition are limited. One major reason for the palmprint recognition not being utilized widely is the lack of a small and compact acquisition system. Then we proposed a line-scan palmprint acquisition system (LPS). LPS uses line scan imaging that makes the system small and flexible. LPS comprises the line scan sensor, the <b>synchronizing</b> <b>unit,</b> and the controller board. With the proposed acquisition system, we collected 8000 images from 250 people. In this huge data set, the equal error rate of LPS is 0. 048 %, which is comparable to conventional palm-print acquisition systems. Moreover, the volume of the proposed LPS is 94 % smaller than conventional systems at least. After the line scan palmprint system, it is realized that a new biometrics design model and new biometric systems are required. This new biometrics design model should emphasize user experience, because the improvements in system level is not enough. The conventional biometrics design model focuses on security performance. They are under the assumption that biometric traits can be extracted better in the standard pose and position than in a deformed pose. This assumption is true with the limitations of both hardware (imaging technology) and algorithms (feature extraction and classi. cation methods). With the recent development in both hardware and algorithms field, this situation has altered. For hardware, the lens and cameras have become tiny in volume. The precision and the resolution of the lens and cameras are far better than five years ago. For algorithms, new feature extraction method and classification method are robust to various interference and deformations. Thus, we proposed the new ergonomic biometrics design model. In this ergonomic biometrics design model, the human factor, both physical and psychological factors, {{is one of the major}} concerns in the design stage of building a biometric system. Using this model, we proposed the door knob hand recognition system (DKHRS). The acquisition device of DKHRS has an identical appearance of a conventional door knob. It capturesa hand image when people hold the door knob. The door knob hand recognition is user-friendly in both physical and psychological merits. First, the appearance of door knobs has been evolved for over a hundred years. The design of door knob is one of the most convenient design of a device. Second, the function of door knobs is access control. This function and interactions of a door knob have been accepted by the human society for over a century. Following this convention, people could understand the function of the system in a very short time. Third, using biometric feature instead of conventional keys and locks empowers people the convenience of flawless security experience, because the biometric feature can not be lost or forgotten. In DKHRS, there is a critical problem: imaging. The imaging is a challenge because the system requires an omnivision image capturing in a very compact space. Thus, we proposed a simplified catadioptric imaging scheme, which can capture omnivision images but is also easy to manufacture and cost-efficient. Using this imaging scheme, the door knob hand recognition acquisition device is established. It comprises six components: an acrylic transparent door knob, an over 95 % full spectrum reflective mirror, a white LED board, a 6 mm focal length pinhole lens, a 1 / 3 inch mini CCD camera, and a USB 2. 0 frame grabber. With the developed acquisition system, a big door knob hand image database containing 10920 samples from 420 hands is built. The feature extraction and classification method is another major challenge. After investigating state-of-art feature extraction methods for hand-based biometrics, we propose a patch-based method which combines the local Gabor binary pattern, the principal component analysis, and the projective dictionary pair learning method. In a large data set including 420 hands and 10920 images, the proposed methods achieves an 0. 091 % equal error rate. The performance is promising and competitive in biometric applications.

40|$|Repeated {{acoustic}} {{events are}} ubiquitous temporal features of natural sounds. To reveal the neural {{representation of the}} sound repetition rate, a number of electrophysiological {{studies have been conducted}} on various mammals and it has been proposed that both the spike-time and firing rate of primary auditory cortex (A 1) neurons encode the repetition rate. However, previous studies rarely examined how the experimental animals perceive the difference in the sound repetition rate, and a caveat to these experiments is that they compared physiological data obtained from animals with psychophysical data obtained from humans. In this study, for the first time, we directly investigated acoustic perception and the underlying neural mechanisms in the same experimental animal by examining spike activities in the A 1 of free-moving cats while performing a Go/No-go task to discriminate the click-trains at different repetition rates (12. 5 – 200 Hz). As reported by previous studies on passively listening animals, A 1 neurons showed both synchronized and non-synchronized responses to the click-trains. We further found that the neural performance estimated from the precise temporal information of <b>synchronized</b> <b>units</b> was good enough to distinguish all 16. 7 – 200 Hz from the 12. 5 Hz repetition rate; however, the cats showed declining behavioral performance with the decrease of the target repetition rate, indicating an increase of difficulty in discriminating two slower click-trains.

40|$|Pulse-coupled {{threshold}} units {{serve as}} paradigmatic models {{for a wide}} range of complex systems. When the state variable of a unit crosses a threshold, the unit sends a pulse that is received by other units, thereby mediating the interactions. At the same time, the state variable of the sending unit is reset. Here we present and analyze a class of pulse-coupled oscillators where the reset may be partial only and is mediated by a partial reset function. Such a partial reset characterizes intrinsic physical or biophysical features of a unit, e. g., resistive coupling between dendrite and soma of compartmental neurons; at the same time the description in terms of a partial reset enables a rigorous mathematical investigation of the collective network dynamics. The partial reset acts as a desynchronization mechanism. For $N$ all-to-all pulse-coupled oscillators an increase in the strength of the partial reset causes a sequence of desynchronizing bifurcations from the fully synchronous state via states with large clusters of <b>synchronized</b> <b>units</b> through states with smaller clusters to complete asynchrony. By considering inter- and intracluster stability we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence and stability of cluster states on the partial reset function and on the intrinsic dynamics of the oscillators.
