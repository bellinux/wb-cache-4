25|$|Kh-31A - active <b>seeker</b> <b>head</b> {{for use as}} an anti-shipping missile against vessels up to {{destroyer}} size, {{range of}} 25km103km (13.555.6 nmi). Missile is sea-skimming as it approaches the target.|$|E
25|$|Some Western {{sources have}} {{referred}} to a Kh-58A that is either optimised for naval radars or has an active <b>seeker</b> <b>head</b> for use as an anti-shipping missile - it probably represents {{another name for the}} Kh-58U.|$|E
25|$|The first air-to-air {{anti-radiation}} missile {{developed by the}} United States, the Brazo utilised the airframe of the existing AIM-7E Sparrow air-to-air missile, fitted with a new, Hughes-built passive radar <b>seeker</b> <b>head</b> developed by the Naval Electronics Center. The seeker was intended to detect and home on enemy radar emissions, such as those on interceptor and AWACS aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Argon {{is used as}} a {{propellant}} in {{the development}} of the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR). Compressed argon gas is allowed to expand, to cool the <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> of some versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and other missiles that use cooled thermal <b>seeker</b> <b>heads.</b> The gas is stored at high pressure.|$|R

25|$|Nisan-28 or Nissan-28 - Iraqi {{version of}} Kh-28E {{displayed}} in Baghdad in 1989 that {{was reported to}} have three <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> for different frequency bands.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} Have Dash II {{missiles were}} recoverable, and utilised Rocketdyne Mk 58 solid-fueled rocket motors {{of the same}} type used by the AIM-7 Sparrow. Production missiles {{were expected to be}} powered by a ramjet engine, and would use inertial navigation during the cruise phase of flight, with a dual-mode infrared/active radar <b>seeker</b> <b>head</b> for terminal guidance.|$|E
25|$|The newest {{generation}} of the FIM-92 Stinger uses a dual IR and UV <b>seeker</b> <b>head,</b> which allows for a redundant tracking solution, effectively negating the impact of modern decoy flares (according to the U.S. Department of Defense). While research and development in flare technology has produced an IR signature on the same wavelength as hot engine exhaust, modern flares still produce a notably (and immutably) different UV signature than an aircraft engine burning kerosene jet-fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{would then}} pull {{away at a}} sharp angle from the flare (and the terminal trajectory of the missile) and reduce engine power in attempt to cool the thermal signature. Optimally, the missile's <b>seeker</b> <b>head</b> is then confused by this change in temperature and flurry of new signatures, and therefore follows the flare(s) rather than the aircraft. The most modern IR-guided missiles have sophisticated on-board electronics that help discriminate between flares and targets, reducing the effectiveness of countermeasures.|$|E
50|$|A variant {{using the}} <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> of the K-13, giving better dogfight capability, was {{developed}} in 1960 as the K-88, {{but it did not}} enter service.|$|R
25|$|Like other Soviet {{missiles}} of the time, the Kh-58 {{could be}} {{fitted with a}} range of <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> designed to target specific air defence radars such as MIM-14 Nike-Hercules or MIM-104 Patriot.|$|R
50|$|The K-8's {{development}} {{began in}} 1955, known as R-8 in service. Like most Soviet air-to-air missiles, {{it was made}} {{with a choice of}} semi-active radar homing or infrared <b>seeker</b> <b>heads.</b> The original missile was compatible with the Uragan-5B radar used on the Sukhoi Su-11 and several developmental aircraft from Mikoyan-Gurevich.|$|R
25|$|In 1973 Victor Bugaiskii was {{appointed}} head engineer {{of the bureau}} and he started work on combining the Kh-23M, Kh-25 and Kh-27 into a single modular system to reduce costs and improve tactical flexibility. This was completed {{by the end of}} 1978, resulting in the Kh-25MP (anti-radar), Kh-25ML (laser-guided) and Kh-25MR (radio-guided) family. NATO continued to refer to these as the AS-12 and AS-10 respectively, even though they could now be switched by a simple change of <b>seeker</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} infrared missiles, such {{as early}} {{versions of the}} U.S. Stinger, the Soviet SA-14, and the Chinese FN-6, use improved coolants to cool the <b>seeker</b> <b>head,</b> which enables the seeker to filter out most interfering background IR sources as well as permitting head-on and side engagement profiles. These missiles may also employ technologies to counter decoy flares that might be deployed by targeted aircraft and also have backup target detection modes such as the ultraviolet (UV) mode found on the Stinger missile.|$|E
25|$|The mockup {{shown in}} 1993 {{had a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Buk airframe, but since the Indians became involved {{there have been some}} changes. An Indian magazine gave the specifications of the KS–172 in April 2004 as a core 6.01m long and 40cm in diameter with a wingspan of 61cm, with a booster of 1.4m, and 748kg total weight. It had a solid fuel tandem rocket booster capable of speeds up to , 12g manoevring, and an adaptive HE fragmentation warhead. Development would concentrate on the <b>seeker</b> <b>head,</b> autopilot, resistance to jamming and a steering system with 3D thrust vector control (TVC).|$|E
50|$|In 1954 Dassault {{established}} an electronics division (by 1962 named Electronique Marcel Dassault), the first action {{of which was}} to begin development of airborne radars, soon followed by <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> for air-to-air missiles, navigation, and bombing aids. From the 1950s to late 1970s exports become {{a major part of}} Dassault’s business, major successes were the Dassault Mirage series and the Mystere-Falcon.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{configuration}} of the Kh-38M was revealed at the 2007 Moscow Air Show (MAKS). The modular guided air-to-surface missile is meant to succeed the venerable Kh-25 missile family. The missile {{is designed to be}} carried by the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 fighter aircraft. The missile has folding wings and tail fins for internal carriage, and would have a variety of <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> for different variants.|$|R
50|$|When the Alaska Gold Rush {{started in}} 1897, many older vessels were {{pressed into service}} {{in an effort to}} make money off gold <b>seekers</b> <b>headed</b> for the north country. Geo. E. Starr was no exception. Under Capt. E.E. Caine, the Starr was made ready to, and did in fact depart for Skagway and Dyea on August 3, 1897 with 90 {{passengers}} and a cargo of 100 horses.|$|R
2500|$|NATO {{refers to}} all of the Kh-25 family as AS-10 'Karen' apart from the anti-radar variants. An [...] "M" [...] {{designation}} stands for [...] "Modulnaya" [...] – modular (<b>seeker</b> <b>head).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kh-31P (Type 77P) - passive <b>seeker</b> <b>head</b> {{for use as}} an {{anti-radiation}} missile. Stays at {{high altitude}} throughout its flight, allowing higher speeds and increasing range to [...] The seeker has three interchangeable modules to cover different radar frequency bands, but they can only be changed at the factory.|$|E
2500|$|The Kh-28 ( [...] ; Nisan-28; NATO:AS-9 'Kyle') was {{the first}} Soviet {{anti-radiation}} missile for tactical aircraft. It entered production in 1973 and is still carried on some Sukhoi Su-22s in developing countries but {{is no longer in}} Russian service. Use of the Kh-28 was restricted by its weight, limited <b>seeker</b> <b>head,</b> bulk and fuelling requirements, and it was superseded by the smaller, solid-fuel Kh-58 (AS-11 'Kilter') in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The designations XAGM-153A and XAGM-153B were assigned; the A {{model was}} to have a hard target {{penetrating}} warhead, the B model a blast-fragmentation warhead - both warheads {{would have been in the}} region of 360 kg (800 lb). To distinguish between <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> a number suffix was also mooted, with -1 missiles having a TV unit in the nose and -2 missiles an imaging infra-red system, but this was not adopted formally.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of gold on Rabbit Creek at Dawson City prompted Klondike Gold Rush. Thousands of gold <b>seekers</b> <b>headed</b> north.Riverboats from the Pacific Northwest headed north to ply the route. Hundreds of boats were co-opted {{and others were}} built. Twelve identical steamboats were built by Moran Bros. (hull Nos. 9-20). Yards in Seattle, Victoria, Portland, and Vancouver all built boats. The CPR Steamer service ordered more vessels: Moyie and Minto, for instance; but they arrived too late for service on the Yukon River.|$|R
40|$|Pyrotechnical decoys are {{the most}} {{important}} countermeasures for airborne platforms in case of threats by infrared-guided missiles. To evaluate the functionality and improve the effectiveness of pyrotechnical decoys against modern <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> it is necessary to measure their radiation emission spectrally and spatially resolved. Therefore Fraunhofer ICT utilizes besides various spectrometer and camera systems a hyperspectral imager (TELOPS HyperCam MWE Fast). These data allow a deep insight in chemical processes of the combustion. This paper presents the first results measuring pyrotechnical decoys with the TELOPS HyperCam conducted by Fraunhofer ICT...|$|R

50|$|By {{the spring}} of 1849 tens of {{thousands}} of gold <b>seekers</b> <b>headed</b> westward for California. The California Trail was one of three main ways used as Argonauts went by the California Trail, across the disease ridden Isthmus of Panama and around the storm tossed Cape Horn between South America and Antarctica to get to California. The 1848 and 1849 gold rushers were just the first of many more as many more sought to seek their fortunes during the California Gold Rush, which continued for several years as miners found about $50,000,000 dollars worth of gold (at $21/troy oz) each year.|$|R
50|$|Green Cheese was a British-made radar-guided anti-ship {{tactical}} nuclear warhead missile {{project of the}} 1950s. It was developed by Fairey Aviation {{to be used by}} the Fairey Gannet shipborne anti-submarine warfare aircraft, and was originally called Fairey Project 7. However, the missile's 3,800 lb (1720 kg) weight proved to be too heavy for the Gannet, and would have required modifications to the Gannet's bomb bay to expose the missiles' <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> to the target before launch. The missile project continued, since the Blackburn Buccaneer naval strike aircraft had a rotating bomb bay which was ideally suited to the task.|$|R
5|$|The Banner State was {{the first}} {{steamboat}} to land materials for building the city in early 1854, before the city was formally founded. Until 1879 Captain Joseph La Barge was the principal figure among the Missouri steamboat captains {{in the early years}} of the city. According to J. Sterling Morton, the golden era for steamboating on the Missouri was from 1855 to 1860, just before the advent of the railroads. In 1857, 174 steamboats carrying 13,000 tons of freight tied up at Omaha wharves.

40|$|Reduction of the {{infrared}} signature of warships helps {{to increase their}} survivability. Two methods to reduce {{the infrared}} signature are discussed: the cooling of exhaust gases {{and the application of}} low emissivity paint. The infrared signature of a generic frigate has been calculated with and without signature reduction. The signature values are used to determine the lock-on range of four generic infrared <b>seeker</b> <b>heads</b> of anti ship missiles ranging fro hot spot seekers to imaging seekers. From the reduction in lock-on range the reduction in hit probability is calculated. The results show that both exhaust gas cooling and low emissivity paint contribute to the survivability of a warship...|$|R
