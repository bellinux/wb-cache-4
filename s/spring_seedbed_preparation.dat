40|$|No-till {{management}} {{leads to}} beneficial effects on soil fertility preservation, erosion mitigation and cost reduction. However, weed management strategies should {{be adapted to}} no-till field conditions. A field experiment was set up on November 2011 to compare emergence behavior of three weed species (Abutilon theophrasti Medik., Sonchus oleraceus L. and Sorghum halepense L. Pers.) and to evaluate if a single model could be adopted to predict their emergence in arable and no-till managements. Two treatments were performed to simulate conditions of weed seeds in arable (seeds overwinter buried in the soil and are affected by soil disturbance due to <b>spring</b> <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparation)</b> and no-till managements (seeds overwinter on soil surface without any further disturbance). Four 100 -seeds replicates were included for each treatment. Seedlings were counted weekly from March 2012. Mean percentages of emerged seedlings were calculated for each species, treatment and their combinations. Emergence dynamics was modeled using a logistic function from which time of 50 % relative emergence (t 50) was estimated. Factorial ANOVA (P< 0. 05) identified significant effects of species, treatment and their interaction on percentage and t 50 of emergence. Regarding emergence percentage, {{significant differences were found}} between treatments for A. theophrasti and S. halepense, but not for S. oleraceus. Moreover, the two treatments of each species presented identical emergence dynamics without any significant difference for emergence t 50. These findings may suggest that a single model could be adopted to predict seedling emergence for the three species in arable and no-till systems. However, this experiment has to be replicated to confirm these results under different environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Selecting the tillage system {{best suited}} to a {{particular}} farming situation is an important management decision. Formerly, the traditional system was a moldboard plow operation followed by several secondary tillage operations before planting. This system can be appropriate for poorly drained soils having little or no slope and low erosion potential. However, plowing has several disadvantages. The potential for soil erosion is high on sloping lands, and labor and fuel requirements can be substantially higher than with other tillage and planting systems. Today, conservation tillage systems are used to reduce preplant tillage operations, thus reducing soil erosion and moisture loss while saving labor and fuel. The label 2 ̆ 2 conservation tillage 2 ̆ 2 represents {{a broad spectrum of}} farming methods, and is most often defined by the amount of residue cover remaining on the soil surface. The minimum amount recommended is 20 to 30 percent after planting. Research in Nebraska and other Midwestern states has shown that leaving at least this much residue will reduce erosion by more than 50 percent of that occurring from a cleanly tilled field. To achieve effective erosion control, this minimum residue cover should be maintained during the critical soil erosion period between <b>spring</b> <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparation</b> and crop canopy establishment. Conservation tillage does not necessarily require new equipment. Most conventional farm implements can be used. For corn, grain sorghum, or wheat residue, one or two passes with a field cultivator, disk, or chisel plow will usually leave more than the 20 percent minimum cover. Additional operations reduce the amount of residue, and thus reduce erosion control. Other tillage and planting systems such as ridge-plant (till-plant) and no till leave even more residue, and thus offer greater erosion control. However, no-till planting is the only method that consistently leaves the minimum surface cover in the more fragile and less abundant soybean residue. No single tillage system is best for all situations at all times. Selecting the best tillage system for a particular soil and cropping situation requires matching the operation to the crop sequence, topography, and soil type. Rotating systems to coincide with crop rotations often provides an excellent combination. For example, a no till system could follow soybeans while a chisel or disk system might follow corn. This tillage rotation provides the best erosion control following soybeans, and provides an opportunity for some tillage in the less fragile and more abundant corn residue...|$|E

40|$|Winter cress (Barbarea verna) <b>seed</b> <b>preparations</b> rich in phen-ethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) {{had strong}} in vivo and in vitro {{anti-inflammatory}} activity, significantly reducing {{the size of}} carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. This in vivo effect was comparable {{with that of the}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin. The <b>seed</b> <b>preparation,</b> in a concentration-depen-dent manner, reduced the mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes such as the inducible forms of cyclooxygenase and nitric-oxide synthase and the proinflammatory cytokine inter-leukin in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7. Activity of the <b>seed</b> <b>preparation</b> was {{similar to that of the}} synthetic PEITC. PEITC was the most active of five different forms of isothiocyanate tested for their effects on in vitro proinflammatory gene expression. In vitro activity of the <b>seed</b> <b>preparation</b> was also compared with that of two known anti-inflammatory drugs. We conclude that Barbarea verna <b>seed</b> <b>preparation</b> may function as a potent anti-inflammatory agent, interfering with the transcription of proinflammatory genes. Phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) is an organosulfur bio-active compound present in many plants of the Brassicaceae family, most of which have long histories of human consump-tion. Of these, Barbarea verna (winter cress) is the richest source of PEITC (Ribnicky et al., 2001), with the highest levels formed in the seeds. Winter cress is an annual herb, mostly harvested as a seedling to add a peppery flavor to salads, sandwiches, soups, and garnishes. PEITC has many well documented cancer chemopreventive properties.

40|$|The {{effects of}} stale <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparations</b> and several weed control methods on the {{emergence}} of weeds in lettuce were studied. The specific goal was {{to evaluate the use}} of a stale seedbed in combination with chemical or mechanical weed control methods in the field. Depending on location and year, stale <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparations</b> followed by weed control prior to planting reduced the amount of weeds during crop growth by 43 ¿ 83 %. Control of the emerged seedlings after a stale <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparation</b> was more effective with glyphosate than with a rotary harrow. Covering the rotary harrow during control to prevent light reaching the soil improved its effect on the weed density during crop growth in two of 3 years. Radiation with far red light (FR) did not reduce the number of emerging weeds in this study. Mechanical control by finger weeder, torsion weeder and hoe was applied without stale <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparations.</b> These measures reduced the weed densities by 88 ¿ 99 %, compared with the untreated control and were more effective than chemical weed control with carbetamide and chlorpropham. The results show that the stale seedbed technique in combination with mechanical control of emerging weeds can reduce the weed population during crop growth as effectively as chemical control. The technique may therefore help reduce the use of herbicides in lettuce crops in the future...|$|R

Information about <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparation</b> aspects in double-cropping of wheat and mungbean in Isfahan is lacking. For this reason, the effects of various <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparation</b> methods on growth, seed yield and yield components of mungbean (experimental line 1 - 61 - 16) were studied in a wheat-mungbean double-cropping system during 1996 at the Agricultural Research Station, Isfahan University of Technology. Two residue management treatments (burned and nonburned) along with four tillage systems: moldboard plow, disk, khischee and no-till were {{laid out in a}} strip plot design within a randomized complete block design with four replications. Improved establishment and plant growth conditions associated with burning residue treatment significantly increased plant density, above ground plant weight, number of nodes per branch, plant height, number of pods per main stem and per square meter, number of seeds per pod on main stem and on branches, number of seeds per main stem, seed yield, biological yield and harvest index. Higher plant density in this treatment resulted in significant {{reduction in the number of}} branches and number of pods per branch. Desirable conditions for establishment and growth in disk and moldboard plow treatments significantly increased plant density, above ground plant weight, number of pods per main stem and per square meter, number of seeds per pod on main stem and on branches, number of seeds per main stem, seed yield, biological yield and harvest index.

50|$|A {{prepared}} seedbed remains receptive for {{a relatively}} short period, seldom as long as 5 years, sometimes as short as 3 years.
