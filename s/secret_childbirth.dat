2500|$|Three weeks later, Madame de Berry shut {{herself up}} in the Luxembourg Palace, officially [...] "bothered with a bad cold". The princess who had been hiding her {{pregnancy}} until she reached her term was really suffering the pains of labour. This clandestine confinement is reported in the Gazette de la Régence on 6 February 1716: They say the Duchess of Berry {{gave birth to a}} daughter who lived only three days. This conduct reminds of Messalina and of Queen Margot. This <b>secret</b> <b>childbirth</b> soon became public knowledge and excited the verve of satirists. A song dated 1716 ("Les couches de la Duchesse de Berry") and later satirical verses from the Collection Clairambault-Maurepas lampoon the unbridled lust of the young widow, poking fun at her [...] "countless" [...] lovers and her clandestine pregnancies.|$|E
50|$|Shizuka {{is mostly}} Ryo's fiancée {{because of the}} Japanese government's <b>secret</b> <b>childbirth</b> program, but {{disclosures}} later on reveal that her grandfather has {{a hand in the}} matter. When her grandfather was young, {{he fell in love with}} a woman from a lower class, but they could not get married due to his parents' disapproval via class status. Instead, he married the woman his family picked. He eventually accepted and fell in love with his wife and forgot about his first love. When his wife died two years before the events of Final Approach, Shizuka's grandfather went back to reminiscing about his first love. After some research, he found out she had already died. In studying some more, he found out the woman had two grandchildren (who were Ryo and Akane), both of close ages to his grandchild. The grandfather, knowing this, asks Shizuka to marry Ryo, as a sign of realization of his lost love, which seems to be his only wish left in his lifetime. Shizuka, obeying and honoring her grandfather, carries on his request, despite her being unhappy at first with a forced marriage. Like Ryo, she at first did not want to be in a planned marriage where she didn't know who her spouse was. The reason Shizuka didn't tell Ryo about the story was because she thought he would pity her, a love relationship that Shizuka would not have been happy or satisfied with. Fortunately, Shizuka was in love with Ryo so deeply and strongly that she didn't care if Ryo pitied her or not. In the end, Ryo, realizing the real Shizuka and her passionate love, came to her hometown, fully accepting their marriage status from having developed so strong of feelings for his fiancée.|$|E

40|$|The Abstract The aim of {{my thesis}} {{is to find}} and {{describe}} the problematic aspects of the determination of parenthood. I chose four areas of the determination of parenthood, {{which can lead to}} various complications - assisted reproduction, surrogacy, <b>secret</b> <b>childbirths</b> and anonymous births. In the first chapter of the thesis I deal with the legal aspects of the determination of parenthood. I examine mandatory determination of maternity and various assumptions of paternity. With the development of relations in the society and of the reproductive medicine, there emerge possibilities doubting the traditional legal principles of the determination of parenthood. Mother is not always certain anymore and there are five presumptions of paternity in the Czech legal order nowadays, compared to the traditional three. The second chapter is devoted to the issue of assisted reproduction. Assisted reproduction is a modern and rapidly developing area of medicine that allows infertile couples to have their own child. It is a medical specialty that requires a broad legal framework to prevent its abuse. At the end of a successful medical procedure a new life is coming into existence and such area must be regulated. The third chapter, entitled Surrogacy, builds on the previous chapter. Surrogacy is often discussed area of [...] ...|$|R
