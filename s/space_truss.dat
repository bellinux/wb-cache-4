40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} concerned {{with the formation of}} barrel-vault <b>space</b> <b>trusses</b> derived from a flat configuration by posttensioning. To obtain a fairly general picture of the shape-formation process by means of posttensioning, both gently and sharply curved barrel-vault models are studied. The structures are devised to be near mechanisms during the posttensioning operation. They are considered to be near mechanisms because only the flexural stiffness of the top chords provides any appreciable resistance to deformation apart from friction and self weight. Therefore, no appreciable axial force is induced in the members of the structures during the shape-formation process. The result of experimental and theoretical work on the shape formation of barrel-vault <b>space</b> <b>trusses</b> by means of posttensioning is presented here. The shape-formation process, referred to as self-erection, can lead to significant economies in the construction of large-span lightweight structures by eliminating or minimizing the need for scaffolding and heavy cranes...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} principally {{concerned}} with the shape formation of different forms of space trusses with non-zero Gaussian curvature {{by means of a}} post-tensioning technique. The <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> that is shaped and erected by a post-tensioning procedure, rather than by traditional techniques involving cranes and scaffolding, is called a post-tensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>truss.</b> The construction procedure for a post-tensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> initially involves the assembly of a planar truss with a single-layer of chords, together with out-of-plane web members, at ground level. In proportion to the desired space shape, certain bottom chords are given gaps. The bottom chords comprise shorter tubes and strands that pass through the tubes and through the bottom joints. The initially too-short chords are used to create pre-defined gaps, while the tensioning strands are used to close the gaps. By means of post-tensioning, a planar layout can be deformed and erected to its desired space shape at the same time. In this thesis, the principles of the post-tensioned and shaped space trusses, together with the essential aspects that lead to shape formation and self-erection, are investigated theoretically and are verified by experimental models. In addition to theoretical work, seven domes and one hypar have been constructed by means of a post-tensioning method under laboratory conditions. Also, a pyramidal unit of a full-size practical <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> has been tested. After the shape formation tests, three post-tensioned and shaped domes and one hypar <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> have been loaded to failure in order to observe the ultimate load carrying capacity. The post-tensioned and shaped space trusses have satisfactory ultimate load capacity. The post-tensioning process m a y increase or reduce the ultimate load capacity of posttensioned and shaped space trusses, due to the resulted prestress forces in some critical members. Compared with the simplicity in construction and erection procedure, the post-tensioned and shaped space trusses still have evident advantages in economy, even if the ultimate load capacity is reduced. Furthermore, the ultimate load capacity of a posttensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> can be improved by stiffening only a few critical members according to the test results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} evolutionary optimization methods to design of <b>space</b> <b>trusses.</b> The objective is to minimize the weight of <b>space</b> <b>trusses</b> with discrete variable sections subject to constraints on displacements, stresses, and local stability. Member&# 039;s displacement sensitivity index, stress index and slenderness index are derived and used to change the member section. The process of structural analysis - member indexes calculation - member section selection is repeated until all constraints are satisfied. At each iteration, a number of members can only be assigned the next smaller or larger sections from an initially chosen set of sections. This discrete section sizing approach provides much convenience in practical design works. Various optimization algorithms, based on section selection strategy, type and sequence of constraints included into the algorithm, are proposed and employed. The optimization process is automatically carried out by an optimization program called FEMOPT. Optimal designs obtained by the proposed algorithms {{are very similar to}} each other and can be compared with solutions by other optimization methods...|$|R

The NPS <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> is a 3. 7 -meter long truss that simulates a space-borne appendage with sensitive equipment at its extremities.

40|$|Deployable {{periodic}} large space structures {{have been}} shown to exhibit high dynamic sensitivity to period-breaking imperfections and uncertainties. These can be brought on by manufacturing or assembly errors, structural imperfections, as well as nonlinear and/or nonconservative joint behavior. In addition, the necessity of precise pointing and position capability can require the consideration of these usually negligible and unknown parametric uncertainties and their effect on the overall dynamic response of large space structures. This work describes the use of a new design approach for the global dynamic solution of beam-like periodic space structures possessing parametric uncertainties. Specifically, the effect of random flexible joints on the free vibrations of simply-supported periodic large <b>space</b> <b>trusses</b> is considered. The formulation is a hybrid approach in terms of an extended Timoshenko beam continuum model, Monte Carlo simulation scheme, and first-order perturbation methods. The mean and mean-square response statistics for a variety of free random vibration problems are derived for various input random joint stiffness probability distributions. The results of this effort show that, although joint flexibility has a substantial effect on the modal dynamic response of periodic large <b>space</b> <b>trusses,</b> the effect of any reasonable uncertainty or randomness associated with these joint flexibilities is insignificant...|$|R
