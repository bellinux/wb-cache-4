30|$|Archeological and {{volcanic}} {{materials have}} the potential to acquire a natural remanent magnetization (NRM) that is thermal in origin (termed a thermal remanent magnetization or TRM). TRM is obtained on cooling through a material’s Curie-temperature (Néel temperature) to room temperature and can be preserved over geological timescales depending on the magnetic grain size distribution of a particular material. A TRM can be treated as the summation <b>of</b> blocks <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> associated with discrete temperature ranges (called partial TRM or pTRM). In the laboratory it is possible to reverse the magnetization process (demagnetization).
