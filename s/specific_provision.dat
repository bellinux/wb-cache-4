5|$|Celtic law made <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> {{with regard}} to {{cabbages}} and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E

Alternative Catholic school provision had been available at St John the Baptist R.C. primary school, which also served Felling at Willow Drive but was closed down due to lack of pupils in the summer 2011 after 74 years of operation. The school is now a Jewish girls school.|$|E

Consequently, no <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> was made for the Philippines. Instead they fell under the general provision that all other lands not otherwise provided for {{be returned to the}} Spanish Crown.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom {{there are}} no laws forbidding {{photography}} of private property from a public place. Photography on private land is not restricted if the landowner has given permission. However, landowners are permitted to impose any conditions they wish upon entry to a property, including forbidding or restricting photography. Two public locations in the UK, Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square, have a <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> against photography for commercial purposes without the written permission of the Mayor, or the Squares' Management Team and paying a fee, and permission is needed to photograph or film for commercial purposes in the Royal Parks.|$|E
25|$|Sydney was {{established}} as a penal settlement on 26 January 1788 {{in the name of}} King George III by Captain Arthur Phillip, for prisoners transported from Britain. Many of the people to arrive in Sydney at that time were military, some with wives and family, there were also some free settlers. The first chaplain of the colony was the Reverend Richard Johnson of the Church of England. No <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> was made for the religious needs of those many convicts and settlers who were Roman Catholics. To redress this, an Irish Catholic priest, a Father O'Flynn, travelled to the colony of New South Wales but, as he arrived without government sanction, he was sent home.|$|E

25|$|As {{a part of}} the Seven Years' War, British forces {{occupied}} Manila between 1762 and 1764. However, {{the only}} part of the Philippines which the British held was the Spanish colonial capital of Manila and the principal naval port of Cavite, both of which are located on Manila Bay. The war was ended by the Treaty of Paris (1763). At the end of the war the treaty signatories were not aware that Manila had been taken by the British and was being administered as a British colony. Consequently, no <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> was made for the Philippines. Instead they fell under the general provision that all other lands not otherwise provided for be returned to the Spanish Empire. Many Indian Sepoy troops and their British captains mutinied and were left in Manila and some parts of the Ilocos and Cagayan. The ones in Manila settled at Cainta, Rizal and the ones in the north settled in Isabela. Most were assimilated into the local population.|$|E
25|$|Joint authorship of articles, {{in which}} {{different}} users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, {{can also cause}} editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, {{making it impossible to}} republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing. However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable. Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership.

500|$|Congress had {{expressed}} concern about possible misuse of the blue discharge when it began work on the G.I. Bill in 1944. In discussions about the legislation's details, the American Legion insisted on a <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> to provide benefits to veterans discharged under any circumstance other than dishonorable. The Legion believed {{a large number of}} veterans had been given blue and other less-than-honorable discharges for reasons that it considered unreasonable or trivial. In testimony before the United States Senate, Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs strongly opposed this provision {{on the grounds that it}} would undermine morale and remove any incentive to maintain a good service record. Senator Bennett Champ Clark, a sponsor of the bill, dismissed his concerns, calling them [...] "some of the most stupid, short-sighted objections which could be raised". Clark went on to say: ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was widely}} {{expected}} that Southern Rhodesia {{would eventually be}} incorporated into the Union of South Africa as its fifth province. It was generally considered part of South Africa geographically and in colonial terms, part of the British expansion into the region that had begun with the 1820 Settlers. Representatives from Rhodesia had participated in the South African National Convention of 1908 and section 150 of the South Africa Act 1909 made <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> for the accession of BSAC territories. Coghlan had represented the interests of the Rhodesian people at the Convention, although his contribution was insignificant. The presence of the Rhodesian delegation had been supported - and even secured - by Louis Botha, who was keen to win the trust of the settlers. In November 1909, at a banquet for Lord Selborne, the departing High Commissioner in Cape Town, Coghlan spoke of the BSAC and the people of Southern Rhodesia working together towards entering the Union, though some settlers wished to enjoy what he called [...] "an artificial stage of responsible government" [...] first. Indeed, the order in council of 1898 had provided Southern Rhodesia with a constitution that resembled that of a Crown Colony with responsible government and the South Africa Act made no changes to the territory's administrative framework.|$|E
500|$|The Victoria Cross {{is awarded}} for [...] A {{recommendation}} for the VC is normally issued by an officer at regimental level, or equivalent, {{and has to}} be supported by three witnesses, although this has been waived on occasion. The recommendation is then passed up the military hierarchy until it reaches the Secretary of State for Defence. The recommendation is then laid before the monarch who approves the award with his or her signature. Victoria Cross awards are always promulgated in the London Gazette with the single exception of the award to the American Unknown Soldier in 1921. The Victoria Cross warrant makes no <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> as to who should actually present the medals to the recipients. Queen Victoria indicated that she would like to present the medals in person and she presented 185 medals out of the 472 gazetted during her reign. Including the first 62 medals presented at a parade in Hyde Park on 26 June 1857 by Queen Victoria, nearly 900 awards have been personally presented to the recipient by the reigning British monarch. Nearly 300 awards have been presented {{by a member of the}} royal family or by a civil or military dignitary. About 150 awards were either forwarded to the recipient or next of kin by registered post or no details of the presentations are known.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1974, {{with sales}} of D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36 years old. But in January 1975, Kaye {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a heart}} attack. He had not made any <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna. Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company. Gygax characterized her as [...] "less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner." [...] After Kaye's death, TSR was forced to relocate from Kaye's dining room to Gygax's basement. In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares {{at any time in the}} future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D was still owned by the 3-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies. In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares. These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.|$|E
