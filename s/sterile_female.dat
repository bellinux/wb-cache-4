25|$|The {{workers of}} army ants are usually blind or can have {{compound}} eyes that {{are reduced to}} a single lens. There are species of army ants where the worker caste may show polymorphism based on physical differences and job allocations; however, there are also species that show no polymorphism at all. The worker caste is usually composed of <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> worker ants.|$|E
25|$|M. mexicanus {{like many}} ant, wasps and bees, is a eusocial insect species. Eusocial insects are {{characterized}} by distinct caste systems, where some individuals breed and most individuals are sterile helpers, and overlapping generations so mother, adult offspring and immature offspring are all living at the same time. In a eusocial colony, an individual is assigned a specialized caste before they become reproductively mature, which makes them behaviorally (and sometimes physiologically) distinct from other castes. The honey pot ants exhibit all of these characteristics within a colony: a queen and males make up the reproductive caste, {{and the rest of}} the individuals are <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> workers.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on their}} {{location}} and altitude, A. pallipes {{can vary from}} 9.05mm-9.21mm in length and are yellow with black maculation. Their head displays {{a range of colors}} of black, yellow and brown. Their bodily terga vary from yellow to brown and black. Their legs and wings are also yellow. There is clear dimorphism between queens (egg-layers) and <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> workers with the former displaying physical superiority and size in 17 of 22 characteristics relating to the head, mesosoma, metasoma and wings. There is also clear dimorphism between ovary development of the two different castes of females. Longer and developed ovaries are seen in queens whereas short, thread-like ovaries are seen in workers. There is a stark absence of no transitional females (workers with developed ovaries) thus showing unambiguous division between castes. Furthermore, what separates workers from queens is the presence of a brown or black stripe on the humeri.|$|E

2500|$|Ant colonies {{consist of}} a queen mother and her offspring, a {{majority}} of which are <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> workers. These workers gather food, tend to the brood and defend the colony, while the queens' main responsibility is to continue laying eggs. [...] Conway surveyed sixty six M. mexicanus nest colonies located near Garden of the Gods, Colorado Springs, CO. He found that a typical nest consisted of about 5,000 ants. Typically, about 75% to 78% {{of the total population}} consisted of workers. About 22 -25% of the colony population consisted of replete workers. In preparation for nuptial flights, nests produce a large number of reproductives. 100-110 males were found in one nest, and 209 queens were found in another.|$|E
50|$|Royal jelly is {{secreted}} {{from the}} glands in {{the heads of}} worker bees and is fed to all bee larvae, whether they are destined to become drones (males), workers (<b>sterile</b> <b>females),</b> or queens (fertile females).

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{physiological}} mechanisms that underlie the cost of reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that stress susceptibility is a cost of reproduction. In one test of our hypothesis, Dro-sophila melanogaster females were exposed to a juvenile hormone analog (methoprene) to stimulate egg production followed by stress assays. A sterile stock of D. melanogaster was employed as a control for reproduction. Exposure of fertile females to methoprene resulted {{in an increase in}} female repro-duction and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and starvation (compared to solvent con-trols). <b>Sterile</b> <b>females</b> did not exhibit a decrease in stress resistance. Mating also stimulated egg production. As a second test of our hypothesis, mated females were compared to virgin females.

50|$|Workers are <b>sterile</b> <b>females</b> {{produced}} by the queen that develop from fertilized, diploid eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females will raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest {{to start their own}} colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.|$|R
5|$|The {{less common}} tigon is {{a cross between}} a lioness and a male tiger. Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth {{inhibiting}} gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150kg (350lb), which is about 10–20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species, and males are <b>sterile.</b> <b>Females</b> are sometimes fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a lion.|$|R
40|$|Post-teneral dietary {{supplements}} {{have been found}} to improve mating performance of male Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (Q-fly) and show considerable promise for enhancement of sterile insect technique (SIT) programmes even when applied within the current 48 h pre-release holding period. However, Q-flies are released as a bisexual strain, and the positive effects of a diet including yeast hydrolysate for males may also boost reproductive development and sexual performance of females. Increased prevalence of mature <b>sterile</b> <b>females</b> can substantially dilute SIT efficacy as mating capacity of sterile males is largely depleted by <b>sterile</b> <b>females</b> rather than the relatively rare wild females. Here, we demonstrate that providing yeast hydrolysate for 48 h after adult emergence, emulating the current pre-release holding period of Q-fly SIT, leads to a significant increase in reproductive development and sexual performance in male Q-flies. In contrast, female Q-flies with access to yeast hydrolysate for 48 h had ovaries that were poorly developed and, particularly at younger ages, were less likely to mate and remate than females with continuous, ad libitum access to yeast hydrolysate. Our findings suggest that addition of yeast hydrolysate into the pre-release diet of Q-flies could be a cost-effective means of releasing a bisexual strain with competitive males but with sexually immature females, thereby rendering it operationally more similar to a unisexual strain. 11 page(s...|$|R

50|$|An ant colony, {{also called}} a formicary, {{is the basic}} unit around which ants {{organize}} their lifecycle. Ant colonies are eusocial, and are very much like those found in other social Hymenoptera, though the various groups of these developed sociality independently through convergent evolution. The typical colony consists {{of one or more}} egg-laying queens, a large number of <b>sterile</b> <b>females</b> (workers, soldiers) and, seasonally, a large number of winged sexual males and females. Periodically, swarms of the winged sexuals (known as alates) depart the nest in great nuptial flights. The males die shortly thereafter, along with most of the females. A small percentage of the females survive to initiate new nests.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifecycle}} lasts {{about one}} year. In early spring, the new queen emerging from hibernation starts a new colony, building an umbrella-shaped nest {{made of a}} papery material and suspended from a single stalk. The queen lays eggs into individual cells. The first generation is composed of infertile female workers. In the next generation, multiple queens are hatched with communal nests, but the other fertile females accept the dominance of a single female and raise offspring cooperatively. Later in summer, the next year's queens are produced, and they mate with males. The newly mated queens hibernate in winter, while old founding queens, workers (<b>sterile</b> <b>females),</b> and males die.|$|R
50|$|Venom {{from the}} bite of a <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> fire ant {{typically}} causes painful red bumps with white pustules on the skin of its victim. It may also cause severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis {{which can lead to}} death. First aid includes external treatments of topical steroid cream and oral medicines of antihistamines.|$|E
50|$|Although male tigons and ligers are <b>sterile,</b> <b>female</b> hybrids {{can produce}} cubs. As with ligers, tiligers grow to a size that is {{typically}} larger {{than either of}} their tiger and lion forebears. Large males can grow up to 400 kg and 3.50 meters in length, while the females may grow up to 250 kg and 3 meters in length.|$|E

50|$|Workers in ant colonies are {{typically}} <b>sterile</b> <b>females</b> {{that do not}} reproduce. F. polyctena is consistent with this model, with almost completely sterile workers that do not lay eggs. This {{is in contrast to}} other Formica species that have workers that actually do reproduce, disrupting the eusocial system. F. polyctena’s high proportion of worker sterility indicates a strict obligate polygynous colony structure that most likely allows for a stable unicoloniality, or the cooperation of several nests. In other words, workers do not have the ability to disrupt the strict social segregation of reproduction by reproducing themselves. Thus they uphold a multi-queen, multi-nest cooperation that may not be advantageous to their genes since they act altruistically toward non-kin.|$|R
40|$|Bumblebees {{and other}} eusocial bees offer a unique {{opportunity}} to analyze the evolution of body size differences between sexes. The workers, being <b>sterile</b> <b>females,</b> are not subject to selection for reproductive function and thus provide a natural control for parsing the effects of selection on reproductive function (i. e., sexual and fecundity selection) from other natural selection. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we explored the allometric relationships among queens, males, and workers in 70 species of bumblebees (Bombus sp.). We found hyperallometry in thorax width for males relative to workers, indicating greater evolutionary divergence of body size in males than in <b>sterile</b> <b>females.</b> This is consistent with the hypothesis that selection for reproductive function, most probably sexual selection, has caused divergence in male size among species. The slope for males on workers was significantly steeper than that for queens on workers and the latter did not depart from isometry, providing further evidence of greater evolutionary divergence in male size than female size, and no evidence that reproductive selection has accelerated divergence of females. We did not detect significant hyperallometry when male size was regressed directly on queen size and our results thus add the genus Bombus to the increasing list of clades that have female-larger sexual size dimorphism and do not conform to Rensch's rule when analyzed according to standard methodology. Nevertheless, by using worker size as a common control, we were able to demonstrate that bumblee species do show the evolutionary pattern underlying Rensch's rule, that being correlated evolution of body size in males and females, but with greater evolutionary divergence in males...|$|R

5000|$|Lillie {{was also}} {{a pioneer in the}} study of sex steroids in sexual differentiation.

Free-martins, <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> cows born without sex organs, were a perplexing issue for cattle ranchers. Lillie found that free-martins formed when twins shared the same placenta. The hormones from the male twin would then be shared with the female, stunting the growth of her reproductive system.|$|E
50|$|S.saevissima, {{similar to}} the other social insects in the order Hymenoptera, is eusocial: an extreme form of kin {{selection}} in which {{members of a group}} willingly give up their reproductive abilities in favor of the reproductive success of their close relatives. For S. saevissima, the workers are all <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> daughters who dedicate their lives to the caring and protection of their future sisters: the broods of the fertile queen (their mother). In eusociality, the sterile ants often perform specialized tasks to effectively care for the reproductive queen, including group defense and self-sacrifices.|$|E
50|$|A {{special case}} of parental {{investment}} is when young do need nourishment and protection, but the genetic {{parents do not}} actually contribute {{in the effort to}} raise their own offspring. For example, in Bombus terrestris, oftentimes <b>sterile</b> <b>female</b> workers will not reproduce on their own, but will raise their mother's brood instead. This is common in social Hymenoptera due to haplodiploidy, whereby males are haploid and females are diploid. This ensures that sisters are more related to each other than they ever would be to their own offspring, incentivizing them to help raise their mother's young over their own.|$|E
