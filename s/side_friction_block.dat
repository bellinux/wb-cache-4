By introducing radial structure factor and circular structure factor concepts, the research characterized the effect of <b>friction</b> <b>block</b> radial and circumferential arrangement on temperature field of the brake disc. A method was proposed for improving heat flow distribution of the brake disc through optimizing the position of the <b>friction</b> <b>block</b> of the brake pad. Structure optimization was conducted on brake pads composed of 5 or 7 circular <b>friction</b> <b>blocks.</b> The result shows that, with the same overall contact area of friction pair, an appropriate brake pad structure can make the friction energy distribute evenly and therefore lowers peak temperature and stress of the brake disc.

METHODS: First of all, a method for distribution between superelevation and <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> factor and a theory for the functional formula of <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> factor in compliance with horizontal radius applied in South Korea and the United States are considered. Especially, design speed of 140 km/h and numerical value of design elements are applied to the theory for the functional formula of <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> factor in AASHTO’s methods. Also, the anxiety EEG upon running speed is measured to reflect ergonomic characteristics through field experiments at seven curve sections of the West Coast Freeway, and this data is applied to graph for the functional formula of <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> factor. RESULTS: Matching <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> factor against the anxiety EEG, the results that a critical points of driver’s anxiety EEG sharply increase locate under existing parabola are figured out.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 64 - 67). Understanding vehicle performance on horizontal curves ics. is needed to improve current design standards. Superelevation distribution methods determine the amount of supererogation that is used on each horizontal curve. The supererogation distribution methodologies currently used in the United States do not provide a clear understanding of the operational characteristics of these methods. These methodologies were developed on the 1930 's, 1940 's, and 1950 's. Since then, roadway, pavement, and vehicle characteristics have greatly evolved. This thesis documents an evaluation of the two supererogation distribution methods recommended in, 4 Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and streets (i. e., Methods 2 and 5, J). Specifically, the focus of this evaluation was on predicting the portion of the driver population experiencing adequate <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand when traveling on a horizontal curve. Because of driver expectancy, adequate <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand should be lower than the comfortable limit and higher than zero. Good design guidelines should provide adequate <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand for the majority of drivers. The results indicated that Method 2 provides adequate <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand for the majority of drivers. Additionally, Method 5 provides <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand below the maximals comfortable <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> limit for a majority of the drivers. However, it was found that Method 5 fails to provide the majority of drivers with positive <b>side</b> <b>friction.</b> The results of this thesis indicate that the portion of drivers experiencing negative <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> increases with increasing curve radius. Also, the portion of drivers experiencing negative <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> decreases with increasing 95 th percentile speed of the facility. Recommendations include investigating crashes related to negative <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand, and considering both fast and slow driver in curve design. Also, Method 5 should be modified to consider the 5 th percentile driver...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{principle}} {{underlying the}} capacity analysis of road segments is that speed decrease as flow increase. The speed decrease with unit flow increase is small at low flows but becomes greater as flows get higher. Near capacity, a small increase in flows {{results in a}} large decrease in speed. According to the 1997 Indonesian Highway Capacity, this relationship has been quantitatively defined for a “standard” case, {{for each type of}} road. Each standard case has standard geometric and environmental characteristics specified. If the characteristics of the road are “better” than the standard case (e. g. : wider than normal carriageway width) the capacity is higher, with higher speeds at a given flow. If the characteristics are “worse” than the standard (e. g. high <b>side</b> <b>friction)</b> the capacity is less and speed at a given flow is lower. Surveys have been carried out at congested urban roads (with high <b>side</b> <b>friction)</b> in the city of Yogyakarta during peak hours, to analyze the effects of the characteristics of urban roads, specially the <b>side</b> <b>friction,</b> in reducing the capacity and speed. It is than compared the results to the capacity and speed predicted by Indonesian HCM. It is also compared the actual speed-flow relationship and that predicted by Indonesian HCM. It is found that the capacity and speed predicted by Indonesian HCM are too high. The effects of <b>side</b> <b>frictions,</b> e. g. : on street parking, city bus stopping anywhere on the roadway (there is no specific bus stop for city bus), exit/entry vehicles and U-turn vehicles are higher than those predicted by Indonesian HCM. It is concluded that, when the <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> is too high, there is a significant different between the actual speed/capacity and that predicted by Indonesian HCM. A new formula has been recommended to improve the Indonesian HCM in calculating the speed and capacity for urban roads with high <b>side</b> <b>friction.</b> However, there is still a need in doing further research to find whether the results of this research only an exception of the IHCM formula or {{there is a need to}} improve IHCM...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the linear mixed model developed for vehicle speed along two-lane two-way rural horizontal curves {{in the outside}} lane. Speed data at each curve was collected at four points along the curve including {{the midpoint of the}} curve for a minimum of 48 hours during weekdays. Vehicle speed was analyzed separately for day and night conditions. The horizontal curves were categorized into different groups using different methods using <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand, radius and pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity. In the speed prediction model, radius, superelevation at the midpoint of the curve, deflection angle, posted speed limit and pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity were used to predict the vehicle speed at the midpoint of the horizontal curve. The regression analysis indicates that all of these variables are statistically significant in predicting the vehicle speed at the midpoint of horizontal curves with a 95 percent confidence interval. The linear model determined that the vehicle speed has a positive relation with the radius of the curve, superelevation and posted speed limit but has a negative relation with the deflection angle and pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity. Curves were categorized based on <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand or radius and retroreflectivity of pavement edgeline marking. ANOVA was used to compare the day and night time speed. The comparisons reveal that vehicle speed at the horizontal curves decreases as the <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand value of the curves increases. Another finding of this research was that even though the posted speed limit is incorporated into the calculation of <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> demand, {{it may be necessary to}} analyze the impact of posted speed limit on vehicle speed for both daytime and nighttime. Previous literature determined that drivers may drive at an unsafe speed during nighttime at high levels of retroreflectivity. The results of this study could not confirm this statement as data from this study suggests that for curves with pavement edgeline marking retroreflectivity greater than 90 mcd/m 2 /lx, the effects of retroreflectivity on speed was determined to be minimal.
