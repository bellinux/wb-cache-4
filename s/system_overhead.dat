40|$|Abstract—Simulation {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{evaluation}} methods in scientific workflow studies. However, existing workflow simulators fail to provide a framework that takes into consideration heterogeneous <b>system</b> <b>overheads</b> and failures. They also lack the support for widely used workflow optimization techniques such as task clustering. In this paper, we introduce WorkflowSim, which extends the existing CloudSim simulator by providing a higher layer of workflow management. We also indicate that to ignore <b>system</b> <b>overheads</b> and failures in simulating scientific workflows could cause significant inaccuracies in the predicted workflow runtime. To further validate its value in promoting other research work, we introduce two promising research areas for which WorkflowSim provides a unique and effective evaluation platform...|$|R

50|$|A massively {{parallel}} high-performance computing (HPC) system is particularly sensitive to operating <b>system</b> <b>overhead.</b> Traditional multi-purpose operating systems {{are designed to}} support {{a wide range of}} usage models and requirements. To support the range of needs, a large number of system processes are provided and are often inter-dependent on each other. The computing overhead of these processes leads to an unpredictable amount of processor time available to a parallel application. A very common parallel programming model {{is referred to as the}} bulk synchronous parallel model which often employs Message Passing Interface (MPI) for communication. The synchronization events are made at specific points in the application code. If one processor takes longer to reach that point than all the other processors, everyone must wait. The overall finish time is increased. Unpredictable operating <b>system</b> <b>overhead</b> is one significant reason a processor might take longer to reach the synchronization point than the others.|$|E
