50|$|The {{structural}} components are, generally, {{the frame}} members, bearings, splines, <b>springs,</b> seals, <b>fasteners</b> and covers. The shape, texture {{and color of}} covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical system and its users.|$|R
50|$|The sleepers, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} bi-bloc sleepers, are U41 twin block reinforced concrete, 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in.) wide, and weigh 245 kg (540 lb) each. They {{are equipped with}} hardware for Nabla RNTC <b>spring</b> <b>fasteners,</b> and a 9 mm (3/8 in.) rubber pad. (Rubber pads are always used under the rail on concrete sleepers, to avoid cracking). Next, a rail threader is used to lift the rails onto their final position on the sleepers. This machine rides on the rails just like the gantry cranes, but can also support itself directly on a sleeper. By doing this, it can lift the rails, and shift them inwards over {{the ends of the}} sleepers, to the proper gauge (standard gauge). It then lowers them onto the rubber sleeper cushions, and workers use a pneumatically operated machine to bolt down the Nabla clips with a predetermined torque. The rails are canted inward at a slope of 1 in 20.|$|R
40|$|Matched pair of washers {{with broad}} surface ramps is locking {{mechanism}} in bayonet plug. It {{can be used}} where threaded <b>springs</b> and <b>fasteners</b> are impractical because of extreme temperatures or other environmental incompatibility. Matched pair of ramped washers is placed on plug and bayonet inserted. Inner slot of one washer matches contour of plug; this washer is stationary. Inner slot of second washer is circular. When second washer is rotated, washers push against bayonet plug, locking it in place. Retaining wire secures plug...|$|R
50|$|NASA makes {{significant}} use {{of touch}} fasteners. Each space shuttle flew equipped with ten thousand inches {{of a special}} fastener made of Teflon loops, polyester hooks, and glass backing. Touch fasteners are widely used, from the astronauts' suits, to anchoring equipment. In the near weightless conditions in orbit, hook and loop fasteners are used to temporarily hold objects and keep them from floating away. A patch is used inside astronauts' helmets where {{it serves as a}} nose scratcher. During mealtimes astronauts use trays that attach to their thighs using <b>springs</b> and <b>fasteners.</b>|$|R
50|$|Snap-together {{connectors}} {{have been}} used for thousands of years. The first ones were metal. Some of the oldest snap-fits found are snap fasteners, or buttons, shown on the Chinese Terracotta Army featuring soldiers from the late Warring States Period. Metal snap <b>fasteners,</b> <b>spring</b> clips, and other snap-type connectors are still in broad use today.|$|R
50|$|Stay rods {{are used}} for {{relieving}} weights on a higher elevation. These systems are particularly useful to control movements caused by wind or tree growth, however they are the used less often, due to the natural limits of the systems. Higher elevation and more branches tailing off decreases capacity and increases wind sensibility.As building materials for hanging are used ropes, wire cables, tension <b>fasteners,</b> <b>springs</b> etc.|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{response}} of timber frame multi-storey buildings, considering the nonlinear behavior of metal fastener joints, was herein investigated. A refined numerical model {{to simulate the}} actual behavior of buildings was developed using one dimensional elements for beams and columns, two dimensional elements for bracing panels and nonlinear <b>springs</b> for <b>fastener</b> connections. The characteristics of the springs were derived {{from the results of}} tests carried out on single connectors or from detailed numerical simulations. In these analyses, the actual constitutive relationships for the materials were used. The push over analysis allows to determine the seismic capacity curve of the building and to assess the behavior factor that have {{to be used in the}} seismic design based on the linear static analysis. A push over analysis of a two storey frame building was carried out to evidence the applicability of the numerical model...|$|R
50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension pin or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining <b>fastener.</b> <b>Spring</b> pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
40|$|A {{quick connect}} {{fastener}} and {{method of use}} is presented wherein the quick connect fastener is suitable for replacing available bolts and screws, the quick connect fastener being capable of installation by simply pushing a threaded portion of the connector into a member receptacle hole, the inventive apparatus being comprised of an externally threaded fastener having a threaded portion slidably mounted upon a stud or bolt shaft, wherein the externally threaded fastener portion is expandable by a preloaded <b>spring</b> member. The <b>fastener,</b> upon contact with the member receptacle hole, has the capacity of presenting cylindrical threads of a reduced diameter for insertion purposes and once inserted into the receiving threads of the receptacle member hole, are expandable for engagement of the receptacle hole threads forming a quick connect of the fastener and the member to be fastened, the quick connect fastener can be further secured by rotation after insertion, {{even to the point}} of locking engagement, the quick connect fastener being disengagable only by reverse rotation of the mated thread engagement...|$|R
40|$|Design {{is the key}} {{activity}} in the generation of successful products. Without attention to the requirements and specification, generation and selection of a suitable concept and appropriate detailed design and manufacture, products {{will not be able}} to compete effectively in the market place. This book explores the process of design with specific emphasis on mechanical items. This includes consideration of the design and selection of components that involve relative motion to each other such as bearings, shafts, gears, belts, chains, dynamic seals, clutches and brakes. In addition a number of essential machine elements such as <b>fasteners,</b> <b>springs,</b> static seals, casings, sensors and actuators, which allow the implementation of useful devices, are included. The emphasis in the text is on the reader acquiring useful skills and developing understanding. Most applications of design do not result in single answers. This realistic insight has been recognised in the development of the material presented and many of the worked examples and worksheet questions do not have unique solutions. Instead a possible answer is offered to allow the reader to develop their understanding and insight and as confidence and abilities increase, alternative solutions can be explored. The book is supported, if adopted as a course textbook by approximately 2000 lecture slides, worked solutions for worksheet questions and a number of spreadsheets to speed up some of the analysis or design procedures...|$|R
40|$|Cross-laminated timber panels (X-lam) {{are more}} and more used as {{construction}} material for buildings. For a sound and reliable structural analysis in both static and cyclic loading situations, the behaviour of connections between wall panels has to be evaluated. As the Xlam panels are very rigid, these connections are determining significantly the mechanical performance of X-lam buildings. A typical in-plane wall-to-wall connection makes use of an LVL strip that is mounted as an inlay along the edges of two notched panels and is connected to these two panels by single shear fasteners, for instance self-drilling screws. As a consequence, the static and dynamic behaviour of this connection type differs from panels that are directly connected to each other due to the LVL strip and the subsequent double row of single shear fasteners. The LVL-inlay joints have to be modelled as a serial system of single shear <b>fastener</b> <b>springs.</b> Therefore, monotonic and cyclic tests on such connections have been undertaken in order to get input parameters for subsequent design models. Bending angles of fasteners have been measured. A comparison of the test results with dynamic measurements and calculations on a 3 -storey building has resulted in the conclusion that in-plane wall-to-wall panel connections are an important factor in the structural behaviour of X-lam buildings, especially under dynamic loading such as earthquakes. Design procedures dealing with EC 5 and EC 8 concerning this connection type are discussed and their applicability is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{companies}} {{have taken a}} larger interest in quality and it´s economic impact within the company. Having the knowledge that it´s not quality that costs money, but it´s rather the lack of quality. The work immerses itself {{in the field of}} cost of poor quality and the development of key performance indicators. The thesis is performed at Bufab Holding in Värnamo. Bufab Holding is a trading company which mainly buys and sells C-parts. C-parts include fasteners, other small metal-, rubber- or plastic parts such as wires, <b>springs</b> and electronic <b>fasteners.</b> The aim of this thesis was to make a survey of the cost of poor quality and to find key performance indicators (KPI) for cost of poor quality that can be continuously monitored. This work can serve as a basis for other companies within the Bufab group if the company believes that the content of the report can be used. With this aim two issues was created. What is the cost of poor quality that are linked to Bufabs complaints today, and where do they occur? Which key performance indicators can be created, which continuously can be monitored? The work began with a literature study to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} cost of poor quality and the creation of KPI´s. The literature led the writers of this thesis into the methods that were used. Through the data collection, document gathering and given interviews an understanding of the company´s current economic situation. On this basis the company´s claims and processes where analysed with the help of "Seven quality tools". With the help of the piece cost model cost barriers was prepared and the cost of poor quality was calculated. Furthermore KPI´s was created through Lars Sörqvists description of ratio. The cost carriers differed depending on whether it was Bufab who caused the error, if it was a wrong product quality claim or if it was the supplier who caused the error. The cost of poor quality totaled of 4, 7 Mkr. The pareto chart shows that the cause wrong product quality caused the highest costs. The costs of poor quality that where calculated mostly consisted of different labor costs. One of the KPI´s was based on labor cost and the other was based on total costs. Furthermore KPI´s where made of the number of complaints with the base of total number of order lines that have been sent. The company can then use this result to show how good quality the company have when new contracts are negotiated. If the methodology and results are promising, this thesis can be a working model for more companies within the Bufab group. Not all visible costs of poor quality was calculated in this thesis due a lack of time. The thesis also lacks entirely an assessment of the hidden costs of poor quality...|$|R
