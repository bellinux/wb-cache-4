25|$|In a 1992 book, {{sociologist}} Max Dublin {{pointed to}} many past failed predictions of technological progress {{and argued that}} modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate. He also objected to {{what he saw as}} <b>scientism,</b> fanaticism and nihilism by a few in advancing transhumanist causes. Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between Millenarian religions and Communist doctrines.|$|E
30|$|While Cobb {{acknowledges}} this point, {{he tends}} to attribute the demand for transcendence to the West’s theistic roots. But I am unconvinced. Postmodern spirituality is far more a reaction to <b>scientism’s</b> demystification of life and cosmos, than its atheism.|$|R
25|$|Hardin {{is proven}} correct again {{upon his return}} to Terminus City by another Seldon recording, set to play at this date. Though Actionists {{continue}} to hold {{a significant amount of}} power, enough now to control the City Council, an attempt to impeach the Mayor has already failed, and his popularity is renewed among the city's residents. It is also confirmed by Hari Seldon that the Foundation's immediate neighbors, the Four Kingdoms, will now be virtually powerless and incapable of resisting <b>Scientism's</b> advance.|$|R
5000|$|Identifying with Alfred North Whitehead's {{criticism}} of <b>Scientism's</b> [...] "bifurcationism" [...] and [...] "physical reductionism", i.e., the belief that, first, the qualitative {{properties of the}} objects of perception (the [...] "corporeal objects") are ultimately distinct from their respective quantitative properties (the [...] "physical objects" [...] studied by the different sciences); and second, that the physical objects are [...] "in fact" [...] all there is, meaning the corporeal objects are reduced to their physical counterparts, Smith examines critically in his work Cosmos and Transcendence (1984) the Cartesian roots of modern physical sciences.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, Spain saw {{the release}} of the film All'Ombra Della Croce (A la Sombra de la Cruz) {{directed}} by the Italian filmmaker Alessandro Pugno. The film tells the secret story of the children of the chorus who sing every day in the mass. They live in a boarding school inside the monument and receive an education that tries to resist the drift towards secularism and <b>scientism</b> of contemporary Spain and of global society. The film has been awarded with the first prize for the best documentary at Festival de Málaga de Cine Español.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Hayek {{began the}} ‘Abuse of Reason’ project. His {{goal was to}} show how a number of then-popular doctrines and beliefs had a common origin in some {{fundamental}} misconceptions about the social science. In his philosophy of science, which has {{much in common with}} that of his good friend Karl Popper, Hayek was highly critical of what he termed scientism: a false understanding of the methods of science that has been mistakenly forced upon the social sciences, but that is contrary to the practices of genuine science. Usually, <b>scientism</b> involves combining the philosophers' ancient demand for demonstrative justification with the associationists' false view that all scientific explanations are simple two-variable linear relationships.|$|E
25|$|Wienis {{plans to}} launch his {{offensive}} {{on the night of}} his nephew's coronation as king and sole ruler of Anacreon. Hardin attends the coronation ceremony and is arrested, but he has already arranged with Anacreonian High Priest Poly Verisof, who is aware of the true nature of <b>Scientism</b> and is also Terminus's Ambassador to Anacreon, to foster a popular uprising against Wienis. Convincing the Anacreonian populace that an assault against the Foundation and Terminus is blasphemous, Verisof leads an infuriated mob to the royal palace and surrounds it, demanding Hardin's release. Meanwhile, under the leadership of its priest-attendant, Theo Aporat, the crew of the space cruiser mutinies against its commander, Admiral Prince Lefkin, Wienis's son. Lefkin confronts the mutineers and, captured, is forced to broadcast a message to Anacreon demanding Wienis's arrest and threatening a bombardment of the royal palace if that and other demands are not met. Wienis, maddened by his failure, orders Hardin's execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. Attempting and failing, due to a protective energy field, to kill Hardin personally, Wienis commits suicide.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} narratives {{sold at the}} shows: The profit {{potential of}} travelling freak shows meant that proprietors often found themselves needing to differentiate those they displayed from increasing groups of imitators. The scientific narratives helped in this regard, as their use of hard to decipher, scientific-sounding terms embellished the dramatic and spectacular nature of the event, making what the audience saw seem more real to them. Notable segments of the MDA telethon would often mention the scientific, medical and technological accoutrements garnered from donations. Using terms like genetic hybridization and neuromuscular pathways, this contextual language quantified <b>scientism's</b> role in the telethon spectacle by assuring the home viewer that what they were seeing was real.|$|R
40|$|After innumerable {{hours and}} weeks spent adrift {{on the ocean}} of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) literature, searching for answers among the {{biological}} and behavioural social sciences, an infuriating amount of questions with no answers remained. Far from scientific experts and their de-contextualized truth claims, the voice of one young man, plucked us from their spider?s web. When posed the question ?what?s life with ADHD like?? he responded in kind, asking, ?how does an elephant tell a mouse what it?s {{like to be an}} elephant?? Apparently an ?insider? experiences barriers, just like an ?outsider?, each seeking a way out and in. One can recognize the privileged nature of experiential knowledge (Beresford, 2003), and still appreciate that developmentally generative social interactions depend upon shared systems of meaning (Gergen, 1994). Realising ?<b>scientisms?</b> (Thomas, 2009) inability to explicate either began the construction of the student voice methodology delineated in this paper. Student voice (i. e., voice) poses significant challenges and transformative potentials (Bragg, 2007); it is further problematized, and necessary, when it involves students with ADHD. Voice is inherently about power and knowledge (Thomas, 2011). As such, the social meaning of ADHD (Singh, 2012) must be considered to avoid re-victimizing the voices of students with ADHD (i. e., ADHD voice) or reproducing conventional knowledge (Fielding, 2004). This paper provides a pertinent analysis of voice methodology, and the limitations in prior ADHD voice research. The theoretical framework for the current study will also be explained, that is, the construction of a ?counter-discourse? to engage in meaningful dialogue (Taylor & Robinson, 2009) ...|$|R
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? And how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow <b>Scientism</b> on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{have been in}} {{dialogue}} for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting {{with the natural world}} may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, some have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan. Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture. The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and <b>scientism,</b> and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike. Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity. It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.|$|E

[...] He also states how the Babylonian-like location uses its demigods to control its people through <b>scientism,</b> technicism, and economism. [...] The final track from Achtung Baby, [...] "Love Is Blindness", is described as [...] "an interpretive bridge into the land of Zooropa", which Vagacs explains is the setting for the album, as well as the setting for songs on U2's following album, Pop.

2500|$|... 1951 – Isaac Asimov's {{science fiction}} novel Foundation (consisting mostly of stories {{originally}} published between 1942 and 1944) is published. In this novel, the first {{novel of the}} Foundation series, the Foundation on Terminus, guided by Psychohistory, invents a religion called <b>Scientism</b> which has an atomic priesthood based on the scientific use of atomic energy to pacify, impress, and control the masses of the barbarian inhabitants of the stellar kingdoms surrounding Terminus as the Galactic Empire breaks up.|$|E
2500|$|Frankfurt School theorists {{explicitly}} linked up {{with the}} critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, in which the term critique meant philosophical reflection on the limits of claims made for certain kinds of knowledge and direct connection between such critique and the emphasis on moral autonomy as opposed to traditionally deterministic and static theories of human action. In an intellectual context defined by dogmatic positivism and <b>scientism</b> {{on the one hand}} and dogmatic [...] "scientific socialism" [...] on the other, critical theorists intended to rehabilitate Marx's ideas through a philosophically critical approach.|$|E
2500|$|Negulescu's {{publishing}} debut came in 1892, with {{a metaphysical}} essay, Critica apriorismului și a empirismului ("A Critique of Apriorism and Empiricism"), earning him the Romanian Academy award in philosophy. The title indicates {{the two main}} philosophical currents rejected by Negulescu, who sought a middle road between transcendental idealism and resurgent anti-realism, finalism, and theism. He found it in [...] "realistic empiricism", a brand of monism, evolutionism and <b>scientism</b> that quoted heavily from Herbert Spencer. His monistic outlook fell short of classical positivism and historical materialism, since it rehabilitated metaphysical inquiry as a legitimate pursuit. Various authors have regretfully noted that Negulescu never truly developed his tentative metaphysical system, which appeared to them inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein's {{religious}} faith and {{his relationship with}} Christianity and religion, in general (for which he professed a sincere and devoted reverence) would change over time, much like his philosophical ideas. In 1912, Wittgenstein wrote to Russell saying that Mozart and Beethoven were the actual sons of God. However, Wittgenstein resisted formal religion, saying {{it was hard for}} him to [...] "bend the knee", though his grandfather's beliefs continued to influence Wittgenstein—as he famously said, [...] "I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view". Wittgenstein referred to Augustine of Hippo in his Philosophical Investigations. Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows fundamental alignment with religious discourse. For example, Wittgenstein would become one of the century's fiercest critics of <b>Scientism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Călinescu sees Zarifopol a man {{of little}} {{classical}} culture, his [...] "obviously German method" [...] being more akin to the sociology of literature. Such verdicts were nuanced by another literary historian, Alexandru Dima, who suggests that Zarifopol did have contribution to the scholarly study of aesthetics, one which [...] "imposes itself even against his own wish." [...] Zarifopol's rejection of <b>scientism</b> and historicism had deep roots in Junimism and Neo-Kantianism, but Zarifopol also criticized Kantian assumptions about the sublime, finding them too indebted to ethical imperatives. As noted by Dima, his attachment to phenomenology was [...] "at the very least formal". According to Balotă, his applications of the art for art's sake principle show that, despite his own claims to the contrary, Zarifopol borrowed his poetics from Henri Brémond, Paul Valéry, and Stéphane Mallarmé.|$|E

2500|$|Although celebrated at an {{official}} level, Negulescu was losing {{the respect of}} his students, who visited him in his salon and heard him speak for hours. One of them, the diarist Jeni Acterian, complained that the Negulescu home was [...] "sinister". The professor himself, she argued, was [...] "smart" [...] but [...] "dry to the bone", his voice [...] "raucous and monotonous". By his own standards, Negulescu insisted that a professor's job was not primarily about transmitting information, but about [...] "advancing the science." [...] Also a student of his, Eliade recalled him as an [...] "honest" [...] man of great [...] "self-discipline", but generally [...] "colorless". The target of his jibes against metaphysics, he argued that Negulescu's <b>scientism</b> was most of all shaped by popular science. They quarreled most bitterly about Eliade's study of Indian philosophy, which Negulescu refused to allow in his university.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Nixon Administration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had written about. Until then, the USDA was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting {{the concerns of the}} agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a conflict of interest, since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as [...] "the extended shadow of Silent Spring". Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcement of the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was directly related to Carson's work. Contrary to the position of the pesticide industry, the DDT phase-out action taken by the EPA (led by William Ruckelshaus) implied {{that there was no way}} to adequately regulate DDT use. Ruckelshaus' conclusion was that DDT could not be used safely. History professor Gary Kroll wrote, [...] "Rachel Carson's Silent Spring played a large role in articulating ecology as a 'subversive subject'as a perspective that cuts against the grain of materialism, <b>scientism,</b> and the technologically engineered control of nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} post-modern anthropologists {{are increasingly}} engaging {{with the concept}} of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of <b>scientism,</b> and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour, these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to [...] "animate" [...] the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our [...] "professional subcultures," [...] which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are [...] "approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists." [...] These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.|$|E
2500|$|Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems {{referred}} {{to the role of}} the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge. The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while <b>scientism,</b> a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies. However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that [...] "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. [...] Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{discussion}} in England was over by 1696, {{and yet it}} seems to have fired Swift's imagination. Swift saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general ways of looking at the world (see the historical background, below, for some of the senses in which [...] "new men" [...] and [...] "ancients" [...] might be understood). The Tale of a Tub attacks all who praise modernity over classical learning. Temple had done as much, but Swift, unlike Temple, has no praise for the classical world, either. There is no normative value in Rome, no lost English glen, no hearth ember to be invoked against the hubris of modern <b>scientism.</b> Some critics have seen in Swift's reluctance to praise mankind in any age proof of his misanthropy, and others have detected in it an overarching hatred of pride. [...] At the same time, the Tale revived the Quarrel of Ancients and Moderns at least enough to prompt Wotton to come out with a new edition of his pamphlet attacking Temple, and he appended to it an essay against the author of A Tale of a Tub. [...] Swift was able to cut pieces from Wotton's [...] "Answer" [...] to include in the fifth edition of the Tale as [...] "Notes" [...] {{at the bottom of the}} page. [...] Swift's satire also gave something of a framework for other satirists in the Scriblerian circle, and Modern vs. Ancient is picked up as one distinction between political and cultural forces.|$|E

Of Boston, with its circles of social mummies, swathed in cerements harder than brass--its bloodless religion, (Unitarianism,) its complacent vanity of <b>scientism</b> and literature, lots of grammatical correctness, mere knowledge, (always wearisome, in itself)--its zealous abstractions, ghosts of reforms--I should say, (ever admitting its business powers, its sharp, almost demoniac, intellect, and no lack, in its own way, of courage and generosity)--there is, at present, little of cheering, satisfying sign.

Poetry, so largely hitherto and even at present wedded to children's tales, and to mere amorousness, upholstery and superficial rhyme, will have to accept, and, while not denying the past, nor the themes of the past, will be revivified by this tremendous innovation, the kosmic spirit, which must henceforth, in my opinion, be the background and underlying impetus, more or less visible, of all first-class songs.|$|E
