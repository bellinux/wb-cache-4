2500|$|RGB is {{also the}} term {{referring}} to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry. [...] It consists of three signals—red, green, and blue—carried on three separate cables/pins. RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS-170 and RS-343 standards for monochrome video. This type of video signal is widely used in Europe {{since it is the}} best quality signal that can be carried on the standard <b>SCART</b> <b>connector.</b> This signal is known as RGBS (4 BNC/RCA terminated cables exist as well), but it is directly compatible [...] with RGBHV used for computer monitors (usually carried on 15-pin cables terminated with 15-pin D-sub or 5 BNC connectors), [...] which carries separate horizontal and vertical sync signals.|$|E

50|$|In many European Union countries, S-Video is {{less common}} {{because of the}} {{dominance}} of <b>SCART</b> <b>connectors,</b> which are present on most existing televisions. It is possible for a player to output S-Video over SCART, but televisions' <b>SCART</b> <b>connectors</b> are not necessarily wired to accept it, and if not the display would show only a monochrome image. In this case it is sometimes possible to modify the SCART adapter cable to make it work.|$|R
5000|$|However, this {{no longer}} works when S-Video signals are used. As {{straight}} links (RGB Red and Blue up) were re-purposed to carry chrominance information, the S-Video pinouts are different for [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] <b>SCART</b> <b>connectors.</b> Further, {{they are often}} not fully implemented.|$|R

50|$|Before HD {{television}} {{became a}} standard, nearly all TV sets, VCRs, and DVD players sold in Europe had <b>SCART</b> <b>connectors,</b> although these are sometimes supplemented by RCA and/or RF connectors. SCART-RCA adapters also exist, which usually allow input of composite video and stereo audio. Outside Europe, separate RCA connectors are usually used, supplemented by RF connectors for backward compatibility and simplicity. Although mini-DIN connectors {{are used for}} S-Video connections, composite video, component video, and analog audio (mono or stereo) all use RCA connectors unless the signals are sent via SCART. In the digital realm, however, combined A/V connectors are gaining ground; HDMI is commonly used today for consumer electronics, and DisplayPort, a potential competitor to HDMI, is often found on home computers and peripherals.|$|R
50|$|AV.link, {{also known}} under the trade names nexTViewLink, SmartLink, Q-Link, EasyLink, etc., is a {{protocol}} to carry control information between audio-visual devices connected via the <b>SCART</b> (EIA Multiport) <b>connector.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most TVs {{currently}} sold in SECAM countries support both SECAM and PAL, {{and more}} recently composite video NTSC as well (though not usually broadcast NTSC, that is, they cannot accept a broadcast signal from an antenna). Although the older analog camcorders (VHS, VHS-C) were produced in SECAM versions, none of the 8 mm or Hi-band models (S-VHS, S-VHS-C, and Hi-8) recorded it directly. Camcorders and VCRs of these standards sold in SECAM countries are internally PAL. They use an internal SECAM to PAL converter for recording of broadcast TV transmitted in SECAM. The result could be converted back to SECAM in some models; most people buying such expensive equipment would have a multistandard TV set and as such would not need a conversion. Digital camcorders or DVD players (with the exception of some early models) do not accept or output a SECAM analog signal. However, this is of dwindling importance: since 1980 most European domestic video equipment uses French-originated <b>SCART</b> <b>connectors,</b> allowing the transmission of RGB signals between devices. This eliminates the legacy of PAL, SECAM, and NTSC color sub carrier standards.|$|R
50|$|A SuperGun {{contains}} {{the inner workings}} of a standard arcade videogame cabinet inside a small plastic or metal box. A SuperGun plugs in a JAMMA board and usually provides at least RGB output (the native output of arcade games) sometimes through an <b>SCART</b> <b>connector.</b> Since the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> is not common on televisions in North America, frequently a supergun will also convert the RGB signal into NTSC composite video, S-video, Component Video or VGA signals, with varying degrees of quality.|$|E

50|$|SCART {{connections}} generally {{offer the}} best quality video at standard-definition, due {{to the use of}} pure RGB signalling (although composite and S-Video may alternatively be offered over a <b>SCART</b> <b>connector).</b> SCART provides video and audio in one connection.|$|E

50|$|VHF/UHF TV tuners {{are rarely}} found as a {{separate}} component, but are incorporated into television sets. Cable boxes and other set top boxes contain tuners for digital TV services, and send their output via <b>SCART</b> or other <b>connector,</b> or using an RF modulator (typically on channel 36 in Europe and channel 3/4 in North America) to TV receivers that do not natively support the services. They provide outputs via composite, S-video, or component video. Many {{can be used with}} video monitors that do not have a TV tuner or direct video input. They are often part of a VCR or digital video recorder (DVR, PVR). Many home computers in the 1970s and 1980s used an RF modulator to connect to a TV set.|$|R
50|$|The RGB SCART cable {{provides}} {{a better quality}} picture than RF, composite or S-Video cables. It utilizes the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> standard and is sold in Europe only. Operates at 576i/50 Hz or 480i/60 Hz. This cable is only compatible with PAL GameCubes.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, a {{set-top box}} does not {{necessarily}} contain a tuner of its own. A box connected to a television (or VCR) <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> is fed with the baseband television signal from the set's tuner, and can have the television display the returned processed signal instead.|$|E

The MonoMouse is shaped like an oversized computer mouse and connects to any television through either the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> in Europe or the RCA connector {{in the rest of}} the world.|$|E
50|$|There was a DM 5600 {{and also}} a DM 5620 model. The only {{difference}} being that the DM 5620 included an Ethernet port.Otherwise, the DM 56X0 models were a cut down version of the DM 7000 without an IDE interface. They did, however, include an RF modulator allowing them {{to be used with}} older TVs that lack a <b>SCART</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sync-on-composite: The {{connector}} {{carries a}} standard {{composite video signal}} along with the RGB components, for use with devices that cannot process RGB signals. For devices that do understand RGB, the sync component of that composite signal is used along with the color information from the RGB lines. This arrangement {{is found in the}} <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> in common use in Europe and some other PAL/SECAM areas.|$|E
50|$|All modes are paletted, with a 16-entry CLUT {{selecting}} from {{a palette}} of 128 colours. Palette entries consist of 2 bits {{for each of the}} red, green and blue components as well as an extra bit which slightly increases the intensity of all three components. The machine's non-standard <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> includes signals to drive a TTL-style monitor, in which case the total palette of colours is reduced to 16.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that there}} is also a Japanese version of the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector,</b> which is {{referred}} to as the Japanese RGB-21 connector, EIAJ TTC-003, or simply JP-21. This version of SCART uses similar signals and the same connector, but it has a different pinout. When using RGB video, the red channel uses the same pins in both standards, so red video with no audio is indicative of mismatching JP-21 SCART with EuroSCART ...|$|E
50|$|In case of {{analogue}} pay-TV, {{this approach}} avoided {{the need for}} a second remote control. The use of digital television signals in more modern pay-TV schemes requires that decoding take place before the digital-to-analogue conversion step, rendering the video outputs of an analogue <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> no longer suitable for interconnection to decryption hardware. Standards such as DVB's Common Interface and ATSC's CableCARD therefore use a PCMCIA-like card inserted as part of the digital signal path as their alternative to a tuner-equipped set-top box.|$|E
50|$|The various RGB (red, green, blue) analog {{component}} video standards (e.g., RGBS, RGBHV, RGsB) use no compression and impose no real limit on color depth or resolution, but require large bandwidth {{to carry the}} signal and contain much redundant data since each channel typically includes {{much of the same}} black-and-white image. Most modern computers offer this signal via a VGA port. Many televisions, especially in Europe, utilize RGB via the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector.</b> All arcade games, other than early vector and black-and-white games, use RGB monitors.|$|E
50|$|The signals {{carried by}} SCART include both {{composite}} and RGB (with composite synchronisation) video, stereo audio input/output and digital signalling. The standard was extended {{at the end}} of the 1980s to support the new S-Video signals. A TV can be awakened from standby mode, and it can automatically switch to appropriate AV channel, when the device attached to it through a <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> is turned on. SCART connection was also used for high definition signals like 720i, 720p, 1080i, 1080p with YPbPr connection by some manufacturers, but to the present day this connection is very scarce due to the advent of HDMI.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> first {{appeared}} on TVs in 1977. It became compulsory on new TVs sold in France from January 1980, and since 1989/1990 in eastern Europe, such as Poland. The actual French legal ruling was published 7 February 1980 and then rescinded 3 July 2015. SCART is actually {{the name of the}} French organisation that created the connector in 1970. The related European standard EN 50049 has been then refined and published in 1978 by CENELEC, calling it peritelevision but it's commonly called by the abbreviation péritel in French. The standard got several amendments and at least 2 major revisions, approved by CENELEC 13 November 1988 (EN 50049-1:1989) and 1st July 1997 (EN 50049-1:1997).|$|E
50|$|Quality {{differences}} exist in SCART cables. While a proper SCART cable uses miniature coaxial cables for the video signals, cheap SCART cables often use plain wires for all signals, {{resulting in a}} loss of image quality and greatly reducing the maximum cable length. A common problem on a cheap SCART cable is that a TV outputs a composite video signal from its internal tuner and this is induced or cross-talked onto an incoming video signal due to inadequate or non-existent screening; the result is ghostly images or shimmering superimposed on the incoming signal. To non-destructively verify if a SCART cable uses coaxial cables, unscrew the strain relief at the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> and fold open the plastic shell.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to introduce combined audio/video connectors for direct signals, {{but in the}} analog realm none of these has ever become common, {{with the exception of}} Europe where the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> is very successful. [...] For a time the 5-pin DIN connector was popular for bi-directional stereo connection between A/V equipment, but it has been entirely displaced on modern consumer devices. Though RF modulators inherently transmit combined A/V signals in video applications, they depend on broadcast television systems and RF connectors which are not universal worldwide; RF signals are also generally inferior to direct signals due to protocol conversion and the RF limitations of the three major analog TV systems (NTSC, PAL and SECAM).|$|E

50|$|The DM 600 PVR is {{the same}} small size as the DM 500 but {{includes}} an IDE interface allowing to add an internal 2.5 in laptop-type hard disk drive, the box will only recognise 5600rpm drives. On the outside it adds an S-Video output connector and an analog modem port. It is built around the same IBM STBx25xx integrated controller, but features 32 MiB of flash and 96 MiB of RAM, of which 64 MiB are user-accessible. It is possible to change the tuner module, selecting between Satellite, Terrestrial and Cable versions. There is still just one <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> and no 7-segment LED display, just 2 status LEDs. The provided remote control unit {{is the same}} one supplied with the 7000, 7020 and 7025 and allows one to control the TV set as well.|$|E
50|$|The JVC D-VHS deck {{released}} in the UK, was not a bitstream recorder, although it did have a FireWire input. Instead it is best {{thought of as a}} digital recorder for traditional analog inputs such as domestic analog TV and digiboxes for digital broadcasts. The deck was able to record D-VHS signals onto S-VHS tapes, which made it a cost-effective source of high quality domestic recordings (USA version also allows use of cheaper S-VHS media). Pictures were noticeably superior to S-VHS and were essentially transparent when compared to an off-air source. Using the LS3 mode, approximately 17.25 hours of digital video could be stored on a S-VHS E-240. The deck's biggest shortcomings were the lack of a DV output and, perhaps more crucially, the lack of RGB input via the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector.</b> NTSC versions had component outputs.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high signal voltages used in SCART, [...] "hot plugging" [...] (connecting or disconnecting devices while they are on) is not recommended. Although there is no risk of personal injury, {{there is the possibility}} of damaging electronics within the devices if the connector is inserted improperly. Also, since many TVs are Class II (double-insulated) rather than earthed, the large exposed shield on the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> will be held at approximately half mains voltage if it is plugged into a powered TV with the other end unplugged. If the cable is then plugged into an earthed device with a metal case, inadvertent contact with the SCART cable shield while the earthed device is touched with the other hand can cause a painful electric shock. For this reason the device end of the cable should always be plugged in first and the TV end plugged in last.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe (but {{not most}} other PAL areas), SCART {{connectors}} are typically used, which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals (RGB can be progressive, {{but not all}} DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C (S-Video), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog RGB component signal offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to YPbPr component video. However, analog RGB and S-Video signals can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no switching mode exists for S-Video. (A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the <b>SCART</b> <b>connector</b> intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary. (Hypothetically, unlike RGB component, YPbPr component signals and S-Video Y/C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously, since they share the luminance (Y) component.) ...|$|E
