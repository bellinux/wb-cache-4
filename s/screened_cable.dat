50|$|PROFIBUS DP uses two core <b>screened</b> <b>cable</b> with a violet sheath, {{and runs}} at speeds between 9.6kbit/s and 12Mbit/s.

If systems change slowly then lower communication speed is suitable, and if the systems change quickly then effective communication will happen through faster speed. The RS485 balanced transmission used in PROFIBUS DP only allows 126 devices to be connected at once; however, more devices can be connected or the network expanded {{with the use of}} hubs or repeaters.|$|E
50|$|The {{moving parts}} and hinges can wear out or break. The most serious common problem arose {{because of a}} design fault in the <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> where tooling holes caused {{unnecessary}} stressing due to additional bending of the cable at this point each time the Psion Series 5 was opened or closed and eventually leading to failure of the cable, which caused a serious display malfunction {{and the appearance of}} vertical lines on the <b>screen.</b> The <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> to the Psion Series 5 was more durable than the <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> of the Psion Series 5mx. There was an after-market cable available for the 5mx which aimed to eliminate this problem (see Psionflexi in the 'External links' below).|$|R

5000|$|If, for example, a {{domestic}} HiFi system has a grounded turntable and a grounded preamplifier {{connected by a}} thin <b>screened</b> <b>cable</b> (or cables, in a stereo system) using phono connectors, the cross-section of copper in the cable screen(s) {{is likely to be}} less than that of the protective ground conductors for the turntable and the preamplifier. So, when a current is induced in the loop, there will be a voltage drop along the signal ground return. This is directly additive to the wanted signal, and will result in objectionable hum. For instance, if a current [...] of 1mA at the local power frequency is induced in the ground loop, and the resistance [...] of the screen of the signal cable is 100 milliohms, the voltage drop will be [...] = 100 microvolts. This is a significant fraction of the output voltage of a moving coil pickup cartridge, and a truly objectionable hum will result.|$|E
5000|$|Part of {{the cost}} went towards wiring up the new Square three coffee bar with URE speakers. This was the {{original}} food bar, before the Hexagon was built, however {{with the advent of}} the Square four coffee bar in 1980 it was closed and used as a lecture room. The Square Four coffee bar was wired with twin speakers in the ceiling, a home built amp, an outside broadcast socket for URE's totally unique [...] "network" [...] sockets. By 1989 a new coffee bar was mooted - the old Square 3 rooms: in a weekend long operation after the coffee bar was finished by estates, URE members put speakers over the ceiling tiles, and then ran a single <b>screened</b> <b>cable</b> under the podia (an operation involving a member walking 20 feet (6.3m) above the ground on a single cable tray), although the speakers were later cut into ceiling tiles, and then run through a single 100 volt transformer. The Square three coffee bar later closed, but in 2006 became what is now called Food on Three, still with the student radio station on speakers in the ceiling. The Square Four coffee bar shut in 1989, and became tutorial rooms, but reopened as SXPress in 2000, however no attempt has been made to put speakers back here, despite the permanent landline.|$|E

For reasons of economy and ease of construction modern <b>cables</b> increasingly use <b>screens</b> comprised of sparsely spaced conductors. The electrical relationship between a screen manufactured using this construction and the core it surrounds is markedly different {{to the relationship between}} a solid coaxial screen and the core it surrounds. The ability of a <b>cable</b> <b>screen</b> to return current during a fault situation is significantly dependent on its relationship with the core carrying the fault energy and has significant impact on the performance of the earthing systems involved.

50|$|Early {{systems could}} have custom graphics—or no graphics—depending upon {{the whims of}} the artist. Serge adopted a series of {{geometric}} designs denoting signal types, input, outputs, and triggers. Colored 4 mm sockets were used for most connections - blue, black, and red jacks for (unipolar) control voltages, bipolar signals (NOT necessarily AC coupled) and pulse/gate signals respectively, although these were not rigidly enforced. Later, other colors were introduced, e.g. yellow for triggers. By keeping output impedances low, Serge largely avoided the need for <b>screened</b> <b>cables.</b> 3.5 mm sockets were used for some audio interfacing to the outside World.|$|R
50|$|A D-sub {{contains}} {{two or more}} parallel rows of pins or sockets usually surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support, ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector or socket. The socket's shield fits tightly inside the plug's shield. Panel mounted connectors usually have threaded nuts that accept screws on the cable end connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a cable end connector if {{it is expected to}} connect to another cable end (see the male DE-9 pictured). When <b>screened</b> <b>cables</b> are used, the shields are connected to the overall <b>screens</b> of the <b>cables.</b> This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole cable and connector system.|$|R

40|$|Power cable {{terminations}} {{are widely used}} in power system networks for a last few decades. A proper design of cable termination is essential in reducing the electric field distribution {{around the end of}} high voltage cable. At the termination of cable, the electric field was usually the highest, for the insulation layer was cut in this place. And with the high electric field at the cutting point, there were surely partial discharge occurs. In order to overcome this issue, some sorts of method were proposed. Stress control geometry method and non-linear properties of Zinc Oxide Microvaristor method have been used in this research. The aim was to find an optimal solution for the electric field distribution. An 11 kV power cable has been modelled for this study by using Finite Elements Method (FEM) computational solution. The model has been used to simulate the electric field distribution in the cable termination. The structure of terminations and the critical parts in this design were also defined through literature. A non-linear grading has been applied to several design of layer insulation. The proposed model was used to covers the point that generate high fields at <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> insulation. Material properties {{play a key role in}} suppresses electric field spread throughout termination area. Based on the switching point of about 1 kV/cm the material changes its conductivity significantly. In this way it prevents the occurrence of electric fields which are above this switching point. Different thicknesses also were introduced to get a better design and economically to produce in cost advantages.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{component of}} underground mining costs stems from ground {{support in the}} form of rock bolts, mesh and <b>screen,</b> <b>cable</b> bolts, and shotcrete. Should any of this support approach or reach failure (stripped or broken cable bolts, severe bagging of screen, large numbers of broken rock bolts, etc.) then the support needs to be rehabilitated. This rehabilitation is often much more expensive than the initial support installation, due not just to the cost of the support, but to loss of access, down-time of that area of the mine, potential for injuries, and possible lost mining revenues. Many mines use instrumentation in critical infrastructure, such as haulage drifts, crusher stations, intersections, etc., to monitor the displacement of the backs and/or walls, support loads, etc. Data is generally collected by hand from time-to-time and entered into a database, but is analysed only if there is a problem (i. e. reactive engineering). Most mines today also utilize numerical modeling. These models, normally linear-elastic, are often not up to date and modeling is often done only in reaction to a problem. In certain cases modeling of the underground mining environment requires software packages that employ non-linear constitutive models (i. e. models that allow for failure to occur). Linear elastic models unrealistically allow for stresses to build up far beyond those at failure and hence do not redistribute stresses away from failed zones. The challenge with non-linear models is that they require the input o...|$|R
