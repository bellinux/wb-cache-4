5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is {{described}} as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on his lap. To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> main task in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.|$|E
5|$|She {{entered the}} Neutrality Patrol at the {{beginning}} of World War II, and served as a convoy escort for ships to Iceland and Great Britain in the early phase of the war. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> first combat against coastal artillery during Operation Torch around Casablanca in North Africa, and later became a training ship. Late in the war, she moved to the Pacific, and provided naval gunfire support for the invasion of Iwo Jima and later the invasion of Okinawa. Returning to Pearl Harbor for repairs {{until the end of the}} war, she was classified obsolete and was chosen to take part in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. She survived both explosions and the effects of radiation on the ship were studied for several years. She was eventually sunk as a target in 1948. She received three battle stars for her service.|$|E

The Hazens used separate bedrooms, so that was the last <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> of <b>her</b> husband.|$|R

5|$|Wu's {{older brother}} died in 1958, {{her father in}} 1959 and her mother in 1962. At that time the United States {{government}} had severe restrictions on its citizens' ability to travel abroad, so she was not permitted to visit China to attend their funerals. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> uncle Wu Zhou-Zhi and younger brother Wu Chien-Hao again {{on a trip to}} Hong Kong in 1965. After the 1972 Nixon visit to China, {{relations between the two countries}} improved, and she was able to visit China again in 1973. By this time her uncle and brother had perished in the Cultural Revolution, and the tombs of her parents had been destroyed. She was greeted by Chou En-Lai, who personally apologized for the destruction of the tombs. After this, she returned to China a number of times.|$|E
5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

25|$|The Bronze Horseman of {{the title}} was sculpted by Étienne Maurice Falconet and {{completed}} in 1782. Catherine the Great, a German princess that married into the Romanov family, commissioned {{the construction of the}} statue to legitimate her rule and claim to the throne to the Russian people. Catherine came to power through an illegal palace coup after the death of her husband. She had the statue inscribed with the phrase, Петру перьвому Екатерина вторая, лѣта 1782, in both Latin and Russian, meaning Peter the first Catherine the second, both to show reverence to the ruler and indicate where <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> place among Russia’s rulers.|$|E

25|$|Although {{she knew}} her voice was good and she liked the attention, {{becoming}} an actress was her main objective. That desire was made stronger when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> first Broadway play, The Diary of Anne Frank, when she was fourteen. The star in the play was Susan Strasberg, whose acting she wanted to emulate if ever given the chance. To help achieve that goal, Streisand began spending her spare time in the library, studying the biographies of various stage actresses such as Eleanora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition, she began reading novels and plays, including some by Shakespeare and Ibsen, and also on her own, studied the acting theories of Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to prepare her {{daughter}} Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she {{tried to explain to}} her that the next time <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> father he would be in a casket and would not be speaking. When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and told him that his father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis. Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination and asked if he could persuade Jacqueline Kennedy to attend her husband's funeral with him.|$|E
25|$|By her own account, {{she was not}} {{initially}} {{a supporter of the}} French Revolution; her uncle was a firm, if discreet, royalist, and she feared her best friend, a drummer-boy in the Swiss Guard, had been killed during the overthrow of the monarchy, when the National Guard stormed the Tuileries Palace. She joined the counter-revolutionary Federalist uprising in 1793, in a unit of volunteer artillery led by her uncle, now a captain. Captured by the forces of the Republican government, she was encouraged to change sides, and on 9 July 1793, the nineteen-year-old girl enlisted as a cavalry trooper in the Légion des Allobroges under Colonel Pinon. Quickly earning the nickname le petit Sans-Gêne, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> first real battle in the siege of Toulon, where she was wounded for the first time, and first met Napoleon, then a young artillery commander.|$|E

25|$|Beck and Fernandez {{traveled}} to Byron Center Road in Wyoming Township, Michigan, {{a suburb of}} Grand Rapids, where they met and stayed with Delphine Downing, a young widow with a two-year-old daughter. On February 28, Downing became agitated, and Fernandez gave her sleeping pills to calm her. The daughter witnessed Downing's resulting stupor and began to cry, which enraged Beck. Panicked, Beck choked the child but didn't kill her. Fernandez thought Downing would become suspicious if <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> bruised daughter, so he shot the unconscious woman. The couple then stayed for several days in Downing's house. Again enraged by the daughter's crying, Beck drowned her in a basin of water. They buried the bodies in the basement, but suspicious neighbors reported the Downings' disappearances, leading the police {{to arrive at the}} door on March 1, 1949 and arrest Beck and Fernandez.|$|E
25|$|The first {{military}} action in the Azores occurred {{about a year after}} António's crushing defeat at Alcântara. A Spanish fleet of ten warships, commanded by Pedro Valdez, bombarded Angra on 5 July 1581, then began investigating the coast of the island in search of the best landing places. At dawn on 25 July, the first ships loaded with Spanish troops anchored in Salga Bay, about twelve kilometres east of Angra's harbour in the village of Vila de São Sebastião. A coastwatcher, stationed at the cape called Ponta do Coelho, gave the alarm, but when the first Portuguese forces arrived about one thousand Castilians had already landed and had started to sack the surrounding villages. In this phase of the fighting, according to local accounts of the action, a leading role was played by young and pretty Brianda Pereira who, together with other women, attacked the enemy with farm implements when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> house destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Kristiansen's mother testified {{during the}} trial that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> son {{arriving}} and walking in the backyard {{on the evening of}} the murders, and as such could not have been at the murder-site. This statement also matched the measurements in the telecommunication reports since the cell cite connected to Kristiansen's phone was close to his home, a fact Kristiansen's mother couldn't have known about since the cell phone alibi wasn't discovered until the trial was almost over. Furthermore, a witness saw a man together with two girls right before the crime. The description he gave matched Andersen and the victims. He did not see a second man, and it's unlikely that the witness saw Kristiansen instead of Andersen since Kristansen is a short and thin while Andersen is tall and big. Despite extensive public outreach for everyone who was in the area to contact the police, no other people matched this description. This witness, a commercial airline pilot, was not called as witness to the trials. Additional 5 people that heard or saw relevant activity that did not fit the timeline created by the police were not called as witness to the court either.|$|E
