40|$|According to farm records, cultured Haliotis midae (50 - 70 g. abalone⁻¹) {{were growing}} 10 % slower in winter when {{compared}} to summer. This reduction in growth rate also coincided with enlarged gonads. Initial trials showed that there were differences in mean monthly growth rates ranging from 1. 97 – 5. 14 g abalone⁻¹ month⁻¹, and gonad bulk index (GBI) also varied between months (GBI range: 26. 88 ± 12. 87 to 51. 03 ± 34. 47). The investment of energy into gonad tissue growth did not compromise whole body growth as the abalone continued to gain weight throughout the reproductive periods, probably due to gonadal growth. Growth of this size class of abalone was not influenced by water temperature or day length, suggesting favourable on-farm culture conditions (regression analyses, p > 0. 05). There {{is no need to}} implement a seasonal dietary regime. Cultured H. midae were fed artificial diets with different protein sources, including only soya, only fishmeal, a combination of soya and fishmeal, and these were compared to kelp-fed abalone. Kelp-fed abalone grew slower than those fed artificial feeds (p> 0. 05). Gonad growth was the greatest when <b>soya</b> <b>meal</b> was included in the diet (average GBI: 74. 91 ± 23. 31), while the average gonad size of abalone fed the fishmealbased diet had gonads which were 38 % smaller, and kelp-fed abalone had gonads which were 75 % smaller than those of the abalone fed on diets containing <b>soya</b> <b>meal.</b> The increased gonad mass in abalone fed on diets including <b>soya</b> <b>meal</b> could be attributed to phytoestrogenic activity, {{as a result of the}} presence of isoflavones found in the soya plant; this remains to be tested. The use of soya in brood stock diet development is advised. The influence of dietary protein to energy ratio (1. 41 – 2. 46 g MJ⁻¹) on growth and gonad size was tested. Protein and energy levels within the ranges tested (22 and 33 % protein; 13. 5 and 15. 6 MJ kg⁻¹) did not interact to influence growth rates of cultured H. midae. GBI increased from 50. 67 ± 4. 16 to 83. 93 ± 9. 35 units as a function of dietary protein to energy ratio (y = 42. 02 x⁰·⁸¹; r² = 0. 19; regression analysis: F₁¸₃₈ = 8. 9; p = 0. 005). In addition, protein level influenced gonad size, with gonad growth being greater in abalone fed the high protein diet (factorial ANOVA: F₁¸₃₂ = 7. 1, p = 0. 012). Canning yields were reduced by 7 % when the protein content was increased, while increasing the quantity of dietary energy improved canning yields by ~ 6 % (one-way ANOVA: F₁¸₂₈ = 14. 4, p= 0. 001). The present study provided evidence that although growth rates are varying seasonally, reproductive investment is not hindering weight gain. Gonad growth can be influenced if desired by farms, depending on the level of soya inclusion, as well as the protein to energy ratio in the diet. Monthly variation in growth and gonad size, as well as the influence of diet on gonad growth were highlighted, and the implications for farm application and further research were discussed...|$|E

Intakes were maintained high in the diet with 33, 66 or 100 % of protein from rapeseed meal at 93. 5 +/- 7. 7; 93. 0 +/- 5. 0 and 93. 5 +/- 7. 7 g/kg, respectively. The apparent digestibility of rapeseed meal in the ration containing only rapeseed meal was high at 74. 9 +/- 1. 9 % for dry matter, 76. 5 +/- 2. 1 % for organic matter, 69. 9 +/- 3. 9 % for nitrogen, 59. 1 +/- 4. 8 % for ADF and 74. 6 +/- 6. 9 % for ether extract. Dry matter of rapeseed meal was less degradable (57. 8 +/- 5. 0 %) than that of <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> (65. 5 +/- 2. 6 %) or of linseed meal (61. 6 +/- 4. 2 %) but was not as well protected than that of protected <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> (43. 6 +/- 2. 6 %) (P < 0. 001). Similar trends were observed for the degradability of nitrogen (P < 0. 001). Ether extract of rapeseed meal was more degradable than that of linseed meal (P < 0. 001). There were no significant effects of the incorporation rate of rapeseed meal on the pH in the rumen. The fermentations were mainly of the acetate type with usual concentrations of propionate, butyrate, total volatile fatty acids, glucose or alpha amino nitrogen. Ammonia concentration was higher with the control diet and lower with the diet with 100 % of protein from rapeseed meal. Fatty acids of rapeseed meal were more protected against saturation by the rumen microorganisms than in linseed meal. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Effect of intraruminal {{infusions of}} sodium {{bicarbonate}} on {{the rate of}} passage and degradation of dietary proteins in cows given a silage-based diet. Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 42 (4), 287 - 293. Four non-lactating cows, each fitted with a rumen cannula, were given a diet of grass silage, molasses, barley, <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> and a mineral mix (70 : 14 : 9 : 6 : 1 on a dry matter basis) in eight meals a day. Four experimental treatments, consisting of intraruminal infusions of sodium bicarbonate at 0, 300, 600 and 900 g d ? 1 in a 4 ? 4 Latin square design, were used to {{study the effects of}} added bicarbonate on the rumen environment and on the predicted rumen degradability of <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal,</b> rapeseed meal and fishmeal. Mean rumen pH values were 6. 26, 6. 53, 6. 73 and 6. 87 for the control and bicarbonate treatments, respectively; corresponding values for the fractional outflow of rumen liquid were 0. 129, 0. 142, 0. 151 and 0. 153 h? 1 (SED 0. 01; P> 0. 05) and for the fractional outflow rates of Cr-mordanted protein particles 0. 035, 0. 040, 0. 048 and 0. 054 h? 1 (SED 0. 001; P< 0. 01). Sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the disappearance of <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> or rapeseed meal nitrogen from Dacron bags incubated in the rumen, but at the 900 g d? 1 level there was an increased nitrogen disappearance from fishmeal at all incubation times; disappearances after 24 h were 0. 64 and 0. 68 (SED 0. 025; P< 0. 05). Using the values for the disappearance of nitrogen and the outflow rates of Cr-mordanted protein the predicted rumen degradabilities of <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> and rapeseed meal were reduced by about 8 % by the 900 g d ? 1 infusion, but for fishmeal there was no change in degradability since the effects of an increased outflow rate were counter-balanced by an increased rate of loss of nitrogen in the Dacron bag incubations.

The research conducted {{in the year of}} 2015 - 2016 was to design the optimum condition of food safety consideration for feed industries in Indonesia. Feed for livestock was formulated by using corn meal, soya protein, fish meals, rice bran, veterinary drugs, steam, and other ingredients. Growth promotor materials were formulated from vitamin, antibiotics, amino acid, methylene blue, and other trace elements also were added in the formulation. The feed ingredients are potential sources of food safety hazard in feed products. Result of model analysis found the major sources of food safety risks, i. e. 1) veterinary drugs residues (X 1); 2) aflatoxin potential in humid corn meals (X 2), and 3) alfatoxin potential in humid <b>soya</b> <b>meal</b> (X 3). Minimisation model formulated for food safety in feed production was Z = 13. 78 X 1 + 10. 00 X 2 + 7. 67 X 3. The optimisation model by using simplex solution found maximum bioaccumulation value index of 93. 33 per ton feed production. The verification model done for two feed industries and calculated bioaccumulation index were 20. 16 and 24. 43 per ton livestock feed production. The result concluded that the feed produced by both industries have been recommended safe to consume.

Actually, these medicinal seeds were individually incorporated at three percentage levels (1, 3 and 5 %) with basal diet formulated by using fish meal (25 %), <b>soya</b> <b>meal</b> (20 %), groundnut oil cake (15 %), wheat bran (5 %), rice bran (10 %) and sunflower oil (2 %). Tapioca flour (15 %) and egg albumin (7 %) were used as binding agents. Vitamin B-complex with vitamin-C (1 %) was also added. Feed without incorporation of any seed was served as control. These medicinal seeds have acted as appetizer and significantly (P< 0. 05) enhanced the activities of digestive enzymes (protease, amylase and lipase) in S. cumini (5 %) incorporated feed fed prawns followed by P. emblica (5 %), A. indica (1 %) and R. communis (5 %) when compared with control. This led to enhanced food consumption, which in turn significantly increases (P< 0. 05) the concentrations of total protein, amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid. Further, the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants (vitamin-C and E) were also significantly improved (P< 0. 05), which ensures good health of the prawns. Thus, better nutritional indices (survival, growth, and food conversion) were attained. Furthermore, the total haemocyte population was also found to be increased (P< 0. 05), which indicate...|$|E
40|$|Grain legumes, {{especially}} pea and lupine, {{are important}} agricultural crops in Central and Northern Europe. Because {{of the high}} level of protein in their seeds, these species constitute an alternative to <b>soya</b> <b>meal</b> imported from South America. The breeding of new cultivars in a short time is a major problem in pea breeding, particularly since the production of homozygous lines in the DH (doubled haploid) system, as used for cereals, for example, is very difficult. An alternative approach may be the single seed descent (SSD) method. The materials for this study were lines of pea obtained by that method combined with in vitro culture of embryos. This approach enabled 9 generations to be obtained in 2. 5 years. First, SSD lines (F 10) were investigated in a field experiment conducted in a complete randomized design with two replications, in which the dates of flowering and ripening and seed yield per plant were observed. Seventy seven lines out of 120 (64 %) were selected for a subsequent experiment in which F 4 generations of each cross combination were also included. In the second field experiment SSD lines were evaluated for earliness, plant height, seed yield per plot, and 1000 -seed weight. The data were processed by multivariate analysis of variance and related methods, leading to the selection of 16 lines for further breeding experiments. Multivariate analysis can be helpful for breeders in seeking plants with a new favorable complex of yield-forming traits...|$|E

On the Polish market, soybeans come mostly from traditional crops, {{for this reason}} its cultivation is much more expensive than soybeans derived from GM crops. Refuse soybean contains {{a large amount of}} fat that can be used as an additive enriching animal feed fat. It is however essential first soybeans processing. The extrusion process is one of the processing method refused soybean or whole soybeans as a component in extruded blends. The study used with isolated hulled and unhulled soybeans. From the analysis of the results obtained for the extrudates of mixtures with wheat and corn with addition of soya bean grains, it can be concluded that both the cutting strength and the hardness of the extrudates was higher in the case of corn compound. The greatest ratio of expansion was achieved for the extrudates of wheat and unhulled soya bean compound. The highest hardness was obtained by subjecting to extrusion a mixture of unhulled <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> with corn, while introducing <b>meal</b> of hulled <b>soya</b> bean resulted in extrudates with about 70 % lower hardness...|$|R

With this purpose, a total of 450 10 -day-old birds were allocated to 15 cages (30 birds/cage) and received three dietary treatments: a Control diet (C) and two diets (H 1 and H 2) corresponding to 10 % and 15 % H inclusion levels, respectively (H substituted 28. 4 % soya bean oil and 16. 1 % <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> for H 1, and 100 % soya bean oil and 24. 8 % <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> for H 2, respectively). At 28 days of age, quails were slaughtered, carcasses were weighed, breast muscles were then excised from 50 quails/treatment, weighed, and ultimate pH (pHu) and L*, a*, b* colour values were measured. Breast muscles were then cooked to assess cooking loss and meat toughness. For the digestibility trial, a total of 15 28 -day-old quails {{were assigned to the}} three feeding groups. The excreta samples were subjected to chemical and microbiological analysis. The same 15 quails were then simultaneously provided with C and H 2 diets for a 10 -day feed choice trial. Productive performance, mortality and carcass traits were in line with commercial standards and similar in all experimental groups. With the exception of ether extract digestibility, which was lower in H 1 group compared with C and H 2 (P= 0. 0001), apparent digestibility of dry matter, CP, starch and energy did not differ among treatments. Microbial composition of excreta was also comparable among the three groups. Feed choice trial showed that quails did not express a preference toward C or H 2 diets. Breast meat weight and yield did not differ among C, H 1 and H 2 quails. Differently, the inclusion of H meal reduced meat pHu compared with C. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that H. illucens larvae meal can partially replace conventional <b>soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> and <b>soya</b> bean oil in the diet for growing broiler quails, thus confirming to be a promising insect protein source for the feed industry. Further research {{to assess the impact of}} H meal on intestinal morphology as well as on meat quality and sensory profile would be of utmost importance...|$|R

Six isonitrogenous; 40 % crude protein diets were formulated where LSM replaced <b>Soya</b> bean <b>meal</b> (SBM) at 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 % inclusions. Catfish fingerlings (5. 21 ± 0. 14 g) stocked at 25 fish/ 70 liters tanks were fed diets in triplicates three times daily for 112 days. Data from the completely randomized experiment were subjected to ANOVA and correlation analysis was separated at 5 % probability level. Mean weight gain (MWG) and Specific growth rate (SGR) of fish fed 20 % LSM were statistically different (p< 0. 05) from those fish fed LSM at higher inclusion rates. Fish MWG, SGR, PER and FCR significantly (p< 0. 05) correlated negatively with LSM inclusion rates r= - 0. 62,- 0. 57, - 0. 78 and - 0. 64 respectively.
