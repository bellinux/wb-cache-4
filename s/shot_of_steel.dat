50|$|Another {{use of the}} peening {{process is}} to flatten sheet metal and is {{specifically}} used as a primary technique to flatten steel belts used in industrial conveying and pressing operations. In this process a steel belt that has a cross curvature can be flattened by peening the concave surface to stretch it and thereby removing the cross-curvature by equalizing the surface length across the belt between the previously concave and convex surfaces. The <b>shot</b> peening <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> belts is usually achieved by a using specialised equipment and special peening shot.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the influence of post-shot peening on Mo-coating as compared to substrate steel 16 MnCr 5 (according to ZFN- 413 A). <b>Shot</b> peening <b>of</b> carburized <b>steel</b> discs with and without Mo-coating was performed by using Shot size S 230, Almen intensity 0. 42 mm ’A’ and exposure time 96 sec. Tribological properties were analyzed, using pin-on-disc tribometer apparatus, under dry sliding conditions at different specific applied loads, sliding velocities and distance. Typical standardized methods were used for studying of surface integrity parameters (micro-hardness, topography and surface roughness). Surface morphology of the Mo-coating specimens with and without Shot Peening before and after wear was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The results showed that shot peening after Mo-coating has considerable effect on improving wear resistance and because of having low friction coefficient has showed better wear behavior and tribologi cal properties over that of the un-peened Mo-coating...|$|R

40|$|Abstract.
