At the same time, a fleet auxiliary, RFA Boxol, began to pump the 10,000 tons of fuel oil {{into her own}} tanks. As the oil flowed out, Ohio sank lower and lower in the water. The last drops of oil left her and simultaneously her keel settled on the bottom. Her captain, Dudley William Mason, was subsequently awarded the George Cross.|$|R

50|$|On 24 January {{a request}} {{was made to}} the Coxswain of the Cromer Lifeboat, Henry Blogg to go to Great Yarmouth {{to meet with the}} Chief Salvage officer to discuses the {{possibility}} of savaging the marooned SS Meriones of Haisbro Sands. Henry Blogg knew Haisbro Sands better than anyone living and he knew every moment lost went against getting the Meriones off the sands. With this in mind Blogg accompanied the Salvage Officer out to the ship on the salvage tug Richard Lee Barber to assess the situation. The two men were also joined by the marine superintendent, Captain Glazier, of the China Mutual Steam Navigation Company, who were the owners of the SS Meriones. There was a moderate east-north-east wind blowing with a moderate sea. The sky was overcast and misty and it was very cold. The Richard Lee Barber had <b>salvage</b> <b>pumps</b> aboard as it was reported that the ships number six hold was full of water.|$|R
5000|$|Allegedly, Wilson’s final {{idea was}} to fill the ship with cork, which Young {{predicted}} would block the <b>salvage</b> <b>pumps</b> and the [...] "battleship was lost needlessly".At {{the end of the}} summer of 1906, salvage efforts were suspended for the year, with plans to resume them in 1907. However, an inspection of the ship conducted from 1 to 10 October 1906 found that the action of the sea was driving her further ashore and bending and warping her hull so that her seams were beginning to open, her deck planking was coming apart, and her boat davits had collapsed.The Liverpool Salvage Company was given full responsibility for partial salvage.A guard was put aboard to prevent looting; later, the guard was taken off and replaced by men in boats and ashore. By 1907, however, Montagu was in such bad shape that any hope of salvaging her was abandoned. The Western Marine Salvage Company of Penzance completed salvage of the wreck for scrap metal over the next 15 years.|$|R
5000|$|Initial salvage {{operations}} focused on removal of 630,000 litres {{of oil from}} the ship. [...] Removal of the hazardous fuel oil was contested by the salvage firms of Smit Amandla and Tsavliris, both of which claimed <b>salvage</b> contracts. <b>Pumping</b> the fuel took a few weeks during which period the weather remained calm, despite swells that enlarged substantial cracks in the main deck. The coal, which had been loaded in Durban, was eventually removed, eliminating virtually all risk of pollution. The ship's owners, despite abandoning the vessel, opposed selling the coal to defray removal costs.|$|R
5000|$|SS Wyola was a [...] steam tug {{built in}} 1912 by LT Eltringham & Co of South Shields, England for the Swan River Shipping Company of Western Australia. Wyola was 125 ft long between perpendiculars, had {{a beam of}} 24.7 ft, a depth of 13.1 ft and a draught of 14 ft. Her 179 NHP (1,200 horsepower) triple-expansion engine gave Wyola a speed of 11.5 kn.

50|$|In 1981 Wolstanton Colliery stopped coal {{production}} and {{after months of}} <b>salvage</b> work the <b>pumps</b> were turned off in May 1984. This meant that the water present would gradually rise to its natural level and slowly flood the abandoned workings at Wolstanton and then eventually Chatterley Whitfield.

50|$|John Sears {{adopted a}} {{different}} solution {{based on the}} evaporation of seawater in large wooden vats, which he constructed near his Cape Cod home in Dennis, Massachusetts. The process was inefficient and unrewarding at first, but he improved it by making the vats leakproof, providing moveable covers {{to keep out the}} rain and installing a <b>salvaged</b> bilge <b>pump</b> to draw water directly from the sea via leadlined wooden pipes. He profited considerably both from his production improvements and from the increase in the price of salt from 50 cents a bushel to $8 by the time the war finished in 1783. In 1785 he built a windmill to pump the water automatically from the sea.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Augusta" [...] was moored at Palacios, Texas in {{the mid-1950s}} when damaged during a storm and sunk at the pier. The owner at that time {{declined}} to raise the hull and she was sold for <b>salvage.</b> She was <b>pumped</b> out, interior furnishings were removed and the hull pulled up on the shore for final salvage. The shafts, propeller and other fittings were sold for scrap. The hull planking and deck house were salvaged {{for use in the}} construction of other vessels at the Palacios Shipyard.|$|R
50|$|The clipper Cutty Sark {{was given}} to the College in 1938, and was used as a boating station moored off the Greenhithe estate.

The Worcester was used as a training base by the Royal Navy but by 1945 the second Worcester was in a very poor condition, had lost most of her masts and was only kept afloat by a large <b>salvage</b> <b>pump.</b> Happily, after the war, a replacement ship was found {{in the form of the}} Exmouth, which was renamed and became the third and last Worcester. She was an unusual vessel, since she was built in 1904 of steel and iron especially for nautical training and had many advantages over the converted hulks previously used.|$|E

40|$|Challenges {{related to}} {{perfusion}} support of thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair include maintenance of distal aortic perfusion, rapidity of fluid resuscitation, and avoidance of both hypothermia and excessive hemodilution. Using available technology, we have devised a circuit and protocol that addresses these issues. To accomplish such support a bypass circuit consisting of 3 / 8 inch tubing {{connected to a}} centrifugal pump and low-prime heat exchanger was constructed. The circuit was primed via 1 / 4 inch spiked connectors attached to a 3 -liter bag of normal saline. After initial de-airing, the solution was recirculated through this bag. Patients were anticoagulated with 1 mg/kg of heparin prior to initiation of support. Left atrial-descending aorta bypass was used primarily. A cell salvage device was used for autotransfusion. All blood products were delivered via a rapid infusion device. During partial exsanguination, shed blood was not processed, but directed to the rapid infusor for immediate retransfusion. Any packed cells given were washed prior to transfusion. Citrate dextrose solution {{was used as an}} anticoagulant for the cell scavenger. This configuration was used successfully in 50 procedures during an 18 -month period. Use of this low-prime, custom circuit reduced both hemodilution and cost. A connection off the cell <b>salvage</b> <b>pump</b> offers fast retransfusion of shed blood during partial exsanguination. Minimal heparinization and citrate anticoagulation appears to reduce coagulopathy...|$|E
5000|$|The ship's dragheads are 6 m {{wide and}} can dredge between 55 m and 160 m deep. The ship has three hopper {{discharge}} options of pumping ashore by pipeline, dumping through bottom doors or rainbowing. The ship has equipment to dredge almost any material; such as clay, silt, sand and rock. During the Swissair Flight 111 salvage operation, {{a mixture of}} sea water, silt and aircraft pieces was pumped out of the Atlantic Ocean. The ship assisted in the recovery of nearly 98% of the aircraft, with over 144698 kg of aircraft and cargo pieces <b>salvaged.</b> The <b>pump</b> room onboard has two [...] dredge engines {{that can be used}} in series or in parallel with the vessels two 1200 mm suction pipes or combined with a submerged outboard pump. The vessel also has three [...] jet water pumps that are used to agitate subsea material whilst trailing, collapse and liquify hopper cargo for pumping or degassing natural air pockets in the seabed using the Venturi effect.|$|R
50|$|Crew {{size was}} about 120 men {{including}} the complement of divers, made complete with some unique features found onboard. Two fire monitors, capable of pumping out 4000 {{gallons of water}} per minute onto a flaming deck, aided in rescue efforts. A full machine shop allowed patches to be cut and assembled, repairing damaged hulls long enough to return to port for any major repairs. The forward boom could lift up to 20 tons while the one aft, on the fantail, had a maximum lift of 8 tons. Also on the fantail was the Almon Johnson Towing machine which held 2100 feet of 2 inch wire rope capable of a maximum pull of 50 tons.Further, in her salvage holds was an extensive inventory of portable <b>salvage</b> equipment- <b>pumps,</b> generators, and welding machines of various sizes that could be placed wherever needed. Plus, eight complete legs of beach gear, each capable of generating up to 60 tons of pulling power, were maintained onboard. The ships could lift up to 150 tons off {{the bottom of the}} ocean with its main bow rollers and an additional 30 tons on its auxiliary bow rollers. A recompression chamber was available for treating diving related sicknesses and the MK-5 Surface Supplied Diving System was in use.|$|R
50|$|On September 6, 1967, Standard Oil of California's 18,000-ton tanker, SS R. C. Stoner {{was driven}} onto the reef at Wake Island {{by a strong}} southwesterly wind after the ship failed to moor to the two buoys near the harbor entrance. An {{estimated}} 6 million gallons of refined fuel oil, including 5.7 million gallons of aviation fuel, 168,000 gallons of diesel oil and 138,600 gallons of bunker C fuel spilled into the small boat harbor and along the southwestern coast of Wake Island to Peacock Point. Large numbers of fish were stranded and killed by the oil spill, and personnel from the FAA and crewman from the ship cleared the area closest to the spill of dead fish. The U.S. Navy salvage team Harbor Clearance Unit Two and Pacific Fleet Salvage Officer, Commander John B. Orem flew to Wake to assess the situation and by September 13, Navy tugs USS Mataco and USS Wandank, salvage ships USS Conserver and USS Grapple, tanker USS Noxubee, and USCGC Mallow, arrived from Honolulu, Guam and Subic Bay in the Philippines, {{to assist in the}} cleanup and removal of the vessel. At the boat harbor, the <b>salvage</b> team <b>pumped</b> and skimmed oil which they burned each evening in nearby pits. Recovery by the Navy salvage team of the R. C. Stoner and its remaining cargo, however, was hampered by strong winds and heavy seas. On September 16, Super Typhoon Sarah made landfall on Wake Island at peak intensity with winds up to 145-knots, causing widespread damage. The intensity of the storm had the beneficial effect of greatly accelerating the cleanup effort by clearing the harbor and scouring the coast. Oil did remain, however, embedded in the reef's flat crevices and impregnated in the coral. The storm also had broken the wrecked vessel into three sections and, although delayed by rough seas and harassment by blacktip reef sharks, the salvage team used explosives to flatten and sink the remaining portions of the ship that were still above water.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the crew}} and {{passengers}} had abandoned the ship, MSC Flaminia was left drifting in mid-Atlantic. Dutch salvage company Smit International signed a salvage contract for the stricken vessel, but {{the extent of the}} fire was not known until the first salvage tug, Fairmount Expedition, arrived at the scene on 17 July. According to the first reports, the fire was still burning in holds 4, 5 and 6, and the ship had developed a list of about 8.5 degrees {{as a result of the}} firefighting operations, but the engine room, superstructure and aftship were not seriously damaged. A second explosion occurred on the ship on 18 July, but the salvage efforts soon continued. The ship's own firefighting system was also started and the salvage personnel attempted to find the missing crewman. On 20 July, Fairmount Expedition began to tow MSC Flaminia towards Europe while Anglian Sovereign, another salvage tug with specialized firefighting equipment, continued to cool down the fire. On 24 July, it was announced that the fire on board MSC Flaminia was under control and an aerial high definition video, recorded by a helicopter on 26 July, showed the damage to the ship and its containers. By 29 July, the ship had arrived within [...] of the British coast. However, the deteriorating weather prevented the salvage crew from entering the ship, then listing at 10 degrees, on 31 July and she was moved away from the coast. Although the fires had been put out in holds 4, 5 and 6, temperatures in hold 7 were still rising. On 13 August, the salvage efforts restarted but, as no European country had given the ship a permission to enter its coastal waters, MSC Flaminia remained at her waiting position approximately [...] offshore. In addition to extinguishing individual containers, the <b>salvage</b> crew had <b>pumped</b> water from the cargo holds to stabilize the vessel, reducing the list to around 2.5 degrees.|$|R
