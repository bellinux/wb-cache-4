Based on panel data estimations for subsidiaries of European multinational companies with a presence in Spain, the authors found that if the subsidiary located in the <b>springboard</b> <b>country</b> is a springboard subsidiary, its performance increases by 3. 6 %. When the subsidiary has a technological relationship with another subsidiary, its performance increases by 1. 9 %. If the subsidiary that has the technological relationship is a springboard subsidiary located in a <b>springboard</b> <b>country,</b> this increases performance by 1. 8 %. Growth of 1 % in absorption capacity increases a subsidiary's performance by 1. 2 %. Finally, low autonomy reduces the performance of a subsidiary by 34. 4 % compared to independent subsidiaries or those with a high degree of autonomy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a microeconometric {{analysis of the}} distinctive characteristics of springboard subsidiaries that {{have a positive impact}} on the subsidiaries' performance. Based on panel data estimations for subsidiaries of European multinational companies with a presence in Spain, the authors found that if the subsidiary is located in the <b>springboard</b> <b>country,</b> then the performance improvement (increase in profit margin) of the subsidiary is about 49 percentage points. When the Spanish subsidiary is considered a springboard subsidiary, its performance is 7. 7 percentage points higher than the performance of other subsidiaries that are not springboard subsidiaries. If the subsidiary has a technological relationship with another subsidiary, its performance is 6. 7 percentage points higher than the performance of other subsidiaries that do not have a technological relationship. Finally, when the firm has low autonomy, the performance of the subsidiary is 6. 2 percentage points lower than that of firms that are independent or have a high level of autonomy...|$|E
40|$|Background: For Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME), {{international}} {{expansion is}} important strategy for growth. However, considering {{the facts that}} SMEs often are characterized by limited personal and financial resources, and that new international markets pose challenges in terms of differences in for instance culture, language and political systems, international expansion is a risky business. We argue {{that there might be}} an easier way for SMEs to enter challenging markets and regions through establishing in a <b>springboard</b> <b>country.</b> Such a country is characterized by a possibility to in a westernized context accumulate learning about countries {{in the rest of the}} region and also to develop and utilize networks. At the moment, Asia is a rapid developing region and is expected to contribute with two thirds of the worldâ€™s GDP in 2050. Hence, the Asian region provides immense opportunities for companies, however particularly for SMEs, also severe challenges. We argue that Swedish SMEs could learn how to overcome these challenges establishing in the westernized Singapore, hence finding an easier way when entering more difficult Asian countries. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore the phenomenon of SMEs expanding their international activities via a <b>springboard</b> <b>country.</b> This will be done by studying how Swedish SMEs perceive that their establishment in Singapore has affected (1) the development of their networks with other actors in the Asian region, and (2) their accumulation of knowledge and experience regarding doing business in Asia. Method: In order to fulfil the purpose, we have conducted a qualitative multiple case study including seven Swedish SMEs that are established in Singapore. We have primarily used semistructured telephone interviews for our data collection. Conclusion: We found that there is support for the existence of the Springboarding phenomena. We can conclude that Swedish SMEs, by being established in Singapore, can develop and utilize their networks as well as gaining general market knowledge of other countries in the Asian region. We can also see tendencies regarding how these benefits associated with the Singapore establishment can decrease the perceived uncertainties of doing business in other more difficult Asian counties...|$|E
50|$|The first {{president}} of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah attempted to use agricultural wealth as a <b>springboard</b> for the <b>country's</b> overall economic development, Ghanaian agricultural output has consistently fallen since the 1960s. Beginning with the drop in commodity prices in the late 1960s, farmers were faced with fewer incentives to produce {{as well as with}} a general deterioration of necessary infrastructure and services. Farmers have also had to deal with increasingly expensive inputs, such as fertilizer, because of overvaluation of the cedi. Food production has fallen as well, with a decline in the food self-sufficiency ratio from 83 percent in 1961-66 to 71 percent in 1978-80, coupled with a fourfold increase in food imports in the decade prior to 1982. By 1983, when drought hit the region, food shortages were widespread, and export crop production reached an all-time low.|$|R
