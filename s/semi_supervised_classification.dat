Research on Semi Supervised Learning is motivated by the availability of unlabeled examples in abundance even in domains with limited number of labeled examples. In such domains semi supervised classifier uses the results of clustering for classifier development since clustering does not rely only on labeled examples as it groups the objects based on their similarities. In this paper, the authors propose a new algorithm for <b>semi</b> <b>supervised</b> <b>classification</b> namely Semi Supervised Weighted K-Means (SSWKM). In this algorithm, the authors suggest the usage of weighted Euclidean distance metric designed as per the purpose of clustering for estimating the proximity between a pair of points and used it for building semi supervised classifier.

Large variety in adventitia descriptors difficulties its detection and motivates using a classification strategy for selecting {{points on the}} structure. Whatever the set of descriptors used, the selection stage suffers from fake responses due to noise and uncompleted true curves. In order to smooth background noise while strengthening responses, we apply a restricted anisotropic filter that homogenizes grey levels along the image significant structures.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine {{learning}} community to develop better understanding and {{improve the quality of}} classifiers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown {{the state of the art}} performance in <b>semi</b> [...] <b>supervised</b> <b>classification.</b> In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step. Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n^ 3) to O(n^ 2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach. Comment: 39 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

In our old world, learning has been studied either in the unsupervised paradigm which include clustering where all the data is unlabeled, or in the supervised paradigm which include classification where all the data is labeled.
