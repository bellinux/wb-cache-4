5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> voice to use for the character.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|Unexpectedly, this weak push by Młokosiewicz {{and his men}} {{probably}} {{forced the}} Russians to reconsider their plans and postpone any further attacks until the following day. At that moment Paskevich was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> the Poles would do. He feared a Polish counter-attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted. His artillery continued to duel with the Poles, but infantry was withdrawn and Paskevich himself left his forces {{to look for the}} Corps of General Muraviev to the south, somewhere between Szczęśliwice and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E

Or whether it’s regressive and stupid and joyless and monotonous and silly and pointless. In fact, let’s call Kaabil {{for what it}} is: a B-movie with well-known actors. Worse, it’s exacerbated by shoddy CG, fake earnestness and a needless item number." ...|$|R

25|$|By 1952, as {{the funding}} ended, {{the economy of}} every {{participant}} state had surpassed pre-war levels; for all Marshall Plan recipients, output in 1951 was at least 35% higher than in 1938. Over the next two decades, Western Europe enjoyed unprecedented growth and prosperity, but economists are not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> proportion was due directly to the ERP, what proportion indirectly, and how much would have happened without it.|$|E
25|$|Michael realizes Hanna's secret: she is {{illiterate}} and has concealed it {{her whole}} life. The other guards who claim {{she wrote the}} report are lying to place responsibility on Hanna. Michael informs the professor that he has information favourable {{to one of the}} defendants but is not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to do since the defendant herself chose not to disclose the information. Michael arranges a visit with Hanna in prison, but once there he leaves without seeing her.|$|E
25|$|M94, also {{classified}} as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms {{and a bright}} core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the ultraviolet because of a ring of new stars surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a bar that is thus far invisible.|$|E

25|$|The Somerville Circle {{is located}} on the border between Bridgewater Township and Raritan, New Jersey, just {{slightly}} northwest of Somerville. The border runs down Route 28 with Raritan having a slightly larger portion of the circle within its borders. The border bisecting the circle usually causes minor confusion when accidents are reported as drivers are often not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> side of the border they are on and which town's police department has jurisdiction. More traffic accidents occur on the Raritan side of the circle than the Bridgewater side.|$|E

25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> they have or might be buying and therefore what it might be worth.|$|E
25|$|Uranus is {{the third}} largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a {{distance}} of about 2.8billion kilometers (1.7billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the plane of the ecliptic. This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought {{to be the result of}} a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were not at all <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to expect when observing Uranus.|$|E
25|$|Using the few {{scraps of}} {{reliable}} information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, {{to such an}} extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Both Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> is best. Trevize's purpose, faced with the leaders of both first and the Second Foundations and Gaia itself, is to be trusted to make the best decision between the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation's path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., empire); the Second Foundation's path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia's path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part.|$|E
