60|$|This {{finished}} me, and I am sure <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could think}} of nothing nice to say about those inhabitants, for I heard her sigh. We walked side by side up the rose-fringed path and presently arrived at the stoep, where Anscombe, whose hair I had cut very nicely on the previous day, was watching us from his long chair. They looked at each other, and I saw both of them colour a little, out of mere foolishness, I suppose.|$|E
60|$|On {{the third}} {{occasion}} that I saw Isabel she was, as I have said, climbing a tree--and a very creditable tree--for her own private satisfaction. It was a lapse {{from the high}} seriousness of politics, and I perceived <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might regard it as such and attach too much importance to it. I had some difficulty in reassuring her. And it's odd to note now--it has {{never occurred to me}} before--that from that day to this I do not think I have ever reminded Isabel of that encounter.|$|E
40|$|One {{consequence}} of the current economic climate is that many couples are choosing to keep living {{under the same roof}} despite divorce and emotionally detaching. The current article focuses on some of the economic implications and also introduces a checklist that can assist couples in making agreements and identifying issues that are or are not negotiable. Keywords couples and economic challenges, couples problem solving, living together and emotionally separating, divorce The motivation for writing this article occurred {{as a result of an}} interaction that Dr. Daniel Eckstein had while working with a couple during therapy. After seeing the wife individually a few times, it was clear she felt the relationship had come to an end. Based on the therapeutic alliance we had, she wanted my sup-port as she made her feelings very clear to her husband that their relationship was in fact over. She indicated that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could help her by providing a caring and supportive envi-ronment for the couple to address such an emotionally difficul...|$|E
60|$|Ajor always {{spoke of}} the world as though nothing existed beyond Caspak. She could not seem to grasp the truth of my origin or {{the fact that there were}} countless other peoples outside her stern barrier-cliffs. <b>She</b> {{apparently}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> came from an entirely different world. Where it was and how I came to Caspak from it were matters quite beyond her with which she refused to trouble her pretty head.|$|R
5000|$|... {{she just}} {{continued}} on {{and she just}} said that she couldn't stand {{to listen to me}} whistle, <b>that</b> every time <b>I</b> touched her, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> sick, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a lousy fuck and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a little penis and that she's never going to fuck me again, and I'm just sitting there with my head down; and by this time, she's kneeling on the seat and she's yelling this in my face.|$|R
6000|$|Quick {{enough of}} comprehension, she {{understood}} me directly; her face became a little blanched--a very little--but no muscle in her rather marked features moved; and, calm and self-possessed, she {{retired from the}} estrade, taking her seat quietly at a little distance, and occupying herself with netting a purse. I proceeded to give my lesson; it was a [...] "Composition," [...] i.e., I dictated certain general questions, of which the pupils were to compose the answers from memory, access to books being forbidden. While Mdlle. Eulalie, Hortense, Caroline, &c., were pondering over the string of rather abstruse grammatical interrogatories I had propounded, I was at liberty to employ the vacant half hour in further observing the directress herself. The green silk purse was progressing fast in her hands; her eyes were bent upon it; her attitude, as she sat netting within two yards of me, was still yet guarded; in her whole person were expressed at once, and with equal clearness, vigilance and repose--a rare union! Looking at her, I was forced, as I had often been before, to offer her good sense, her wondrous self-control, the tribute of involuntary admiration. <b>She</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had withdrawn from her my esteem; she had seen contempt and coldness in my eye, and to her, who coveted the approbation of all around her, who thirsted after universal good opinion, such discovery {{must have been an}} acute wound. I had witnessed its effect in the momentary pallor of her cheek-cheek unused to vary; yet how quickly, by dint of self-control, had she recovered her composure! With what quiet dignity she now sat, almost at my side, sustained by her sound and vigorous sense; no trembling in her somewhat lengthened, though shrewd upper lip, no coward shame on her austere forehead! ...|$|R
3000|$|After I {{gave birth}} to my son, my mom came {{to take care of}} us for a month. She wanted to stay but then I asked her to leave. I told her, ‘this is my home, not yours. If I go to your home, I will listen to you. But here you are in my home, I respect you, and please respect me. At the beginning, my mom could not accept it, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> turned into another person after I got married. So I told her, ‘Mom, I am still your daughter, but I have other roles, I am a wife, and a mother too.’ She was not fully convinced, and still felt that I changed because I married a foreigner. She also had {{different}} feeling for my husband. Before the marriage, she thought my husband was very sweet and considerate. However, after the marriage, she found that he was very protective to me and our nuclear family, and doesnot want any external interruption. My mom felt that he changed and treated her differently after he managed to marry her daughter. (Juicy) [...]...|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} time Tuppence <b>felt</b> afraid. <b>She</b> had not feared Whittington, but this woman was different. As if fascinated, she watched the long cruel line of the red curving mouth, and again <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{sensation}} of panic pass over her. Her usual self-confidence deserted her. Vaguely <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving Whittington. Mr. Carter's warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed, she might expect no mercy.|$|R
