5|$|While on course, JG 6 {{approached}} the airfield of Heesch {{and some of}} its pilots assumed it to be Volkel airfield. It is unlikely that the Heesch strip, built in October 1944, was known to the Luftwaffe. No. 126 Wing RCAF was based there and had dispatched its 411 and 442 Squadrons on recce missions early that morning so the majority of its units were airborne. Its 401 Squadron was readying for takeoff when JG 6 appeared at 09:15. Most of the German pilots had failed to notice the airfield, concentrating on keeping formation at low altitude. 401 Squadron scrambled. Some of the German fighters were authorised to engage, while the main body continued to search for Volkel. Stab., and II./JG 6 <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> another strip at Helmond, which contained no aircraft. Several German pilots believed it to be Volkel and attacked, losing several of their number to ground fire. II./JG 6 suffered severely from Spitfire and Tempests based at Helmond. Very little damage was done at Heesch or Helmond.|$|E

25|$|A modern 40-year-old {{mystery of}} the Arctic was {{recently}} solved when {{the remains of a}} 1938 Fairchild 82 were found south of Bathurst Inlet. The aircraft belonged to bush pilot Chuck McAvoy, who was flying a pair of American geologists on 9 June 1964, when he disappeared. After an extensive search, the story of the missing Fairchild became a legend of the north until 2003 when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> the crash site.|$|E

It became known as the 'Christmas Massacre' (Strage di Natale) and was initially attributed to political extremists. Only several years later, when police <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> explosives of the same type as used in Train 904 while searching the hideout of Giuseppe Calò, did it become apparent that the Mafia had been behind the attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Le Touquet had the Merlimont Plage Hotel as an objective. Intelligence had {{suggested}} that the Germans were using the hotel as a barracks. When the group reached the hotel they discovered it was empty and {{the doors and windows}} boarded up. Unable to find another target, they returned to the beach, only to discover their boat had put back out to sea. During the wait, two German sentries <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> the group and were quietly killed by the troops' bayonets. Another German patrol then approached across the sand dunes and the group was forced to swim out to the boat, leaving its weapons behind.|$|E
25|$|Cistercian monk Father Thomas Keating, {{a founder}} of Centering Prayer, was abbot all through the 60s and 70s at St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts. This area is thick with {{religious}} retreat centres, including the well-known Theravada Buddhist centre, Insight Meditation Society. Fr. Keating tells of meeting many young people, some who <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> St. Joseph’s by accident, many of them born Catholic, who had turned to Eastern practices for contemplative work. He found {{many of them had}} no knowledge of the contemplative traditions within Christianity and set out to present those practices in a more accessible way.

The drill core containing the fossil was extracted from [...] below the seafloor. Martin Sander and Nicole Klein, palaeontologists of the University of Bonn, analysed the bone microstructure and concluded that the rock preserved fibrous bone tissue from a fragment of a limb bone belonging to Plateosaurus, making it the first dinosaur found in Norway. Plateosaurus material has also been found in the Fleming Fjord Formation of East Greenland.|$|E

Performing after her victory, she <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with Lill-Babs for the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1987 winner [...] "Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola", performed by Lotta Engberg, is another example; the song's title was changed to [...] "Boogaloo" [...] for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest's rules. This name was chosen as Sweden's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix [...] "-loo".|$|E

Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it during the car ride home he sensed that [...] " [...] had <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> something big." [...] The band's recording session lasted three weeks and the album was remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, [...] "similar to the Sex Pistols' album or first Black Sabbath albums." [...] The band felt the original mix to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, [...] "Everything was already written, all we had to do was play it." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} some {{resistance}} within the astronomical community toward the reclassification. Alan Stern, principal investigator with NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, derided the IAU resolution, stating that [...] "the definition stinks, for technical reasons". Stern contended that, {{by the terms of}} the new definition, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded. He argued that all big spherical moons, including the Moon, should likewise be considered planets. He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Marc W. Buie, then at the Lowell Observatory petitioned against the definition. Others have supported the IAU. Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris, said [...] "through this whole crazy circus-like procedure, somehow the right answer was <b>stumbled</b> <b>on.</b> It's been a long time coming.

500|$|In 1940, [...] Edmund Godfrey Burr, a Canadian {{professor}} at McGill University, serendipitously <b>stumbled</b> <b>on</b> {{the principle of}} counter-illumination, or {{as he called it}} [...] "diffused-lighting camouflage". Burr had been tasked by Canada's National Research Council (NRC) to evaluate night observation instruments. With these, he found that aircraft flying without navigation lights remained readily visible as silhouettes against the night sky, which was never completely black. Burr wondered if he could camouflage planes by somehow reducing this difference in brightness. One night in December 1940, Burr saw a plane coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish: light reflected from the snow had illuminated the underside of the plane just enough to cancel out the difference in brightness, camouflaging the plane perfectly. Burr informed the NRC, who told the RCN. They realized that the technique could help to hide ships from German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. Before the introduction of centimetre radar, submarines with their small profile could see convoy ships before they were themselves seen. Diffused lighting camouflage might, the RCN believed, redress the balance.|$|E
