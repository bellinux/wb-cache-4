40|$|Aqueous {{extracts}} of silage {{samples from}} four farms in up-state New York were reacted in vitro with normal human serum. Hemolytic levels of complement component C 3 were consumed in a dose-dependent fashion, {{and the four}} extracts differed in their relative activity rankings. Studies with chelated serum indicate that the alternative complement pathway {{is involved in the}} activation, and the active fragment C 3 b was demonstrated. Serum levels of hemolytic C 3 and C 4 in vivo were quantified before and after farmers performed their normal <b>silo</b> <b>unloading</b> operations. Although the study groups were small, suggestive evidence of in vivo complement consumption was found. IgE-related allergy {{did not appear to be}} of significance to the study groups. Complement activation may be an initiator of or contributor to adverse reactions in farmers who are exposed to airborne silage dusts...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar o efeito do tamanho de partícula, do teor de MS e do uso de inoculante bacteriano sobre as propriedades físicas e perdas por deterioração da silagem de capim Tanzânia. Também foram avaliados a ingestão de MS (IMS), o ganho de peso vivo (GPV) e a conversão alimentar (CA) de novilhas alimentadas com rações completas contendo essa silagem. A redução no tamanho da partícula não aumentou as densidades de matéria seca (DMS) e de massa verde (DMV), não reduziu a porosidade e nem as perdas durante a ensilagem. O emurchecimento não reduziu a DMS devido ao maior teor de MS, ocasionando maiores perdas. Não houve efeito dos tratamentos sobre a IMS (2, 36 % PV), o GPV (1, 03 kg animal - 1 dia - 1) e a CA (7, 91 kg MS kg - 1 GPV). Os procedimentos adotados na ensilagem de capim Tanzânia não foram eficientes em evitar perdas e não provocaram melhoria no desempenho dos animais. The {{objective}} was to study the e ffect of particle size, dry matter content {{and the addition of}} bacterial inoculant to the ensiling of Tanzania grass (Panicum maximum, Jacq. cv. Tanzânia) on the physical characteristics and losses occurred during <b>silo</b> <b>unloading.</b> Dry matter intake, live we ight gain and feed conversion of beef heifers fed TMR containing grass silage were measured. The small particle size in the forage did not increase either wet or DM silages bulk densities, did not reduce the porosity and did not change the unloading losses. The forage wilting was not enough to reduce the DM density due to the compensatory effect established by the higher DM content, which presented the highest losses. No significant differences were observed for treatments on animal DM intake (2. 4 %BW), body weight gain (1. 03 kg animal - 1 day - 1) and feed conversion (7. 91 kg MS kg - 1 BWG). Treatments in the ensiling of Tanzania grass did not prevent unloading losses and did not improve animal performance...|$|E
50|$|Bunker silos are trenches, {{usually with}} {{concrete}} walls, that are filled and packed with tractors and loaders. The filled trench {{is covered with}} a plastic tarp to make it airtight. These <b>silos</b> are usually <b>unloaded</b> with a tractor and loader. They are inexpensive and especially well suited to very large operations.|$|R
50|$|Storage silos are {{cylindrical}} structures, typically 10 to 90 ft (3 to 27 m) {{in diameter}} and 30 to 275 ft (10 to 90 m) in height with the slipform and Jumpform concrete silos being the larger diameter and taller silos. They can be made of many materials. Wood staves, concrete staves, cast concrete, and steel panels have all been used, and have varying cost, durability, and airtightness tradeoffs. Silos storing grain, cement and woodchips are typically unloaded with air slides or augers. <b>Silos</b> can be <b>unloaded</b> into rail cars, trucks or conveyors.|$|R
50|$|The {{underground}} mine is accessible either via an incline ramp or a mine shaft. Ore extraction started at level 500, {{from which the}} process proceeds upwards towards {{the bottom of the}} open-pit. Fully excavated primary stopes are filled with waste rock. From each stope, the ore is carried to an underground crushing station. The crushed ore is transferred via a conveyor belt to crushed ore silos located close to the mine shaft and further to a skip via a measuring pocket. The ore is hoisted through the shaft to an <b>unloading</b> <b>silo</b> located in a 70-meter-tall lifting tower, from where it is forwarded to the concentration process.|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} when animals {{must be kept}} indoors, the silo plastic is removed, the {{unloader}} is lowered down onto {{the top of the}} silage pile, and a hinged door is opened {{on the side of the}} silo to permit the silage to be blown out. There is an array of these access doors arranged vertically up the side of the <b>silo,</b> with an <b>unloading</b> tube next to the doors that has a series of removable covers down the side of the tube. The unloader tube and access doors are normally covered with a large U-shaped shield mounted on the silo, to protect the farmer from wind, snow, and rain while working on the silo.|$|R
50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} can be implements {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a <b>silo</b> for <b>unloading,</b> and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.|$|R
40|$|An acute febrile illness {{associated}} with <b>unloading</b> <b>silos</b> occurs {{more frequently than}} any other farm associated respiratory illness in mid state New York. This report describes 29 cases of organic dust toxic syndrome (also known as pulmonary mycotoxicosis) occurring in 24 men and one woman {{with a mean age}} of 29 years. In 16 instances more than one worker was exposed to the dust, and in 12 of these shared exposures more than one worker became ill. Patients presented 5. 3 (SD 3. 3) hours after inhalation of organic dust and mould with fever (79 %), myalgia (76 %), chest tightness (72 %), cough (66 %), and headache (59 %). The mean temperature was 38. 7 degrees C and the mean white blood cell count 13. 2 X 10 (9) /l. In contrast to patients with allergic alveolitis, nearly all these patients had normal breath sounds, chest radiographs, and arterial oxygen saturation. Tests for precipitating antibodies to farmer's lung disease antigens gave negative results in all 26 episodes in which they were done; of these, 10 had no evidence of precipitating antibodies to an aqueous extract of the silage {{associated with}} their own illness. Organic dust toxic syndrome appears to be a common and substantial respiratory hazard to young farm workers. Despite being frequently mis-diagnosed as farmer's lung, organic dust toxic syndrome is clearly a distinctly different disease process...|$|R
