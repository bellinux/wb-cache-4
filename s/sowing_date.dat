40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of different <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> on the yield, 100 -grain weight, oil, protein and isoflavone contents of food-type soybean breeding lines UEL 110, UEL 115 and UEL 123 and a cultivar BRS 257. The materials were seeded on four <b>sowing</b> <b>dates,</b> and the experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications. The productivity and 100 -grain weight varied with the <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> and soybean genotypes. The protein content ranged from 36. 40 to 42. 44 %, and the oil content ranged from 18. 29 to 22. 71 %. No significant interaction was found between the genotype and <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> for the protein content. The isoflavone content also varied with the <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> and soybean genotypes. The cultivar BRS 257 had the highest isoflavone content, including the &# 946;-glucoside, malonyl glucoside and aglycones forms. The different <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> influenced the productivity, 100 -grain weight, oil and protein content and isoflavone levels. Higher temperatures and lower rainfall during the grain filling decreased the productivity and isoflavone content and increased the protein content. For all <b>sowing</b> <b>dates,</b> the BRS 257 soybean food-type cultivar showed the highest isoflavone content, indicating that the effect of genotype is more important...|$|R

50|$|Ascochyta blights occur {{throughout}} the world and can be of significant economic importance. Three fungi contribute to the ascochyta blight disease complex of pea (Pisum sativum). Ascochyta pinodes (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella pinodes) causes Mycosphaerella blight. Ascochyta pinodella (synonym: Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella) causes Ascochyta foot rot, and Ascochyta pisi causes Ascochyta blight and pod spot. Of the three fungi, Ascochyta pinodes is of the most importance. These diseases are conducive under wet and humid conditions and can cause a yield loss of up to fifty percent if left uncontrolled. The best method to control ascochyta blights of pea {{is to reduce the}} amount of primary inoculum through sanitation, crop-rotation, and altering the <b>sowing</b> <b>date.</b> Other methods—chemical control, biological control, and development of resistant varieties—may also be used to effectively control ascochyta diseases.|$|E
50|$|Nitrogen {{nutrition}} {{is another}} factor that affects the yield of Cicer arietinum, although the application itself differs from other perennial crops {{with regards to the}} levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant. Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of Cicer arietinum. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, <b>sowing</b> <b>date,</b> and mineral nitrogen supply all {{have an effect on the}} yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that Cicer arietinum differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from soil during drought stress. Additional minerals and micronutrients make the absorption process of nitrogen and phosphorus more available. Inorganic phosphate ions are generally attracted towards charged minerals such as iron and aluminium oxides.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{simulate}} the <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> of 11 major annual crops {{at the global}} scale at high spatial resolution, based on climatic conditions and crop-specific temperature requirements. Location Global. Methods <b>Sowing</b> <b>dates</b> under rainfed conditions are simulated deterministically based {{on a set of}} rules depending on crop-and climate-specific characteristics. We assume that farmers base their timing of sowing on experiences with past precipitation and temperature conditions, with the intra-annual variability being especially important. The start of the growing period is assumed to be dependent either on the onset of the wet season or on the exceeding of a crop-specific temperature threshold for emergence. To validate our methodology, a global data set of observed monthly growing periods (MIRCA 2000) is used. Results We show simulated <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> for 11 major field crops world-wide and give rules for determining their <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> in a specific climatic region. For all simulated crops, except for rapeseed and cassava, in at least 50 % of the grid cells and on at least 60 % of the cultivated area, the difference between simulated and observed <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> is less than 1 month. Deviations of more than 5 months occur in regions characterized by multiple-cropping systems, in tropical regions which, despite seasonality, have favourable conditions throughout the year, and in countries with large climatic gradients. Main conclusions <b>Sowing</b> <b>dates</b> under rainfed conditions for various annual crops can be satisfactorily estimated from climatic conditions for large parts of the earth. Our methodology is globally applicable, and therefore suitable for simulating <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> as input for crop growth models applied at the global scale and taking climate change into account...|$|R
40|$|Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) yield in Ghana {{is limited}} by {{variable}} rainfall, low soil fertility, pests and diseases, and poor crop management. Field experiments were conducted during the 1997 and 1998 seasons at the Savanna Agricultural Research Station in Ghana to evaluate the CROPGRO-peanut model {{for its ability to}} simulate growth, yield, and soil water balance of a peanut crop and to quantify yield losses caused by biotic and abiotic factors. Two peanut cultivars, Chinese which matures in 90 d, and F-Mix which matures in 120 d, were grown rainfed on an Alfisol soil at three <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> between May and August in 1997 and at four dates in 1998. Soil water and crop growth were measured during the season and compared with crop model simulations to determine yield-limiting factors relative to potential yield. Growth and yield were highest for the early <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> and decreased progressively with later sowing, a trend attributed to leaf diseases. After incorporating functions for percentage leaf defoliation and percentage diseased leaf area, the model accurately simulated soil water content fluctuations, crop growth, and yield of cultivars for the <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> and seasons. Simulated yield losses caused by water deficits were small (averaging 5 – 10 %) for early <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> (late May to mid-July) and increased with later <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> (20 and 70 % for third and fourth sowings). Yield losses due to diseases and pests were simulated as a percentage of potential yield under water-limited environments and averaged 40 %, also increasing with later <b>sowing</b> <b>dates.</b> Using 13 yr of weather data, simulated yields were reduced 10 to 20 % by water deficit for the two earlier (normal) <b>sowing</b> <b>dates,</b> but more for the later <b>sowing</b> <b>dates,</b> while additional yield reductions were attributed to biotic stresses. We conclude that the CROPGRO-peanut model can be successfully used to quantify the yield potential and yield gaps associated with yield-reducing stresses and crop management for this region...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> on grain protein, hordein {{fraction}} content and malting quality of two-rowed spring barley was investigated by using ten commercial cultivars with different grain protein {{content and the}} relationships among these traits were examined. The results showed that grain protein content and B hordein content increased as the <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> postponed and were significantly affected by <b>sowing</b> <b>date,</b> while C and D hordein contents were less influenced by <b>sowing</b> <b>date.</b> There were significant differences in grain protein and hordein fraction content among the ten cultivars. The coefficient of variation of D hordein content was much larger than that of B and C hordein contents, suggesting its greater variation caused by different sowing dates. Beta-amylase activity and diastatic power were also significantly affected by <b>sowing</b> <b>date,</b> with malt extract being less affected. Significant differences in measured malt quality were found among the ten cultivars. Grain protein was significantly correlated with B hordein and malt extract positively and negatively, respectively. There was no significant correlation between beta-amylase activity or diastatic power and grain protein content. B hordein was negatively and significantly correlated with malt extract, but no significant correlations between C hordein, D hordein and malting quality traits...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 2005 - 2006 at Safiabad Agricultural Research Center to assess the effects of <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> on the yield of canola genotypes. The design was a split plot in a completely randomized block with 3 replications. Main plots consisted of 3 levels of <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> (November 1 st, November 16 th and December 1 st) and subplots included 7 canola cultivars (Hyola 60, Hyola 308, Hyola 330, Hyola 401, Hyola 420, RGS 003 and Option 500). Grain yield was decreased by 5. 72 % and 21. 27 % {{in the second and}} third sowing dates compared with the first one, respectively. The results of interaction between <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> and cultivars showed that the highest grain yield (5055. 09 Kg/ha) at the first <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> (Nov 1 st) belonged to Hyola 420 cultivar and the lowest grain yield (2360. 68 Kg/ha) at the third <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> (Dec 1 st) to the Option 500 cultivar. The number of pods per plant was decreased by 20. 61 % and 36. 02 % in the second and the third sowing dates compared with the first one, respectively. The highest (28. 93) number of grains per pod belonged to Hyola 401 cultivar sown on December 1 st and the lowest (15. 69)) number of grains per pod belonged to Hyola 60 cultivar sown on December 1 st. Considering the results of the experiment, the <b>sowing</b> <b>date</b> of Nov 1 st for Hyola 420 cultivar, and Nov 1 st and Nov 16 th for other cultivars could be appropriate...|$|E

The experiment consisted of five cultivar competition assays, arranged in a completely randomized block design, with each assay <b>sown</b> at different <b>dates</b> (10 / 15, 10 / 30, 11 / 15, 11 / 30 and 12 / 15) for each cropping season. The evaluated cultivars were BRS 132 (early), BRS 133 (semi-early), BR 16 (semi-early), BRS 134 (intermediate) and FT- Estrela (late). Seeds obtained at the <b>sowing</b> <b>dates</b> were evaluated in the laboratory by germination, accelerated aging, and health tests. Sowing in November resulted in seeds with superior physiological and health quality. Cultivar BRS 133 showed the greatest stability in seed production with better quality for the different <b>sowing</b> <b>dates.</b> Cultivars BRS 134 and BRS 133, which were sown during the period from 10 / 15 to 11 / 30, produced seeds that had higher percentages of normal seedlings in the germination and accelerated aging tests.
