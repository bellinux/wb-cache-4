While in a servitude work ”A” and ”B” quarreled and suddenly ”A” gave ”B” a blow by a <b>scraper.</b> At the moment, ”B” parried {{it with his}} left wrist, but the <b>scraper</b> haft broke and its blade stuck in ”C” while in a servitude work in front of ”B” at a distance about 1. 3 meters, and as the result ”C” died. We made scientific research in following dynamical analysis about this matter. 1) Before ”B” stopped the <b>scraper</b> with his left wrist, how did the <b>scraper</b> blade stick in ”C” to come out by centrifugal force? 2) The value of the <b>scraper</b> kinetic energy when the <b>scraper</b> blade would not come out. 3) The value of energy expended upon the wrist when ”B” stopped the <b>scraper</b> with his left wrist. 4) The value of energy when the <b>scraper</b> haft broke. 5) The value of kinetic energy when the <b>scraper</b> broke and its blade came out...|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of the card <b>scraper</b> is the <b>scraper</b> plane which consists of a hand plane body in which a card <b>scraper</b> is mounted. There are also various styles of holder {{which can be used}} for this purpose. These simplify the use of the card <b>scraper</b> and alleviate the problems associated with heat.|$|R

5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse <b>scrapers</b> and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} warrant the non-fracture of the <b>scraper</b> chain, the safety {{coefficient}} {{of the chain}} was calculated. When the total power is 2000  kW, <b>scraper</b> chain speed is 1.77  m/s and the broken load of <b>scraper</b> chain is 3290 kN, the safety coefficient of <b>scraper</b> chain should reach 1.72 {{to satisfy the requirements}} of safe coal transportation.|$|R

50|$|The cutting {{component}} of a card <b>scraper</b> is the burred edge of the <b>scraper.</b> The burr is a sharp hook of metal which is turned {{on the edge of}} the <b>scraper</b> by burnishing with a steel rod. A file or sharpening stone is used to joint the edge of the <b>scraper</b> before burnishing. Cabinet makers typically joint the edge square, or at a right angle to the face of the <b>scraper,</b> which allows a fine burr to be turned on both sides. Luthiers often use a beveled edge, which allows a more aggressive burr, but on one side only.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} that settlements have existed {{in the area around}} Rivington since the Bronze Age. Arrowheads, a flint knife, <b>scrapers</b> and the remains of cremations were excavated from a Bronze Age cairn at Noon Hill in 1958 and 1963–64. It {{is possible}} that the name Coblowe on the eastern bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir derives from the Old English hlaw, a hill, which denoted an ancient barrow or burial place. Evidence for the existence of a settlement here in Anglo-Saxon times is found in the Rivington and Coblowe names.|$|E
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody <b>scrapers</b> are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E
5|$|Flint <b>scrapers,</b> {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E

40|$|A load to an {{armoured}} {{face conveyor}} (AFC) during coal mining is changeable and very difficult or even {{impossible to be}} predicted. Changes of the load to the upper <b>scraper</b> chain affect the load of the driving motor and generate changes in a <b>scraper</b> chain tension. Impact of increasing the external load to the upper <b>scraper</b> chain on the operation of electric motors and on the <b>scraper</b> chain tension is presented. The developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor enabled identifying the places of the <b>scraper</b> chain high tension or places of its loosening. An impact of changing frequency of driving motor voltage on AFC’s operational conditions was tested and analysed using the AFC’s numerical model. During tests, tension of the <b>scraper</b> chain on the discharge end and the return end was recorded. High tension of the <b>scraper</b> chain and its loosening during the changeable load were also recorded on upward and downward transportation of run-of-mine material...|$|R

5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and <b>scrapers</b> who {{followed}} the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, <b>scrapers</b> and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|The Arctic {{small tool}} {{tradition}} {{is a broad}} cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500BCE (4,500years ago). These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. <b>Scrapers,</b> engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits. The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000Common Era (CE).|$|E
30|$|During {{the period}} of the ninth five-year {{national}} economic plan, with the cooperation of Zhangjiakou and Northwestern Coal Mining Equipment Manufactory, using CAD technology, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute developed the first <b>scraper</b> conveyors for LTCC face with retractable end chain adjusting device. They were the SGZ 960 / 750 front <b>scraper</b> conveyor and the SGZ 900 / 750 rear <b>scraper</b> conveyor, and also stage loader and crusher. The equipment developed met the requirements from Yankuang Group for a coal production of 10, 000 – 13, 000 t/d. During {{the period of}} the tenth five-year national economic plan, Yankuang Group, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute and Northwestern Benniu Group jointly developed the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliability front <b>scraper</b> conveyor and rear <b>scraper</b> conveyor. Currently, the SFZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliable rear <b>scraper</b> conveyor is an ultra-heavy <b>scraper</b> conveyor for LTCC faces, which is characterized by its highest power level, widest chute and longest length. Furthermore, it integrated various advanced technologies, including automatic extension of the conveyor end, hydraulic motor chain tensioner, speed adjustment hydraulic coupler and compact chain. In the 1990 s, its main specifications reached an advanced level accepted worldwide. The SGZ 1000 / 1200 front <b>scraper</b> conveyor is currently the largest front <b>scraper</b> conveyor, and can be integrated with various powerful shearers and hydraulic supports. Its installed power is 2  ×  600  kW. The development of the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 <b>scraper</b> conveyors enables not only the technical advance in <b>scraper</b> conveyor technology, but also in LTCC technology.|$|R

The support workshop added a further 40 vehicles, and over 1,800 tonnes of stores were shipped with the contingent's equipment. There was a total of over 200 wheeled and tracked vehicles and trailers and a large quantity of dangerous cargo (demolition explosives and ammunition). The UN hired the MV Mistra for the deployment. It departed Sydney on 23 March; the equipment was unloaded at Walvis Bay in mid-April, moving by road and rail to the South African Defence Force Logistics Base at Grootfontein.|$|E
5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically {{carried out at}} night, when the ice was thickest. First the surface would be cleaned of snow with <b>scrapers,</b> {{the depth of the}} ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of the blocks varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. The blocks could finally be cut out of the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on the ice. In both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, {{over the top of}} the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, and a desire to reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) to the bottom of the grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn <b>scrapers</b> were used.|$|E

5|$|Twenty Palaeolithic {{sites have}} been {{identified}} in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic artefacts recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the artefacts found include points, <b>scrapers,</b> and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of artefacts have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed artefacts and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough's Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the benthos. Other species are collector-filterers, sieving organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are <b>scrapers,</b> feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E
5|$|Jeita I (sometimes {{referred}} to as Nahr-el-Kelb) is a dry cave, 56 metres deep {{to the east of}} the source cave from where the river flows and connected to it by narrow channels. It was first noted in 1833 by Botta and excavated by Godefroy Zumoffen in two positions in 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1910. It was later excavated by Auguste Bergy with materials from both excavations now with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut and the private collection of Dr. Gigues. Henri Fleisch noticed an Upper Paleolithic level with further finds including polished Neolithic pieces, primitive potsherds, burned bones and end <b>scrapers.</b> Jacques Cauvin noted similarities in these finds to the Néolithique Moyen period of Byblos.
