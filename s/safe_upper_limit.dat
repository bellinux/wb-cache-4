40|$|Severe iodine {{deficiency}} during development results in maternal and fetal hypothyroidism and associated serious adverse health effects, including cretinism and growth retardation. Universal salt iodization is the first-line {{strategy for the}} elimination of severe {{iodine deficiency}}. Iodine supplementation is recommended for vulnerable groups in severely iodine-deficient regions where salt iodization is infeasible or insufficient. A recent clinical trial has informed best practices for iodine supplementation of severely iodine-deficient lactating mothers. Because of successful programs of universal salt iodization in formerly severely iodine-deficient regions around the world, public health concern has shifted toward mild to moderate iodine deficiency, which remains prevalent in many regions, especially among pregnant women. Observational studies have shown associations between both mild maternal iodine deficiency and mild maternal thyroid hypofunction and decreased child cognition. Iodine supplementation has been shown to improve indexes of maternal thyroid function, even in marginally iodine-deficient areas. However, no data are yet available from randomized controlled trials in regions of mild to moderate iodine insufficiency on the relation between maternal iodine supplementation and neurobehavioral development in the offspring; thus, the long-term benefits and safety of such supplementation are uncertain. Although it is clear that excessive iodine intake can cause alterations in thyroid function in susceptible individuals, <b>safe</b> <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> for iodine intake in pregnancy have not been well defined. Well-designed, prospective, randomized controlled trials that examine the effects of iodine supplementation on maternal thyroid function and infant neurobehavioral development in mildly to moderately iodine-deficient pregnant women are urgently needed.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We questioned whether patients undergoing hip resurfacing with no clinical problems could be differentiated from those with clinical (pain, loss of function) and/or radiographic (component malpositioning, migration, bone loss), problems based on metal ion levels, {{and if there was}} a threshold metal level that predicted the need for clinical intervention. Furthermore, we asked if patient and implant factors differed between these functional groups. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 453 unilateral and 139 bilateral patients with ion measurements at minimum followup of 12 months (mean, 4. 3 years; range, 1 - 12. 9 years). Patients were designated as well functioning or poorly functioning based on strict criteria. The acceptable upper levels within the well-functioning group were determined from the 75 th percentile plus 1. 5 × interquartile range. The sensitivity and specificity of these levels to predict clinical problems were calculated. RESULTS: Well-functioning group ions were lower than the poorly functioning group ion levels. The acceptable upper levels were: chromium (Cr) 4. 6 μg/L, cobalt (Co) 4. 0 μg/L unilateral and Cr 7. 4 μg/L, Co 5. 0 μg/L bilateral. The specificity of these levels in predicting poor function was high (95 %) and sensitivity was low (25 %). There were more males in the well-functioning group and more females and smaller femoral components in the poorly functioning group. CONCLUSIONS: Metal levels higher than these proposed <b>safe</b> <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> can predict problems with metal-on-metal resurfacings and are important parameters in the management of at-risk patients.

40|$|The {{limits of}} a {{recently}} proposed computer method for finding all distinct substructures {{of a chemical}} structure are systematically explored within comprehensive graph samples which serve as supersets of the graphs corresponding to saturated hydrocarbons, both acyclic (up to n = 20) and (poly) cyclic (up to n = 10). Several pairs of smallest graphs and compounds are identified that cannot be distinguished using selected combinations of invariants such as combinations of Balaban’s index J and graph matrix eigenvalues. As the most important result, it can now be stated that the computer program NIMSG, using J and distance eigenvalues, is safe within the domain of mono- through tetracyclic saturated hydrocarbon substructures up to n = 10 (oligocyclic decanes) and of all acyclic alkane substructures up to n = 19 (nonadecanes), i. e. it will not miss any of these substructures.

40|$|Abstract Background Metal ions such as {{iron and}} copper {{are among the}} key {{nutrients}} that must be provided by dietary sources. Numerous foodstuffs have been evaluated for {{their contributions to the}} recommended daily allowance both to guide for satisfactory intake and also to prevent over exposure. In the case of heavy metal ions, the focus is often on exposure to potentially toxic levels of ions such as lead and mercury. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine target hazard quotients (THQ) from literature reports giving empirical levels of metal ions in table wines using the reference <b>upper</b> <b>safe</b> <b>limit</b> value. Contributions to the THQ value were calculated for seven metal ions along with total values for each wine. Results The THQ values were determined as ranges from previously reported ranges of metal ion concentrations and were frequently concerningly high. Apart from the wines selected from Italy, Brazil and Argentina, all other wines exhibited THQ values significantly greater than one indicating levels of risk. The levels of vanadium, copper and manganese had the highest impact on THQ measures. Typical potential maximum THQ values ranged from 50 to 200 with Hungarian and Slovakian wines reaching 300. THQ values for a sample of red and white wines were high for both having values ranging from 30 to 80 for females based on a 250 mL glass per day. Conclusion The THQ values calculated are concerning in that they are mainly above the safe level of THQ< 1. It is notable that in the absence of <b>upper</b> <b>safe</b> <b>limits,</b> THQ values cannot be calculated for most metal ions, suggesting that further unaccountable risks are associated with intake of these wines. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{as part of a}} research project aiming at understanding the dynamics of precast rocking concrete members. The characteristics and energy dissipation associated with the dynamic response of these systems were investigated. The simple rocking model broadly used by the previous and current research society and a finite element modeling approach developed herein were used as guidelines and reference modeling methods to assess experimental free rocking responses and produce methodologies to more accurately estimate the actual rocking decay of motion. Two discrete energy dissipation mechanisms were identified, namely, instantaneous dissipation due to the impact phenomenon and continuous dissipation due to viscous behavior of the rocking interface. It was found that the instantaneous dissipation formula used in the simple rocking model serves as a lower-bound limit for the amount of energy dissipation per impact. The rocking coefficient of restitution can be alternatively expressed through its relationship with the impact velocity, base force and rocking body inertia. Finally, the continuous dissipation mechanism was modeled by using a viscous term in the original simple rocking model for accurately estimating the real-time displacement responses. As far as controlled rocking is concerned, it was shown that its decay of motion is mainly dependent on the instantaneous dissipation mechanism, while the coefficient of restitution by the simple rocking model significantly overestimates decay of controlled rocking motion. To provide a <b>safe</b> <b>upper</b> bound <b>limit</b> for coefficient of restitution associated with controlled rocking systems, a simplified method which makes use of the original simple rocking model was proposed...|$|R
