Injection of a desensitizing dose of antigen specifically abolishes systemic as well as skin reactivity for several days.

40|$|SummaryTransfection of a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (KSHVBac 36) into mouse {{bone marrow}} endothelial-lineage cells generates a cell (mECK 36) that forms KS-like tumors in mice. mECK 36 expressed most KSHV genes and were angiogenic, but they didn't form colonies in soft agar. In nude mice, mECK 36 formed KSHV-harboring vascularized spindle cell sarcomas that were LANA+/podoplanin+, overexpressed VEGF and Angiopoietin ligands and receptors, and displayed KSHV and host transcriptomes reminiscent of KS. mECK 36 that lost the KSHV episome reverted to nontumorigenicity. siRNA suppression of KSHV vGPCR, an angiogenic gene upregulated in mECK 36 tumors, inhibited angiogenicity and tumorigenicity.

40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) infection of newborn rhesus macaques is a rapid, <b>sensitive</b> <b>animal</b> model of human pediatric AIDS. Newborn macaques were readily infected by uncloned SIVmac following oral-conjunctival exposure and had persistently high viremia and rapid develop-ment of AIDS.

40|$|Arthropod {{filiform}} hairs {{respond to}} air particle movements and {{are among the}} most <b>sensitive</b> <b>animal</b> sensory organs. In many species, they are tuned to detect predators or prey and trigger escape or prey capture behaviours. Here we show {{for the first time that}} these hairs also receive intraspecific near-field sound signals in an arachnid. During agonistic encounters, whip spiders (Arachnida, Amblypygi) perform antenniform leg vibration (ALV) displays that have significantly longer duration in contest winners than losers. During an ALV display: (i) the vibrating antenniform leg of the displaying whip spider is positioned close to the trichobothria (filiform hairs) on its opponent’s walking legs, (ii) the vibrating antenniform leg can excite these trichobothria via air movements and without direct contact, (iii) the antenniform leg of the displaying whip spider vibrates at a frequency that causes particularly strong, sustained excitation and little adaptation in the trichobothria, and (iv) the duration of an ALV display can be extracted from the response of a trichobothrium. Since filiform hairs are widespread among arthropods, communication via such hairs could be extremely prevalent. [Includes supplemental materials. ...|$|E

40|$|Alpha synuclein (αsyn) {{aggregates}} {{are associated}} with the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease and others related disorders. Although modulation of αsyn aggregation is an attractive therapeutic target, new powerful methodologies are desperately needed to facilitate in vivo screening of novel therapeutics. Here we describe an in vivo rodent model with the unique ability to rapidly track αsyn-αsyn interactions and thus oligomerization using a bioluminescent protein complementation strategy that monitors spatial and temporal αsyn oligomerization ex vivo. We find that αsyn forms oligomers in vivo as early as 1 week after stereotactic AAV injection into rat substantia nigra. Strikingly, although abundant αsyn expression is also detected in striatum at one week, no αsyn oligomers are detected at this time point. By 4 weeks, oligomerization of αsyn is detected in both striatum and substantia nigra homogenates. Moreover, in a proof-of-principle experiment, the effect of a previously described Hsp 90 inhibitor known to prevent αsyn oligomer formation, demonstrates the utility of this rapid and <b>sensitive</b> <b>animal</b> model to monitor αsyn oligomerization status in the rat brain...|$|E

40|$|The trichothecenes are a {{very large}} family of {{chemically}} related toxins classified in 4 groups (A-D). The most toxic are those belonging to the group A (diacetoxyscirpenol [DAS], T- 2 toxin [T- 2], HT- 2 toxin [HT- 2]) and B (deoxynivalenol [DON], nivalenol [NIV], fusarenon-X [FX]). Potentially hazardous concentrations of the trichothecene mycotoxins can occur naturally in moldy grains, cereals, and agricultural products and have been found worldwide. Although the toxicity can change in severity {{among the members of}} trichothecene mycotoxins, the main toxic effects produced are directed to the gastrointestinal, dermal, immune and hematopoietic systems. The toxicokinetics of trichothecenes are essential to understand the potential effects in animals. In detail, the metabolism of trichothecenes does not activate but rather deactivate their biological activity. It can be phase I, II and bacterial and has different implication according to the contaminated animal species.

40|$|International audienceZearalenone (ZEA) is a resorcylic acid lactone {{derivative}} {{produced by}} various Fusarium {{species that are}} widely found in food and feeds. The structure of zearalenone is flexible enough to allow a conformation able to bind to mammalian oestrogen receptors, where it acts as an agonist. Using oestrogen-dependent Human Breast Cancer (MCF- 7) cells, the oestrogenic activity of zearalenone and its derivatives were compared using 17 β-oestradiol as a positive control. The results obtained demonstrate that the oestrogenic potency of ZEA derivatives could be ranked in the following order: α- zearalenol > α-zearalanol > zearalenone > β-zearalenol. Since pigs {{have been reported to}} be among the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>animal</b> species, biotransformation studies with pig liver subcellular fractions were conducted. These studies indicated that α-zearalenol is the main hepatic metabolite of zearalenone in pigs, and it is assumed that 3 α- and 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogeneases are involved in the hepatic biotransformation, since the formation of α-zearalenol and β-zearalenol could be inhibited by prototypic substrates for either enzyme. The bioactivation of ZEA into the more active α-zearalenol seems to provide a possible explanation for the observed high sensitivity of pigs towards feedingstuffs contaminated with the mycotoxin...|$|E
40|$|Acidic pH within endosomal vesicles of <b>sensitive</b> <b>animal</b> cells {{triggers}} a conformational change in diphtheria toxin (DT) that {{is believed to}} cause the B chain to insert into the vesicular membrane and the enzymic A chain to be released into the cytosol. In artificial lipid bilayers, DT forms ion-conductive channels under mildly acidic conditions (pH approximately 5). Here we report a related phenomenon in Escherichia coli strains that secrete certain cloned DT-related proteins into their periplasm: the cells are rapidly killed at pH 5 but remain unharmed at pH 7. Expression of full-length DT (an active-site mutant, {{to comply with the}} National Institutes of Health recombinant DNA guidelines) causes acid-sensitivity, whereas expression of the A chain alone does not. The killed cells are not lysed, but inner-membrane functions are impaired (membrane potential, active transport, and ion impermeability). We propose that acidification of DT within the periplasm induces its insertion into the inner membrane, lethally damaging the permeability barrier. This discovery provides a potentially important selection procedure for mutations affecting the membrane insertion function of DT. Similar approaches may be useful in studying other proteins that undergo condition-dependent interaction with membranes...|$|E
