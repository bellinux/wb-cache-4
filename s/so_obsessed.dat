5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson.

Westmoreland was <b>so</b> <b>obsessed</b> with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, {{for the first time}} during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.|$|E

40|$|Beyond its {{apparent}} chaotic character, the contemporary art possesses certain structuring features. We agree {{the idea of}} the Romanian philosopher Tudor Vianu about the workart as a representation of the visible world or of its transcendent ideal. The question of limit, <b>so</b> <b>obsessing</b> in the contemporary art, can be understood like a perpetual temptation to surpassing the human condition, as a bound between the real and the ideal. ’To be’, ’to be aware of’, ’to be finite’, the intelligence, the body, sex, temporality, religion, etc. – all of these are determinations that human being gets as limits which would be established by „somebody else”. Such of determinations become favourite topics in contemporary artworks. Stelarc, Marina Abramovic, Ana Mendieta, and Bill Viola are merely part of the artists engaged in a continuous endeavour to transcending the human condition through their very own works...|$|R

25|$|By contrast, the {{majority}} of the officers of the Task Force, both French and British, admired Beaufre as an elegant yet tough general with a sharp analytical mind who always kept his cool. Most of the officers of the Anglo-French Task Force expressed regret that it was Beaufre who was Stockwell's deputy rather the other way around. A major problem both politically and militarily with the planning for Musketeer was the one-week interval between sending troops to the eastern Mediterranean {{and the beginning of the}} invasion. Additionally, the coming of winter weather to the Mediterranean in late November would render the invasion impossible, which thus meant the invasion had to begin before then. An additional problem was Eden, who constantly interfered with the planning and was <b>so</b> <b>obsessed</b> with secrecy that he refused to tell Keightley what his political objectives were in attacking Egypt, namely was he interested in retaking the Suez canal or toppling Nasser, or both. Eden's refusal to explain to Keightley just what exactly he was hoping to accomplish by attacking Egypt exasperated Keightley to no end, and greatly complicated the planning process.|$|E

Ian gets engaged to Cindy Williams (Michelle Collins) in 1989; however, a one-night stand with her former lover Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) leaves her pregnant. Cindy marries Ian and claims that the baby she is expecting, Steven Beale, is his, resulting in Ian attempting suicide when he learns the truth. He recovers and causes Simon to have a car accident in revenge so Simon, Cindy and Steven leave Walford together.

While the work raises issues of tort and criminal liability, this article analyzes the legal issues presented by one particular and crucial plot device that Stevenson employs—the last will of Dr. Jekyll. This will <b>so</b> <b>obsesses</b> Jekyll’s friend and solicitor, Gabriel John Utterson (through whose eyes the story unfolds), that he is impelled to seek the truth behind his friend’s relationship to Hyde. At the end of Utterson’s search, the solicitor learns about Jekyll’s dangerous scientific experiment. This discovery leads to the respected doctor’s moral downfall and his physical death. This article is presented as an imagined dialogue between the article’s author and Utterson, Jekyll’s lawyer, concerning the issues surrounding Jekyll’s mental capacity to make the will that left the doctor’s estate to Hyde. Jekyll’s will is an excellent case study {{for the application of}} various legal rules and doctrines regarding a testator’s mental capacity to make a valid will. These rules include those relating to the general soundness of the testator’s state of mind, the issues of undue influence and duress, and the doctrine of insane delusion. Stevenson’s novella is a wonderful vehicle for examining important legal problems that remain as relevant in America today as they were in England during Queen Victoria’s reign...|$|R

40|$|Languages differ {{considerably}} in {{the attention that}} they pay to manner as a dimension of motion events. One factor that seems to influence attention to manner is a language’s lexicalization pattern. Following Talmy’s well-known dichotomy of verb-framed and satellite-framed languages, the latter type provides more readily accessible constructions that include path and manner in compact form. In this chapter it is proposed that the dichotomy be expanded to included an “equipollent ” type, in which both path and manner receive equal weight. Furthermore, other factors {{also contribute to the}} degree of “manner salience ” of a particular language. In particular, language-specific morphosyntax, the availability of ideophones, and the availability of motion-related lexical categories (such as posture verbs) are three sorts of factors that interact with lexicalization patterns in influencing manner salience.

Online marketing platforms are not only allowing marketers to implement and analyze marketing strategies but also helping them to research customer behavior, and to receive suggestions and feedback. The objective of this thesis is to select most appropriate marketing platforms for delivering value propositions to the different group of customers. The study introduces the concept of strategic benchmarking process for selecting the platform. Moreover, an additional step was included in the process which reflects the selection criteria and justifies the framework. Through the framework, marketers could identify their most suitable platform to reach to their customers. It allows businesses to optimize the marketing budget and helps to bring additional earnings for the company. The study claims that overall marketing costs of a small and medium sized enterprise could be curtailed and net earnings could be increased. One of the key findings of this study was to reduce the overall marketing expenses without impacting much on generated revenue. This finding could benefit small and medium sized enterprises, and for those who have limited marketing budget to reshuffle their marketing strategies. The result of the study shows that proposed framework was effective to determine most appropriate platform for the case company. The implemented strategy and online platform helped the company to reach to their target customer. Furthermore, the framework helped to bring additional savings from the monthly expenditure. Due to the limitation of marketing budget and lacking of strategy implementation know-how in other platforms, the study was limited to one platform...|$|R
