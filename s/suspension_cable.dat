25|$|In mid-June 2011, {{preparations}} for the spinning of the main cable began by installing the temporary catwalks on the SAS span. Both western catwalks were installed and by mid-August, all four catwalks were installed in place and an approximation of the completed outline of the bridge could then be seen. All four catwalks, the traveler, its <b>suspension</b> <b>cable</b> and the drafting cables and the winches and specialized tracks at the deviation saddles {{had to be in}} place before strand dragging could begin. These catwalks were required for worker's access to the cable strands for bundling and arrangement as the individual wires are placed.|$|E
25|$|Constructing the {{replacement}} Tacoma Narrows Bridge was delayed {{for nearly a}} decade primarily due to the demand on steel created by World War II, {{and the fact that the}} state had trouble arranging insurance for the new span. On April 30, 1947, Governor Mon Wallgren had announced that insurance had finally been arranged. It wasn't until August 1947 that Washington finally requested bids for the construction, and by that time, the price tag for construction went from $8.5 million (US$ in present terms) to $11.2 million (US$ in present terms). On October 15, the state opened bids for the construction, with Bethlehem Pacific Steel Corporation bidding $8,263,904 (US$ in present terms) on construction of the superstructure, and John A. Roebling's Sons Company of San Francisco bidding $2,932,681 (US$ in present terms) for the construction of the <b>suspension</b> <b>cable</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Production of the {{suspension}} cables {{was done by}} Thyssen of Germany, while the vertical suspenders were built by Bridon Ropes in England. The 24 steel deck boxes were built by Kværner Eureka in Moss. The first wire of the <b>suspension</b> <b>cable</b> was placed between the pylons on 1 July 1991. The three auxiliary roads on Askøy were completed by December 1991. Work was ahead of schedule, and the planned opening date was on 1 April 1992 moved from May 1993 to 12 December 1992. The last deck section was lifted in place on 4 April 1992. The first tube of the Damsgård Tunnel opened on 10 December, while the second was scheduled for 1 May 1993. West-bound traffic along National Road 555 was in the mean time routes via Laksevåg. Only one tube of the Lyderhorn Tunnel was open, but it instead had one lane in each direction.|$|E

500|$|In 1934 a {{temporary}} footbridge which {{had previously been}} used during rebuilding works on Lambeth Bridge was moved into place alongside Chelsea Bridge, and demolition began. The new bridge, also called Chelsea Bridge, was designed by LCC architects G. Topham Forrest and E. P. Wheeler and built by Holloway Brothers (London). Much wider than the older bridge at [...] wide, it has a [...] wide roadway and two [...] wide pavements cantilevered out {{from the sides of}} the bridge. Uniquely in London, Chelsea Bridge is a self-anchored suspension bridge, the first of the type to be built in Britain. The horizontal stresses are absorbed by stiffening girders in the deck itself and the suspension cables are not anchored to the ground, relieving stress on the abutments which are built on soft and unstable London clay. The piers of the new bridge were built {{on the site of the}} old bridge's piers, and are built of concrete, faced with granite above the low-water point. Each side of the bridge has a single <b>suspension</b> <b>cable,</b> each made up of 37 1-inch (23mm) diameter wire ropes bundled to form a hexagonal cable. As was agreed with the Ministry of Transport, all materials used in the bridge came from the British Empire; the steel came from Scotland and Yorkshire, the granite of the piers from Aberdeen and Cornwall, the timbers of the deck from British Columbia and the asphalt of the roadway from Trinidad.|$|E

50|$|Downtown Greenville is {{bisected}} by {{a wooded}} valley park containing the falls of the Reedy River. The Liberty Bridge is located just downstream from {{this group of}} waterfalls, replacing a six-lane highway bridge that was demolished to improve the visibility and accessibility to the falls and adjacent park. The bridge has a curved clear span over the river that curves away from the falls, providing visitors with an aerial amphitheater from which to view the cascading water. The link gently slopes into the ravine and is supported by twin inclined towers and a single <b>suspension</b> <b>cable</b> with thin cable suspenders only on the side away from the falls, allowing for unobstructed views. The bridge, with a total length of approximately 345 ft and a clear span of 200 ft, appears to float over the landscape. The twin towers and <b>suspension</b> <b>cable</b> are visible from vantage points around the city, calling attention and drawing visitors to the public park, falls and river.|$|E
