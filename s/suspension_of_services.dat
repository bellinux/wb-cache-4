25|$|SeaLink has outlasted several {{competing}} companies {{since it}} began operations. Boat Torque, a Western Australian company, operated Superflyte from 1994 until 1997, sailing from Glenelg to Kingscote. Kangaroo Island Ferries had a short-lived venture with SeaWay, which travelled from Wirrina Cove to Kingscote from September 2004 until February 2005. SeaWay could not handle rough weather as well as SeaLink vessels which impacted the service's reliability. Under different proprietorship, SeaWay recommenced services in August 2007. However, in May 2008, the operator of SeaWay announced <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> until October 2008, citing increased fuel prices. In June 2008 the SeaWay's operating company was placed in administration and the vessel advertised for sale.|$|E

25|$|A {{transport}} plan {{released by}} the New South Wales Government in 1998 reported that the line carried an average of 5000 passengers on weekdays. 2.8 million journeys were made in 2009-10, increasing to 4.2 million in 2012-13. The partial integration of the line into the broader Sydney ticketing system was a major driver of the increase. In the 12 months to June 2015, the line carried 6.1 million passengers, compared to 3.9 million passengers in the prior year. The increase in the 2014-15 figure {{was influenced by the}} opening of the extension to Dulwich Hill in March 2014, while the 2013-14 figure was affected by the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for much of October 2013 and closures for maintenance works. In the period from 2015-2016, 9.7 million journeys were made, followed by 9.1 million in 2016-2017. The 2016-2017 statistic was affected by a partial closure of the line in December 2016/January 2017 for construction works on the CBD and South East Light Rail.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 March 1977, cracks were {{noticed in}} the roof of Govan Cross station, leading to <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> until 2 May. The service resumed with only four trains per circle. On 21 May 1977, the system was shut down eight days prematurely for a major {{refurbishment}} and modernisation; the date was brought forward because of the appearance of more cracks in the Govan Cross roof. Badly deteriorated tunnels were repaired; stations were rebuilt and enlarged, with additional platforms at Buchanan Street, Partick, Govan, Ibrox, Hillhead and St Enoch. The entrance to Kelvinbridge was reversed, with a new entrance and car park built at South Woodside Road, an escalator to Great Western Road and stairs down to {{the west end of}} the platform; the former entrance and stairway at the east end became an emergency exit, and the lift was withdrawn from service. Merkland Street station was closed; a new station to the north was built at Partick to provide an interchange with the ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second and}} perhaps more {{profound}} way of manipulating the news flow resulted from the governmental decision {{to bring about a}} shot-gun merger of the four privately owned Indian news agencies; the main purpose behind this merger was to alter the management and control of the Indian news agencies and thus to control much of the content of the leading newspapers. Since these agencies had been acting as the gatekeepers of information, it was essential for Indira Gandhi and her Information and Broadcasting Minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, to control the gatekeepers. To effect such a merger, the government carried through various successful tactics. First of all, pressure was put on the members of boards of these agencies. Then the financial squeeze was applied to the agencies themselves by withholding governmental subsidy. Thirdly, the government introduced the threat of cutting-off the teleprinter services, the lifelines of a news agency. For example, the government-owned Post and Telegraph Department was ordered to impose a <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> to the United News of India if it resisted the merger. The manipulation of these four news agencies was so effective that hardly a voice was raised to resist the governmental perfidy. Soon after this, Shukla reported to the Indian parliament that these four news agencies accepted the merger [...] "voluntarily." ...|$|E
