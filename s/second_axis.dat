25|$|Most {{instruments}} are suspended or {{supported by a}} U-shaped yoke, fixed at two points {{to the sides of}} the instrument, providing an axis of rotation. The base of the yoke is typically a single bolt around which the yoke can be rotated, providing a <b>second</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation. Combined together, these two axis allow the fixture to point nearly anywhere in a spherical range of motion encircling the yoke.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic trough {{power plants}} use a curved, {{mirrored}} trough which reflects the {{direct solar radiation}} onto a glass tube containing a fluid (also called a receiver, absorber or collector) running {{the length of the}} trough, positioned at {{the focal point of the}} reflectors. The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the orthogonal axis. For change of the daily position of the sun perpendicular to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight parallel to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver. Thus the trough design does not require tracking on a <b>second</b> <b>axis.</b> The receiver may be enclosed in a glass vacuum chamber. The vacuum significantly reduces convective heat loss.|$|E

The JNA 2nd Corps destroyed the village of Ravno before turning south towards Dubrovačko Primorje area, aiming to envelop Dubrovnik from the west. The <b>second</b> <b>axis</b> of the JNA advance {{was assigned to the}} 9th Boka Kotorska VPS. It originated in the Bay of Kotor about [...] south-east of Dubrovnik and was directed through Konavle. The advance started at 5am after preparatory artillery fire against Vitaljina and other targets in Konavle. The advance, using several roads in the region, was supported by the Yugoslav Navy and the Air Force. Croatian defences were nonexistent in Konavle and light in Dubrovačko Primorjethe only JNA casualties of the day occurred during a successful ZNG ambush in Čepikuće village. On {{the first day of the}} offensive, JNA artillery attacked Srđ Hill and the Žarkovica promontory just to the north and east of Dubrovnik, while Yugoslav Air Force MiG-21s raided Komolac in Rijeka Dubrovačka to the west, destroying supplies of electricity and water to Dubrovnik. Until the end of December, Dubrovnik relied on fresh water supplied by boats and electricity from a few electric generators.|$|E

60|$|Near {{the ravine}} of Los Hornitos, {{there is a}} well-marked line of elevation, {{extending}} for many miles in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, with the strata dipping in most parts (as in the <b>second</b> <b>axis)</b> only in one direction, namely, eastward at an average angle of between 30 and 40 degrees. Close {{to the mouth of}} the valley, however, there is, as represented in the section, a steep and high mountain [D], composed of various green and brown intrusive porphyries enveloped with strata, apparently belonging to the upper parts of the porphyritic conglomerate, and dipping both eastward and westward. I will describe the section seen on the eastern side of this mountain [D], beginning at the base with the lowest bed visible in the porphyritic conglomerate, and proceeding upwards through the gypseous formation. Bed 1 consists of reddish and brownish porphyry varying in character, and in many parts highly amygdaloidal with carbonate of lime, and with bright green and brown bole. Its upper surface is throughout clearly defined, but the lower surface is in most parts indistinct, and towards the summit of the mountain [D] quite blended into the intrusive porphyries. Bed 2, a pale lilac, hard but not heavy stone, slightly laminated, including small extraneous fragments, and imperfect as well as some perfect and glassy crystals of feldspar; from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in thickness. When examining it in situ, I thought it was certainly a true porphyry, but my specimens now lead me to suspect that it possibly may be a metamorphosed tuff. From its colour it could be traced for a long distance, overlying in one part, quite conformably to the porphyry of bed 1, and in another not distant part, a very thick mass of conglomerate, composed of pebbles of a porphyry chiefly like that of bed 1: this fact shows how the nature of the bottom formerly varied in short horizontal distances. Bed 3, white, much indurated tuff, containing minute pebbles, broken crystals, and scales of mica, varies much in thickness. This bed is remarkable from containing many globular and pear-shaped, externally rusty balls, from the size of an apple to a man's head, of very tough, slate-coloured porphyry, with imperfect crystals of feldspar: in shape these balls do not resemble pebbles, AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SUBAQUEOUS VOLCANIC BOMBS; they differ from SUBAERIAL bombs only in not being vesicular. Bed 4; a dull purplish-red, hard conglomerate, with crystallised particles and veins of carbonate of lime, from three hundred to four hundred feet in thickness. The pebbles are of claystone porphyries of many varieties; they are tolerably well rounded, and vary in size from a large apple to a man's head. This bed includes three layers of coarse, black, calcareous, somewhat slaty rock: the upper part passes into a compact red sandstone.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} partitioning the real plane — or suitable subsets of it — into (non-degenerated) closed segments.

(2) It is possible to find a partition of R 2 into closed segments, {{each of which is}} parallel to either the first or the <b>second</b> co-ordinate <b>axis.</b> Moreover, we may require each element of such a partition to have a lenght chosen among two pre-assigned ones. Let also call a subset of the real plane segment-free, if it contains no non-degenerated closed segment. We prove that there is a subset of the real plane, with segment-free complement, which may be partitioned into countably many closed segments. The construction is based on the idea of creating inductively an infinite grill, by adding at each stage segments of decreasing lenght, which are alternately parallel to the first or the <b>second</b> co-ordinate <b>axis...</b>|$|R

50|$|Precession is {{a change}} in the {{orientation}} of the rotational axis of a rotating body. In an appropriate reference frame it can be defined as a change in the first Euler angle, whereas the third Euler angle defines the rotation itself.
