50|$|Dwell {{magazine}} is published 10 {{times a year}} (monthly except bi-monthly in December/January and July/August) by Dwell Media, LLC. Dwell Media also publishes three special interest publications annually. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, by the close of 2005 the magazine's circulation exceeded 260,000, a 25.5 percent increase over 2004. President and CEO Michela O’Connor Abrams has introduced a number of branded spin-offs, including Dwell digital properties—dwell.com and Dwell <b>Store—as</b> well as national events from modern home tours to the Dwell on Design® events in Los Angeles and New York City. A limited edition minimalist athletic sneaker designed by Medium Design Group and a weekly TV series on the Fine Living cable network were also in production for a short time. Approximately 50% of the pages in a typical issue of Dwell are used for advertising.|$|R
40|$|Concurrent {{constraint}} programming [Sar 89,SR 90] is {{a simple}} and powerful model of concurrent computation based on the notions of <b>store-as</b> constraint and process as information transducer. The store-as-valuation conception of von Neumann computing is replaced {{by the notion that}} the store is a constraint (a finite representation of a possibly infinite set of valuations) which provides partial information about the possible values that variables can take. Instead of "reading" and "writing" the values of variables, processes may now ask (check if a constraint is entailed by the store) and tell (augment the store with a new constraint). This is a very general paradigm which subsumes (among others) nondeterminate data-flow and the (concurrent) (constraint) logic programming languages. This paper develops the basic ideas involved in giving a coherent semantic account of these languages. Our first contribution is to give a simple and general formulation of the notion that a constraint system is...|$|R

While he was away for his trip {{in the late summer}} of 1831, he left Almena in Tarlton with their infant children, as he always had until then.

Almena had to deal with this catastrophe alone.Ward's father, Robert Quigley King, who was born on August 13, 1832 in Tarlton, was their first child to survive. Understandably, Almena insisted on going along with David on his supply trips after that, carrying with her the infant Robert Quigley King as a babe in arms. Their next child was Samuel Noble King, who was born in Tarlton on October 22, 1834. He went all his life by his middle name of [...] "Noble". The Kings named him after their country neighbor, Samuel Noble, who had come from Emmitsburg, Maryland {{to become one of the}} first settlers of Tarlton and who had a large farm just south of Tarlton. Mary Elizabeth King, was born to David and Almena in Tarlton on April 1, 1837, and David King, Jr., later to become a Civil War colonel, was born in Tarlton on September 11, 1839.As time passed, Tarlton began to lose some of its importance. The state capital was moved from nearby Chillicothe (its last location outside Columbus) to Columbus, Ohio in 1816, and the National Road (present U.S. Route 40 or more roughly Interstate 70) went through the center of Ohio. This road started at Baltimore and ending in Illinois. So, the focus of commerce in Ohio shifted from the communities along Zane's Trace to the center of the state. Among the cities the National Road crossed was Springfield, Ohio, where it arrived in 1836 and stopped for ten years while lawmakers argued about where it would go from there. Located at that terminus, Springfield especially boomed during those ten years.Several of Robert Quigley's grandchildren, the Rodgers families, had moved to Springfield. David's childhood companions were Robert Quigley's Rodgers grandchildren instead of Robert's children. Robert Quigley probably took in David King out of [...] "empty nest syndrome", since his own children were grown and likely out on their own at the time he found David. According to the Quigley Family History, Robert Quigley's second daughter Jennet [...] "Jane" [...] Quigley married James Rodgers, her Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, neighbor, and continued to live near the Robert Quigley farm. So, it was Robert Quigley's grandchildren, Richard Rodgers, Mary Rodgers, Rachel Rodgers, Dr. Robert Rogers and William Rodgers who lived close to the Quigley farm during David's childhood. They would have been the children with whom David King grew up and with whom he would have been particularly close. Their daughter Mary Rodgers married a Cumberland County neighbor, Isaac Ward. Their daughter Rachel Rodgers never married. Their son, Dr. Robert Rodgers, married Effie Harrison, daughter of a Pennsylvania Militia brigadier general. Their son William Rodgers married the sister of Effie Sarah Harrison. All of these Quigley grandchildren, their spouses and families, apparently except Eleanor, moved to Springfield, Ohio in 1831 (source in footnote says 1833). Modern day Littleton & Rue Funeral Home now occupies the Rodgers mansion at 830 North Limestone Street, Springfield, Ohio.|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{emission}} on peatland {{under oil}} palm plantation were highly varied {{probably due to}} many factors involved.   The objectives of the research were to evaluate the effect of distance sampling from center of oil palm tree on Carbon dioxide flux, and  to study the factors that cause variability of carbon dioxide flux on peatland under oil palm plantation.   The study was conducted on peatland at Arang-Arang Village, Kumpek Ulu Sub-District, Muaro Jambi District, Jambi Province, on six year old oil palm plantation.   The {{study was conducted in}} the form of observational exploratory.   Emission measurements performed on 5 selected oil palm trees at points within 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 cm from the center of trunk.   Carbon dioxide flux was measured using (IRGA), Li-COR 820.   The results showed that there is significant correlation between the distance of sampling from center of oil palm tree and Carbon dioxide flux.   The farther distance from the tree, Carbon dioxide flux more decreased. Before applying fertilizer, variability of soil fertility was not significantly correlated with the flux of Carbon dioxide, so the difference of Carbon dioxide flux based on distance sampling can be caused by root distribution factor.   After fertilizer application, variability of Carbon dioxide flux under the oil palm tree were beside affected by differences in root distribution, was also greatly influenced by fertilization.
