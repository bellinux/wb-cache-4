50|$|During Alito's Senate {{confirmation}} hearings following his {{nomination to the}} Supreme Court, CAP attracted attention because of its public stance against affirmative action and co-education at Princeton. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who were questioning Alito suggested that his involvement in this group could shed some light <b>on</b> his <b>stance</b> <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> and women's rights issues, which may come before him if he is confirmed as an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the Swedish society has {{become more and more}} multicultural, which has {{resulted}} {{in the fact that the}} differences between different ethnic groups have become more and more noticed and debated. Studies have shown that persons belonging to minority groups are often wronged by majority decisions, which leaves the minorities in a disadvantageous position in relation to the majority. The scientific problem is how a state should compensate different minority groups for their disadvantaged position in order to be able to guarantee justice and equality for all individuals of the state. The aim of this thesis is to examine the Swedish government’s attitude towards minority rights, and to analyse whether this coincides with Will Kymlicka’s normative minority rights theory. The research questions are: • How should the majority society treat minorities according to Kymlicka? • Which is Swedish <b>minority</b> policy’s <b>stance</b> <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> rights? The methods used in this thesis include a qualitative text analysis and a field investigation among Finnish-speaking people living in Borlänge. The conclusion of this essay is that the Swedish government in all likelihood has a positive attitude towards minority rights, since it has assigned group differentiated rights to the national minorities in Sweden. Furthermore, the Swedish government’s view <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> rights coincides to a great extent with Will Kymlicka’s normative theory...|$|R
50|$|United Russia {{has always}} characterised itself as wholly {{supportive}} of {{the agenda of the}} popular current President Vladimir Putin, and this has proved key to its success. A survey, whose results were presented by Henry E. Hale in 2008 at the Annual Meeting of American Political Science Association, indicates that the Russian population associates the party with a market economic orientation, opposition to communism, a moderately pro-Western foreign policy and a tough <b>stance</b> <b>on</b> rebellious <b>minority</b> regions like Chechnya. Voters who support such values are significantly more likely to vote for United Russia. Survey results also provide clear evidence that Russians tend to credit United Russia (as well as Putin) for improvements in the economy.|$|R
