5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his <b>son.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first half of the 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} {{his vision of the}} 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E
5|$|Grayburn was {{promoted}} to war substantive lieutenant in 1942 and married Marcelle Chambers, {{with whom he had}} a <b>son,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year. However, the Ox and Bucks remained on the home front and Grayburn became bored with the inactivity. Instead he applied to the Parachute Regiment and in June 1943 he was transferred to the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The following year he was transferred to the regiment's 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, and took command of 2 Platoon, A Company.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, daughters {{currently}} inherit {{on average}} more than <b>sons.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past, however, the eldest <b>son</b> was favored <b>in</b> matters of land inheritance. During the Colonial Period, {{the eldest son}} inherited twice more than <b>the</b> other <b>sons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern colonies (these inheritance laws were modelled on Mosaic Law), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern colonies there was a rule of male primogeniture.|$|R

5|$|Horsefield did not confine his {{scientific}} interests to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged his <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last pursuit, {{taking him to}} meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope. John Horsefield developed {{an interest in the}} subject {{to the extent that he}} constructed an orrery, much to the bewilderment of his neighbours.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{he made a}} cameo {{appearance}} in the sport/crime drama The Big Man, opposite Liam Neeson, and in which Grant assumed a Scottish accent.

In 1991, he played Julie Andrews' gay <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ABC made-for-television film Our Sons.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley {{testified that}} she had {{instructed}} her son to watch his manners in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do it without a thought.

5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1800. Other gossip declared the child {{was the product of}} rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular. Historians are divided on the validity of these stories, as some believe she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family's political enemies.|$|E

5|$|Adam Mickiewicz {{was born}} on 24 December 1798, either at his {{paternal}} uncle's estate in Zaosie (now Zavosse) near Navahrudak (in Polish, Nowogródek) or in Navahrudak itself {{in what was then}} part of the Russian Empire and is now Belarus. The region was on the periphery of Lithuania proper and {{had been part of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either Polish or Polonized. The poet's father, Mikołaj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish nobility (szlachta) and bore the hereditary Poraj coat-of-arms; Adam's mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, née Majewska. Adam was the second-born <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family.|$|E

5|$|Between 1993 and 1994, Vikram {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} films where he portrayed supporting roles. He {{appeared in}} three successful Malayalam films by appearing with Mammooty, Suresh Gopi and Jayaram in Joshi's successful action film Dhruvam, before teaming up with Gopi again for Shaji Kailas's Mafia, which explored Bangalore's criminal underworld. Furthermore, Joshi cast him again alongside Mammooty in the action drama Sainyam in the role of an air cadet. During the period, Vikram also appeared in the small budget Telugu film Chirunavvula Varamistava in the lead role and as Akkineni Nageswara Rao's eldest <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family drama Bangaru Kutumbam with both films failing commercially. A brief return to Tamil films also proved unsuccessful, with his role in Vikraman's multistarrer Pudhiya Mannargal with music composed by A. R. Rahman turning out to be a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Princess Andrew {{was in the}} {{difficult}} situation of having sons-in-law fighting on the German side and a <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Royal Navy. Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation of Athens by Axis forces in April 1941. She and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece (the mother of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent), lived in Athens {{for the duration of}} the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa. She moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law George's three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross, helped organize soup kitchens for the starving populace and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Louise, who was married to the Crown Prince. She organized two shelters for orphaned and stray children, and a nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Henry, {{a younger}} <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hastings family, became a Royalist {{commander}} in the Midlands. He based {{himself out of the}} castle until he was forced to surrender it after a long siege. A fresh rebellion occurred in 1648, leading Parliament to slight the castle in order to prevent it being used militarily: the two towers were badly damaged with gunpowder and undermining. Parts of the remaining castle were turned into a new house and continued to be used by members of the Hastings family for many years, although they moved their main residence to Donington Hall.|$|E

5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E
5|$|Liubartas (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' {{youngest}} <b>son.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1320s {{he married}} a daughter of Andrew of Galicia and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother Lev of Galicia's deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The Galicia–Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370, when Poland received Galicia, while Lithuania retained Volhynia. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.|$|E
5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn <b>son</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family in this way has continued since.|$|E
