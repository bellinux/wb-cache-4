Andy challenges Mark to a game of pool with the hopes of hustling him, but Mark turns out to be an excellent player and wins multiple games.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and <b>says</b> <b>a</b> prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with.

50|$|When {{faced with}} an {{opposing}} team using the end run, one requires three things to stop it: outside containment (from <b>say</b> <b>a</b> cornerback), defense of the cutback (from <b>say</b> <b>a</b> defensive end), and a safety person (to defend the halfback pass).|$|R
25|$|Corso <b>says</b> <b>a</b> covert {{government}} {{group was}} assembled {{under the leadership}} of Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, the first director of Central Intelligence (see Majestic 12). Among its tasks was to collect all information on off-planet technology. The US administration simultaneously discounted the existence of flying saucers {{in the eyes of the}} public, Corso says.|$|E
25|$|Shariah also {{includes}} stoning and explicitly states that stones used must be {{small enough to}} not kill instantly. As of July 2010, the Iranian penal code authorizes stoning as a punishment. However, Iran <b>says</b> <b>a</b> new draft of the penal code that has removed stoning is currently under review by the Iranian parliament {{and has yet to}} be ratified.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to skeptical explanations, Bruce Maccabee <b>says</b> <b>a</b> meteor theory would require impossibly slow speeds and durations for brightly glowing meteors on a horizontal trajectory. He {{says it is}} impossible for a bird to be as bright as reported by Arnold, and that birds—which could not fly as fast as Arnold's plane—would have steadily moved backward, not forwards, relative to his position.|$|E

60|$|The poet {{intended}} no {{allusion to}} the word “Erota” itself; but says that her very name, “the proud Erota,” became a character and adage;—as we <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> Quixote or a Brutus: so to <b>say</b> <b>an</b> “Erota,” expressed female pride and insolence of beauty.|$|R

25|$|For Ferdowsi, the Turanians/Anērānians (often used interchangeably) are unquestionably {{the villains}} of the piece. Their {{conflict}} with Iranians {{is the main}} theme of the Shahnameh and {{accounts for more than}} half of the text. The deaths of heroes and other admirable figures are frequently attributed to Turanians. Thus Shahnameh 5.92 <b>says</b> <b>a</b> Turanian raider named Tur-Baratur killed the 77-year-old Zoroaster in Balkh.|$|E
25|$|During Great Lent {{a number}} {{of changes in the}} office take place. On Monday through Thursday, after the three fixed psalms, the Reader <b>says</b> <b>a</b> kathisma from the Psalter. The Troparion of the Day is {{replaced}} by special Lenten hymns that are chanted with prostrations. Then a portion of the Ladder of Divine Ascent may be read. The Kontakion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten troparia. Near the end of the Hour, the Prayer of St. Ephraim is said, with prostrations.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{motivation}} {{of the theory}} is that projective modules (at least over certain commutative rings) are analogues of vector bundles. This can be made precise for the ring of continuous real-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space, {{as well as for the}} ring of smooth functions on a smooth manifold (see Serre–Swan theorem that <b>says</b> <b>a</b> finitely generated projective module over the space of smooth functions on a compact manifold is the space of smooth sections of a smooth vector bundle).|$|E

25|$|The Gentlemen v Players series ended {{after the}} 1962 season, when the {{distinction}} between amateur and professional players was abolished. Charles Williams has described several reports on the subject which were submitted to MCC by its Amateur Status Standing Committee (ASSC) and, on 31 January 1963, the MCC committee unanimously agreed to abolish amateurism. Williams <b>says</b> <b>a</b> substitute fixture was sought but it was decided not to pursue this as the new Gillette Cup limited overs competition was beginning in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Yumedono {{is one of}} {{the main}} constructions in the Tō-in area, built on the ground which was once Prince Shōtoku's private palace, Ikaruga no miya. The present {{incarnation}} of this hall was built in 739 to assuage the Prince's spirit. The hall acquired its present-day common name in the Heian period, after a legend that <b>says</b> <b>a</b> Buddha arrived as Prince Shōtoku and meditated in a hall that existed here. The hall also contains the famous Yumedono Kannon (also Kuse-, or Guze Kannon); which is only displayed at certain times of the year.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Raven informs Officer Ed Price (Lawson), {{the head}} of the police department, that he wants Tom to meet him alone. If he agrees he will leave the Richmond alone. Price tells Tom to get out of town. Tom, Ellen, and McCoy leave on a train. He knocks out Ellen and returns to town for a climactic fight with Raven. Tom defeats Raven and the {{defeated}} gang carries their leader away. Later that night, Tom <b>says</b> <b>a</b> final goodbye to Ellen and rides off with McCoy.|$|E

25|$|In {{anticipation}} of the 2010 Harley Bike Week rally, a local Harley-Davidson dealership said events would still take place for their bike week event, but on a reduced schedule of only 5 days, May 11 to 16, while the website Myrtle Beach Bike Week, LLC <b>says</b> <b>a</b> full-length rally of May 716 would take place. Both sources say {{there would be no}} vendors inside the city limits of Myrtle Beach during the Harley Bike Week, and they both encouraged attendees to boycott the city and patronize those communities and businesses outside the city which did support Harley Bike Week.|$|E
25|$|In childhood, Vātsyāyana <b>says,</b> <b>a</b> {{person should}} {{learn how to}} make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass one should {{concentrate}} on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth. The Kama Sutra acknowledges that the senses can be dangerous: 'Just as a horse in full gallop, blinded by the energy of his own speed, pays no attention to any post or hole or ditch on the path, so two lovers, blinded by passion, in the friction of sexual battle, are caught up in their fierce energy and pay no attention to danger' (2.7.33).|$|E
25|$|An {{organisation}} called Students for a Democratic University instigated {{a petition}} {{for a special}} general meeting under the SFSS's bylaws and the Society Act of British Columbia that called for the impeachment of seven directors and two bylaw changes that would alter funding and decision-making authority within the SFSS. The petition had signatures from 9.8% of all students, exceeding the 5% required to call a meeting, according to an SFSS bylaw. Despite this, the directors up for impeachment insisted the petition was insufficient, quoting the Society Act, which <b>says</b> <b>a</b> meeting must be called if 10% sign a petition.|$|E
