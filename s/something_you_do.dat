Stated Keyes, [...] "I see the black people in South Africa as the most critical positive factor for eliminating apartheid and building the future of that country... And that is not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with rhetoric, slogans and noninvolvement. It's not something you will achieve through disinvestment." ...|$|E
500|$|Sociologists Virginia Rutter and Pepper Schwartz {{consider}} Alvy and Annie's {{relationship to}} be a stereotype {{of gender differences}} in sexuality. The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as [...] "the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on." [...] Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise {{of his relationship with}} Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that [...] "It's never <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> That's how people are. Love fades," [...] a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately [...] "irrational and crazy and absurd", but a necessity of life. Christopher Knight points out that Annie Hall is framed through Alvy's experiences. [...] "Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience's interpretative favor." [...] He suggests that because Allen's films blur the protagonist with [...] "past and future protagonists {{as well as with the}} director himself", it [...] "makes a difference as to whether we are most responsive to the director's or the character's framing of events". Knight believes Alvy's quest upon meeting Annie is carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note. Despite the narrative's framing, [...] "the joke is on Alvy." ...|$|E

[...] In 1997, Stone was one of 34 celebrities to sign an open letter to then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, which protested against the treatment of Scientologists in Germany and compared it to the Nazis' oppression of Jews in the 1930s. [...] In 2003, Stone was a signatory of the third Humanist Manifesto.|$|E

Hedrick served Garcia as a model {{not only as a}} painter but as an expositor of a way of life. To Garcia, Hedrick was a genuine beatnik. Hedrick thought Garcia bright and hip, and advised Garcia to attend poetry {{readings}} at the North Beach coffee houses, such as the Co-Existence Bagel Shop, the social centre of the Beat community. It was Hedrick who turned the young Garcia on to acoustic blues and Jack Kerouac’s On the Road and all its attendant attitudes. On the Road changed Garcia’s life forever. “Wally taught me that art is not only <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> but something you are.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 5 the Rays were {{involved}} in a benches clearing brawl at Fenway Park with the Boston Red Sox following a series of events leading up from the previous night's game. In the previous game, Red Sox Center Fielder Coco Crisp attempted to steal 2nd Base, and slid into the base head first. Rays Shortstop Jason Bartlett who was covering the base on the play, knelt on his left knee while attempting to catch the throw from Catcher Dioner Navarro, which blocked the base and caused Crisp to make contact with Bartlett's leg, jamming Crisp's thumb. Crisp was safe on the play. Crisp stated that Bartlett's actions were [...] "not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> You can do that, but that's shady. And he's not a bad dude, but that was shady.
