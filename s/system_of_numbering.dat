25|$|After {{migrating}} {{further to}} the Shire, its Hobbits begin Shire Reckoning, a new <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbering</b> the year. Year 1 of Shire Reckoning corresponds to {{the foundation of the}} Shire in the year 1601 of the Third Age (the founders are the Bree Hobbits Marcho and Blanco). Therefore, years of the Third Age can be converted to Shire-years by subtracting 1600. The last year of the Third Age is year 1421 on the Shire calendar. A year in the Shire is the same length as our year – 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds. The Shire's calendar year is also divided into 12 months but all of 30 days. Five additional days are added to create a 365-day year.|$|E

25|$|In Pakistan, stamp {{programmes}} are not {{issued in}} advance. Earlier, collectors could almost {{always count on}} stamps being issued {{on at least two}} dates: 23 March and 14 August. However, in recent years, the 23 March issues have become less frequent. The number of stamps issue per year also varies. However, no matter how many issues are released, their total cost rarely exceeds Rs. 300/- (approx USD 5). Besides postage stamps and souvenir sheets, the post office also sells first day covers, leaflets with and without stamps on it and postal stationery. Earlier, the post office did not use any specific numbering system but this changed when they started using a rather simple system on their leaflets: xxxx – y where xxxx is the year and y is the issue number within that year. All major catalogues include Pakistani stamps in them. Two local updated catalogues are available, each of which uses its own <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbering.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, four exemplifications of the {{original}} 1215 charter remain in existence, held by the British Library and the cathedrals of Lincoln and Salisbury. There are also {{a handful of the}} subsequent charters in public and private ownership, including copies of the 1297 charter in both the United States and Australia. The original charters were written on parchment sheets using quill pens, in heavily abbreviated medieval Latin, which was the convention for legal documents at that time. Each was sealed with the royal great seal (made of beeswax and resin sealing wax): very few of the seals have survived. Although scholars refer to the 63 numbered [...] "clauses" [...] of Magna Carta, this is a modern <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbering,</b> introduced by Sir William Blackstone in 1759; {{the original}} charter formed a single, long unbroken text.

2500|$|Therefore, the {{references}} to Pepi I's first jubilee being celebrated in his 18th cattle count are likely just part of this royal tendency to emphasize the king's first jubilee {{years after it was}} first celebrated and Michel Baud (and F.

2500|$|Dionysius is {{best known}} as the {{inventor}} of the Anno Domini era, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar. He used it to identify the several Easters in his Easter table, but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year; he himself stated that the [...] "present year" [...] was [...] "the consulship of Probus Junior", which he also stated was 525 years [...] "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbering</b> years to replace the Diocletian years that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one [...] "Victorian cycle" [...] (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable Bede to date the events in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in 731.|$|E
