25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{required}} new safety equipment. A new energy-absorbing steering column {{was accompanied by}} an energy-absorbing steering wheel, padded instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers. A <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> option was also featured, and the brake master cylinder was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.|$|E
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual brake master cylinder used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|E
25|$|Early models {{featured}} {{front seat}} three-point harnesses where the <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> was {{fixed to the}} seat itself. This was found to offer too little strength and was replaced with one fixed to the fuselage behind the seat {{as part of a}} 1987 Airworthiness Directive (AD). In spite of being designed specifically to avoid fatigue issues, the series has been subject to a number of ADs due to fatigue cracking, both in the main wing and the elevator.|$|E
50|$|All Legacy wagons sold in Europe {{came with}} rear seat {{headrests}} and 3-point outboard position lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> as standard equipment, whereas rear headrests were available on upper trim levels elsewhere. All international Legacy, except the USA, had front seat adjustable anchor <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... 1993: On 7-passenger models, the {{optional}} [...] "Quad Command" [...] bucket seats replaced the middle bench seat. The right bucket tilted forward to ease entry and exit to the rearmost bench. The front <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> became height-adjustable and rear <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> had lower anchor points and the horn button was black.|$|R
25|$|It {{was common}} for {{infantry}} soldiers {{to wear a}} cross belt consisting of two white buff leather straps which made an X across their chests; one belt held a bayonet {{and the other a}} cartridge box. Officers wore one <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> which often supported a sabre scabbard or pistol cartridge box, since they did not carry a musket. The belts had a plate at the center which identified a soldier's regiment. Soldiers were issued white pipe clay which was used to whiten the belts to maintain their appearance.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 2001, Taylor was {{critically}} {{injured in}} a car accident in Atlanta, Georgia. The driver, her then boyfriend Chad Renegar, was attempting to answer his cell phone when he lost control of the car and smashed into a utility pole. Taylor was wearing her automatic <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> at the time, and she was not thrown from the vehicle. However, she suffered severe internal injuries, including a collapsed lung and serious liver damage, and two steel rods had to be implanted in her back to hold her spine together. The accident left her unconscious and in a coma for six weeks and then bedridden for an additional month. She was treated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and had approximately 56 operations and substantial physical therapy.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968 For 1968, Chevelle got a {{new body}} style (though still under the 817 and 817 {{internal}} designations) emphasized the [...] "Coke bottle" [...] look even more. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights on each fender, as well as <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> for outboard front-seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967. This explains why some '68s had <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts,</b> and some early-production cars did not. However, all '68s had anchors for the belts. Manual transmission cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] smog pump, which added complexity under the hood.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, GM {{made its}} [...] "Air Cushion Restraint System" [...] (ACRS) {{available}} as a regular production option (RPO code AR3) in full-size Cadillacs, Buick and Oldsmobile models. The GM cars from the 1970s equipped with ACRS had a driver-side airbag, a driver-side knee restraint (which consists of a padded lower dashboard), and a passenger-side airbag. The passenger-side airbag protects both front passengers and unlike most newer ones, it integrated a knee cushion and a torso cushion, and it also had dual stage deployment which varied depending on {{the force of the}} impact. The cars equipped with ACRS had lap belts for all seating positions but they did not have <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> were already mandatory equipment in the United States on closed cars without airbags for the driver and outer front passenger seating positions, but GM chose to market its airbags as a substitute for <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts.</b> Prices for this option on Cadillac models were USD$225 in 1974, USD$300 in 1975, and USD$340 in 1976.|$|R
25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts,</b> side marker lights, and headrests.|$|R
500|$|Thus, {{throughout}} the Napoleonic wars, the 52nd foot continued to wear red uniforms with buff facings. The officers had silver lace, {{while the other}} ranks' lace was worn in pairs, red with orange stripes (according to 1802 regulations); in 1812 a commentator described the lace as red with two blue stripes. Light infantry officers wore short jackets, rather than the tailed coats of the other line regiments, with white piping, silver buttons, and silver and scarlet shoulder wings. The uniform was completed with a crimson sash; to match the buff facings and turn-backs, the officers generally wore buff breeches, or grey overalls. Field officers of the 52nd wore silver epaulettes, with regimental badge, overtop the light infantry wings, to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated these be badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Light infantry also commonly wore a narrow waist belt instead of the customary <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt.</b> The 52nd did not adopt the [...] "Belgic cap" [...] but retained the stovepipe shako {{throughout the}} Napoleonic period; it was adorned with the brass bugle badge and green plumes of the light infantry. In the 52nd, officers' plumes were made from horsehair. Officers generally carried a stirrup-hilted sabre.|$|E
2500|$|... 1967 saw the {{introduction}} of U.S. mandated safety equipment to improve occupant protection during a crash, including an energy-absorbing steering column, non-protruding control knobs, 4-way hazard flasher, soft interior surfaces, locking seat backs (on 2-door models), a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system (with warning light), and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors. [...] The Rivieras complied on all counts and featured {{the full range of}} safety features.|$|E
2500|$|The Valiant was {{completely}} redesigned for 1967 model {{year and the}} station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly-styled Barracuda, which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style. [...] The new Valiant model range included 2- and 4-door sedans on a newly lengthened [...] wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical taillights were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the [...] Slant-6 engine was raised from [...] to [...] by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 carburetors using the larger [...] throttle bore previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller [...] carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine. [...] Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way hazard flasher, and, for 1970, lane-change directional signals were included.|$|E
50|$|The {{roll cage}} was {{extended}} in 1992 {{to allow for}} rear <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts,</b> and anti-lock brakes were added as an option the next year. An automatic transmission option for 4-cylinder Wranglers came in 1994, along with a center high-mounted brake light.|$|R
25|$|Like all 1968 {{passenger}} vehicles {{sold in the}} United States, GTOs now featured front outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> (cars built after January 1, 1968) and side marker lights. To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cross belt}} is two {{connected}} straps worn across {{the body to}} distribute the weight of loads, carried at the hip, across the shoulders and trunk. It is roughly identical to two <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> joined with a single buckle {{at the center of}} the chest.|$|R
2500|$|The 1969 88 series {{dropped the}} Delmont name, leaving the Delta 88 {{as the base}} model of the series. The Royale trim {{appeared}} on a top-line Holiday coupe and came standard with a more luxurious interior featuring a notchback vinyl upholstered bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with optional center console. For safety, a ceiling mounted <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> was offered in the front seats for both the driver and right passenger. This arrangement provided five belt buckles in the front bench seat. [...] The standard engine in the base Delta 88 was a 350 cubic-inch 9.0 to 1 low compression ratio Rocket V8 with a Rochester two-barrel carburetor that was rated at [...] at 4,600rpm and [...] of torque ran on leaded regular 94 RON gasoline. Standard on the Delta 88 Custom and Royale models and optional on the base series was a low compression two-barrel version of the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at [...] designed to use regular fuel. Optional on all Delta 88s was the four-barrel Ultra High Compression 455 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 rated at [...] Top option was the [...] version of the four-barrel 455 V8 designed to run on 98 RON octane fuel available in all Delta 88 models as the W-33 option.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillight lenses were all red as the backup lights were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps {{in the center of the}} taillights. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional [...] Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the [...] 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the [...] and [...] V8s was now optional with the [...] Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> anchors.|$|E
60|$|About {{his neck}} hung the golden chain from which {{depended}} the diamond encrusted locket of his mother, the Lady Alice. At {{his back was}} a quiver of arrows slung from a leathern <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt,</b> another piece of loot from some vanquished black.|$|E
5000|$|The 1991 {{facelift}} included revised grill, headlights, turn signals, badges, and hubcaps - {{as well as}} {{reduction of}} towing hooks to two from four. Later North American models featured [...] "automatic" [...] non-motorized front seat <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> along with a knee-bar and manual front lap belts.|$|R
50|$|Children {{traveling}} by plane are safer {{in a child}} safety seat than in a parent's arms. The FAA and the AAP recommend that all children under 40 lb use a child safety seat on a plane. Booster seats cannot be used on airplanes because they don't have <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Use of seatbelts in late model {{cars with}} {{automatic}} or manual belt systems {{was observed in}} suburban Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In cars with automatic two-point belt systems, the use of <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> by drivers was substantially {{higher than in the}} same model cars with manual three-point belts. This finding was true in varying degrees whatever the type of automatic belt, including cars with detachable nonmotorized belts, cars with detachable motorized belts, and especially cars with nondetachable motorized belts. Most of these automatic <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> systems include manual lap belts. Use of lap belts was lower in cars with automatic two-point belt systems than in the same model cars with manual three-point belts; precisely how much lower could not be reliably estimated in this survey. Use of <b>shoulder</b> and lap <b>belts</b> was slightly higher in General Motors cars with detachable automatic three-point belts compared with the same model cars with manual three-point belts; in Hondas {{there was no difference in}} the rates of use of manual three-point belts and the rates of use of automatic three-point belts...|$|R
60|$|In {{one hand}} the {{creature}} carried a stout club, and suspended at its left side from a <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> was a short, sheathed knife, while a cross belt supported a pouch at its right hip. Confining these straps {{to the body}} and also apparently supporting the loin cloth was a broad girdle which glittered in the moonlight as though encrusted with virgin gold, and was clasped {{in the center of}} the belly with a huge buckle of ornate design that scintillated as with precious stones.|$|E
60|$|He {{advanced}} {{quickly to}} seize her {{and as he}} laid a rough hand upon her she struck him heavily upon {{the side of his}} head with her golden breastplates. Without a sound Es-sat, the chief, sank to the floor of the apartment. For a moment Pan-at-lee bent over him, her improvised weapon raised to strike again should he show signs of returning consciousness, her glossy breasts rising and falling with her quickened breathing. Suddenly she stooped and removed Es-sat's knife with its scabbard and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt.</b> Slipping it over her own shoulder she quickly adjusted her breastplates and keeping a watchful glance upon the figure of the fallen chief, backed from the room.|$|E
60|$|The age of {{the young}} {{traveller}} might be about nineteen, or betwixt that and twenty; and his face and person, which were very prepossessing, did not, however, belong to {{the country in which}} he was now a sojourner. His short gray cloak and hose were rather of Flemish than of French fashion, while the smart blue bonnet, with a single sprig of holly and an eagle's feather, was already recognized as the Scottish head gear. His dress was very neat, and arranged with the precision of a youth conscious of possessing a fine person. He had at his back a satchel, which seemed to contain a few necessaries, a hawking gauntlet on his left hand, though he carried no bird, and in his right a stout hunter's pole. Over his left shoulder hung an embroidered scarf which sustained a small pouch of scarlet velvet, such as was then used by fowlers of distinction to carry their hawks' food, and other matters belonging to that much admired sport. This was crossed by another <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt,</b> to which was hung a hunting knife, or couteau de chasse. Instead of the boots of the period, he wore buskins of half dressed deer's skin.|$|E
5000|$|Changes for the 1968 model {{increased}} safety with a two-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel, {{along with}} newly introduced <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts.</b> Other changes included {{front and rear}} side markers, [...] "FORD" [...] lettering removed from hood, rearview mirror moved from frame to windshield, a 302 cuin L V8 engine was now available, and C-Stripe graphics were added.|$|R
50|$|The 1968 Furys {{received}} only minor grille and taillight trim updates, along with {{side marker lights}} and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> for front outboard occupants (except the convertible). Parking lights now illuminated with the headlights, which meant that if one headlight was inoperative in low beam, that other drivers wouldn't mistake your car for a motorcycle in the dark.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, the US federal 5 mph bumper impact {{standards}} were expanded to cover rear bumpers {{as well as}} front ones, {{and as a result}} the Swinger and Dart sedan's rear bumpers grew much more massive. Taillights larger than the previous year's items were set above the rear bumper, rather than within it. <b>Shoulder</b> and lap <b>belts</b> were finally combined in all Chrysler products into a retractable, inertia-sensitive, single-buckle design Chrysler called [...] "Unibelt", replacing the difficult-to-use separate lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> that had been installed through 1973.|$|R
50|$|A <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> {{was worn}} in various configurations, {{depending}} on army and rank. For example, an officer may have only worn one <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> as appropriate for only having a pistol. A light horseman {{may have also}} worn one <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt,</b> for their cartridge pouch.|$|E
5000|$|Manual {{lap belt}} with {{automatic}} non-motorized <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> — This system {{was used in}} American-market vehicles such as the Hyundai Excel and Volkswagen Jetta. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> is fixed to the aft upper corner of the vehicle door, and is not motorized. The lap belt must be fastened manually.|$|E
50|$|Most commonly, {{scabbards}} {{were worn}} suspended from a sword belt or <b>shoulder</b> <b>belt</b> called a baldric.|$|E
50|$|All 2G Eclipses came {{standard}} {{with driver}} and front-passenger air bags, side-guard door beams, {{front and rear}} body structure crumple zones, 5 mph energy absorbing bumpers, safety-cage body construction, 4- wheel disc brakes (except RS), three-point ELR/ALR lap/shoulder safety belts (ELR only for driver) and height adjustable front <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts.</b> Anti-lock brakes was optional on all models (except for RS).|$|R
2500|$|Regular Chevelle engines {{started with}} a [...] Turbo-Thrift six or the new [...] Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a [...] version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual {{transmission}} cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights, as well as <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{vehicles}} had rear lap belts only on {{the lower}} trim levels and 3-point outboard position lap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>belts</b> with a center rear position lap belt on all vehicles with the 2.0-liter engine. Seat belt pre-tensioners with Emergency Locking Retractors (called E.L.R.) were standard equipment in Japanese vehicles with the VZ trim package and all vehicles equipped with the turbocharged engine.|$|R
