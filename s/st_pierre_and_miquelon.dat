25|$|Part of the {{residual}} legitimacy of the Vichy regime resulted from the continued ambivalence of U.S. and other leaders. President Roosevelt continued to cultivate Vichy, and promoted General Henri Giraud as a preferable alternative to de Gaulle, despite the poor performance of Vichy forces in North Africa—Admiral François Darlan had landed in Algiers the day before Operation Torch. Algiers was headquarters of the Vichy French XIX Army Corps, which controlled Vichy military units in North Africa. Darlan was neutralized within 15 hours by a 400-strong French resistance force. Roosevelt and Churchill accepted Darlan, rather than de Gaulle, as the French leader in North Africa. De Gaulle had not even been informed of the landing in North Africa. The United States also resented the Free French taking control of <b>St</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon</b> on 24 December 1941, because, Secretary of State Hull believed, it interfered with a U.S.-Vichy agreement {{to maintain the status}} quo with respect to French territorial possessions in the western hemisphere.|$|E

In 1783 the British signed the Treaty of Paris with the United States that gave American fishermen similar rights along the coast.

The Vikings might have found the island a useful refuge and restocking point after their depredations on the mainland [...] The island issued its own coins and, in 1929, its own stamps with denominations in [...] "puffins". Other countries and dependencies which have depicted Atlantic puffins on their stamps include Alderney, Canada, the Faroe Islands, France, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Iceland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, <b>St</b> <b>Pierre</b> et <b>Miquelon</b> <b>and</b> the United Kingdom.

25|$|The first {{map that}} showed Saint <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon</b> was the Mappa mundi of 1500 created by Juan de la Cosa, {{where they were}} {{labelled}} 'Illa de la Trenidat'. There are some who argue that the 'Green Islands' encountered during the two pre-1472 Portuguese expeditions under João Vaz Corte-Real and the 1501 Portuguese expedition under his son Gaspar Corte-Real were <b>St.</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> the islands near it. A map drawn by Johannes Ruysch published in 1507 depicts <b>Miquelon,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding islands, and labelled as Barbatos.|$|R
2500|$|Starting in 1920, the US {{passed the}} Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution {{which led to}} Prohibition. As a result, <b>St.</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon</b> became the {{transshipment}} point for bringing illegal alcohol from Canada into the United States. Some Canadian provinces also experimented with prohibition as well, but alcohol manufacturers in Canada were still allowed to distil liquor for export. A French law forbidding the importation of foreign liquor was repealed in 1922, drastically increasing the alcohol smuggling operations. Canadian whisky, Caribbean rum and legally imported French wines and spirits were the main products smuggled into and then reshipped from the islands.|$|E

The United States and Canada both threatened armed intervention, despite Free France being an ally of both countries. However, [...] US Secretary of State Cordell Hull then disclaimed any further U.S interest in the islands, and the islands were not critical to any Allied country.|$|E

2500|$|The {{change of}} {{terminology}} from external affairs to foreign affairs recognized, albeit belatedly, a shift {{that had occurred}} many years before. At {{the time that the}} external affairs portfolio was created in 1909, Canada was a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire and did not have an independent foreign policy. Under s. 132 of the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal government had authority to conduct and implement relations with [...] other parts of the British Empire, which were not considered foreign lands. The United Kingdom and other colonial powers still routinely divided their conduct of overseas policy into foreign affairs (e.g. the UK's Foreign Office) and domestic or colonial affairs (the Colonial Office or Dominion Office, which were later reorganized and combined into one department, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). Diplomacy outside the Empire (e.g. between Canada and its non-Empire neighbours, the United States, Russia, <b>St.</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon,</b> and Greenland) were conducted by the foreign office of the United Kingdom. Informally, however, Canada had had relations with the United States in particular, with trade and other relationships pre-dating Confederation.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socioeconomic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However, in the Soviet sphere during the period of the Warsaw Pact Poland adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, so the Bahá'ís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and properties. From 1947 - 1950 Bahá'ís were still known to be in seven cities in Poland. In 1948 there was a known group studying the religion in Warsaw. While the Bahá'ís in Poland were retreating from public view, in Chicago, the largest ethnically Polish population outside of Warsaw, saw the rise of the first Bahá'í House of Worship in the West and was completed in 1953. In 1960 a Bahá'í traveled from Poland to Luxembourg for a Bahá'í meeting. By 1963 only Warsaw was recognized as having an active community. After that, until about 1989, the Soviet oppression of religions ended public activities of the religion. See also other Soviet block countries which had Bahá'í communities like Ukraine, Turkmenistan among others. [...] While the Bahá'í community became all but unknown, the religion had been the object of some academic and popular commentary in Poland over the years. There are several distinctions between Soviet coverage translated into Polish and native Polish coverage of the Bahá'í Faith. There were differences in sources cited, periods when the works were published, and attitudes about the religion presented. Most Soviet translations cited works from Persian antagonists of the religion. The native Polish works cited leaders of the religion or western or earlier Polish academics. For the native Polish works no Russian or Soviet publications, either in translation or in original, were cited. The translations from Soviet academics largely came from the later period during Soviet domination of Poland while most of the native Polish references were from the period before. The Soviet sources tried to portray the history of the religion as supporting the philosophy of Dialectical materialism of Soviet communism as an early anti-feudal movement but in the end supporting imperialism and colonialism. Contrary to this, native Polish works were either neutral or sympathetic to the religion, including publications from the Catholic Church in Poland. One of the few Polish Bahá'ís known from this period was Ola Pawlowska, a native of Poland who had fled during World War II and settled in Canada where she {{became a member of the}} religion. In 1953 she became a Knight of Bahá'u'lláh when she moved to <b>St.</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon</b> Islands. In 1969 she was traveling in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1971 at the age 61 she returned to Poland for a period of almost 2 years before pioneering to Luxemburg and then Zaire where she took interest in the Pygmy population. Lisa Janti, better known as Lisa Montell, a Hollywood actress of the 1950s and 60s, was born Irena Augustynowic and her family fled Poland before World War II. In the 1960s she joined the religion and then worked on several advocacy projects while continuing to work in the arts. Contact at the time was so minimal that it is worth noting Polish visitors to Bahá'í Houses of Worship: before 1973 some visited the temple in Panama who were surprised to meet a guide who could speak a little Polish and in May 1978 a dance troupe from Poland visited the one near Chicago. In 1979 a Polish citizen attending an Esperantist convention joined the religion.|$|E
