5|$|The CSF {{occupies}} the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around {{and inside the}} brain and spinal cord. It fills the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, {{as well as the}} central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are {{contained within the}} ventricles of the brains, {{but not in a}} nonexistent <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space.</b> In mammals, where a <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they are}} often {{described}} as distinct compartments, the subarachnoid cisterns are not truly anatomically distinct. Rather, these <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> are separated from each other by a trabeculated porous wall with various-sized openings.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare CT and MR in the {{differentiation}} of benign {{enlargement of the}} <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> and subdural collections in infants with macrocephaly. METHODS: MR was performed in 19 infants with macrocephaly, showing bifrontal enlargement of the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> on CT. RESULTS: In 11 patients, a single fluid layer could be distinguished on MR of the pericerebral collections, suggesting benign enlargement of the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces.</b> In eight patients, two separate layers were clearly differentiated, an outer layer that was hyperintense on all sequences and an inner layer with the same intensity as the cerebrospinal fluid. This indicated the presence of subdural collections. These collections were mainly frontal in six and extended over the entire hemisphere in two patients. On CT, these separate lesions were seen only in three patients and missed in three others. In two final patients, CT findings were equivocal with evidence of membrane formation within the hypodense collections. In seven patients with a subdural collection, subdural-external drainage was performed. In three patients, the collection was hemorrhagic. The protein content of the fluid showed a mean of 1381. 7 +/- 785. 6 mg/dL. The MR and surgical findings of a subdural collection correlated with {{the absence of a}} family history of macrocrania, an age under 5 months, and acute clinical signs of vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. CONCLUSION: MR appears essential in the differential diagnosis between benign enlargement of the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> and subdural collections in infants. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|The {{spread of}} a {{malignancy}} into body cavities can occur via penetrating {{the surface of}} the peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, or <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces.</b> For example, ovarian tumors can spread transperitoneally to {{the surface of the}} liver.|$|R
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum. There is a connection from the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space.</b> Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissection}} of {{the artery}} {{extends to the}} part of the artery that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture of the artery and accumulation of blood in the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space.</b> It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF {{circulation}} {{has been}} reported to represent {{a major factor in the}} pathophysiology of syringomyelia. Our purpose was to determine the CSF flow patterns in spinal cord cysts and in the subararachnoid space in patients with syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformation and to evaluate the modifications of the flow resulting from surgery. METHODS: Eighteen patients with syringomyelia were examined with a 3 D Fourier encod-ing velocity imaging technique. A prospectively gated 2 D axial sequence with velocity encoding in the craniocaudal direction in the cervical region was set at a velocity of 6 10 cm/s. Velocity measurements were performed in the larger portion of the cysts and, at the same cervical level, in the pericystic <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces.</b> All patients underwent a surgical procedure involving dural opening followed by duroplasty. Pre- and postoperative velocity measurements of all patients were taken, with a mean follow-up of 10. 2 months. We compared the velocity mea-surements with the morphology of the cysts and with the clinical data. Spinal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> of 19 healthy subjects were also studied using the same technique. RESULTS: A pulsatile flow was observed in syrinx cavities and in the pericystic <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> (PCSS). Preoperative maximum systolic cyst velocities were higher than were diastoli...|$|R
5000|$|The periscleral lymph {{space or}} episcleral {{space of the}} eye is {{the space between the}} outer surface of the sclera and the inner surface of the capsule of Ténon.

30|$|The CSF {{volume is}} {{approximately}} 150  ml in adults; 125  ml is {{distributed in the}} cranial and spinal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> and 25  ml {{is found in the}} ventricles [1].

5|$|In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began {{treating}} {{tubercular meningitis}} by tapping the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate {{description of the}} chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) is bleeding {{into the}} <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> — {{the area between}} the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In {{about a quarter of}} people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve arises {{as a number}} of small rootlets {{from the front of the}} medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, an opening in the occipital bone of the skull.|$|E
40|$|The present work aims {{to provide}} support in the {{diagnosis}} of hydrocephalus, which requires an assessment to the volumes of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within its total, ventricular and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces.</b> In this paper we describe a fully automatic method to estimate the CSF volumes from a new 3 D whole body MR imaging sequence. The method was developed using image properties as well as anatomical and geometrical features, completed with a topological assumption on the CSF shape. Experiments on phantoms and clinical data were performed and evaluated by comparing our assessments of volumes with those derived from a segmentation controlled by expert physicians. Then we show that a robust distinction between pathological cases and healthy adult people {{can be achieved by}} a linear discriminant analysis on volumes of the ventricular and intracranial <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces.</b> We also find that healthy adults maintain a proportional relationship between these volumes...|$|R
30|$|Though T 2 -weighted images (T 2 -WI) and fluid-attenuated {{inversion}} recovery (FLAIR) sequences {{are less}} sensitive than DWI in demonstrating parenchymal {{changes in the}} first few hours after stroke onset, loss of arterial signal void distal to a large artery occlusion may be observed immediately. Such FLAIR intravascular hyperintensities in the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> are associated with diffusion–perfusion mismatch [4].|$|R
40|$|Suprasellar {{arachnoid}} cysts (SSAC) are uncommon intracranial lesions. Two {{patients of}} SSAC presenting with precocious puberty are described. In both the cases partial excision of the cyst wall, through a pterional craniotomy, establishing {{communication with the}} basal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> was carried out.

5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
50|$|Hydrocephalus ex vacuo also {{refers to}} an {{enlargement}} of cerebral ventricles and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces,</b> and is usually due to brain atrophy (as it occurs in dementias), post-traumatic brain injuries and even in some psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. As opposed to hydrocephalus, this is a compensatory enlargement of the CSF-spaces in response to brain parenchyma loss - {{it is not the}} result of increased CSF pressure.|$|R
40|$|Meningocles {{with very}} small {{communication}} within the normal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> appeared {{the most suitable}} to be cured by an endoscopic procedure. In case of a larger communication, the meningocele could be treated, {{or at least the}} morphology can be better understood, by using a keyhole procedure under endoscopic control. In all cases the surgery was of short duration (less than 1 hour) and very well tolerated...|$|R
30|$|The atrophy of the brain, {{probably}} due to neuronal death and myelin loss, is a common feature in MPS and is seen as widened <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> and enlargement of the cortical sulci. The neuronal death {{could be explained by}} ischaemic damages due to the progressive accumulation of GAG in blood vessels [38]; on the other hand, the neuronal death could be caused by direct intracellular storage of GAG.|$|R
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space.</b> If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space.</b> They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
40|$|By intraspinous {{injections}} of specimens of poliomyelitic virus of suitable virulence infection {{can be caused}} regularly in Macacus rhesus monkeys. The virus passes from the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> into the nervous tissues in which it multiplies, and into the blood. The constant involvement of the pia-arachnoid membranes in poliomyelitis, even when no paralysis occurs, {{and the fact that}} infection can readily be produced by intraspinous inoculation suggests anew that in the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis the interstitial tissue changes within the meninges, blood vessels, and ground substance play a determining part. While the virus injected into the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> can be demonstrated there by inoculation tests forty-eight hours after the injection it can no longer be detected on the sixth day, {{at a time when the}} first symptoms of infection make their appearance. The failure of the cerebrospinal fluid from human and experimental cases of poliomyelitis to produce the disease when inoculated into monkeys is due to the fact that the virus is either fixed by the nervous tissues or passes into the blood...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Limited {{studies of}} brain MR imaging {{findings}} in Usher syndrome have reported atrophy with enlarged <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces.</b> However, the specific {{appearance of the}} <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> surrounding the cranial nerves {{has not yet been}} described. Herein we describe the skull base MR imaging findings in an adult with Usher syndrome. Multiple cranial nerve exits were enlarged to the point of causing cephaloceles with bony remodeling. A combination of uncommon findings in this rare disorder raises the question of an etiologic association. Usher syndrome, also called Graefe-Usher syndrome, is arare, congenital, autosomal recessive disorder character-ized by retinitis pigmentosa and sensorineural hearing loss, as first described by Von Graefe in 1858. 1, 2 In the United States, the prevalence is estimated at 4. 4 per 100, 000. 1 Usher syn-drome stems from a variety of genetic mutations for which a common mechanism is not well understood. 3 This syndrome is divided into 3 clinical subtypes {{on the basis of the}} temporal course and the extent of deafness: type I patients exhibit pro-found hearing loss and lack of vestibular function; type II pa...|$|R
50|$|Primary {{microcephaly}} shows {{a clinical}} image of craniosynostosis, {{but due to}} a different cause. The primary failure {{is the absence of}} growth of the brain, rendering the sutures of the cranial vault useless. As a consequence, the sutures close, presenting a pansynostosis like image.A differentiation between these two conditions can be made with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> are typically enlarged with primary microcephaly, whereas they are reduced or absent in true pansynostosis.|$|R
25|$|Vasospasm, {{referring}} to blood vessel constriction, can occur secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage following a ruptured aneurysm. This {{is most likely}} to occur within 21 days and is seen radiologically within 60% of such patients. The vasospasm is thought to be secondary to the apoptosis of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils that become trapped in the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space.</b> These cells initially invade the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space</b> from the circulation in order to phagocytose the hemorrhaged red blood cells. Following apoptosis, it is thought there is a massive degranulation of vasoconstrictors, including endothelins and free radicals, that cause the vasospasm.|$|E
25|$|A further cause {{can be a}} {{reduction}} in cerebral spinal fluid pressure which can create a low pressure in the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>space,</b> pulling the arachnoid away from the dura mater and leading to a rupture of the blood vessels.|$|E

40|$|Seventy-two {{successfully}} treated {{patients with}} acute lymphocytic leukemia, all in first complete remission and all off therapy, {{who had received}} CNS prophylaxis (radiotherapy, 2, 400 rad, plus intrathecal methotrexate), were studied by computed tomography (CT) of the brain, EEGs, and neurologic evaluations 3 to 9 {{years after the end}} of prophylaxis. Thirty-five patients showed CT brain scan abnormalities: intracranial calcifications (twelve); widening of the <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> (eight); isolated dilatation of ventricular spaces (three) and with frontal periventricular hypodensity (two); dilatation of ventricular and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> (nine); and a hypodense area (one). Only 17 patients showed aspecific EEG abnormalities which were never linked to CT scan findings. None of our patients presented major motor deficits at the neurologic examination. A stepwise logistic regression technique showed that age less than 5 years at the time of prophylaxis was the most important risk factor (p = 0. 008) of CT brain scan abnormalities followed by neurets (p = 0. 037) and sex (p = 0. 10). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis pointed out that the interactions between these variables were not significant and the effects were only of the first order...|$|R
50|$|This {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from external hydrocephalus. This is a condition generally seen in infants and involving enlarged fluid <b>spaces</b> or <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> around {{the outside of the}} brain. This is generally a benign condition that resolves spontaneously by 2 years of age. (Greenberg, Handbook of Neurosurgery, 5th Edition, pg 174). Imaging studies and a good medical history can help to differentiate external hydrocephalus from subdural hemorrhages or symptomatic chronic extra-axial fluid collections which are accompanied by vomiting, headaches and seizures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Idiopathic normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a treatable {{neurological syndrome}} in the elderly. Although the {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) findings of tight high-convexity and medial <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> and the ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt with programmable valve are reportedly useful for diagnosis and treatment, respectively, their clinical significance remains to be validated. We conducted a multicenter prospective study (Study of Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus on Neurological Improvement: SINPHONI) to evaluate {{the utility of the}} MRI-based diagnosis for determining the 1 -year outcome after VP shunt with the Codman-Hakim programmable valve. Methods Twenty-six centers in Japan were involved in this study. Patients aged between 60 and 85 years with one or more of symptoms (gait, cognitive, and urinary problems) and MRI evidence of ventriculomegaly and tight high-convexity and medial <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces</b> received VP shunt using the height/weight-based valve pressure-setting scheme. The primary endpoint was a favorable outcome (improvement of one level or more on the modified Rankin Scale: mRS) at one year after surgery, and the secondary endpoints included improvement of one point or more on the total score of the iNPH grading scale. Shunt responder was defined by more than one level on mRS at any evaluation point in one year. Results The full analysis set included 100 patients. A favorable outcome was achieved in 69. 0 % and 80. 0 % were shunt responders. When measured with the iNPH grading scale, the one-year improvement rate was 77. 0 %, and response to the surgery at any evaluation point was detected in 89. 0 %. Serious adverse events were recorded in 15 patients, three of which were events related to surgery or VP shunt. Subdural effusion and orthostatic headache were reported as non-serious shunt-related adverse events, which were well controlled with readjustment of pressure. Conclusions The MRI-based diagnostic scheme is highly useful. Tight high-convexity and medial <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>spaces,</b> and enlarged Sylvian fissures with ventriculomegaly, defined as disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH), are worthwhile for the diagnosis of iNPH.
