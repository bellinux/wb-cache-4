5|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, {{schooling}} in England {{was provided}} either on a fee-paying basis or by the Church. To ensure that all children had access to elementary education, the Forster Act 1870 set up Local School Boards to provide elementary schools for all children aged 5 to 10. From 1880, schooling became compulsory for that age group. The Education Act 1902 consolidated these boards into local education authorities and allowed them to subsidise schools with money raised from local rate-payers. Alongside a grammar school for boys, a private school for girls and a mixed National School, Sleaford had four elementary schools in 1905: two Wesleyan (one was for infants), one Catholic and one other infants school. The construction of the Bass maltings (1901–06) and the Rauceby Asylum (1897–1902) led {{to an increase in}} the town's population and school inspectors found that the four <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> not accommodate every child in the town. The indebted Wesleyan <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> not afford any enlargements so the town's elementary school managers opted for Kesteven County Council to take responsibility under the 1902 Act. The Council built a schoolhouse on Church Lane at the cost of £11,500, which opened as Sleaford Council School on 4 May 1908. The staff and pupils at the Wesleyan schools were transferred there; its first headmaster was H. H. Godfrey, who had been master at the Wesleyan school. Built with a capacity of 600 pupils, 280 were on roll when teaching commenced.|$|E
5|$|In the High Middle Ages {{there were}} {{new sources of}} education, such as song and grammar schools. These were usually {{attached}} to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were most common in the developing burghs. By {{the end of the}} Middle Ages grammar <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. Early examples including the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.|$|E
5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer be}} considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to approach them with a new perspective {{in the aftermath of}} Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E

5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|Hoosiers {{were divided}} about {{entering}} World War I. Before Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare {{and tried to}} enlist Mexico as a military ally in 1917, most Hoosiers wanted the U.S. to be neutral in the war. Support for Britain came from professions and businessmen. Opposition came from churchmen, women, farmers and Irish Catholics and German-American elements. They called for neutrality and strongly opposed going to war to rescue the British Empire. Influential Hoosiers who opposed involvement in the war included Democratic Senator John W. Kern, and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. Supporters of military preparedness included James Whitcomb Riley and George Ade. Most of the opposition dissipated when the United States officially declared war against Germany in April 1917, but some teachers lost their jobs on suspicion of disloyalty, and public <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> no longer teach in German. Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, from Terre Haute, went to federal prison for encouraging young men to evade the draft.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a cafeteria, and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair was {{critical}} of the BBC's decision, accusing it of incompetence and arrogance. Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers, including the BBC Micro and Research Machines 380Z, that <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> purchase, {{with the aid of}} a grant, for half price; Sinclair's computers were not included on the list. Sinclair responded by launching his own half-price deal, offering schools the chance to buy a ZX81 and 16 KB RAM pack for £60, plus a ZX Printer at half price, for a total cost of £90. As the cheapest Government-approved system was £130, this was an attractive offer for many schools and about 2,300 bought Sinclair's package.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the selection of Virginia Tech and Boston College, concerns about potential attendance at the 2008 ACC Championship Game arose. Because the same matchup resulted in such low attendance at the 2007 championship game in Jacksonville, it was doubted that Tampa, which is several hundred miles further south and more distant from the two <b>schools,</b> <b>could</b> attract as many spectators as the previous season's game. Adding {{to the problem of}} selling tickets was the 2008 economic crisis, which many fans cited as a reason for not purchasing tickets. By the Wednesday before the game, Virginia Tech had sold just 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets it was required by contract to sell. There also were questions about how many local fans would attend. To mitigate the problems seen in Jacksonville the year before, ticket prices were lowered from $65 to $25, and it was hoped that the lower capacity of Tampa's Raymond James Stadium compared with Jacksonville Municipal Stadium would allow for a quicker sellout. The campaign to attract more fans was moderately successful, as 30,000 of the 43,000 tickets not assigned to either school were sold by December 1, five days before the game. Team ticket sales were abysmal, however, as Virginia Tech and Boston College combined to sell just 5,000 tickets of the 20,000 allotted to the two teams.|$|E
5|$|The new {{religious}} orders {{that became a}} major feature of Scottish monastic life in this period also brought new educational possibilities {{and the need to}} train larger numbers of monks. Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had almonry schools, charity schools using funds from the almoner to provide a type of bursary to educate young boys, who might enter the priesthood. At the Cluniac Paisley Abbey, secular chaplains were employed as schoolmasters. Some monasteries, including the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, Sweetheart Abbey and Beauly, opened their doors to a wider range of students to teach the sons of gentlemen. St Andrews, which was both the seat of a bishop and the site of a major Augustinian foundation, had both a grammar school, under the archdeacon, and a song school, under the priory. The foundation of over 100 collegiate churches of secular priests between 1450 and the Reformation would have necessitated the training of large numbers of choristers. Sometimes, as at Lochwinnoch, they were taught both music and grammar. Dominican friars were noted for their educational achievements and were usually located in urban centres, probably teaching grammar, as at Glasgow and Ayr. The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> be found in all the main burghs and some small towns.|$|E

25|$|A UK DfES report {{suggested}} that Waldorf and state <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> {{learn from each}} other's strengths: in particular, that state <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> benefit from Waldorf education's early introduction and approach to modern foreign languages; combination of block (class) and subject teaching for younger children; development of speaking and listening through an emphasis on oral work; good pacing of lessons through an emphasis on rhythm; emphasis on child development guiding the curriculum and examinations; approach to art and creativity; attention given to teachers’ reflective activity and heightened awareness (in collective child study for example); and collegial structure of leadership and management, including collegial study. Aspects of mainstream practice which could inform good practice in Waldorf schools included: management skills and ways of improving organizational and administrative efficiency; classroom management; work with secondary-school age children; and assessment and record keeping.|$|E
25|$|The college-operated Primary <b>Schools</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} meet the Secondary School needs; therefore, {{additional}} Primary Schools under Navy operation were begun in late 1943.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the genetic and {{environmental}} influences underlying the relationship between dimensions of personality and school maladjustments among children and adolescents. In this study, participants were Japanese twins in grade 4 to 9, a total of 259 twin pairs. Results of bivariate genetic analyses found that patterns of school maladjustment varied by the dimension of personality. : (1) The relationship between Reward Dependence and signs of nonsocial behavior (e. g., withdrawal, avoid social situations) in <b>school</b> <b>could</b> be contributed to additive genetic and non-shared environmental influences. (2) The relationship between Novelty Seeking and signs of antisocial behavior in <b>school</b> <b>could</b> be contributed to additive genetic and non-shared environmental influences.

25|$|A key {{turning point}} for braille {{literacy}} was {{the passage of the}} Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an act of Congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools. Because {{only a small percentage of}} public <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> afford to train and hire braille-qualified teachers, braille literacy has declined since the law took effect. Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{tasks for}} the Education Detachment {{included}} providing advice on where new <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> be built, providing educational supplies to schools, and conducting English language classes. These classes were delivered by Australian soldiers who would spend time alone in villages at schools and proved very popular. During 1969–70, when 1 ACAU {{was under the}} command of Lieutenant Colonel Peter Gration, the Education Detachment also became responsible for youth and sports activities in Phuoc Tuy Province. At this time, the detachment commander was also the Province CORDS adviser on Education, and its second-in-command was the Province CORDS adviser on youth and sports matters, co-coordinating sporting activities in Phuoc Tuy Province.|$|E
