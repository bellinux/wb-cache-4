The bill allows for the ratification of the treaty and also retains the prohibition on Irish participation in an EU common defence agreement.

25|$|In February 2012, Italian Marines {{based on}} the tanker Enrica Lexie {{allegedly}} fired on an Indian fishing trawler off Kerala, killing two of her eleven crew.

Enrica Lexie was ordered into Kochi where her crew were questioned by officers of the Indian Police.

25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy in the United <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E
500|$|By 1787 the {{government}} of New York had almost entirely given up plans to subjugate Vermont, but still claimed jurisdiction. As {{a member of the}} legislature of New York, Hamilton argued forcefully and at length in favor of a bill to recognize the sovereignty of the State of Vermont, against numerous objections to its constitutionality and policy. [...] Consideration of the bill was deferred to a later date. [...] In 1787 through 1789 Hamilton exchanged letters with Nathaniel Chipman, a lawyer representing Vermont. In 1788 the new Constitution of the United States went into effect, with its plan to replace the unicameral Continental Congress with a new Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives. [...] Hamilton wrote: One of the first subjects of deliberation with the new Congress will be the independence of Kentucky , for which the southern <b>states</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> anxious. [...] The northern will be glad to find a counterpoise in Vermont. In 1790 the New York legislature decided to give up New York's claim to Vermont if Congress decided to admit Vermont to the Union and if negotiations between New York and Vermont on the boundary between the two states were successfully concluded. [...] In 1790, negotiators discussed not only boundary, but also financial compensation of New York land-grantees whose grants Vermont refused to recognize because they conflicted with earlier grants from New Hampshire. Compensation in the amount of 30,000 Spanish dollars was agreed to, and Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791.|$|E

2500|$|Songun {{politics}} have also thrived on the ongoing nuclear crisis. [...] For the United States, given that its primary {{concern is the}} denuclearisation of the peninsula, the concept of military-first politics and ideology is a troubling one. Songun also seems to fit very well with the possession of nuclear weapons, and {{can be seen as}} a way of making such weapons central to the government's guiding ideology of self-governance. This leads to the concern that, the longer military-first ideology guides the North Korean government, the less likely it will be that the United <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme. A similar concern is that North Korea could perceive attempts at denuclearisation and normalisation of affairs with the United States as a threat to the primacy of the military within North Korea and, thus, a threat to songun ideology, a fear which puts into doubt the idea that North Korea may be(come) willing to give up its nuclear weapons programme.|$|E
