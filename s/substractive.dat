These sounds capture the main invariants of the sounds they imitate, enabling users to recognize and understand them easily.

40|$|Different {{kinds of}} prepositional phrases are usually {{included}} in the grammar of Spanish, obviously {{as a result of}} a grammaticalization process. The aim of this paper is to deal with the problems that arise from the categorial, pragmatic and informative status of these elements. I have recently analyzed some of these structures (a propósito de, en cuanto a, en lo que se refiere a, etc.) as discourse markers of topicalization (Cifuentes, 2001 b). For this reason I will complete my research on this elements with what is called <b>substractive</b> phrases (excepto, salvo, menos, a excepción de, con la excepción de, aparte de, fuera de, etc.), which obviously will lead us to take into account the additive ones too. These elements have been traditionally considered —at least the most representative ones— imperfect prepositions, and it is said that they are imperfect because they can function as conjunctions as well. And, at this point, the analysis turns more difficult to understand, because their discourse analysis as markers remains undetermined with their categorial analysis —allegedly adverbial—. The synchronic analysis of these structures from the point of view of grammaticalization offers us new paths for their analysis. On the other hand, we will show how all these particles point out the sentence focus, which turns out to be, particularly, a contrastive focus. This explanation can be enriched with another perspective, that of the semantic relationship that the adjunct phrase holds with the considered expressions and the main sentence. We will consider this a quantifying relationship. The categorial status of all these elements is quite difficult to determine, since some of them come from a reanalysis of prepositive elements (aparte, fuera de, hasta), so they allow other similar constructions to appear in the scheme (a excepción de, con la excepción de); and others are a result of a grammaticalization process —mainly from absolute participle constructions— which make possible Sancho Cremades’ idea to consider them hybrids. As a conclusion, I will propose an analysis of the mentioned structures as <b>substractive</b> quantifiers that function as grammatical markers. From the point of view of their informative value, they point out the sentence focus; and their categorial status is a hybrid, as a result of the different, persistent stages of grammaticalization...|$|E

In an attempt to identify novel genes and proteins that are regulated by fatty acids in preadipocytes, we performed a <b>substractive</b> hybridization screening and identified PTX 3, a protein of the pentraxin family. PTX 3 mRNA expression is transient during adipocyte differentiation of clonal cell lines and is absent in fully differentiated cells. Stable overexpression of PTX 3 in preadipocytes {{has no effect on}} adipocyte differentiation. In line with this, PTX 3 mRNA is expressed in the stromal-vascular fraction of adipose tissue, but not in the adipocyte fraction; however, in 3 T 3 -F 442 A adipocytes, the PTX 3 gene can be reinduced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is accompanied by PTX 3 protein secretion from both 3 T 3 -F 442 A adipocytes and explants of mouse adipose tissue. PTX 3 mRNA levels are found to be higher in adipose tissue of genetically obese mice versus control mice, consistent with their increased TNFalpha levels.

We previously reported scFvC 1, that selectively bind to the GTP-bound form of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC. In this present study we generate, by molecular evolution, a new phage library to isolate scFvs displaying high affinity and selectivity to RhoA and RhoB. Using phage display affinity maturation against the GTP-locked mutant RhoAL 63, we isolated scFvs against RhoA active conformation that display Kd values at the nanomolar range, which corresponded to an increase of affinity of three orders of magnitude compared to scFvC 1. Although a majority of these evolved scFvs remained selective towards the active conformation of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC, we identified some scFvs that bind to RhoA and RhoC but not to RhoB activated form.

Information on the age distribution of insects, and more particularly, the knowledge of wild female reproductive status (mature or not) {{at the time of}} the sterile male release is one of the key factors for the success of the SIT. In recent years, sequencing analysis has become an important tool in molecular biology. In this work we present a genome-wide expression analysis based on SSH (<b>substractive</b> sequence hybridization) and EST (expressed sequence tag) sequencing and macroarray expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the ageing-maturing process in C. capitata, leading to the successful identification of new putative candidate genes of reproductive status in medfly that would serve as molecular markers for ageing. We have sorted out 94 unigenes from 873 single-pass ESTs, of which 57 % have homology with known genes. Ageing-maturing process in C. capitata presents a marked expression pattern accompanied by the increase of transcription level of genes involved in reproduction (vitellogenins, chorion proteins and male-specific serum proteins).

40|$|Recycling is a {{limiting}} {{step for}} receptor-mediated endocytosis. We first report three in vitro or in vivo evidences that class III PI 3 K/VPS 34 {{is the key}} PI 3 K isoform regulating apical recycling. A <b>substractive</b> approach, comparing in OK cells a pan-class I/II/III PI 3 K inhibitor (LY 294002) with a class I/II PI 3 K inhibitor (ZSTK 474), suggested that class III PI 3 K/VPS 34 inhibition induced selective apical endosome swelling and sequestration of the endocytic receptor, megalin/LRP- 2, causing surface down-regulation. GFP-(FYVE) x 2 overexpression to sequester PI(3) P caused undistinguishable apical endosome swelling. In mouse kidney proximal tubular cells, conditional Vps 34 inactivation also led to vacuolation and intracellular megalin redistribution. We next report that removal of LY 294002 from LY 294002 -treated OK cells induced a spectacular burst of recycling tubules and restoration of megalin surface pool. Acute triggering of recycling tubules revealed recruitment of dynamin-GFP and dependence of dynamin-GTPase, guidance directionality by microtubules, and suggested that a microfilamentous net constrained endosomal swelling. We conclude that (i) besides its role in endosome fusion, PI 3 K-III is essential for endosome fission/recycling; and (ii) besides its role in endocytic entry, dynamin also supports tubulation of recycling endosomes. The unleashing of recycling upon acute reversal of PI 3 K inhibition may help study its dynamics and associated machineries...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{cross-linking}} agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin {{are used}} as chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment. However, the molecular mechanism underlying their antitumor activity is not entirely clear. Critical steps in cytotoxicity toward cross-linking agents can involve DNA repair efficiency, inhibition of replication, cell-cycle checkpoints, regulation, and induction of apoptosis. The complexity of the mechanisms of the mammalian cell defense against cross-linking agents is reflected by the existence of many complementation groups identified in rodent cells that are specifically sensitive to MMC. We recently showed that increased induction of apoptosis contributes to the MMC sensitivity of the group represented by the V-H 4 hamster mutant cell line. In this study, through the analyses of a <b>substractive</b> library, we discovered that sensitive V-H 4 cells display a 40 -fold increase of steady-state expression of metallothionein II (MT-II) mRNA compared with resistant parental V 79 cells. Down-regulation of MT-II by antisense oligonucleotides partially restores MMC resistance in V-H 4 cells, indicating that MT-II overexpression is directly involved in MMC hypersensitivity of these cells. MTs {{have been reported to}} regulate the activation of NF-kappaB, one of the key proteins that modulates the apoptotic response. Here we found that NF-kappaB activation by MMC is impaired in V-H 4 cells and is partially restored following down-regulation of MT-II by antisense oligonucleotides. All these data suggest that the overexpression of MT-II in V-H 4 cells impairs NF-kappaB activation by MMC, resulting in decreased cell survival and enhanced induction of apoptosis...|$|E

The T 9 SS is poorly characterized {{but a number of}} proteins involved in the assembly of the secretion apparatus in the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis have been identified based on genome <b>substractive</b> analyses. Among these proteins, PorY and PorX encode typical two-component system (TCS) sensor and CheY-like response regulator respectively. Although the porX and porY genes do not localize at the same genetic locus, it has been proposed that PorXY form a bona fide TCS. Deletion of the porX in P. gingivalis causes a slight decrease of the expression of a number of other T 9 SS genes, including sov, porT, porP, porK, porL, porM, porN and porY. Here, we show that PorX and the soluble cytoplasmic domain of PorY interact. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, DNA-protein co-purification and heterologous host expression assays, we showed that PorX does not bind and does not directly regulate expression of the T 9 SS genes. Finally, we show that PorX interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of PorL, a component of the T 9 SS membrane core complex and propose that the CheY-like PorX protein might be involved in the dynamics of the T 9 SS...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} {{here has been}} {{the development of a}} technique for fabrication of absorber patterns made of tungsten. Highly adhesive low stress tungsten layers of several micrometer thickness have been made by magnetron sputtering and subsequently patterned by reactive ion etching. Then the titanium layer together with the tungsten patterns is transferred to a carrier frame. The advantages of the subtractive patterning process of a tungsten film include good adhesion, even of tiny absorber patterns, on the mask carrier foil and the homogeneous thickness of the absorber independent of the line width across the whole mask area. As the film is deposited and patterned under vacuum conditions, less defect density can be achieved. Using the <b>substractive</b> process absorber patterns of only 0. 5 #mu#m width have been fabricated which are 2 mm long and 2. 5 #mu#m in height. To achieve X-ray masks with small distortions of the absorber patterns tungsten films with little internal stresses must be prepared. Low stress tungsten films with isotropic stress distribution have been manufactured by rotation of the substrates during film application. Vertical absorber structures have been prepared by reactive ion etching with both CF_ 4 and SF_ 6 as etching gases. The addition of oxygen to the etching gases improves the selectivity of etching from tungsten to titanium so that {{there is no need for}} an additional etch stopping film. Nickel has been used as masking material in reactive patterning; it excels by minimum removal rates, especially in SF_ 6 etching in the range of high generator powers. (orig.) Dissertation of K.

40|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) are anti-herbivorous toxins {{that are}} found in several angiosperm lineages. The first pathway-specific enzyme, the homospermidine synthase (HSS), evolved repeatedly by gene duplication from the primary metabolism gene deoxyhypusine synthase in different lineages. Remarkably, although the independent evolution resulted in very similar PA structures, the integration into the plant’s pathway was different in the various lineages. In this thesis, a further facet {{was added to the}} versatile regulation of the PA pathway. Previous studies revealed that comfrey (Symphytum officinale L.) produces PAs in the root. This study presents evidence that Symphytum activates a second site of PA biosynthesis in young leaves to boost defense of inflorescences against herbivores during flowering. The finding that Symphytum has two sites where PAs are produced, was used to identify further enzymes of the pathway. For a <b>substractive</b> approach, the transcriptomes of three different tissues were sequenced (PA-producing leaves, non-PA-producing leaves, and PA-producing roots). The transcript abundance was measured in silico and transcripts that were up-regulated in PA-producing tissues were enriched. By searching the enriched transcripts, diamine oxidases (DAOs) were identified that are postulated to catalyze the second step of the PA biosynthesis. These DAO coding transcripts were further analyzed on their occurrence in various tissues and cell types and their enzyme activity with the postulated substrate homospermidine was determined. The results indicate that two different DAOs are involved in PA biosynthesis in different PA-producing tissues. To test DAOs and further candidate genes in planta, RNAi knockdown in Symphytum hairy roots was established. In a proof-of-concept experiment, HSS was used as a target for RNAi-mediated knockdown and it was shown that a reduced level of HSS transcripts leads to a reduced level of PAs...|$|E

Analyses of mutant embryos suggest that D-V patterning occurs in three distinct phases. During the first two phases a D-V gradient of Bmp activity is set up, which in the third phase leads to differential cell fate specifications along the D-V axis. Using a <b>substractive</b> approach, we identified DNp 63, {{a member of the}} p 53 / 63 / 73 family of tumor suppressors, as a direct transcriptional target of Bmp 2 b/ 7 signaling. DNp 63 acts as a transcriptional repressor, mediating the effect of Bmp signaling during dorsoventral patterning of the ectoderm to block neural development in the presumptive epidermal ectoderm. Comparing this early role with the later role of DNp 63 to promote the maintenance of skin stem cells, we suggest that Bmps and DNp 63 have a similar, specification-blocking function in the non-neural ectoderm of the gastrulating embryo. In addition to cell fate determination, Bmps have been shown to regulate differential cell movement behavior along the D-V axis. Here, we dissect the two roles, showing that Hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has 2) interacts with Bmps during cell movements, but not during dorsoventral patterning. Loss of Has 2 function leads to a block of dorsal convergence as in bmp mutants, however, in contrast to bmp mutants, has 2 morphants are not dorsalized. In contrast to DNp 63, Has 2 does not act downstream of Bmps. Rather, Has 2 and Bmps act in parallel, with Has 2 regulating the migratory potential of cells, and Bmps determining the direction of the migration...|$|E
40|$|Context. Determining stellar {{characteristics}} such as the radius, mass or age is crucial when studying stellar evolution or exoplanetary systems, or when characterising stellar populations in the Galaxy. Asteroseismology is the golden path to accurately obtain these characteristics. In this context, a key {{question is how to}} make these methods less model-dependent. Aims: Building on the previous work of Daniel Reese, we wish to extend the <b>Substractive</b> Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA) inversion technique to new stellar global characteristics beyond the mean density. The goal is to provide a general framework in which to estimate these characteristics as accurately as possible in low-mass main-sequence stars. Methods: First, we describe our framework and discuss the reliability of the inversion technique and possible sources of error. We then apply this methodology to the acoustic radius, an age indicator based on the sound speed derivative and the mean density, and compare it to estimates based on the average large and small frequency separations. These inversions are carried out for several test cases including various metallicities, different mixing-lengths, non-adiabatic effects, and turbulent pressure. Results: We observe that the SOLA method yields accurate results in all test cases whereas results based on the large and small frequency separations are less accurate and more sensitive to surface effects and structural differences in the models. If we include the surface corrections of Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L 175), we obtain results of comparable accuracy for the mean density. Overall, the mean density and acoustic radius inversions are more robust than the inversions for the age indicator. Moreover, the current approach is limited to relatively young stars with radiative cores. Increasing the number of observed frequencies improves the reliability and accuracy of the method.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and widespread diseases in western countries still is chronic renal failure. The reasons for that are manifold: besides genetically fixed renal issues, renal failure often is a concomitant disease induced {{as a consequence of}} severe intoxications, diabetes or rheumatoide diseases. Due to these complex correlations, therapeutic approaches are often difficult and more of a palliative than a curative character, only to mention immune suppression, organt ransplantations or dialysis. Especially in mesangioproliferative diseases like the IgA Nephropathy a basic mechanistic understanding is of absolutely urgent need,due to very limited access to suitable animal models. Within this work an innovative, unique Phage Display selection procedure was established, from which antibody fragments highly specific for murine mesangial cells were generated and characterized. This cell type represents a key player in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. The C 9 -(scFv), E 4 -(scFv) and B 4 -(scFv) antibody fragments were each fused to a murine IgG 2 a-Fc portion, leading to an antibody-like chimera protein. Their binding characteristics towards the target cells in different matrices were investigated. The analysis performed during this thesis aimed to show mMC specificity {{on the basis of a}} <b>substractive</b> approach. Crossreactivity investigations on healthy competitor tissues like lung, heart, spleen and liver were performed followed by <b>substractive</b> co-localization studies with cell types closely related to the mesangial cells. It was clearly shown that all of the generated scFv-binders are highly specific for mesangial regions and do not bind on other tissues or cell types neighboured in the glomerulus. Nevertheless, the target antigens of the three selected mMC binders were not yet identified. Such investigations are of urgent need to promote therapeutic approaches. Regarding this, mass spectrometry analysis of cross-linked and immunoprecipitated scFv-Fc binders on the target cells is a promising step. So far we were not able to establish such experiments within our group, but this is still of major interest and appropriate steps are initiated. A highly specific recognition of murine mesangial cells within their natural tissue environment was proven for each of the three scFv-Fc fusion proteins. The utilization of these exclusive and newly murine MC specific, antibody-like fusion proteins is a reasonable path forward in diagnostic and descriptive approaches of murine kidney disease models. Fused to the Fc-portion the highly specific mMC binders should be used as an external trigger for the initiation of a new murine animal model for mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN). Following the disease progress and transformation of the anti-thy 1 nephritis in rats, the idea was to induce mesangial cell lysis, hyper-proliferation of residual cells within the glomerular structure as well as accumulation and agglutination of extracellular matrix within the mesangium by injection of a single portion of scFv-Fc fusion protein. Within the present work we did not succeed to establish such a murine animal model, but prepared the ground for further investigations into this direction. Especially the functionalization of the scFv-Fc proteins via their included recombinant SNAP-tag anchor allows a huge variety of further disease induction approaches. It allows the usage of the generated scFv-Fc fusions as highly cell specific delivery vehicles for different effector moieties. Direct labelling of our proteins with specific cytotoxic agents like Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA) or immune stimulating agents like growth factors via the SNAP-tag have the potential to induce site directed cell lysis and macrophage recruitment within the glomerular tuft and therefore mimic the complement derived inflammatory response described for the anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis. Further engineering of our scFv-Fc fusion proteins via the SNAP-tag combined with alterations and modifications in the experimental in-vivo set-up can help to open the wide field of genetically manipulated mouse models and utilize them to gain better understanding of the mechanisms involved in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Selection {{programs}} {{for growth and}} stress traits in cultured fish are fundamental to the improvement of aquaculture production. The gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) is the main aquacultured species in the Mediterranean area and there is considerable interest in the genetic improvement of this species. With the aim of increasing the genomic resources in gilthead sea bream and identifying genes and mechanisms underlying the physiology of the stress response, we developed a cDNA microarray for gilthead sea bream that is enriched by suppression <b>substractive</b> hybridization with stress and immunorelevant genes. This microarray is {{used to analyze the}} dynamics of gilthead sea bream liver expression profile after confinement exposure. Results: Groups of confined and control juvenile fish were sampled at 6, 24, 72 and 120 h post exposure. GeneSpring analyses identified 202 annotated genes that appeared differentially expressed at least at one sampling time (P < 0. 05). Gene expression results were validated by quantitative PCR of 10 target genes, and K-means clustering of differently expressed genes identified four major temporal gene expression profiles. Set 1 encompassed a rapid metabolic readjustment with enhanced uptake and intracellular transport of fatty acids as metabolic fuels. Set 2 was associated {{with a wide variety of}} tissue repair and remodeling processes that were mostly mediated by the stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Sets 3 and 4 encompassed the re-establishment of cellular homeostasis with increased intracellular trafficking and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accompanied by a bidirectional regulation of the immune system and a general decline of ROS production. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings show the complex nature of the adaptive stress response with a clear indication that the ER is an important control point for homeostatic adjustments. The study also identifies metabolic pathways which could be analyzed in greater detail to provide new insights regarding the transcriptional regulation of the stress response in fish...|$|E
40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} of marsupial species {{leads to}} genomic instability {{as a result}} of methylation aberrations and retroelement activation. Eutherian mammals last shared a common ancestor with marsupial mammals approximately 147 mya. However, no study has successfully addressed whether retroelement demethylation contributes to eutherian hybrid genomic instability, yet phenotypes and preliminary evidence suggest eutherian interspecific hybrids may be subject to the same patterns of genomic instability as that observed in marsupials. This thesis examines the hypothesis that interspecific hybridization of eutherian species results in genomic instability {{as a result of}} aberrant methylation and retroelement activation. Genomic instability manifesting as double minute chromosomes in cell lines from a 16 d Mus musculus X Mus caroli hybrid was characterized and determined to be amplification of an oncogene, mdm 2. Hybrid-specific methylation abnormalities were isolated using a novel application of a methylation-sensitive <b>substractive</b> hybridization technique. These data showed that the double minutes were a result of demethylation targeted to retroelements surrounding the mdm 2 locus that was amplified on the double minute chromosomes. This is the first demonstration of retroelement demethylation in a eutherian hybrid. Additional M. musculus X M. caroli hybrids were produced using artificial insemination to allow for an examination of developmental timing of genetic instability as well as to further quantify the underlying cause of these destabilizing events. These hybrids were growth retarded and morphologically abnormal, with hypoplastic placentas. Isolation of hybrid-specific methylation changes produced a library of sequences enriched in retroelements. A functional genomics approach revealed the pathology observed in two 13 d M. musculus X M. caroli hybrids was the result of overexpression of the retroelement mvL 30 - 1. The activation of mvL 30 - 1 was a direct result of undermethylation in the hybrid genomes and was most pronounced in the placenta. The results presented herein provide evidence that the placenta is a specific site of genomic instability via demethylation and retroelement activation in interspecitic hybridization. This research will lead to a further understanding of hybrid dysgenesis and genomic instability and contributes {{to our understanding of the}} mechanisms and genes that, in concert, play a role in abnormal placental growth. ...|$|E
