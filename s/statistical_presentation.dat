The fact that space syntax is not associated with mainstream GIS applications has somehow tended to undermine the potential of both systems in comprehensively tackling urban design and planning problems.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{difference}} in preventing dentine lesion development between resin-based and glass ionomer sealant materials is unclear. Two recently published reviews {{were unable to}} conclude on the difference because the comparison was an exclusion criterion in one review and there were statistical shortcomings in the relevant papers in the other (Cochrane) review. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present investigation was {{to carry out a}} systematic review on the caries-preventive effect of these two types of sealant materials under more liberal exclusion criteria concerning the <b>statistical</b> <b>presentations</b> in the publications. METHODS: Based on five exclusion criteria, the literature search in the electronic libraries PubMed and MEDLINE and the publications retrieved in the Cochrane review, revealed 12 eligible publications for analyses. A variety of glass ionomers and resin-based sealant materials had been applied in the included studies. Attributable risk (AR) was chosen rather than relative risk (RR), as used in the Cochrane review, because RR is very instable in a low caries population. RESULTS: There was no consistent pattern observed with respect to the caries-preventive effect of either resin-based or glass ionomer sealants. Therefore, it was impossible to calculate an overall AR. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that either resin-based or glass ionomer sealant material is superior to the other in preventing dentine lesion development in pits and fissures over time...|$|R

40|$|When {{statistical}} {{evidence is}} offered in a litigation context, {{the result can}} be bad law and bad statistics. In recent high profile, high-stakes employment discrimination class actions against large multinationals like UPS, Wal-Mart, and Marriott, plaintiffs have claimed that decentralized and highly discretionary management practices result in systematic gender or racial disparities in pay and promotion. At class certification, plaintiffs have relied in part on statistical analyses of the company’s workforce showing companywide inequality. Defendants have responded with <b>statistical</b> <b>presentations</b> of their own, which frequently demonstrate widely varying outcomes for members of protected groups in different geographic areas of the company. These expert submissions usually suggest either that no problems exist, or that any discrimination is isolated and not attributable to institutional-level bias. In adjudicating between these competing visions, courts must referee what the Second Circuit terms “statistical dueling. ” As we show in this paper, sometimes {{at least one of the}} parties is dueling with unconventional weapons. Using simulated data, we show why courts should become more critical of statistical expertise purporting to test for subunit differences, particularly when offered at the class certification phase of the case. Under some circumstances, the statistical approach often used to oppose class certification in employment discrimination litigation is guaranteed to support the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s position, regardless of the actual facts of the case. Furthermore, some courts have improperly or unwittingly legitimized the use of this approach, even when it is demonstrably non-probative of the issues before the court.
