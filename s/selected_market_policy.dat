The effect of different approaches to the composition of cost of sales in accordance with the <b>selected</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>policy</b> on the financial results has been shown. The adjustment to the selling expenses to ensure the planned volume of sales and the optimal financial result have been proposed. The subaccounts to synthetic account number 93 "Expenses for sale" have been proposed to reflect allocation of cost of sales between the reporting and future periods for actual realized and unrealized products (goods, works, services) resulting in a more accurate reflection of financial results from realisation of production (goods, works, services).

It focuses {{on the development of}} the level of registered unemployment and discusses the supply and demand side of the regional labor market. The supply side is characterized by gender, age, education and duration of unemployment of job applicants. The analysis of the demand side is focused on the development of unemployment in various sectors and industries of the national economy. Then the thesis assesses some of the tools of active labor <b>market</b> <b>policy,</b> especially regional individual projects. Registered unemployment rate in the Hradec Kralove region oscillates in a relatively favorable terms, however, as a result of the economic crisis has worsened the situation. Based on the analysis, it was found that the most prone county to high rates of unemployment is Trutnov and the most prone group of citizens to unemployment are the long-term unemployed people. I also came to conclusion that <b>selected</b> active labour <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> has a positive influence on the labour market in that region.

30|$|Active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> play an {{important}} role in this endeavour. There is a long tradition of extensive use of active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in Denmark, and active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> have been maintained during the Great Recession. With the increase in unemployment this means that there has been a volume increase in active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies.</b> The flipside of this is an expenditure increase, but so far it has been possible to accommodate this since there has been some fiscal space. This points to the importance of creating fiscal space in “good times” to be able to accommodate negative shocks. While it in the current situation may be difficult to find policy measures which significantly can boost job creation, it is important to maintain the active focus of labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> to prevent an increase in long-term and thus structural unemployment.|$|R
