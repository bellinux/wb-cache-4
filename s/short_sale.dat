25|$|Potential loss on a <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> is {{theoretically}} unlimited, {{as there}} is no theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument. However, in practice, the short seller is required to post margin or collateral to cover losses, and inability to do so in a timely way would cause its broker or counterparty to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in the <b>short</b> <b>sale.</b> In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> {{by mutual}} funds has {{increased}} significantly {{over the last}} decade. In this paper, we provide a first look at short selling by mutual funds, a phenomenon not examined by prior research. The mutual funds that use <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> do so frequently and in significant amounts, averaging about 16 % of fund assets. We find that mutual funds that use <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> outperform size-matched control funds by a risk-adjusted 1. 5 % per year, suggesting that managers using <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> are skilled. The results are similar when we use style and size-matched funds.

25|$|In finance, {{short selling}} (also known as {{shorting}} or going short) is {{the practice of}} selling securities or other financial instruments that are not currently owned (usually borrowed), and subsequently repurchasing them ("covering"). In {{the event of an}} interim price decline, the short seller profits, since the cost of (re)purchase is less than the proceeds received upon the initial (<b>short)</b> <b>sale.</b> Conversely, the short position closes out at a loss if the price of a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.|$|E
25|$|The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 {{gave the}} Securities and Exchange Commission {{the power to}} {{regulate}} short sales.

The uptick rule aimed to prevent short sales from causing or exacerbating market price declines. In January 2005, The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted Regulation SHO to target abusive naked short selling. Regulation SHO was the SEC's first update to short selling restrictions since the uptick rule in 1938.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new insight}} into how information is disseminated when markets are subject to <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> restrictions by examining the relationship between short interest and returns for Canadian stocks. Short interest is defined in relation to trading volume because volume reflects information in the market. The results strongly support the assertion that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> reflect bad news in Canada. The paper further finds that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> convey more negative information for small firms because the supply of shortable shares is more constrained for these firms. In addition, <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> are less informative for stocks with associated options because the option market enhances the informational efficiency of the stock market. Importantly, {{the evidence suggests that}} informed traders short sell interlisted stocks in Canada, rather than the U. S., to exploit lower execution costs. Thus, <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> in Canada are more informative than in the U. S [...] Together the results suggest that less restrictive regulation of <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> will improve the informational efficiency of markets. Selling borrowed stock is a direct method to take advantage of declines in stock prices resulting from adverse information.

40|$|Indirect {{real estate}} (IRE) returns are often shown to lead direct real estate (DRE) returns. Apart from {{differences}} in liquidity, transaction costs, and management skills, the DRE market is also less complete than the IRE market – when negative shocks arrive, {{one can only}} short IRE (e. g. real estate stocks or REITs), but not DRE. This study investigates if <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> in the IRE market convey any information to the DRE market. Based on high-frequency (weekly) property price data in Hong Kong from 1999 to 2011, we found that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> in the IRE market led DRE returns, even after controlling for the lagged IRE returns in a VAR model. This suggests that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> contain private information on {{the real estate market}} that is not fully reflected in IRE returns. The spillover effect of <b>short</b> <b>sales,</b> however, weakened after the 2007 global financial crisis because increased uncertainty over the credibility of individual firms made <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> carry more firm-specific information than market-wide news. postprin...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I aim {{at improving}} {{the understanding of}} the informativeness of short-selling {{in the context of the}} motivation, the impact on future stock returns, and the relation with market efficiencies. In Chapter 1, I study short sellers? reactions after quarterly earnings announcements as well as the associations between <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> and post announcement stock returns. <b>Short</b> <b>sales</b> increase immediately after both negative and positive earnings surprises. After positive earnings surprises, short sellers appear to act as contrarians, and trade against stock price overreaction, thereby inducing price reversal in the long run. After negative earnings surprises, short sellers act as momentum traders, and trade with post earnings announcement drift. However, they are not able to fully arbitrage away the downside post earnings announcement drift. The short sellers? different reactions at subsequent surprises in a series of same-sign earnings surprises implies that short sellers exploit the consequences of other investors? behavioral biases. The results highlight the motivations and impacts for <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> after earnings announcements. In Chapter 2, I investigate the informativeness of short-selling by combining Probability of Information-based Trading measure and <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> transaction data. <b>Short</b> <b>sales</b> depress stock returns in the short run, regardless of the information asymmetry level. However, <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> can not predict future stock return in the long run if information asymmetry levels are low. Large size <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> are the most informed. When <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraints are more binding, short-selling is more informed, especially for the stocks with high information asymmetry levels. In Chapter 3, I examine <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> prior to merger and acquisition announcements for acquiring firms. Short-selling increases prior to stock-financed not cash-financed mergers and acquisitions. Pre-announcement abnormal short-selling is negatively related to post-announcement stock returns. Short sellers are informed of the method of payment, but not the outcome. The results also indicate that short-sellers are more active in stocks with larger firm size, lower book-to-market ratio, and higher liquidity...|$|R
