25|$|Ajaan Maha Bua, on {{the other}} hand, <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{considered}} {{to be a lot of}} strange ideas being taught about meditation in Bangkok in the later decades of the 20th century. For that reason Ajaan Maha Bua decided to vividly describe how each noble attainment is reached, even though doing so indirectly revealed that he was confident he had attained a noble level. Though the Vinaya prohibits a monk from directly revealing ones own or another's attainments to laypeople while that person is still alive, Ajaan Maha Bua wrote in Ajaan Mun's posthumous biography that he was convinced that Ajaan Mun was an arahant. Thanissaro Bhikkhu remarks that this was a significant change of the teaching etiquette within the Forest Tradition.|$|E
25|$|Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a {{location}} in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Lucinda Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris. On the second occasion in which Bittaker raped Hall, Norris <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Upon informing Bittaker, he (Bittaker) clasped his hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle he had seen. When {{he returned to the}} van, the pair drove to {{a location}} deeper in the San Gabriel Mountains, where Bittaker forced Hall to walk, naked, up a hill alongside the road, then perform fellatio upon him. Bittaker then ordered Andrea Hall to pose for several Polaroid pictures.|$|E
25|$|Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant, {{sometimes}} took extraordinary {{measures to}} combat the practice of live bootleg recordings at Led Zeppelin concerts. He {{is reported to have}} personally visited record stores in London which were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts so as to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment. At one concert at Vancouver in 1971 he <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was recording equipment {{on the floor of the}} venue and personally ensured that the equipment be destroyed, only to find out later that the equipment was a noise pollution unit being operated by city officials to test the volume of the concert. Similarly, at the Bath Festival in 1970, he personally threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment.|$|E

25|$|Grant's {{determination}} {{to protect the}} financial interests of Led Zeppelin was also reflected by the sometimes extraordinary measures he took to combat the practice of unauthorized live bootleg recordings. He {{is reported to have}} personally visited record stores in London that were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts in order to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment.

On another occasion, at the Bath Festival in 1970, he personally threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment. Grant's famous dressing room scene in the film The Song Remains the Same, where he demands an explanation from concert staff about the sale of illegal posters, was typical of his no-nonsense dealings with people who tried to profit at the band's expense.|$|E
500|$|In {{the control}} tower, the takeoff had been {{observed}} by John Davis, who <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> initially {{thought was the}} sun reflecting off the aircraft's wing during its initial climb. Davis quickly realised that the aircraft was on fire. Davis instructed Flight 712 to make a left turn, with the intention that the aircraft would land on runway 28L. He hit the [...] "crash button" [...] which alerted the emergency services and declared an aircraft accident. The emergency services were informed {{of the type of}} aircraft involved and given a rendezvous point at which they were to assemble.|$|E
500|$|Television {{historian}} Robert W. Morrow <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called [...] "the often repeated alphabet recitation segment" [...] as {{an example}} of the show's use of repetition. For example, in a short film in which actor James Earl Jones recited the alphabet, Jones made long pauses before each letter, which were superimposed in a corner of the screen moments before he said it. According to Cooney, some educational advisors recommended against using Jones, thinking that he would frighten young viewers, but children ended up loving his segments. [...] The producers found that children who had seen the segment a few times said the letter before Jones did, and Jones often served as confirmation or correction. The producers viewed this as a way to make television more interactive, and dubbed it [...] "the James Earl Jones effect".|$|E

500|$|Frederick had {{benefited from}} an obliging enemy. First, Charles <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to see}} {{regarding}} the principal attack instead of using his efficient light cavalry {{to figure out what}} the Prussians really intended. Frederick commented later that a lone patrol could have uncovered the truth. The cavalry he had left demonstrating in front of the northernmost position of the Austrian line was simply a screen, a diversion, to hide his real movements. Second, the Austrians obliged him by their failure to post pickets on their unprotected flank south of Leuthen. Nádasdy's omission of outposts on his open flank south of Leuthen was a surprising failure for a man with his long years of experience against the Prussians; he should have considered the possibility of an attack from an unexpected direction because this was Frederick's modus operandi. [...] Third, even when confronted with the attack on his left, the diversion on the right flank near Frobelwitz continued to mesmerize Charles. By the time the Prince moved cavalry to support the faltering troops south of, and in, Leuthen, they had too far to travel in too little time.|$|E

2500|$|Cutler's {{first win}} came {{in his third}} start on December 17, which was a 37–20 road victory over the Arizona Cardinals.

One touchdown traveled 65 yards in the air, and was recorded as a 54-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on the Broncos' third play of the game. Shanahan said to the media, [...] "You <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could do today.

2500|$|Several Chicago Bears {{players and}} fans {{believe that the}} Bears were targets of this program during the second game of the 2011 season, a 30–13 loss to the Saints. Quarterback Jay Cutler was sacked six times, and nearly lost his voice when a Saints player {{kicked him in the}} throat. Later in the game, {{offensive}} tackle Frank Omiyale yanked a Saints defender off Cutler when he <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> later called [...] "some dirty stuff." [...] Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman reported that the Saints' tendency toward illegal hits was common knowledge among the Tampa Bay coaching staff. Preparations for Saints games included warnings to offensive players to keep their knees protected, especially on plays near the sidelines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{visual effects}} company Scanline VFX worked on Snowpiercer.

Already having multiple designs, storyboards and basic concepts of the train cars, it set in motion the development of over 60 different versions of the various wagons for the train Snowpiercer. Thus, visual effects supervisor Michel Mielke said [...] " [...] we [...] a good idea of the vision of director Bong, we <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> liked, and what did not work for the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Predator {{design is}} {{credited}} to special effects artist Stan Winston. While flying to Japan with Aliens director James Cameron, Winston, {{who had been}} hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight. Cameron <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was drawing and said, [...] "I always wanted to see something with mandibles." [...] Winston then included them in his designs. Stan Winston's studio created all of the physical effects for Predator and Predator 2, creating the body suit for actor Kevin Peter Hall and the mechanical facial effects. The studio was hired after attempts to create a convincing monster (including Jean-Claude Van Damme wearing a much different body suit) had failed. Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on The Terminator.|$|E

One pair of wheels from the undercarriage was found near the railway line from Amiens to Beauvais, several hundred yards from the wreckage.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving in England for {{the first}} time, the American writer, in Hazlitt's judgement, <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{encountered}} with the eyes of one steeped {{in the writings of}} the previous century. Irving, he notes, has absorbed the refined style of the older writers and writes well: [...] "Mr. Irvine's [...] language is with great taste and felicity modeled on that of Addison, Goldsmith, Sterne, or Mackenzie"; but what he sees might have been seen with their eyes, and are such as are scarcely to be found in modern England. [...] "Instead of looking round to see what we are, he sets to work to describe us as we were—at second hand. He has Parson Adams, or Sir Roger de Coverley in his mind's eye; and he makes a village curate or a country 'squire sit to these admired models for their portraits {{in the beginning of the}} nineteenth century." [...] As such characters and customs hardly had any actual existence any more, Hazlitt even suggests that they might have been spun out of Irving's imagination, based on his reading of the English authors of the previous century.|$|E
2500|$|The first air–launch was {{performed}} on 25 July 1958 by NOTS research pilot William West, a career US Navy officer. The flight originated from China Lake's airstrip at Inyokern. The jet fighter was placed into a steep climb. The rocket released automatically at 41,000 feet, and three seconds later the first two HOTROCs ignited. The pilot was distracted during this time–the sudden release of weight had flipped his aircraft into a tumble. In mid–crisis, West looked up and <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was the vehicle exploding. He reported it that way, but John Nicolaides (director of the Navy's space program in Washington D.C.) later determined that the [...] "explosion" [...] was the plume from the rocket's motors as the exhaust expanded in the thin atmosphere. However, when ground control heard {{the report of the}} [...] "explosion", it ordered the ground tracking stations (approximately six in number) around the world to stand down. Thus only one station (at Christchurch NZ) remained on the air; it heard a beeping {{in the right place at}} the right time. However, the signal was not repeated, so the shot was declared a failure.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1944, well known {{choreographer}} George Balanchine was hired by Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo {{to work on a}} new production called Song of Norway. The move would mark a turning point in Tallchief's and Balanchine's careers. She was drawn to Balanchine from the start. Describing one of her first experiences with him, she wrote [...] "When I <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done, I was astonished. Everything seemed so simple yet perfect: An elegant ballet fell into place before my eyes." [...] At first, she was not sure if he was paying much attention to her, but she quickly found out he was. Balanchine [...] assigned Tallchief a solo in Song of Norway and on the night before the premiere also informed her that she would be Danilova's understudy. The ballet was a success and Balanchine was offered a contract {{for the rest of the}} season. [...] He was glad to get back into ballet after years on Broadway and in Hollywood and accepted the offer. Sensing Tallchief's star was on the rise, her mother demanded a raise for her daughter. Tallchief was [...] "mortified" [...] by the move, but Denham gave into the demands and increased her salary to $50 per week and promoted her to [...] "soloist." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Third Age, the use of palantíri {{influenced}} {{events of}} The Lord of the Rings. Saruman looked through the Orthanc stone, and <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was an unassailable strength in Mordor, helping to corrupt him. When Pippin touched the Orthanc-stone, he encountered Sauron, who was likely attempting to contact Saruman using the Ithil-stone. Sauron thought he saw the hobbit who had the One Ring. [...] When Aragorn, exercising his lawful authority as heir to the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor, used the stone, he revealed himself to Sauron and wrenched the stone's power free of Sauron's will. As a lawful user of the stone, Aragorn then used the stone to see many things and most importantly the attack on the Falas, which he then intercepted by riding the Paths of the Dead with Rangers of the North. Denethor's constant use of the Anor-stone in Minas Tirith since becoming Steward of Gondor aged him as he battled with Sauron. The images that he saw steered by Sauron in part plus Faramir's apparently mortal wound convinced him that there was no hope for Gondor, which resulted in his attempted murder of Faramir and his own suicide in the tomb of the Stewards off the Rath Dinen, the Silent Way.|$|E
2500|$|Following the verdict, it was {{revealed}} that Bayne had been released from prison after he had served an 18-month sentence for assault and robbery in Hamilton, just seven weeks before he murdered Nelson. He had previously been imprisoned on four occasions, following convictions for drugs charges, assault and theft. D/Supt Robertson gave a statement to the media after the verdicts were delivered, saying: [...] "Zoe Nelson was a young 17-year-old girl with everything to live for. She had many friends and a loving family in Newmains. Robert Bayne ruthlessly took her life and tried to dispose of her body in a cold-blooded attack. This was a particularly horrific crime and now that Bayne has been convicted, Zoe's family and the local community can hopefully try and move forward knowing [...] will not be a threat for a considerable period of time. He showed no remorse for his vile actions or the effect this murder had on Zoe's close family, who remain devastated by her loss. When the verdict was raised you <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can do. So the streets will be a lot safer, and hopefully the Nelson family can move on knowing that he is behind bars." [...] Lady Dorrian said: [...] "This has been... a somewhat distressing case and a stressful one." [...] Nelson's uncle told reporters: [...] "It's a relief to know he's in prison but it's not justice. He should be tortured like he tortured Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother said: [...] "I am so incredibly sorry about what happened. The lives of two families have been ruined by this tragedy." ...|$|E
