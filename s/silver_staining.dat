5|$|Studies of {{the brain}} became more {{sophisticated}} {{with the use of}} the microscope and the development of a <b>silver</b> <b>staining</b> method by Camillo Golgi during the 1870s. This was able to show the intricate structures of single neurons. This was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the then revolutionary hypothesis that the neuron is the functional unit {{of the brain}}. He used microscopy to uncover many cell types, and proposed functions for the cells he saw. For this, Golgi and Cajal are considered the founders of twentieth century neuroscience, both sharing the Nobel prize in 1906 for their studies and discoveries in this field.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>staining</b> is {{used when}} more {{sensitive}} {{method for detection}} is needed, as classical Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining can usually detect a 50ng protein band, <b>Silver</b> <b>staining</b> increases the sensitivity typically 10-100 fold more. This {{is based on the}} chemistry of photographic development. The proteins are fixed to the gel with a dilute methanol solution, then incubated with an acidic silver nitrate solution. Silver ions are reduced to their metallic form by formaldehyde at alkaline pH. An acidic solution, such as acetic acid stops development. <b>Silver</b> <b>staining</b> was introduced by Kerenyi and Gallyas as a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels. The technique has been extended to the study of other biological macromolecules that have been separated in a variety of supports. Many variables can influence the colour intensity and every protein has its own staining characteristics; clean glassware, pure reagents and water of highest purity are the key points to successful staining. <b>Silver</b> <b>staining</b> was developed in the 14th century for colouring the surface of glass. It has been used extensively for this purpose since the 16th century. The colour produced by the early silver stains ranged between light yellow and an orange-red. Camillo Golgi perfected the <b>silver</b> <b>staining</b> {{for the study of the}} nervous system. Golgi's method stains a limited number of cells at random in their entirety.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} <b>silver</b> <b>stain</b> permits the characterization of trace cellular and body fluid proteins separated by the two-dimensional electrophoresis technique of O'Farrell. Many of the proteins detected by the <b>silver</b> <b>stain</b> in urine, spinal fluid, amniotic fluid, and cells were undetected with the widely used Coomassie blue stain. Trace polypeptides observed in Escherichia coli cell lysates with this <b>silver</b> <b>stain</b> could be detected previously only by growth in radioactive precursors followed by lengthy autoradiography. In situations that do not {{permit the use of}} radioactive labeling, as in human clinical studies, the enhanced ability to detect proteins achieved by the <b>silver</b> <b>stain</b> will facilitate metabolic studies and the screening for protein abnormalities in mutational studies and in genetic diseases...|$|R

25|$|Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified {{fragment}} length polymorphism {{was also}} {{put into practice}} during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used PCR to amplify DNA samples. It relied on variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a polyacrylamide gel using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by <b>silver</b> <b>staining</b> the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together {{at the top of}} the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of phylogenetic trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result of}} this is a gel with {{proteins}} spread out on its surface. [...] These proteins can then be detected by a variety of means, but the most commonly used stains are silver and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. [...] In the former case, a silver colloid is applied to the gel. [...] The silver binds to cysteine groups within the protein. [...] The silver is darkened by exposure to ultra-violet light. [...] The amount of [...] silver can be related to the darkness, and therefore the amount of protein at a given location on the gel. [...] This measurement can only give approximate amounts, but is adequate for most purposes. <b>Silver</b> <b>staining</b> is 100x more sensitive than Coomassie Brilliant Blue with a 40-fold range of linearity.|$|E
2500|$|In forensics, the {{analysis}} is performed by extracting nuclear DNA from the cells of a sample of interest, then amplifying specific polymorphic regions of the extracted DNA {{by means of the}} polymerase chain reaction. Once these sequences have been amplified, they are resolved either through gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis, which will allow the analyst to determine how many repeats of the microsatellites sequence in question there are. [...] If the DNA was resolved by gel electrophoresis, the DNA can be visualized either by <b>silver</b> <b>staining</b> (low sensitivity, safe, inexpensive), or an intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide (fairly sensitive, moderate health risks, inexpensive), or as most modern forensics labs use, fluorescent dyes (highly sensitive, safe, expensive). Instruments built to resolve microsatellite fragments by capillary electrophoresis also use fluorescent dyes. Forensic profiles are stored in major databanks. The British data base for microsatellite loci identification was originally based on the British SGM+ system using 10 loci and a sex marker. The Americans increased this number to 13 loci. The Australian database is called the NCIDD, and since 2013 it has been using 18 core markers for DNA profiling.|$|E
