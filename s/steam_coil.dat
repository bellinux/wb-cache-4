50|$|In batch distillation, {{the feed}} is charged to the still pot to which heat is {{supplied}} continuously through a steam jacket or a <b>steam</b> <b>coil.</b> As the mixture boils, it generates a vapour richer {{in the more}} volatile. But as boiling continue, concentration of more volatile in the liquid decrease. It is generally assumed that equilibrium vaporization occurs in the still. The vapour is led to a condenser and the condensate or the top product is collected in the receiver. At the beginning, the condensate will be pretty rich in the more volatiles, but the concentrations of the more volatiles in it decrease as the condensate keep on accumulating in the receiver. The condensate is usually withdrawn intermittently having products or cuts of different concentrations. Batch distillation is used when the feed rate is not large enough to justify installation of a continuous distillation unit. It may also be used when the constituents greatly differ in volatility.

50|$|The easiest {{alternative}} {{to this is}} steam heating. This presupposes {{the presence of a}} boiler capable of generating steam at high enough pressures to reach the required temperatures.

It also enables you to run your autoclave on natural gas, propane, butane, or fuel oil, sometimes interchangeably if the boiler is set up for dual-fuel operation.

5000|$|In 1878, Sutton {{developed}} a better method to extract sugar from sugar cane juice."What {{looks like a}} decided improvement upon the open air methods hitherto followed to evaporate cane juice has just been patented by Messrs. J. W. Sutton and Co., coppersmiths, Brisbane. Mr. Sutton aims at evaporating juice at a heat of from 120° to 180°. This he does in the open air. He obtains the required temperature {{by means of a}} <b>steam</b> <b>coil</b> running around his evaporating pan, which is of the ordinary circular form. This heat will not boil the liquor, of course; that he accomplishes by menus of a perforated pipe or coil coming in {{at the bottom of the}} evaporating pan. Through this latter coil, a current of air is forced by a fan blast. The air may either be of atmospheric temperature, or it may be heated, as seems most desirable. In the event of heated air being forced into the liquor, or through it, the air is passed through furnaces in a series of pipes, by which means it becomes highly rarefied, and the temperature is raised at the same time. We have seen the apparatus at work, cold air being used, and there was a particularly brisk ebullion, while the temperature of the liquid at first barely marked 130°. Mr. Sutton's calculation at the time was that three gallons were evaporated per hour from each superficial foot of liquid while the temperatures was 180°. The evaporation was certainly very rapid, and the temperature completely under control. Two pans upon this principle have been ordered, one by Mr. R. Muir, of Nerang, who intends to have it at work early next month. The advantage claimed are- at least double the ordinary rate of evaporation by open fire-boiling, with absolute security from burning, and perfect control over the entire apparatus, including facilities for skimming and cleaning the liquor and syrups on the boiling proceeds. Mr. Sutton has gone into this matter, as he has into other improvements, with energy and skill, and deserves the success likely to flow from his efforts.""Messrs. J. W.

40|$|Steam {{has been}} widely used {{as the source of}} heating in {{commercial}} buildings and industries throughout the twentieth century. Even though contemporary designers have moved to hot water as the primary choice for heating, a large number of facilities still use steam for heating. Medical campuses with on-site steam generation and extensive distribution systems often serve a number of buildings designed prior to the mid- 1980 s. The steam is typically used for preheat as its high thermal content helps in heating the air faster and prevents coils from freezing in locations with extreme weather conditions during winter. The present work provides a comprehensive description of the various types of steam heating systems, <b>steam</b> <b>coils,</b> and valves to facilitate the engineer's understanding of these steam systems. A large percentage of the <b>steam</b> <b>coils</b> used in buildings are provided with medium pressure steam. Veterans Integrated Service Network and Army Medical Command Medical Facilities are examples which use medium pressure steam for heating. The current design manual for these medical facilities recommends steam at 30 psig be provided to these coils. In certain cases although the <b>steam</b> heating <b>coil</b> is designed for a 5 psig steam pressure, it is observed that higher pressure steam is supplied at the <b>coil.</b> A higher <b>steam</b> pressure may lead to excessive heating, system inefficiency due to increased heat loss, simultaneous heating and cooling, and increased maintenance cost. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of lowering steam pressure on the system performance. A 16 % reduction in temperature rise across the coil was found when the steam pressure in the coil was reduced from 15 psig to 5 psig. The rise in temperature with lower pressure steam was sufficient to prevent coil freeze-up even in the most severe weather conditions. Additional benefits of reduced steam pressure are reduced flash steam losses (flash steam is vapor or secondary steam formed when hot condensate from the coil is discharged into a lower pressure area, i. e., the condensate return line) and radiation losses, increased flow of air through the coil thereby reducing air stratification and reduced energy losses in the event of actuator failure. The work also involved evaluating the existing control strategies for the steam heating system. New control strategies were developed and tested to address the short comings of existing sequences. Improved temperature control and occupant comfort; elimination of valve hunting and reduced energy consumption were benefits realized by implementing these measures...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the feasibility of decreasing NO{sub x} emissions from the current uranium alloy scrap tray dissolving facility. In the current process, uranium scrap is dissolved in boiling nitric acid in shallow stainless-steel trays. As scrap dissolves, more metal and more nitric acid are added to the tray by operating personnel. Safe geometry is assured by keeping liquid level at or below 5 cm, the depth of a safe infinite slab. The accountability batch control system provides additional protection against criticality. The trays are <b>steam</b> <b>coil</b> heated. The process has operated satisfactorily, with few difficulties, for decades. Both uranium and uranium alloys are dissolved. Nitric acid is recovered from the vapors for reuse. Metal nitrates are sent to uranium recovery. Brown NO{sub x} fumes evolved during dissolving have occasionally resulted in a visible plume from the trays. The fuming is most noticeable during startup and after addition of fresh acid to a tray. Present environmental regulations are expected to require control of brown NO{sub x} emissions. Because NO{sub x} is hazardous, fumes should be suppressed whenever the electric blower system is inoperable. Because the tray dissolving process has worked well for decades, as much of the current capital equipment and operating procedures as possible were preserved.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this study}} is to analyze the causes of {{premature}} failure of <b>steam</b> generator <b>coil</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. Special attention is paid to corrosion damage processes within the welded joints. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations were conducted several segments of the coil made of seamless cold-formed pipes Ø 23 x 2. 3 mm, of austenitic stainless steel grade X 6 CrNiTi 18 - 10 according to EN 10088 - 1 : 2007. The working time of the device was 6 months. The reason for the withdrawal of the generator from the operation was leaks in the coil tube caused by corrosion damage. The metallographic investigations were performed with the use of light microscope and scanning electron microscope equipped with the EDX analysis attachment. Findings: Examinations of coil tubes indicated severe corrosion damages as pitting corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and intergranular corrosion within base material and welded joints. Causes of corrosion was defined as wrong choice of austenitic steel grade, improper welding technology, lack of quality control of water supply and lack of surface treatment of stainless steel pipes. Research limitations/implications: It was not known the quality of water supply of steam generator and this was the reason for some problems in the identification of corrosion processes.
