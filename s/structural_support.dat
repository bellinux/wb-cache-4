5|$|In animal cells, two {{networks}} of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork {{on the internal}} face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide <b>structural</b> <b>support</b> for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is an {{important}} material in TRISO-coated fuel particles, the type of nuclear fuel found in high temperature gas cooled reactors such as the Pebble Bed Reactor. A layer of silicon carbide gives coated fuel particles <b>structural</b> <b>support</b> and is the main diffusion barrier {{to the release of}} fission products.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} all species are {{composed}} primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform {{a number of}} critical functions, including <b>structural</b> <b>support,</b> metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white; spores are {{cylindrical}}, smooth, and measure 7–11 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20–40 by 3–5μm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2–3μm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning {{that there are}} three types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide <b>structural</b> <b>support,</b> are thick walled, measuring 3–7μm in diameter; generative hyphae, responsible for new growth, can be either thin- or thick-walled, may contain clamps, and measure 2–6μm; binding hyphae, thick-walled and much branched, are 2–5μm.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{requests}} from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra <b>structural</b> <b>support</b> was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide <b>structural</b> <b>support.</b> Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E
50|$|Structural {{engineering}} surveys {{showed that}} {{parts of the}} pool surround and pool tank were {{in a state of}} near collapse and emergency work had to be carried out to install temporary <b>structural</b> <b>supports.</b> About one year later, the centre was closed in October 2008 to allow a substantial programme, consisting of structural repairs and replacements and the installation of new <b>structural</b> <b>supports.</b> This required a significant amount of structural engineering design input. Fortunately, the structure of the unique roof was not affected.|$|R

5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide <b>structural</b> <b>support</b> for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided <b>structural</b> <b>support</b> for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

25|$|A {{house in}} Cape Schanck Victoria, Australia uses an {{internal}} rainwater tank to provide cooling {{to the living}} room in summer.

25|$|The arctic {{tree line}} is the northernmost {{latitude}} in the Northern Hemisphere where trees can grow; farther north, it is too cold all year round to sustain trees. Extremely cold temperatures, especially when prolonged, can freeze the internal sap of trees, killing them. In addition, permafrost in the soil can prevent trees from getting their roots deep enough for the necessary <b>structural</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
25|$|Woodworking: when wood {{is used as}} a {{construction}} material, whether as a <b>structural</b> <b>support</b> in a building or in woodworking objects, it will absorb or desorb moisture until it is in equilibrium with its surroundings. Equilibration (usually drying) causes unequal shrinkage in the wood, and can cause damage to the wood if equilibration occurs too rapidly. The equilibration must be controlled to prevent damage to the wood.|$|E
