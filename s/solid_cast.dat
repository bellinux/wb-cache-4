2500|$|Horn's 2009-2010 work Well and Truly, [...] {{consists}} of ten <b>solid</b> <b>cast</b> glass parts, each measuring 91.5cm {{in diameter and}} 45.5cm in height. Well and Truly {{is part of a}} private collection, but was included in an exhibition of the same title at Kunsthaus Bregenz from April 24 to July 4, 2010. The 10 glass elements are cylinders in shades of blue and pale blue greens. Like earlier glass sculptures Horn has produced, these works bear rough, textured sides that evidence the process of casting used to produce them, and smooth, fire polished top surfaces that are, from different angles, reflective and seemingly endless in depth. In Briony Fer's essay for the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn, she writes about the experience one has with the surfaces of these glass works, [...] "There is an almost unbearable precision in the effect of the light on the smooth surface of glass or an accidental but infinitesimal flaw in the surface that creates an effect of massive turbulence in certain lights and absolutely none in others. Depending on the angle of view, glass has a surface of either razor sharpness or infinite depth. At one moment its surfaces can seem as thin and dazzling as the gold leaf laid out on the floor of Paired Gold Mats, for Ross and Felix, at another it is purely transparent. You cannot see the change happenings in perception; it is only visible in its sudden effect when one kind of surface has switched invisibly into another. You can see into it and then suddenly the light changes, and it has no inside at all--only a surface and a shine that reflects outward. The line between the two is so fine that in perception it no longer exists. But it is our experience that fractures in an instant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Casting is a {{group of}} {{manufacturing}} processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The <b>solid</b> <b>casting</b> is then ejected or broken out to complete the process, although a final stage of [...] "cold work" [...] may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BC. Specific techniques include lost-wax casting, plaster mold casting and sand casting.|$|R
