A total of 116 distinct lemmas were selected; for each lemma, approximately 1000 example sentences were taken from the MASC corpus; and for each word in its sentence context, a trained annotator assigned a WordNet sense (WordNet version 3. 1) as the annotation label.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Q-WordNet, a lexical resource {{consisting of}} WordNet senses automatically annotated by {{positive and negative}} polarity. Polarity classification amounts to decide whether a text (<b>sense,</b> <b>sentence,</b> etc.) may be associated to positive or negative connotations. Polarity classification is becoming important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis, which facilitates the extraction and analysis of opinions about commercial products, on companies reputation management, brand monitoring, or to track attitudes by mining online forums, blogs, etc. Inspired by work on classification of word senses by polarity (e. g., SentiWordNet), and taking WordNet as a starting point, we build Q-WordNet. Instead of applying external tools such as supervised classifiers to annotated WordNet synsets by polarity, we try to effectively maximize the linguistic information contained in WordNet, thereby {{taking advantage of the}} human effort put by lexicographers and annotators. The resulting resource is a subset of WordNet senses classified as positive or negative. In this approach, neutral polarity is seen as the absence of positive or negative polarity. The evaluation of Q-WordNet shows an improvement with respect to previous approaches. We believe that Q-WordNet {{can be used as a}} starting point for data-driven approaches in sentiment analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} takes {{a functional}} view {{of language and}} applies its perspective to literary discourse, both poetry and prose. Following the performative hypothesis by Ross (1970), which argues that a declarative sentence consists of the performative part and the proposition, I assume that a literary discourse also has these two parts: the performative level which consists of the author-reader level (speech act of narration) and the textual proposition. I argue that the propositional text is made of what I term 'discourse theme', 'discourse rheme' and 'the mediating function', which transforms the first into the second one in a communicative and dynamic way. The propositional content of this variety of discourse is best viewed in terms of Halliday's extended concept of the 'text-forming' functional-semantic component based on the Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP) of the Prague School linguists - the concepts of theme, rheme, transition, and Communicative Dynamism -, or, what I term 'discourse theme', 'discourse rheme' and 't 4 e mediating function'. I also argue that the. coherence scope of Jakobson's (1960 : 358) 'equivaleI!ce' in the micro-structural arrangement's of verbal elements in a literary text,' whether sound or <b>sense,</b> <b>sentence</b> or episode, depends upon the functional theme-rheme structures.

50|$|Investigations {{into how}} {{language}} {{interacts with the}} world are called theories of reference. Gottlob Frege was an advocate of a mediated reference theory. Frege divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components:sense and meaning. The <b>sense</b> of a <b>sentence</b> is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its embedding <b>sentence</b> expresses. <b>Senses</b> determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. Referents are the objects {{in the world that}} words pick out. The <b>senses</b> of <b>sentences</b> are thoughts, while their referents are truth values (true or false). The referents of sentences embedded in propositional attitude ascriptions and other opaque contexts are their usual senses.|$|R

The research purposes {{to identify the}} types of <b>sense</b> based <b>sentence</b> and illocutionary meaning or author‟s intention in the lyric of Adele‟s albums.

In collecting data, researcher uses the document. The data in this research are simple declarative sentences containing types of <b>sense</b> based <b>sentence,</b> they are analytic sentence, syntactic sentence, contradiction sentence and the illocutionary meaning or author‟s intentions, they are stating, informing, asserting, disclosing, offering, warning, threatening, affirming, promising, alleging, identifying, deploring, questioning, conjecturing, claiming and disputing. From the collected data, the researcher finds 50 data. The result of the research shows that: (a) There are three kinds of <b>sense</b> based <b>sentences</b> from 50 data found in Adele‟s album. They are analytic sentence (2 data/ 4, 0 %), syntactic sentence (29 data/ 58, 0 %) and contradiction sentence (19 data/ 38, 0 %).

40|$|Philosophy of {{language}} and its problems {{are among the most}} important and challengeable topics in contemporary philosophical thought. Discussion about the <b>sense</b> of a <b>sentence</b> is one of these important debates. Gottlob Frege explains the sense of a term as the form of the representation of its reference. He calls the <b>sense</b> of a <b>sentence</b> a “thought” and believes that the reference of a sentence is determined by its truth value. In this article, at first, we develop a new approach to the notion of thought. To reach this aim, some of Frege’s logical and epistemological presuppositions and also the properties of thought {{from his point of view}} will be examined. Then, on the basis of a vague relation that Frege supposes between a thought and its owner his view is criticized. Finally, we will criticize Frege’s opinion about true essence and the inessential properties of thoughts. It will be shown that Frege’s interpretation of these notions is incomplete and makes the notion of thought problematic. ...|$|R

I conclude that the Fregean notion of sense, also in its cognitive aspect, cannot be reduced to linguistic meaning, and that the Fregean tension between two notions of sense may also explain the discussion Frege gives on the indexical “I”, proposing to develop a picture of indexicals as hidden complex demonstratives, as originally suggested by Burge...|$|R

40|$|Frege's {{doctrine}} of the existential quantifier solves {{the problems of the}} Ontological Argument. Attempts are often made to apply this notion to existence-statements whose subject is a name. Those whose subjects are empty names, however, are best dealt with by considering <b>senses</b> of names. <b>Sentences</b> which attribute actual existence - e. g. 'X is alive' - cannot be adequately expressed in terms of the quantifier. Thus there is another notion of existence, called esse by Aquinas. Williams's attack on this notion - attempting to show that to use a predicate to express it is paradoxical - and his alternative account, by means of quantifying 're-identifying predicables', both fail. Aquinas, besides a developed theory of esse, shows an appreciation of the Fregean doctrine, distinguishing what is said in answer to the questions quid est? and an est? : the former including esse, the latter being esse ut verum. In this sense the verb 'esse' means 'aliquod dictum est verum': 'X est' depends for support on some true affirmative proposition about X. If 'X' is a nomen naturae (concept-word) it can appear in this supporting proposition as a predicate. Kenny denies this, but the evidence is against him. Attempts to explain away esse, or reduce it to esse ut verum, can be shown to assume it. The distinction between the two notions can be used to dissolve a number of philosophical chimeras. Facts are a confusion between the <b>senses</b> of <b>sentences</b> and per accidens actualities: objects, between names and things. Object theory (ontology) is a confusion between logic and metaphysics, which are distinguished by means of the distinction between the two notions of existence...|$|R
