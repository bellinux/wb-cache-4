50|$|The DECstation <b>system</b> <b>module</b> is repackaged in a CPU drawer, {{which is}} mounted in a rack with a {{mounting}} kit which permits the drawer to be slid in and out. The CPU module also contained an integrated TURBOchannel Extender, the power supply and a blower, which cooled the system. However, as the <b>system</b> <b>module</b> that these systems use does not feature multiprocessing capabilities, {{the presence of}} two CPU drawers in a rack simply meant {{that there were two}} separate systems. The mass storage drawers, in such a case, would be divided between the CPU drawers, with a minimum of one per a CPU drawer.|$|E
50|$|The TURBOchannel is a synchronous, {{asymmetrical}} I/O channel. It is asymmetrical in {{the sense}} that option modules (Digital terminology for expansion card) can communicate with the <b>system</b> <b>module</b> (Digital terminology for motherboard) and not with other option modules.|$|E
