5000|$|... "Mountaintop removal mining" [...] (MTR) {{is a form}} of {{coal mining}} that mines coal seams beneath mountaintops by first {{removing}} the mountaintop overlying the coal seam. Explosives are used to break up the rock layers above the seam, which are then removed. Excess mining waste or [...] "overburden" [...] is dumped by large trucks into fills in nearby hollow or valley fills. MTR involves the mass restructuring of earth in order to reach the coal seam as deep as 400 ft below the surface. Mountaintop removal replaces the original steep landscape with a much flatter topography. Economic development attempts on reclaimed mine sites include prisons such the Big Sandy Federal Penitentiary in Martin County, Kentucky, small town airports, golf courses such as Twisted Gun in Mingo County, West Virginia and Stonecrest Golf Course in Floyd County, Kentucky, as well as industrial <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> disposal sites, solid waste landfills, trailer parks, explosive manufacturers, and storage rental lockers.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project {{is to develop a}} bench-scale {{procedure}} to design and fabricate advanced brake and structural composite materials from Illinois coal combustion residues. During the first two quarters of the project, the thrust of the work directed towards characterizing the various coal combustion residues and FGD residue, i. e., <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge.</b> Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and transmission-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were conducted on PCC fly ash (Baldwin), FBC fly ash (ADK unit l- 6), FBC fly ash (S. I. coal), FBC spent bed ash (ADM, unit l- 6), bottom ash, and <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> (CWLP) residues to characterize their geometrical shapes, mineral phases, and thermal stability. Our spectroscopic results indicate that the <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> is mainly composed of a gypsum-like phase whose lattice structure is different from the lattice structure of conventional gypsum, and sludge does not contain hannebachite (CaSO{sub 3 }. 0. 5 H{sub 2 }O) phase. Our attempts to fabricate brake frictional shoes, in the form of 1. 25 inch disks, from PCC fly ash, FBC spent bed ash, <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge,</b> coal char, iron particles, and coal tar were successful. Based on the experience gained and microscopic analyses, we have now upscaled our procedures to fabricate 2. 5 inch diameter disk,- from coal combustion residues. This has been achieved. The SEM and Young`s modulus analyses of brake composites fabricated at 400 psi < Pressure < 2200 psi suggest pressure has a strong influence on the particle packing and the filling of interstices in our composites. Also, these results along with mechanical behavior of the fabricated disks lead us to believe that the combination of surface altered PCC fly ash and <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> particles, together ed ash particles are ideal for our composite materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{tremendous}} amount of wet flue-gas desulfurization <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> (estimated 20 million metric tons {{per year in the}} US) is currently being landfilled at a huge cost to utility companies. <b>Scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> is the solid precipitate produced during desulfurization of flue-gas from burning high sulfur coal. The amount of this sludge is expected to increase in the near future due to ever increasing governmental regulation concerning the amount of sulfur emissions. <b>Scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> is a fine, grey colored powder that contains calcium sulfite hemihydrate (CaSO{sub 3 } {center_dot} 1 / 2 H{sub 2 }), calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO{sub 4 } {center_dot} 2 H{sub 2 }O), limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }), silicates, and iron oxides. This material can continue to be landfilled at a steadily increasing cost, or an alternative for utilizing this material can be developed. This study explores the characteristics of a naturally oxidized wet flue-gas desulfurization <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> and uses these characteristics to develop alternatives for recycling this material. In order for <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> {{to be used as a}} feed material for various markets, it was necessary to process it to meet the specifications of these markets. A physical separation process was therefore needed to separate the components of this sludge into useful products at a low cost. There are several physical separation techniques available to separate fine particulates. These techniques can be divided into four major groups: magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, physico-chemical separation, and density-based separation. The properties of this material indicated that two methods of separation were feasible: water-only cycloning (density-based separation), and froth flotation (physico-chemical separation). These processes could be used either separately, or in combination. The goal of this study was to reduce the limestone impurity in this <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> from 5. 6 % by weight to below 2. 0 % by weight. The resulting clean calcium sulfite/sulfate material can be oxidized into a synthetic gypsum that can be used in several markets which include: wallboard manufacturing, plaster, portland cement, and as a soil conditioner. Single stage water-only cycloning removed nearly 50 % of the limestone by weight from the <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> and maintained a weight recovery of 76 %. Froth flotation produced a calcium sulfite/sulfate that contained 4. 30 % limestone by weight with a 71 % weight recovery. These methods were successful in removing some of the limestone impurity, but were not able to meet the specifications needed. However, the combination of water-only cycloning and froth flotation provided a clean, useful calcium sulfite/sulfate material with a limestone grade of 1. 70 % by weight and a total weight recovery of nearly 66 %...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} {{problems related to}} the combustion of high sulfur Illinois coal, there continues to be interest {{in the development of}} viable pre-combustion desulfurization processes. Recent studies by the authors have obtained very good sulfur removals but the reagents that are used are too expensive. Use of cheaper reagents leads to a loss of desired coal properties. This study investigates the application of phase transfer catalysts to the selective oxidation of sulfur in coal using air and oxygen as oxidants. The phase transfer catalyst is expected to function as a selectivity moderator by permitting the use of milder reaction conditions than otherwise necessary. This would enhance the sulfur selectivity and help retain the heating value of the coal. The use of certain coal combustion wastes for desulfurization, and the application of cerium (IV) catalyzed air oxidations for selective sulfur oxidation are also being studied. If successful this project could lead to the rapid development of a commercially viable desulfurization process. This would significantly improve the marketability of Illinois coal. During this quarter aliquots of the IBC- 101 coal have been ground to various particle sizes in an attempt to find the optimum physical pretreatment for mineral, especially pyrite, removal. Analysis of these various aliquots shows them to be representative of the original coal. In addition, preliminary desulfurization reactions using fly ash and <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludges</b> have been performed on an unoxidized IBC- 101 sample. Results will be available next quarter. Also, SEM-EDAX analysis of the fly ash indicates that it contains oxides that have shown activity in base desulfurization reactions...|$|R

40|$|Industrial and {{residential}} source control, enhanced liquid phase removal and process modifications are viable air emission reduction strategies {{that should be}} applied before resorting to add-on-devices. i By Jay R, Witherspoon, Walter J. Bishop and Michael J, Wallis ublicly owned treatment works (POTWs) are beginning the process of identifying air emissions from their wastewater treatment and collection facilities. Many of these facilities will be required by local and state regulatory agencies to reduce emissions to meet air quality or health risks standards. Emissions include odors and toxic, reactive, volatile and criteria pollutants. A wide range of residential, commercial and industrial sources contribute pollutants to POTWs. In most cases, pollutant concentrations are low and vary greatly with time. They are subject {{to a variety of}} competing mechanisms, such as volatilization, sorption to solids and biodegradation, and may be emitted from many different processes. Because of low off-gas pollutant concentrations, many “traditional” control technologies used by other industries are largely ineffective or unproven. Developing accurate estimates for how much a given pollutant is being emitted and from what wastewater treatment or combustion process has always been the key to determining proper controls and program emphasis. Federal, state and local air quality laws and regulations are expected to increase the aeed fcr accwate emission facttxs, comprehensive air emissions inventories and viable, cost-effective control strategies for both criteria pollutants and air toxics. POTWs have both stack and large fugitive air emissions sources. Stack emission sources are combustion exhaust vents andor covered and ducted wastewater treatment processes such as headwork <b>scrubbers,</b> activated <b>sludge</b> reactors and sludge handling building blower vents.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of sulfur oxides from high sulfur coal burning utility companies {{has resulted in}} the production of huge quantities of wet flue-gas desulfurization <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge.</b> A typical 400 MW power station burning a coal containing 3. 5 % sulfur by weight and using a limestone absorbent would produce approximately 177, 000 tons (dry weight) of <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> per year. This brownish colored, finely divided material contains calcium sulfite (CaSO{sub 3 } {center_dot} 1 / 2 H{sub 2 }O), calcium sulfate (CaSO{sub 4 } {center_dot} 2 H{sub 2 }O), unreacted limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }), and various other impurities such as fly-ash and iron oxide particles. The physical separation of the components of <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> would result in the re-use of this material. The primary use would be conversion to a highly pure synthetic gypsum. This technical report concentrates on the effect of baffle configuration on the separation of calcium sulfite/sulfate from limestone. The position of the baffles as they related to the feed inlet, and the quantity of the baffles were examined.

40|$|The main aim of {{our project}} was to develop technology, which {{converts}} flue gas desulfurization (FGD) sulfate-rich <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> into value-added decorative materials. Specifically, we were to establish technology for fabricating cost effective but marketable materials, like countertops and decorative tiles from the sludge. In addition, we were to explore the feasibility of forming siding material from the sludge. At {{the end of the}} project, we were to establish the potential of our products by generating 64 countertop pieces and 64 tiles of various colors. In pursuit of our above-mentioned goals, we conducted Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the binders and co-processed binders to identify their curing behavior. Using our 6 -inch x 6 -inch and 4 -inch x 4 -inch high pressure and high temperature hardened stainless steel dies, we developed procedures to fabricate countertop and decorative tile materials. The composites, fabricated from sulfate-rich <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge,</b> were subjected to mechanical tests using a three-point bending machine and a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). We compared our material's mechanical performance against commercially obtained countertops. We successfully established the procedures for the development of countertop and tile composites from <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> by mounting our materials on commercial boards. We fabricated more than 64 pieces of countertop material in at least 11 different colors having different patterns. In addition, more than 100 tiles in six different colors were fabricated. We also developed procedures by which the fabrication waste, up to 30 -weight %, could be recycled in the manufacturing of our countertops and decorative tiles. Our experimental results indicated that our countertops had mechanical strength, which was comparable to high-end commercial countertop materials and contained substantially larger inorganic content than the commercial products. Our moisture sensitivity test suggested that our materials were non-water wettable and did not disintegrate on submerging the product in water for at least two months.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} global release and mass {{partitioning}} in the flux of residues of PCDD/Fs, evaluated with dedicated field campaigns at a {{municipal solid waste}} incineration plant during normal and transient operation. Results are compared with those obtained in other installations equipped with furnaces, energy recovery options and flue gas treatment technologies representative of most of the European incineration plants currently in operation. Levels of the pollutants of interest were determined in all the solid, liquid and gaseous residues produced by every single facility, and the results analysed in terms of the effects arising from the fed waste and the configuration of the plant. PCDD/Fs total release between 1. 5 and 45 lg I-TEQ per ton of burned waste was evaluated, with lower values resulting from the adoption of catalytic conversion process for flue gas treatment. Most of the mass flux emitted is associated with solid residues deriving from activated carbon PCCD/F dry removal options, with significant contributions also from fly ash produced by particulate removal devices located immediately downstream the boiler and from <b>scrubber</b> blowdowns treatment <b>sludge.</b> During transient operating conditions the dioxin total release may increase by 50 % with comparison to steady-state functionin...|$|R
40|$|Emissions {{of major}} air {{pollutants}} including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and mercury (Hg) were studied at two sewage sludge fluidized bed combustion (FBC) plants. Both the North West Bergen (NWB) County Utility Authority and the Little Miami (LM) plants have {{air pollution control}} systems (APCS) that are of the wet type. Various operating conditions such as temperature, excess air, fuel and feed properties, concentration of calcium chloride, and the method of operating were investigated to determine their effect on the emissions. Results of the study reveal that NOx increase with increased bed temperatures and excess air. CO is lower at higher freeboard temperatures. Both CO and NOx emissions are strongly dependent on the feed characteristics. CO and NOx fluctuate more with higher sludge solid content (TS). They increase not only with TS, {{but also with the}} sludge volatile solids (VS) and its heat content. NOx increase with the ratio of sludge oxygen over sludge nitrogen concentration. They are also higher with fuel oil than with natural gas when selected as the auxiliary fuel source. CO and NOx emissions are also higher and fluctuate more when the operation is not run consistently; when the feed quality is inconsistent, or when the feeding is intermittent or interrupted, or when the roof sprays are activated. It is believed that the feed characteristics and mode of operating affect the flame temperature and the excess air surrounding the combusting materials, which in turn have an impact on CO and NOx emissions. While some of the mercury (Hg) vapor is removed by condensation due to flue gas cooling, the addition of calcium chloride to the feed has shown a clear reduction in both emissions of NOx and Hg. It is believed that calcium chloride can generate strong oxidants, promoting the oxidation of both elemental mercury and NOx into more soluble forms, which can then be separated from the exhaust gas in a wet <b>scrubber.</b> KEYWORDS <b>Sludge</b> incineration, fluidized bed combustion, air pollution control systems, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides emissions, nitrogen oxides removal, mercury emissions, mercury removal...|$|R
40|$|Blast furnace sludge (BFS) is a {{hazardous}} metallurgical waste {{generated in the}} ironmaking process [1]. Extraction of Fe from ores and its conversion into alloys {{is the most important}} metallurgical process [2]. Besides Fe and C other elements are also introduced into the blast furnace. Zn especially forms a problem: during the metallurgical process it evaporates because of high temperatures in the furnace and subsequently condenses {{on the walls of the}} furnace at lower temperatures and it damages the installation and the fireproof coating of the furnace. To ensure proper working of the furnace, the input Zn concentration should not exceed an average value of 120 g/ton of pig iron. Consequently, the ores are carefully selected, and the quality of the additives is checked. Part of the evaporated Zn leaves the blast furnace with the effluent gas and condenses on the dust particles, the concentration of Zn being highest on the finest dust particles. Between 8 and 12 kg of dust is produced per ton of pig iron. This dust is normally removed in the air pollution control system. Large particles (> 50 μm) are removed from the flue gas in a dust bag and a cyclone and can directly be recovered in the blast furnace after sintering because the Zn content is in general low (< 0. 1 % Zn). Smaller particles are washed out in a wet <b>scrubber</b> and generate <b>sludge</b> [2].

Alternative methods of solids utilization are presently being developed. Fly ash is presently being marketed commercially as an additive for concrete manufacture.

Further studies are being conducted to confirm encouraging irrigation and crop-yield data obtained with fly ash amended soils. Finally, the composition of many fly ashes and soils are similar in the Southwest, {{and there are no}} anticipated solid discharges from coal usage which cannot be rendered insignificant with proper management of existing and emerging methods of treatment.

40|$|A {{large number}} of coal {{preparation}} plants in the United States are troubled with coal fines and associated plant operation problems. As part of their process, these plants use thermal dryers for producing product coal, cyclones for first-stage recovery of coal fines, and wet scrubbers for the second-stage removal of coal fines carry-over from the dryer exhaust gas. The first challenge for these plants is to recover the clean ultra-fine coal captured in the scrubbers rather than to dispose of it in settling ponds. The second challenge is to mitigate the over-dry fine coal dusting problems in the dryer product. Prior to the completion of this program, the difficulties of the first challenge involving the recovery and use of fine clean coal from the thermal dryer scrubber effluent had not been solved. The second challenge, controlling fine coal dusting, was previously met by applying a solution of surfactants and process water to the over-dry coal fraction. As {{a result of the}} demonstration provided by the performance of this program, the implementation of a simple process improvement, involving the use of a thickener in combination with a belt press, simultaneously solved both challenges: the de-dusting and the dryer scrubber effluent recovery issues.

In the past decade, constructed wetlands have become popular for treating coal-generated acid mine drainage and leachate from coal-ash disposal areas. The goal of the wetland manager is to design a system in which the pH is neutralized, toxic metals are removed, and wetland discharge meets or exceeds discharge standards for water quality. This is typically accomplished by using a combination of wetlands, ponds, and limestone drains. The treatment capability of a constructed wetland is based on relationships among dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and metal speciation. The aim of this research was to determine if PHREEQCi, a geochemical computer program, could be used in wetland management and design. The wetland site chosen for this study was at a Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA) plant located in Grimes County, Texas and was created to treat leachate from a solid waste disposal area where coal ash and SO? <b>scrubber</b> <b>sludge</b> was deposited. The leachate contains significant concentrations of sulfate, chloride, total dissolved solids (TDS), arsenic, and selenium. Using PHREEQCi, geochemical speciation models were created to study the interrelationships between critical chemical components at the TMPA site in order to establish an optimum set of conditions to improve treatment capability and to avoid wetland failure. The results of the geochemical speciation modeling indicated a challenging situation for a wetland manager because different species precipitate under contrasting environments. In order to apply the geochemical speciation results to the design of the TMPA site, two conditions must be recognized. First, metal removal is best accomplished by generating alkaline and oxidative conditions to promote metal-oxide precipitation. Second, sulfate can be controlled under reducing environments where it is converted to sulfide and metal sulfides precipitate. Chlorides are very soluble and no viable conclusions as to the most appropriate removal method could be postulated. TDS has an ambiguous composition and could not be modeled using PHREEQCi...|$|E
