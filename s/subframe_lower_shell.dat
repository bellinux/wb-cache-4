50|$|Time {{and again}} Rigi set {{his head against}} the upper shell and his tail against the <b>lower</b> <b>shell,</b> and heaved. The clam {{resisted}} and sweat poured from Rigi, making a pool in the <b>lower</b> <b>shell,</b> then a lake and finally a sea. The saltiness of the water killed the clam and opened the shell. Areop-Enap made the <b>lower</b> <b>shell</b> into Earth and the upper shell into the sky and set the smaller snail west of the sky-shell where it became the Moon. The second snail was set to the east and became the Sun. Areop-Enap made islands from clam-flesh and clothed them in vegetation made from his own web-thread. Finally he turned to Rigi and found that he had drowned in his own sweat, killed by his own exertions. Areop-Enap wrapped him in a cocoon of silk and hung him in the sky to become the Milky Way.|$|R

50|$|Anomiids have {{extremely}} thin, translucent, paper-like shells. There {{is often}} {{a hole in the}} <b>lower</b> <b>shell,</b> caused by growth of the shell around the byssus. The shell follows the shape of the object it lies on - usually a rock or a large shell of another creature.|$|R
50|$|The flex {{tongue is}} placed {{on the outside of the}} boot in front of the leg and over the foot. This is in {{addition}} to the internal padded tongue. This meant that the split between the right and left halves of the boot did not require the overlapping flaps of the conventional design that keep out the snow; in the Flexon, the flex plate served this purpose. With the overlapping flaps removed, in theory the boot was easier to put on and take off, as the <b>lower</b> <b>shell</b> was open to the sky once the buckles were released and the flex plate folded forward. However, the edges of the <b>lower</b> <b>shell's</b> opening were sharp and skiers learned to live with shell bite on the instep, at least in the early years of the Flexon's evolution.|$|R

40|$|In one of {{our earlier}} works, we {{proposed}} to approximate Pareto fronts to multiobjective optimization problems by two-sided approximations, one from inside and another from outside of the feasible objective set, called, respectively, <b>lower</b> <b>shell</b> and upper shell. We worked there {{under the assumption that}} for a given problem an upper shell exists. As it is not always the case, in this paper we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of upper shells. We also investigate how to constructively search infeasible sets to derive upper shells. We approach this issue by means of problem relaxations. We formally show that under certain conditions some subsets of <b>lower</b> <b>shells</b> to relaxed multiobjective optimization problems are upper shells in the respective unrelaxed problems. Results presented are illustrated by a numerical example representing a~small but real mechanical problem. Practical implications of the results are discussed.

40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{calculations of}} three-dimensional spherical shell thermal convection for constant viscosity and stratified viscosity models of whole-layer and two-layer mantle convection. These four examples {{are intended to}} provide theoretical guidance for determining the style of convection that is occurring in Earth's mantle. An impermeable interface between the upper and <b>lower</b> convecting <b>shells</b> in the two-layer solutions is placed {{at a depth of}} 670 km to coincide with the mantle seismic discontinuity that divides the upper and lower mantle. The interface results in an internal thermal boundary layer that raises the mean temperature in the <b>lower</b> <b>shell</b> by about 1400 K compared to the whole-layer solutions. The patterns of convection in {{the upper part of the}} whole-layer solutions are dominated by narrow arcuate sheetlike downflows in a background of weak upflow. In contrast, the upper shells of the two-layer solutions have complicated networks of convective rolls with the upflows and downflows having very similar structure. The structure of convection in the <b>lower</b> <b>shells</b> is similar to that in the lower part of the whole-layer solutions. Based on the horizontal structure of subduction zones on Earth's surface and on tomographic images of temperature variations in Earth's mantle, we conclude that the style of convection in Earth's mantle is more like that of the whole-mantle models...|$|R

Turtle shells are also composed of two layers of osteoderms, while cyamodontoid shells only have one layer.
