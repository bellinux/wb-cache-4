5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw <b>sewage</b> {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first <b>sewage</b> treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw <b>sewage</b> and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, <b>sewage</b> still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow <b>sewage</b> systems, bind to the walls of <b>sewage</b> pipes, and interfere with <b>sewage</b> treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, city leaders debated the {{responsibility}} and expense {{of creating a}} waterworks system and disposal of <b>sewage.</b> Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of <b>sewage</b> into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw <b>sewage</b> into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s {{as a sign of}} prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. With little regard for beauty, steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.|$|E

40|$|In 1991 the eu {{implemented}} the Nitrates Directive (Council Directive 91 / 676 /eec) concerning {{the protection of}} waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. The compliance to its requirements represent today a critical step for the Italian farms, particularly {{those involved in the}} livestock business sector which suffers also the burden of a worrying market crisis. Difficulties for the farms involve economic and technical aspects. First are linked to the added costs deriving from the respect of the rules in terms of nitrogen burden per area and the <b>sewages</b> disposal. The technical problems are mainly represented by the new classification of the areas in vulnerable (vzs) and non vulnerable zones (nvzs). This facts have represented an important obstacle for farms’ management, particularly if they are located in vzs because it has became necessary find new solutions to spread the farm <b>sewages.</b> The paper offers an empirical analysis aimed at trying to optimize the compliance procedures to this directive for a livestock farm, trough the predisposition of an economic account for two typical chains: the red (bovine) and pork meat production. The calculation comprehends all the phases from the meat production to the <b>sewages</b> handling and management after a denitrification and the nitrogen storage. The evaluation consider different alternative systems. Through this process it could be possible obtain the commutation of the bovine and swine <b>sewages,</b> representing an expensive burden, in a new resource for the farm. This fact permits to achieve also an environmental result in terms of a pollution restraint and an economic advantage as raw material for energetic transformation. Finally the Authors complete the paper with some reflections. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, EEFM (Excitation {{emission}} fluorescent matrix) {{was used}} to evaluate the variation of organic characteristic of both source <b>sewages</b> into WuYiShan wastewater treatment. Similar organic property for both source <b>sewages</b> was identified, having four peaks, respectively belonging to fulvic acid, humic acid, aromatic protein and soluble microbial by-product. The fluorescent intensity (FI) of dominant humic acid fraction increased after biological treatment, and decreased in constructed wetland. UV process could result the increase of FI value of humic acid. However, the ratio of FI value of peak location in soluble microbial by-product to fulvic acid, called as Fs/Ff, continuously had an ascent after the biotreatment, constructed wetland and UV process. The organic property was apparently affected by the interior microorganism activity...|$|R

5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a <b>sewage</b> treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of <b>sewage</b> water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and <b>sewage</b> is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the <b>sewage,</b> sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The <b>sewage</b> problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the <b>sewage,</b> people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As <b>sewage</b> treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because <b>sewage</b> was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of <b>sewage.</b>|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{solid-phase}} extraction, a simple procedure for determining simultaneously two aromatic surfactant classes, i. e., linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) and nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEO), {{as well as their}} biodegradation intermediates in raw and treated <b>sewages</b> is presented. This procedure involved passing 10 and 100 mL of an influent and effluent water sample, respectively, through a 1 -g graphitized carbon black (GCB) extraction cartridge. By exploiting the presence of positively charged active centers on the GCB surface, we succeeded in fractionating the complex mixture of the analytes considered by differential elution. The first fraction contained NPEO and nonylphenol (NP). The second fraction contained the carboxylated biotransformation products of NPEO, i. e., nonylphenoxy carboxylic acids (NPEC). Finally, the last fraction contained LAS and their metabolites, i. e., carboxylic sulfophenyl acids (SPC). By suitably adjusting the chromatographic conditions, any group of analytes was subfractionated and quantified by liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Recoveries of all compounds of interest ranged between 89 % and 99 %. This procedure was empolyed for 1 year to assess monthly the concentrations of the analytes considered in raw and treated <b>sewages</b> of a mechanical-biological treatment plant. © 1994 American Chemical Society...|$|R
