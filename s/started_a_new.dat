A survey of 167 respondents was used embracing the two main communities of Cyprus, Greek and Turkish Cypriots. There is a low, but statistically significant, correlation between a family business background and the intention to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> business. Entrepreneurial education is not correlated, while entrepreneurial self-efficacy has a positive correlation with the intention to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> business. Factor analysis of perceived barriers to entrepreneurship identified six major underlying factors and correlated factor scores with the decision to <b>start</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> business or join the family business. Factor scores were {{not found to be}} significantly correlated with these decisions. Gender and entrepreneurial self-efficacy are not correlated with the decision to join the family business...|$|R

In 1535, the Ottomans tried to seize the fortress by treachery, and again in 1536, but they failed on both occasions. During that year the Ottomans <b>started</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> siege which would last until the final fall of the fortress.|$|E

5|$|In New York City, C.F. Theodor Steinweg (H.E. Steinweg's son) {{changed his}} name to C.F. Theodore Steinway, and served as the leader and chief {{technician}} of Steinway & Sons for fifteen years. He did not like living in the US, so he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled back and forth as needed. In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and <b>started</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Steinway & Sons piano factory in Hamburg, competing with his father's old firm, now called Grotrian-Steinweg, in making pianos for European customers. After establishing the business, Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years. He died in 1889, leaving his collection of pianos to the city's museum. The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian-Steinweg—both companies were known for producing premium pianos.|$|E

5|$|The US Navy {{ended the}} Civil War with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s {{most of these}} were laid up in reserve, leaving the USA {{virtually}} without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw {{the beginning of what}} became the Great White Fleet, and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War of 1898. This <b>started</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> era of naval warfare.|$|E

The colonel, Mohamed Alí Seineldín, who was also pardoned, <b>started</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> mutiny, killing two military men. Unlike the mutinies that {{took place during the}} presidency of Alfonsín, the military fully obeyed Menem's orders for a forceful repression.
