5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E
5|$|During her premiership {{support for}} Dunderdale, her {{government}} and the PC Party saw a steady decline. A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released days after Dunderdale became premier, and conducted before she took office, showed that 90 per cent of the population {{were satisfied with the}} PC government. 75 per cent would vote for the Progressive Conservative Party in an election and 76 percent chose Williams as the best leader to be premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout February 2011, showed that support for Dunderdale, her {{government and the}} PC Party remained high. Satisfaction with government was at 82 per cent, while 73 per cent of respondents said they would vote for the PC Party in an election. 64 per cent of respondents stated Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, compared to 18 per cent for Liberal leader Yvonne Jones and 5 per cent for Lorraine Michael. An Angus Reid Public Opinion (Angus Reid) poll conducted around the same time listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating. 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> approved or disapproved of her performance.|$|E
25|$|After {{getting off}} to 2–7 start, the Mavericks {{eventually}} found {{themselves with the}} sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50–32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about {{three to four weeks}} earlier, weren't even <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were going to make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5–1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in {{the first game of the}} quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

25|$|The band {{recorded}} and completed their Terry Date-produced album, tentatively titled Eros, in 2008, {{and it was}} expected to be released in early 2009. However, bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in an automobile accident in November 2008, leaving him in a coma and putting the release of Eros on hold. Unsure if or when Cheng would recover and be able to perform with the band again, Deftones started playing various shows and festivals with Sergio Vega on bass, starting in early 2009. Vega, a close friend of the band, had previously filled in for Cheng during tours in 1999. At this point, Deftones were not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wanted to break up or continue writing and performing music.|$|E
25|$|Ambiguity is {{one factor}} that affects {{whether or not a}} person assists another in need. In {{situations}} in which the bystander(s) are not sure if a person requires assistance (a high ambiguity situation), reaction time is slow (hearing a person fall but not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are hurt). In low ambiguity situations (a person yelling out for help) reaction times for bystanders is quicker than high ambiguity situations. In some cases of high ambiguity, it can take a person or group up to 5 times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity. The number of bystanders in each condition is not a significant factor. In these cases, bystanders determine their own safety before proceeding. Bystanders are more likely to intervene in low ambiguity, insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity, significant consequence situations.|$|E
500|$|In {{a seminar}} given in November 2014, Justice Elena Kagan {{expressed}} her {{thoughts on the}} decision in this case, noting that for herself, she faced a difficult decision between what she felt was right – allowing parents to decide what their children should watch and play – and what {{the state of the}} law was, and in hindsight, was still not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> made the right decision. She noted that she along with four others on the [...] court effectively added language to the decision that would preempt any future laws that attempted to restrict game sales.|$|E

He is also asked {{to be the father}} of Ann Perkins' child via in vitro fertilization. He is hesitant at first and turns to Ben and others to help him make a decision. After [...] "Bailout", he tells Ann that he will be the father and the two begin parenting compatibility testing to see how well they will work together with raising a child.

2500|$|A {{number of}} critics have commented {{that as he}} grew older the line that {{distinguished}} Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred. Thompson himself admitted during a 1978 BBC interview that he sometimes felt pressured {{to live up to}} the fictional self that he had created, adding [...] "I'm never sure which one people expect me to be. Very often, they conflict— most often, as a matter of fact.... I'm leading a normal life and right alongside me there is this myth, and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped.

2500|$|Confessing at {{some point}} that [...] "the world was my school", Caragiale dissimulated his {{background}} and critical eye {{as a means to}} blend into each environment he encountered, and even adopted the manners and speech patterns he later recorded in his literary work. He thus encouraged familiarity, allowing people to reveal their histories, motivations, and culture. Vianu recounted: [...] "The man was a consummate actor and a pince-sans-rire, an ironist [...] to the point where his partners of dialog were never <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were spoken to «seriously» [...]" [...] In one of his pieces from 1899, he welcomed the famous actors Eleonora Duse and Jean Mounet-Sully to Bucharest, imitating the exaggerated style of other theater chroniclers—the article ended with Caragiale confessing that he had not actually seen the two perform. In one other instance, as a means to comment on plagiarism, the author also parodied his own O făclie de Paşte—which he turned into the sketch, Noaptea Învierii.|$|E
2500|$|While on the Never Say Never tour, fellow {{group members}} Swifty and Kuniva (D12) along with Royce Da 5'9" [...] stopped by KISS 100FM for a live {{interview}} and spoke on Relapse. Royce {{stated that the}} album will be a game changer and jokingly said {{he might have to}} push his own album back three years after Eminem drops his. Kuniva added that D12 recorded many tracks for Relapse but wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would make the album or not. Swifty then confirmed that Eminem would be dropping two albums in 2009, with Relapse 2 following Relapse. Relapse was re-released on December 21, 2009, as Relapse: Refill, with seven bonus tracks and including the single [...] "Forever" [...] (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack), [...] "Taking My Ball" [...] (released with DJ Hero), and five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: [...] "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year".|$|E

However, it was all so delightful that even Granny felt the charm, and was <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did upset in some romantic spot, a Doctor Antonio would spring up as quickly as a mushroom, and mend their bones, marry one of her giddy charges, and end the affair in the most appropriate manner.|$|R

60|$|Some of {{the miners}} {{who were in the}} habit of playing high grumbled {{somewhat}} at the expulsion of Mason, who had not himself been concerned in any of the shooting affrays. Two or three of them packed up their kits and left the camp on the day following the expulsion of the gambler and his associates, but the general result was that the saloon was better attended than ever. There was still a good deal of play going on, for cards formed one of the few amusements {{of the miners}}, but as long as they played against each other, the stakes were comparatively moderate, and men were pretty <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> lost they, at least, lost fairly.|$|R
2500|$|Regarding {{the notable}} {{differences}} in weight {{between himself and}} his opponents throughout his career, {{as well as the}} banning of IV's for rehydration (and potential PED usage), Sakuraba has stated through an interpreter that [...] "it doesn't matter <b>if</b> <b>they</b> [...] use a pill or medicine to get bigger or smaller, I just train hard, eat healthy, fight at my weight and try my best to beat them.

60|$|In {{the course}} of the afternoon, the two American sailors came to Captain Horn and asked {{permission}} to go to look for game. The captain had small hopes of their finding anything suitable for food, but feeling <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should be successful, every one would be glad of a little fresh meat, he gave his permission, at the same time requesting the men to do their best in the way of observation, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should get up high enough to survey the country, and discover some signs of habitation, if such existed in that barren region. It would be a great relief to the captain to feel that there was some spot of refuge to which, by land or water, his party might make its way in case the water and provisions gave out before the return of the mate.|$|R
