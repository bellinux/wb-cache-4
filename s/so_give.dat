[...] Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of The Band's songs: [...] "'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to hear another Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord for the gift of this song." [...] Of The Band's version of [...] "Don't Ya Tell Henry", he writes, [...] "True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. <b>So</b> <b>give</b> Robbie a break." ...|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Day, {{writing for}} The Guardian, commented [...] "For many, the quintessential {{on-screen}} wedding remains the 1987 marriage of Scott and Charlene in Australian daytime soap Neighbours.

[...] The Birmingham Post's Gemma Quade named the wedding one of her five most memorable Neighbours storylines, calling it a [...] "tearjerker episode". Josephine Monroe, author of The Neighbours Programme Guide, wrote that the episode showed the [...] "soap wedding of the century!", adding [...] "Teenagers Scott and Charlene tied the knot in a traditional and emotional church service". During a feature on how to celebrate a wedding ceremony in the style of a soap opera, Tom Cole from the Radio Times said [...] "Who needs Mendelssohn and Bach when you can process down the aisle to power ballad 'Suddenly' by Australian rocker Angry Anderson?

500|$|By early 1918, British {{women who}} had {{attained}} the age of 30 were given {{the right to vote}} and hold office. Following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, which enabled women to become members of the legal profession, Macmillan applied to Middle Temple as a pupil barrister. She was called to the bar on 28 January 1924 and in 1926 joined the Western Circuit, becoming only the second women to be elected to its Bar Mess. Between then and 1929 she acted as counsel for defence in the six cases in which she appeared on the Circuit, and she took 65 cases in the North London Session courts between 1927 and 1936. From 1929, she appeared at the Central Criminal Court in five cases for the prosecution, and one for defence [...] There are no records available for her civil cases. As she was studying for the bar, she co-founded the Open Door Council for the repeal of legal restraints on women. Macmillan worked to lift restrictions and <b>so</b> <b>give</b> women of all stations an equal opportunity in the workplace. NUWSS was re-organised in 1918 as the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, but Macmillan disagreed with the group's stance on protective legislation for women workers. In 1929, she co-founded a global group, the Open Door International for the Economic Emancipation of the Woman Worker—she served as president of this group until her death.|$|E

Eliot or Gerard Manley Hopkins for its degree of honesty in expressing the torment and contradiction of a serious search for belief in the modern world. Meanwhile, a Marxist critic might find such judgments merely ideological rather than critical; the Marxist would say that the New Critical reading did not keep enough critical distance from the poem's religious stance to be able to understand it. Or a post-structuralist critic might simply avoid the issue by understanding the religious meaning of a poem as an allegory of meaning, treating the poem's references to [...] "God" [...] by discussing their referential nature rather than what they refer to. A critic using Darwinian literary studies might use arguments from the evolutionary psychology of religion.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly music reviewer David Browne said that [...] "If you wonder whether they have regrets about the incident, 'Not Ready to Make Nice' makes it clear they don't. When Maines gets to the part about all the death threats, her voice rises and the strings well up; it's a true pop-money-shot moment." [...] Rolling Stone music reviewer Barry Walters commented the following about the song, [...] "Rather than try to forget about singer Natalie Maines' anti-Bush remarks of 2003 -- which landed them in hot water {{with a lot of}} station program directors -- the threesome declares it's still 'Not Ready to Make Nice'." [...] USA Today music reviewer Brian Mansfield commented the following about the song, [...] "They're 'Not Ready to Make Nice' with the yahoos who threatened their lives over an offhanded comment. <b>So</b> <b>give</b> the Chicks credit for sticking to their guns, and give them more for getting on with life.
