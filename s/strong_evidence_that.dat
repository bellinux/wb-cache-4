By contrast, the water thought to be on Jupiter's moon Europa is located under a much thicker layer of ice.|$|E
5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light. This provided <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E

Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

5|$|Poe was {{increasingly}} unstable after his wife's death. He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman {{who lived in}} Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. There is also <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship. Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.|$|E
5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> not only was James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E

5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, is very <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{circumcision}} {{reduces the}} risk of men acquiring HIV infection in areas of the world with high rates of HIV. Evidence among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa shows an absolute decrease in risk of 1.8% which is a relative decrease of between 38percent and 66percent over twoyears, and in this population studies rate it cost effective. Whether it is of benefit in developed countries is undetermined.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E

He put great weight on the point that races graduate into each other, writing [...] "But the most weighty of all the arguments against treating the races of man as distinct species, is that they graduate into each other, independently in many cases, {{as far as we can}} judge, of their having intercrossed", and concluded <b>that</b> the <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> was <b>that</b> they were not different species.|$|R

5|$|Most early {{theories}} of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the Milky Way Galaxy. From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated {{in or near the}} galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way. However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|The Arabization of the Ayyubid ruling {{families}} differed starkly {{from the}} ranks of their armies, which lacked cultural cohesion, with Turks and Kurds dominating the cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filling the ranks of the infantry. These groups typically settled in the pastoral areas outside of the cities, the centers of cultural life, and as such they were relatively isolated from the Arabic-dominant urban environment. This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. It is thought that Saladin spoke Turkish to his military commanders. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of mamluks (military slaves). By {{the first half of the}} 13th century mamluks were mostly drawn from Kipchak Turks and Circassians and there is <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> these forces continued to speak Kipchak Turkish.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapter house}} has 40sedilia lining its walls, {{and may have}} {{originally}} provided seating for more when it was the meeting room for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its floor was raised by about 1m (3ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, {{and at that time}} or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when the floor was lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of Hell was found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> there was a church or shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.|$|E

30|$|In Study 2, we {{modified}} the Causal System Lesson to remove spatial language. Despite this change—and mirroring the primary findings of Study 1 —participants showed <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> of drawing on spatial analogy during their explanations. It appears that participants’ use of spatial analogy was spontaneous and not entirely cued by {{the wording of}} the lesson. Moreover, Study 2 yielded more cases of whole system gestures, providing <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> such gestures are more spatially complex than other gestures types.|$|R
50|$|Orthology is {{strictly}} {{defined in terms}} of ancestry. Given that the exact ancestry of genes in different organisms is difficult to ascertain due to gene duplication and genome rearrangement events, the <b>strongest</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> two similar genes are orthologous is usually found by carrying out phylogenetic analysis of the gene lineage. Orthologs often, but not always, have the same function.|$|R
5|$|There is <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> spiders' {{coloration}} is camouflage {{that helps}} them to evade their major predators, birds and parasitic wasps, {{both of which have}} good color vision. Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds, and some have disruptive coloration, stripes and blotches that break up their outlines. In a few species, such as the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator, several coloration schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant, and this may {{make it more difficult for}} predators to recognize the species. Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant-tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit. However, a few species with powerful venoms, large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors, and some actively display these colors when threatened.|$|E
5|$|There is very <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> comets have {{previously}} been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, {{the origin of}} which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into the satellites.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E

There is <b>strong</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> ECT causes structural brain damages, observable on MRI. Before these advanced brain imaging techniques, some researchers said that ECT doesn't cause physical damage. The observation on MRI of objective lesions {{in the brain}} is consistent with research on cognitive impairments.|$|R
6000|$|The only civil {{sentence}} which He had {{for error}} was, [...] "Get thee behind Me, Satan."

The relinquishment of error deprives material sense of its false claims.|$|R
25|$|The <b>strongest</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> a {{line was}} built as {{single-track}} and duplicated {{at a later}} date consists of major structures such as bridges and tunnels that are twinned.

5|$|Unlike phylogenetic studies {{based on}} {{morphological}} traits, molecular {{analyses of the}} internal phylogeny of the ants have given <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the armadillo ants are neither closely related to nor nested within the Myrmicinae. Brady et al. (2006), Moreau et al. (2006) and Rabeling et al. (2008) reconstructed phylogenetic trees with the agroecomyrmecines inside the 'poneroid' group of subfamilies, close to the Paraponerinae, and gave support for {{the exclusion of the}} genus from the Myrmicinae, a subfamily located inside the 'formicoid' clade. Given the early appearance of the Agroecomyrmecinae in the geologic record, the similarities of armadillo ants to Myrmicinae were hypothesized to represent convergence and/or retention of plesiomorphic forms.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E
30|$|The {{strong and}} {{persistent}} effect of relative female labor supply in immigrant women’s source countries on their labor supply {{behavior in the}} United States strongly suggests a role of culture in determining immigrant women’s US labor supply behavior, although, as we have just seen, assimilation is also important. In the following section we push harder on these results to provide <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they do indeed reflect the role of culture.|$|R
