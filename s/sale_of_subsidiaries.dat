A number of Budget measures, including {{the research and development}} tax credit for large companies and the exemption of capital gains on the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiaries,</b> are welcome and should improve the efficiency of the UK's tax system. All of these measures were subject to extensive prior consultation. A number of other measures were not foreshadowed in the Pre-Budget Report.

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 268 - 275. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. Divestment {{process and}} pricing [...] Chapter 3. Measuring {{discounts}} [...] Chapter 4. Liquidity pressure and discounts on trade sales [...] Chapter 5. Market response to sale announcements [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion. Officer (2007) finds that subsidiaries sold between public companies trade at a 30 % discount relative to comparable public market acquisitions. This discount {{is attributed to}} target parents selling assets under liquidity pressures and adverse credit market conditions. This implies a transfer of wealth from sellers to buyers, and a material friction {{in the market for}} corporate control. I present an alternative view. Assets sold by target parents {{are more likely to be}} poorly performing, non-core and sold at a tax loss. The reported discounts reflect this difference in underlying value, not a transfer of wealth from seller to buyer. I test whether reported discounts are driven by liquidity-pressured target parents or reflect the sale of less valuable subsidiaries. I present four key results. First, Officer (2007) uses the combination of arithmetic mean and percent discounts, procedures which are strongly influenced by asymmetric distribution of discounts. Alternative methods result in lower, or even zero, discounts. Second, measurement of discounts needs to allow for asset specific characteristics. I find that the target’s income status and size are associated with reported discounts. Third, using measures of financial constraints and new measures of seasoned equity market conditions, I find little correlation between discounts, measures of financial constraints and measures of equity market conditions. There is some evidence of a fire sale mechanism operating but the circumstances apply to a small portion of the sample, and cannot be used to explain pervasive discounts. Finally, acquirers buying assets at a discount should attract a larger share of wealth created in a sale. This result may explain the so-called listing effect. I find no association between discounts and the acquirer’s share of wealth created or returns. It is tempting to apply the logic of the private company discount to the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> by public companies. However publicly listed target parents have a wider range of funding strategies and exit strategies than privately owned companies. The case that sizable discounts on the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> exist, and are attributable to liquidity pressures on target parents, is still to be made.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} evidence has highlighted differences between transactions involving {{the acquisition of}} listed and unlisted (private) targets. Acquirers of unlisted targets earn excess returns, a result different to transactions involving the purchase of listed targets This research focuses on one segment {{of the market for}} unlisted targets, namely the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> by publicly listed companies. Officer (2007) finds that listed companies sell a segment of their business at an average 30 % discount relative to transactions involving publicly listed targets. This discount is attributed to liquidity pressure on the selling company, prompting a fire sale. This result implies a significant transfer of value from seller to buyer and, if correct, suggests a significant friction in the efficient reallocation of assets within the economy. I explore the robustness of this conclusion by examining four issues. Firstly, measurement issues raised by the use of valuation multiples to estimate comparative value. We consider the impact of these issues on reported results. This has implications for the use of multiples in both academic and applied settings. Secondly, even if liquidity pressures are the cause, the transmission mechanism is not well understood. Thirdly, other explanations have not been explored. The most obvious alternative explanation is that companies are undertaking strategic transactions to remove underperforming businesses. Other potential explanations include the impact of agency costs, and mispricing arguments. Finally, the potential for self selection raises endogenity issues which may affect statistical conclusions. We address these issues using a sample of private and public market acquisitions from the United States. 2 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the audit pricing by the auditor {{of a parent}} company (i. e., principal auditor) when other independent auditors who are not affiliated with the principal auditor (i. e., other auditors) {{are involved in the}} audit of the group financial statements. Using Korean data, we find that audit fees charged to the parent company by the principal auditor are negatively associated with the proportion of total assets or <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> audited by other auditors in the pre-IFRS period. This finding is consistent with the argument that the principal auditor views subsidiaries audited by other auditors as a business opportunity to attract new clients and thus offers fee discounts to its client. However, in the post-IFRS period, this negative relation between audit fees and the involvement of other auditors becomes insignificant or positive, suggesting that IFRS adoption restricts auditors' strategic behavior in audit pricing because IFRS adoption increases the audit complexity and risk associated with the involvement of other auditors...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the impact of {{cumulative}} experience that arise from a series of sequential entries on the performance <b>of</b> foreign <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>of</b> multinational firms. Drawing upon the literature on organizational learning, we propose that multinational firms acquire different types of experience at the firm level, including general entry experience, entry specific experience, and exporting experience, which exert different influences on their performance. We also investigate the effect of experience on performance at the subsidiary level. Using a dataset <b>of</b> 245 <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>of</b> 81 large U. S. firms in China, we find that firms' entry specific experience, exporting experience, and subsidiary level experience exhibit significant effects on the return on <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>subsidiaries.</b> Further, the effect of exporting experience gets weaker as firms accumulate more entry specific experience. Finns' general entry experience, however, is not related to subsidiary performance. © Gabler Verlag 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
