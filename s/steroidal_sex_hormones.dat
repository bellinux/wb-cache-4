C. sordellii and C. difficile form spores that {{are believed to be}} the infectious form of these bacteria. These spores return to toxin-producing vegetative cells upon binding to small molecule germinants. The endogenous compounds that regulate clostridial spore germination are not fully understood. While C. sordellii spores require three structurally distinct amino acids to germinate, the occurrence of postpregnancy C. sordellii infections suggests that <b>steroidal</b> <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> might regulate its capacity to germinate. On the other hand, C. difficile spores require taurocholate (a bile salt) and glycine (an amino acid) to germinate. Bile salts and steroid hormones are biosynthesized from cholesterol, suggesting that the common sterane structure can affect the germination of both C. sordellii and C. difficile spores. Therefore, we tested the effect of sterane compounds on C. sordellii and C. difficile spore germination. Our results show that both steroid hormones and bile salts are able to increase C. sordellii spore germination rates. In contrast, a subset of steroid hormones acted as competitive inhibitors of C. difficile spore germination. Thus, even though C. sordellii and C. difficile are phylogenetically related, the two species' spores respond differently to steroidal compounds...|$|E

40|$|Testicular cancer (TC) is {{currently}} the most common malignant solid tumour in Caucasian males aged 15 - 39  years. Epidemiological evidence suggests that its onset {{may be due to}} an imbalance in the action of <b>steroidal</b> <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> and their receptors. A faulty androgen receptor signalling pathway can, in fact, cause various male reproductive disorders. The androgen receptor (AR) gene has two polymorphic segments consisting of CAG and GGC repeats. The length of CAG repeats has been shown to affect the regulation of AR activity. In our study, we used fragment analysis to evaluate the AR gene repeats of 302 TC patients and 322 controls, to establish if there is any association between repeat number and TC. This study of the largest Italian caseload investigated to date highlighted three particularly significant aspects. First, a CAG repeat number of ≥ 25 may be considered a risk factor for the onset of TC, given its greater frequency in patients in comparison with controls. This difference became significant for the non-seminoma group. Second, men with CAG repeats below 21 or above 24 were found to have a, respectively, 50 and 76 % higher risk of TC than those with CAG 21 - 24, suggesting that these too can be considered a risk factor for TC.

40|$|<b>Steroidal</b> <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> play an {{important}} role in the neural control of breathing. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that gonadectomy in young male rats (3 months) eliminates a form of respiratory plasticity induced by intermittent hypoxia, known as long term facilitation (LTF). Testosterone replenishment restores LTF in gonadectomized male rats, and this is dependent on the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol by aromatase. By middle age (12 months), male rats no longer exhibit LTF of hypoglossal motor output; phrenic LTF is significantly reduced, and this persists into old age. We tested the hypothesis that LTF can be restored in old male rats by administration of testosterone. Intact Fischer 344 rats (> 20 months) were implanted with Silastic tubing containing testosterone (T), T plus an aromatase inhibitor (T+ADT), or 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a form of testosterone not converted to oestradiol. One week post-surgery, LTF of hypoglossal and phrenic motor output was measured. By comparison with control rats, hypoglossal LTF was increased in testosterone-treated rats, with levels approaching that of normal young rats. LTF was not restored in T+ADT or DHT-treated rats. Aromatase levels in hypoglossal and phrenic nuclei did not change with age. As serum testosterone levels did not decline with age, local bioavailability of testosterone in old rats may be a limiting factor in the expression of this form of respiratory plasticity.

Treatment with T as evidenced by the Morris water maze (MWM) test significantly shortened escape latency and reduced path length to reach the platform compared to the control (C). During probe trials, the T group displayed a significantly greater percent of time in the target quadrant and improved the number of platform crossings compared with C, flutamide (F), an antiandrogen, and a combined F and T group. Flutamide markedly inhibited the influence of T on cognitive performance. Following Nissl staining, the number of intact pyramidal cells was significantly elevated in the T group, and the effect of T was blocked by F. Immunohistochemisty and Western blot analysis showed that the protein expression level of Aβ 1 - 42 was markedly decreased and expression levels of synaptophysin (SYN) significantly increased with T, while F inhibited all T-mediated effects.

40|$|AbstractThere are {{well-known}} {{sex differences}} in the epidemiology and etiopathology of alcohol dependence. Male gender is a crucial risk factor for the onset of alcohol addiction. A directly modifying role of testosterone in alcohol addiction-related behavior is well established. <b>Sex</b> <b>hormones</b> exert both permanent (organizational) and transient (activational) effects on the human brain. The sensitive period for these effects lasts throughout life. In this article, we present a novel early <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> activity model of alcohol addiction. We propose that early exposure to <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> triggers structural (organizational) neuroadaptations. These neuroadaptations affect cellular and behavioral responses to adult <b>sex</b> <b>hormones,</b> sensitize the brain's reward system to the reinforcing properties of alcohol and modulate alcohol addictive behavior later in life. This review outlines clinical findings related to the early <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> activity model of alcohol addiction (handedness, the second-to-fourth-finger length ratio, and the androgen receptor and aromatase) and includes clinical and preclinical literature regarding the activational effects of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> in alcohol drinking behavior. Furthermore, we discuss {{the role of the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and -gonadal axes and the opioid system in mediating the relationship between <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> activity and alcohol dependence.

40|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>hormones</b> play a {{key role}} in the {{development}} and maturation of the human body. From functional tissue to anthropometrics, <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> and the activation of their receptors are crucial in the development of a foetus into the adult they will eventually become. In utero <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> mediate the development of many aspects of a growing body including functional tissue, making them crucial determinants of adult health. Throughout adult life, the activation of <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> receptors within functional tissue also attenuates the efficacy with which that tissue performs its functions, giving <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> an even more crucial role when determining health. The effects of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> have proven to be especially keen in determining pulmonary health, this has been found to be primarily due to the influence that <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> have in determining lung morphogenesis in utero, and determining alveolar quality, and pulmonary smooth muscle elasticity throughout adulthood. The importance of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> has inspired researchers to investigate the links between those hormones and pulmonary health – an area which has proven to be complex and layered beyond what had initially been believed. Owing to the complexity of the issues surrounding the influence of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> on health, researchers turned to investigating the potential of other sex-hormone mediated aspects of development such as anthropometric measurements, as indicators of the effect that <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> have had on an individual’s health and development. Investigating the links between digit ratio and pulmonary function, this study found that digit ratio can be used to determine the difference between individuals predicted respiratory function parameters and their measured parameters.

Methods &# 38; Results: A sex hormone-treated rat model was established in order to study the effects of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> on hepatic fetuin expression. Animal experiments revealed that 17 β-estradiol (E 2) - and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) -treated rats showed opposite effects in terms of body weight gain in both genders. Interestingly, Ft-A and Ft-B were sex-dependently expressed in the livers of rats, responding to different regulatory modes of <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> receptors (ERα, ERβ, and AR).

Methods Participants included post‐menopausal women who underwent hepatic ultrasound (n  =  345) at the Michigan {{site of the}} Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a population‐based study. We examined hepatic steatosis prevalence by race/ethnicity and used logistic regression models to calculate the odds of hepatic steatosis with race/ethnicity and <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> binding globulin, after adjustment for age, alcohol use, waist circumference, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure and use of medications reported to lower intrahepatic fat. Results Fewer African‐American women than non‐Hispanic white women had hepatic steatosis (23 vs. 36 %, P  =  0. 01). African‐American women had lower triglyceride and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but higher blood pressure and follicle‐stimulating hormone levels (P  <  0. 05). In the optimal‐fitting multivariable models, women in the highest tertile of <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> binding globulin (60. 2 – 220. 3  nmol/l) had a lower odds of hepatic steatosis (odds ratio  0. 43, 95 % CI 0. 20 – 0. 93) compared with women in the lowest tertile of <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> binding globulin (10. 5 – 40. 3  nmol/l). There was an interaction between race/ethnicity and medication use whereby non‐Hispanic white women using medications had three times higher odds of hepatic steatosis compared with African‐American women not using medications (odds ratio  3. 36, 95 %  CI 1. 07 – 10. 58).

Women of reproductive age are more likely to be admitted to hospital for asthma than men. 1 Intrigued by this, people have studied the link between asthma or allergy and markers of female <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> levels—for example, time of menstrual cycle, menopause, preg...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>hormones</b> and <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> binding {{globulin}} (SHBG) {{have been}} studied in 32 female post-menopausal patients (16 with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) and 16 with cryptogenic chronic liver disease (CLD). Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) serum levels were significantly higher in PBC compared to CLD subjects (p less than 0. 005). In PBC DHEA-S concentration was higher in precirrhotic than in cirrhotic patients (p less than 0. 02). SHBG was raised in both PBC and CLD patients but higher in CLD compared to PBC subjects (p less than 0. 002). PBC reveals a <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> pattern similar to post-menopausal subjects with breast cancer. These results suggest that <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> alteration is present in females with different types of liver disease, but the metabolic pattern is not due to liver disease per se...|$|R
40|$|We use {{fluctuations}} {{of female}} <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> occurring naturally over the menstrual cycle or induced by hormonal contraceptives {{to determine the}} importance of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> in explaining gender differences in competitiveness. Participants in a laboratory experiment solve a simple arithmetics task first under a piece rate and then under a competitive tournament scheme. Subjects can then choose which compensation scheme to apply in a third round. We find that <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> have a strong effect on whether women select into the competitive environment. The observed patterns are consistent with a negative impact especially of progesterone on competitiveness and our results therefore provide a partial biological explanation for gender differences in competitiveness. We consider three possible indirect pathways through which <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> could affect competitiveness: via an impact on risk aversion, via an impact on performance, and via an impact on overconfidence. None of these hold up to the data and we conclude that <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> have a more direct impact on competitiveness. competitiveness, gender differences, hormones, lab experiment...|$|R
