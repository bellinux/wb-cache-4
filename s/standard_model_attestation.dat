That is how their implications have no overlap, whilst together they explain most {{features of the}} <b>standard</b> <b>model.</b> To illustrate how these two theories might be combined, we consider the dual <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> in a theta vacuum. Whilst there are difficulties with such a calculation, the dual <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> does then appear to become naturally dualised.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 Since its {{foundation}} in the 20 th century, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> has been immensely powerful in explaining many particle physics phenomena. With {{the discovery of}} the Higgs boson at the LHC, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> seems to be complete. However, there are many observations that we cannot explain within the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model.</b> After giving an introduction to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model,</b> I focus on two questions that require beyond the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> physics in this thesis: (1) What is the particle nature of dark matter?
