The pendulum uses a standardized piece of rubber (FourS rubber also known as Slider 96), which is set up to travel across the flooring sample for 123-125mm, mounted onto the pendulum foot. When the arm of the pendulum is set up to miss the flooring completely, the arm swings up to parallel from where it started, and the pointer (brought along by the arm holding the rubber slider) reads zero. Slippery flooring produces readings close to zero, and flooring which show higher resistance to slipping give results further from zero—high numbers (such as those 36 and above) indicating suitable slip resistant flooring.|$|E

40|$|The {{conditions}} of a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle with absolutely hard steering {{have been found}} before. The analytically derived {{conditions of}} a secure stability loss in case of torsional stiffness are dependent {{on the relationship between}} the <b>slipping</b> <b>resistance</b> coefficients, the transverse clutch coefficients on the axes, and the torsional stiffness of the controlled wheel module. In this case, the trail distance is taken into account in the wheel module control system, the mass of the module being neglected. The approach suggested in the paper does take into account the mass of the controlled wheel module. The slipping forces are presented accurate to a cubic term of expansion in slipping angles. The torsional stiffness intervals have been found that provide a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle model. The intervals have been obtained {{on the basis of a}} bifurcation analysis of actual bifurcations of the stationary states in the vicinity of the rectilinear motion of the model.

40|$|Concern for the {{environment}} has lately heightened awareness {{about the need for}} recycling in the construction industry. However, some standards, such as the Spanish standard, only accept the recycling of aggregates derived from concrete, which limits the extensive use of construction and demolition waste, which are produced in much bigger volumes. The aim of this work was to explore the possibility of using recycled mixed aggregates (RMA) in the preparation of precast non-structural concretes. To that end different percentages of natural aggregate were replaced by RMA in non-structural elements (25, 50, 75 and 100 %). Contents of cement, water, and the dosages commonly used by companies were unchanged by the introduction of RMA. The characterization of the prepared elements has been done using the specific tests for each type of non-structural element (terrazzo for indoor use, hollow tiles, kerbstones and paving blocks) : compression and flexural strength, water absorption, dimensional tolerances, abrasion and <b>slipping</b> <b>resistance.</b> The paving blocks, kerbstones, and hollow tiles prepared were tested for 360 days.

The decrease in the absorption at about 660  nm was monitored over the course of 120  min. The color of the phosphate pigments was estimated using ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) reflectance spectra acquired with a UV 2100, Shimadzu Corporation instrument (reference compound: BaSO 4). The moisture retention of the samples was evaluated by mixing 0.3  g of each sample with 0.1  g of water, and the weight loss was then evaluated at 50  °C (MS- 70 Moisture Analyzer, A and D Instruments Co.

The particle smoothness was measured on artificial leather based on KES-SE objective evaluation of the surface friction (Kato Tech Co., Ltd.). The sample powders were spread onto the leather (load of sample: ca. 50  mg), and a sensor was then run over the powders (scan speed: 1  mm/s, area scanned: 3  cm 2). The terms MIU and MMD, respectively, represent the <b>slipping</b> <b>resistance</b> (µ, average value in a distance of 20  mm) and roughness of the powders (fluctuation of average frictional coefficient).

The design and development of a suitable test rig is described in some detail and the results of friction torque and film thickness measurements are compared with values predicted using recent elasto-hydrodynamic theory. It is shown that the reaction torque on the outer race may be ascribed to two principal sources. Firstly, to viscous rolling friction depending upon the product of speed and viscosity, and secondly to metallic hysteresis depending upon the load. If the maldistribution of load due to small dimensional differences in the rollers, is taken into consideration close agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical values of friction torque {{for a wide range of}} loads and speeds. At higher loads a third source becomes significant due to sliding between the ends of rollers and the lip of the inner race. A further important effect of the uneven loading of rollers is its influence on the life of a bearing. It is suggested that improved roller matching would result in an increase in bearing life. Measurements of race and cage speeds, taken throughout the investigation failed to detect any cage <b>slip.</b> Electrical <b>resistance</b> measurements made across the races confirm the presence of a lubricant film of a thickness which is consistent with theory.
