5000|$|On a boat {{having an}} inboard motor that turns a shaft {{attached}} to an external propeller, the shaft passes though a <b>stuffing</b> <b>box,</b> also termed a 'stern gland' in this application. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> prevents sea water {{from entering the}} boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The [...] "box" [...] is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the stern tube and the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> A sound <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.|$|R
40|$|The Hydro-Balanced <b>Stuffing</b> <b>Box</b> is a seal {{assembly}} for polished rod pumping installations commonly used in oil and gas pumping well installations to contain produced well fluids. The improved <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> was developed and patented by Harold H. Palmour of The Palmour Group of Livingston, TX. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is designed to {{reduce the incidence of}} seal leakage and to utilize an environmentally safe fluid, so that if there is any leakage, environmental damage is reduced or eliminated. The unit was tested on two wells at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center. During the test period, the performance of the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> was measured by monitoring the pressure on the tubing and the inner chamber with a Barton Two-pen recorder. The amount of safe fluid consumed, fluid leakage {{at the top of the}} <b>stuffing</b> <b>box,</b> pressure supplied from the nitrogen bottle, ambient temperature, and polish rod temperature was recorded. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is capable of providing a better seal between well fluids an d the environment than conventional <b>stuffing</b> <b>boxes.</b> It allows the polished rod to operate cooler and with lubrication, extending the life of the packing elements, and reducing the amount of attention required to prevent leakage...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 57 In recent years, cooling {{requirements}} for mechanical seals {{have become a}} subject of controversial opinions. While the maximum limiting temperatures of mechanical seals are known and specified by seal manufacturers, the actual temperatures in the sealing cavity of the pump <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> during pump operation are not readily available. A conservative approach has been to provide extra cooling to the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> However, the availability of clean cooling water is often scarce in many installations, and therefore, knowledge of the thermal behavior of the sealing cavity region becomes important. A developed analytical method, which utilizes the finite element analysis (FEA) technique to determine the thermal behavior of the pump <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> in the sealing region is presented. A single-stage overhung hot water (590 ?F) boiler circulation pump was analyzed. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> of the pump described herein the paper was equipped with API plan 23. The developed method {{is not limited to}} a specific API <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> piping plan, but can be used for a variety of cooling/flushing <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> configurations, such as API Plan 2, or others. The values of the heat transfer coefficients used in the method were found iteratively, based on published correlations for natural convection (Nusselt number vs Garashof number) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{technology}} {{provides a}} simple yet clever idea for preventing oil and saltwater polluting spills by sucker rod pumping oil wells, {{as well as}} prolonging {{the life of the}} <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> seals and pressure lubricating the polished rod. This objective is accomplished by introducing a non-polluting, food grade, high viscosity lubricant into the void space between two sets of seals in a typical <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> This safe-fluid acts as a sacrificial fluid that will be the fluid that is exposed to the atmosphere when the primary seal in the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> leaks for any reason. In addition, the pressure on this sacrificial safe-fluid is maintained at the same pressure as the pressure on the produced fluid in the flow line at the pumping tee, thereby equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal in the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> that separates the safe-fluid from the produced fluid. The unique feature, of equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal, is accomplished by using a pressure transmitter which is monitoring the pressure in the flow line (which is the fluid under the secondary seal) and transmitting that pressure to the safe-fluid (which is the fluid above the secondary seal) thereby equalizing the pressure across this secondary seal. The primary seal will be sealing the safe-fluid and will be operating under optimum conditions, extending the life of this primary seal. The principle of the invention was proven by equipping eight oil wells with Field Retro-Fit Packages of Independent component parts to hydro-balance the existing <b>stuffing</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> of a {{sailboat}} {{will have a}} stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. <b>Stuffing</b> <b>box</b> components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|R

50|$|In {{a common}} type of <b>stuffing</b> <b>box,</b> rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> A {{traditional}} variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of flax or hemp impregnated with wax and lubricants. A turn of the adjusting nut compresses the shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just {{enough to make the}} seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when the shaft is turning. The drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat.|$|R

50|$|Later developments, also by Watt, {{produced}} a double-acting cylinder. The piston rod {{now had to}} transmit a force alternately pushing and pulling.

40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> pressure equalization line (balance line) to lower <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> pressures. This technique of pressure equalization has a major drawback: reduced pump efficiency. The work that is done on the fluid that is throttled back to suction through the balance line is lost and acts to reduce the useful work done by the pump. While this was an acceptable compromise in the 1950 s, {{it is now a}} true waste of very expensive electrical power. The modern solution to this problem is to eliminate the balance line and apply a correctly specified mechanical seal to the high pressure side of the pump. This paper serves to show that, with careful consideration of the effects of balance line removal, pump life can be maintained and efficiency gained...|$|R
50|$|The {{surface unit}} {{transfers}} energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the sucker rod string. In doing this, it must change the rotary {{motion of the}} prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the sucker rod. And it must reduce {{the speed of the}} prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of thencrank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker rod string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker rod string above <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> The polished rod and <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> combination is used to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface.|$|R
