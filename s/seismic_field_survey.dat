40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{describe}} {{the results of a}} <b>seismic</b> <b>field</b> <b>survey</b> carried out at Copahue Volcano, Southern Andes, Argentina, using a small-aperture, dense seismic antenna. Copahue Volcano is an active volcano that exhibited a few phreatic eruptions in the last 20 years. The aim of this experiment was to record and classify the background seismic activity of this volcanic area, and locate the sources of local earthquakes and volcanic tremor. Data consist of several volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes, and many samples of back-ground seismic noise. We use both ordinary spectral, and multi-spectral techniques to measure the spectral content, and an array technique [Zero Lag Cross Correlation technique] to measure the back-azimuth and apparent slowness of the signals propagating across the array. We locate VT earthquakes using a procedure based on the estimate of slowness vector components and S–P time. VT events are located mainly along the border of the Caviahue caldera lake, positioned at the South-East of Copahue volcano, in a depth interval of 1 – 3 kmbelow the surface. The background noise shows the presence of many transients with high correlation among the array stations in the frequency band centered at 2. 5 Hz. These transients are superimposed to an uncorrelated background seismic signal. Array solutions for these transients show a predominant slowness vector pointing to the exploited geothermal field of “Las Maquinitas” and “Copahue Village”, located about 6 km north of the array site. We interpret this coherent signal as a tremor generated by the activity of the geothermal field...|$|E
40|$|The seismic {{reflection}} {{characteristics of}} a coal-bed methane reservoir are studied with synthetic modeling and a <b>seismic</b> <b>field</b> <b>survey.</b> The reservoir consiste of two coal seams encountered at depths of 404 m and 414 m below surface. The coals are understood to be saturated with an aqueous phase. A simple rock physics model is assumed in order to investigate the AVO response of the existing wet coals and that of hypothetical “dry” coals. The model {{results show that the}} seismic reflectivities of the wet and dry coals are sufficiently distinct that the AVO response should discriminate between the two states of water saturation. In the summer of 2006, two 1 C- 2 D seismic lines were acquired by the University of Calgary at the study site using an ENVI mini-vibe source. Although the source sweep was 10 - 200 Hz, the reflected energy had lesser bandwidth with a major peak in the amplitude spectrum at ~ 30 Hz and a lesser peak ~ 75 Hz. The signal to noise ratio diminishes above 100 Hz. Reflection continuity and frequency content improve by excluding near-offsets from the stack. Radial trace filtering is successfully used to remove linear noise from the shot gathers. Various methods of boosting amplitudes at higher frequencies (spectral whitening, surface-consistent deconvolution, Gabor deconvolution) improve data quality in the 0 - 100 Hz range. Although the signal bandwidth is limited and the target are thin, closely space beds, the coals are resolved as two distinct events in the migrated seismic section...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} {{several types}} of MEMS accelerometers using commercial MEMS elements for trial use in <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys.</b> <b>Field</b> experiments and earthquake observations were carried out for investigating {{the capabilities of the}} MEMS accelerometers. The results of these experiments and observations show that the properties of these MEMS accelerometers are similar and that they are about 1. 5 - 3. 0 times as sensitive as conventional geophones used in seismic surveys. The noise level of the MEMS 3 -C accelerometer in natural earthquake observation was about 10 - 4 kine (cm/s), and the useable frequency band extends to below 1 Hz. For future works, we will further investigate the characteristic of MEMS geophones in low frequency band using earthquake records. In addition, we will reexamine the electronic circuit and the MEMS elements in order to attain high sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic compressional- and shear-wave {{attenuation}} measurements {{have been}} made on 40, centimetre-sized samples of water- and oil-saturated oolitic limestones at 50 MPa effective hydrostatic pressure (confining pressure minus pore-fluid pressure) at frequencies of about 0. 85 MHz and 0. 7 MHz respectively, using the pulse-echo method. The mineralogy, porosity, permeability {{and the distribution of}} the pore types of each sample were determined using a combination of optical and scanning electron microscopy, a helium porosimeter and a nitrogen permeameter. The limestones contain a complex porosity system consisting of interparticle macropores (dimensions up to 300 microns) and micropores (dimensions 5 – 10 microns) within the ooids, the calcite cement and the mud matrix. Ultrasonic attenuation reaches a maximum value in those limestones in which the dual porosity system is most fully developed, indicating that the squirt-flow mechanism, which has previously been shown to occur in shaley sandstones, also operates in the limestones. It is argued that the larger-scale dual porosity systems present in limestones in situ could similarly cause seismic attenuation at the frequencies of <b>field</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> through the operation of the squirt-flow mechanism...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a new {{approach}} to gravity-gradient noise subtraction for underground gravitational-wave detectors in homogeneous rock. The method is based on spatial harmonic expansions of <b>seismic</b> <b>fields.</b> It is shown that gravity-gradient noise produced by <b>seismic</b> <b>fields</b> from distant sources, stationary or non-stationary, can be calculated from seismic data measured locally at the test mass. Furthermore, the formula is applied to <b>seismic</b> <b>fields</b> from stationary local sources. It is found that gravity gradients from these fields can be subtracted using local seismic measurements. The results are confirmed numerically with a finite-element simulation. A new seismic-array design is proposed that provides the additional information about the <b>seismic</b> <b>field</b> required to ensure applicability of the approach to realistic scenarios even with inhomogeneous rock and non-stationary local sources.

40|$|We {{intend to}} perform {{experiments}} that simulate real Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) {{conditions in the}} laboratory, and hence provide the necessary knowledge to interpret <b>field</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys.</b> Primarily, our research is focused on determining seismic rock properties (i. e., wave velocities and attenuation) of real and artificial 50 mm diameter brine-CO 2 -bearing sandstone and sand samples that are representative host rocks of real CCS scenarios. Accordingly, we have integrated into a new triaxial cell system both an ultrasonic pulse-echo method for accurate velocity (± 0. 3 %) and attenuation (± 0. 1 dB cm- 1) measurements, and an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method to monitor homogeneity of pore fluid distribution within the samples. The use of ERT provides calibration data for field scale techniques (such as marine controlled source electromagnetic surveying) but also allows measurements of bulk resistivity, fluid diffusion monitoring, flow pathway characterization, and determination of the relative permeability for different brine/brine-CO 2 ratios. By simultaneously measuring ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and electrical resistivity, we also provide data for joint inversion of <b>seismic</b> and electric <b>field</b> data. Furthermore, the stress-strain behaviour of the sample is continuously monitored {{with the aid of}} electrical gauges, so that we deal consistently and simultaneously with the geophysical and geomechanical response of the reservoir when submitted to CO 2 injections...|$|R
40|$|Timing and {{distribution}} of fractures related to folding is a crucial topic for migration and accumulation of hydrocarbons in structural traps. We performed sandbox analogue models to investigate the fracture patterns evolution in fault-related anticlines, e. g. fault-propagation and fault-bend fold. Analogue models allow us to: (i) reproduce geometry and kinematics {{of different kinds of}} folds, and (ii) describe and quantify fractures through time in all deformation stages. Three-dimensional digital model reconstructions facilitate the comparison of different steps in the evolution of fault-related anticlines and to highlight similarities and differences in fractures development. Quantitative parameters of fractures as orientation, number and average length have been acquired in each step of deformation using an automated procedure. The fault-related anticline models show that fractures development evolves with a cyclic and non-linear trend, depending on the geometry and kinematic of anticlines. We validate our approach by comparing experimental results with natural cases. Our methodology combined with other studies such as <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys,</b> <b>field</b> analyses and boreholes data may contribute to understanding the nature of fracture networks in real fault-related anticlines, identifying uncertainties and helping to reduce risks during exploration and drilling activities...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{technique}} {{used to estimate}} the anisotropy parameter is directly measure them from the core which is extracted through a special hollow drill bit during drill process. Since coring a sample will generate large extra cost, only limited number of core samples can be obtained for each well. Thus the anisotropy parameter obtained through core measurement technique only represent the anisotropy property of rock near the borehole at just several specific depth, rending this technique often provides little help on the <b>field</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> application. The measurements on each shale plug require at least one week.From {{the context of this}} article, wave propagation in a vertically transverse medium can be described with five elastic constants, and ratios among these parameters define the rock anisotropy [...] This anisotropy parameter can be obtained in the laboratory by measuring the velocity travel speed with transducer ultrasonic systems at variable saturation and pressure conditions. Usually, three directions of wave propagation on core samples are the minimum requirement to estimate the five elastic coefficients of the stiffness tensor. Each direction in core plug measurement yields three velocities (one P and two S).|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a near surface seismic test at a coal {{fire in the}} Southern Ute Nation near Durango, Colorado. The goal was to characterize and image the unburned coal and adjacent burned zone {{in order to determine}} the feasibility of any future <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys.</b> The <b>field</b> <b>survey</b> was preceded by a numerical study to optimize the survey design for the field test. The numerical study suggested that field experiments would rely on creating energy with sufficiently high frequencies, ideally greater than 125 Hz. Reflections or refractions from the top of the coal layer might indicate its presence or absence. Separately imaging of both the top and bottom of the coal layer or burned zone likely would be beyond the resolution of a reflection survey. Data from line 1, which overlies unburned coal at approximately 16 m depth, show useful frequency content above 100 Hz and a reflection that we interpret to originate at approximately 11 m depth. Data from line 2, which crosses the burn front and many fissures, are of lower quality with predominantly jumbled arrivals and some evidence of reflected energy at one or two shot points. It seems that neither the refraction nor reflection method is capable of imaging down to the coal layer; due in part to the presence of unexpected high-velocity layers overlying the coal. We conclude that information about the coal is obscured by a reflection from shallower layers and by chaotic arrivals generated by fissures. Based on our data, we suggest that further seismic work at the site is unlikely to successfully characterize the coal fire zone of interest...|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} aims {{to retrieve}} the Green’s function between two receiver stations by correlating measurements of seismic responses at both stations, effectively turning one sta-tion into a virtual source. Passive seismic interferometry has mainly focused on retrieving high-frequency (> 10) Hz virtual sources where acquiring data with real sources is undesirable. Thus far, results of passive seismic interferometry have been less than promising, partially due to directionality of the am-bient seismic wavefield and poor sampling of the medium by passive seismic sources. More recently, the ambient <b>seismic</b> <b>field</b> at lower frequencies (< 10) Hz {{has been shown to}} contain sufficient coherent and omnidirectional seismic energy to yield low-frequency Green’s functions containing direct arrivals in a marine environment. Here we report results achieved by low-frequency seismic interferometry on a land dataset recorded at a field in Saudi Arabia. Results suggest that sufficient coher-ent energy is recorded between 1 Hz and 7 Hz for retrieval of a Rayleigh surface wave. The strength of the ambient <b>seismic</b> <b>field</b> affects the convergence rate of the correlations. The di-rectionality in the ambient <b>seismic</b> <b>field</b> affects the radiation pattern of the virtual sources.
