It is possible that <b>sivelestat</b> improves the outcome of septic patients associated with ARDS and DIC. Methods: A retrospective data analysis of septic patients associated with ARDS and DIC was conducted to investigate the effects of <b>sivelestat.</b> Observational period was 5 days after admission to ICU. Results: The study included 167 septic patients associated with ARDS and DIC. Control group included 133 patients without <b>sivelestat</b> and <b>sivelestat</b> group included 34 patients started to de administered <b>sivelestat</b> on the admission to ICU. The lung injury scores and Pa_[O 2]/Fi_[O 2] ratio of the <b>sivelestat</b> group were significantly more severe than those of the control group from day 1 to day 4. On day 5, the lung injury score and Pa_[O 2]/Fi_[O 2] ratio of the <b>sivelestat</b> group improved to the same levels of those of the control group. The DIC score of <b>sivelestat</b> group improved on day 3 in comparison to day 1, those of control group remained unchanged until day 4. The length of ICU stay of the <b>sivelestat</b> group was significantly shorter than that of the control group. A stepwise multiple logistic-regression analysis showed the <b>sivelestat</b> administration to be an independent predictor of survival of the septic patients associated with both ARDS and DIC. Conclusions: The length of ICU stay of the <b>sivelestat</b> group was significantly shorter than that of the control group.

In part, {{this is due to the}} wide variety of factors involved in the etiology of ALI/ARDS. In this study, we examined the {{efficacy of}} <b>sivelestat</b> in patients with ALI/ARDS associated with abdominal sepsis. Methods: The subjects were 49 patients with ALI/ARDS after surgery for abdominal sepsis. The efficacy of <b>sivelestat</b> was retrospectively assessed in two treatment groups, ie, a <b>sivelestat</b> group (n = 34) and a non-sivelestat group (n = 15). Results: The <b>sivelestat</b> group showed significant improvements in oxygenation, thrombocytopenia, and multiple organ dysfunction score. The number of ventilator days (6. 6 &plusmn; 6. 1 versus 11. 1 &plusmn; 8. 4 days; P = 0. 034) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (8. 5 &plusmn; 6. 2 versus 13. 3 &plusmn; 9. 5 days; P = 0. 036) were significantly lower in the <b>sivelestat</b> group. The hospital mortality rate decreased by half in the <b>sivelestat</b> group, but was not significantly different between the two groups.

40|$|The {{neutrophil}} elastase inhibitor <b>sivelestat</b> (ONO- 5046) possesses unknown {{mechanisms of}} cardioprotection when infused following global ischemia, {{even in the}} absence of neutrophils. Since myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during reperfusion, we have tested the hypothesis that infusion of <b>sivelestat</b> during postischemic low flow would preserve endothelial and contractile function and reduce infarct size through an ROS-mediated mechanism. Isolated male rat hearts, subjected to global ischemia of 25 minutes, were reperfused with low flow with or without <b>sivelestat</b> followed by a full flow reperfusion. Hearts treated with <b>sivelestat</b> showed a significant improvement of LV contractile function and a reduction in infarct size. Infusion of L-NAME (nonspecific blocker of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)) along with <b>sivelestat</b> during reperfusion reversed the preservation of contractile function and infarct size. In vitro EPR spin trapping experiments showed that <b>sivelestat</b> treatment decreased superoxide adduct formation in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation. Similarly, dihydroethidine (DHE) staining showed decreased superoxide production in LV sections from sivelestat-treated hearts.

40|$|Objectives: To {{conduct a}} cost-minimisation {{analysis}} of <b>sivelestat</b> sodium hydrate treatment for {{patients in the}} intensive care unit (ICU) with acute lung injury (ALI) associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection. Design: The analysis was performed based on data from a phase III randomised, multicentre, double-blind, controlled clinical study of up to 14 days treatment with <b>sivelestat,</b> in which the effect of intravenous <b>sivelestat</b> at a high dose (0. 20 mg/kg/h; the <b>sivelestat</b> group) was compared with that at a low dose (0. 004 mg/kg/h, effectively a placebo; the control group). Patients: Patients with ALI associated with SIRS caused by infection, who began their treatment under mechanical ventilation management in the ICU. Methods: A four-stage Markov model was constructed to represent the possible conditions of an ALI patient: ICU plus intubated mechanical ventilation; ICU plus weaned from a mechanical ventilator; admission to the general ward; and death. The base-case analysis used a mechanical ventilator weaning daily rate of 2. 9 % for the control group and 4. 0 % for the <b>sivelestat</b> group, and the same mortality (1. 2 %) for both groups at all stages of the Markov model. Medical costs were estimated from standard fees and Japanese National Health Insurance drug prices included fees for hospitalisation within the ICU and general wards, mechanical ventilation, examinations and drug expenditure. Costs were in 2001 values. Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the weaning rate, mortality, time between weaning and discharge to the general ward, and drug costs. Perspective: Payers of healthcare costs. Main Outcomes: The expected 30 -day medical costs per patient in the control and <b>sivelestat</b> groups were Japanese yen (Yen) 4 _ 144 _ 887 and Yen 3 _ 975 _ 451, respectively; a difference of Yen 169 _ 436. Drug expenditure accounted for more than half of the medical costs for each group. The periods under mechanical ventilation management and in the ICU for the <b>sivelestat</b> group were shorter than those for the control group by 2 and 1. 8 days, respectively. This was of significance in the reduction of the medical costs.

However, the usefulness of combination therapy with a selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor, <b>sivelestat,</b> and recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) for patients with ARDS and DIC remains unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 142 ARDS patients with DIC to assess the effects of <b>sivelestat</b> combined with rhTM. Patients were divided into four groups: control (no <b>sivelestat</b> or rhTM treatment), <b>sivelestat</b> treatment alone, rhTM treatment alone, and combined treatment with <b>sivelestat</b> and rhTM. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess subject mortality rates. The efficacy of these drugs was evaluated based on survival rate, number of ventilator-free days, and change in PaO 2 /FIO 2 (P/F) ratios and DIC scores before and at 7 days after a diagnosis of ARDS with DIC. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that patient age, combination therapy, gas exchange, organ failure, cause, associated disease score, and serum C-reactive protein levels were predictors of mortality for patients with ARDS and DIC. As compared with untreated controls, combination therapy significantly improved the 60 -day survival rate of patients with ARDS and DIC. There were significantly more ventilator-free days for those who received combination therapy than for untreated controls. P/F ratios and DIC scores were significantly improved with <b>sivelestat</b> alone, rhTM alone, or their combination as compared with untreated controls. Conclusion: Our results suggest that combined treatment with <b>sivelestat</b> and rhTM has beneficial effects on survival and the respiratory and DIC status of patients with ARDS and DIC.

It is heterogeneous and has a high mortality rate. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment {{and there is no}} definitive pharmacological treatment as yet. <b>Sivelestat</b> is a neutrophil elastase inhibitor approved in Japan and the Republic of Korea for acute lung injury, including acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The aim of this review is to examine the clinical utility of <b>sivelestat</b> in different disease states, using data from nonclinical and clinical studies. In nonclinical studies, <b>sivelestat</b> appears to show benefit in acute lung injury without inhibiting the host immune defense in cases of infection. Clinical studies do not yet provide a clear consensus. Phase III and IV Japanese studies have shown improvements in pulmonary function, length of intensive care unit stay, and mechanical ventilation, but a non-Japanese multicenter study did not demonstrate <b>sivelestat</b> to have an effect on ventilator-free days or 28 -day all-cause mortality. Evidence of improvement in various parameters, including duration of stay in intensive care, mechanical ventilation, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio) ratio, and lung injury scores, has been shown in patients with sepsis or gastric aspiration, and following the surgical treatment of esophageal cancer. To date, there are no particular concerns regarding adverse events, and the available data do not suggest that <b>sivelestat</b> might worsen infections. One study has analyzed cost-effectiveness, finding that <b>sivelestat</b> may reduce costs compared with standard care. The currently available evidence suggests that <b>sivelestat</b> may show some benefit in the treatment of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, although large, randomized controlled trials are needed in specific pathophysiological conditions to explore these potential benefits.

40|$|Abstract. Acute pancreatitis, {{affecting}} 382, 014 individuals {{annually in}} China, is life-threatening in its severe form. Since acute pancreatitis-associated morbidity or mortality is attributable mainly to functional {{failure of the}} vital organs, significant research efforts {{have focused on the}} identification of novel agents with potential organ-protective properties in the hope of developing approaches to improve the outcome of acute pancreatitis. In a previous study, we demonstrated that <b>sivelestat,</b> a specific inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE), is effective in protecting against lung failure in rats with taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis. As part of the analyses extended from that study, the present study aimed to evaluate the role of <b>sivelestat</b> in the protection against acute pancreatitis-associated renal injury. Renal histopathology and major renal function parameters were analyzed in renal tissue and blood specimens collected from rats with acute pancreatitis induced by the surgical administration of sodium taurocholate in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>sivelestat</b> treatment and in sham-operated control rats at various time-points. The extended analyses demonstrated that: i) sodium taurocholate induced apparent renal injury and dysfunction manifested by histological anomalies, including vacuolization and apoptosis of the cells of the tubular epithelial lining in the kidney, as well as biochemical aberrations in the blood (increases in levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and tumor necrosis factor-α) and renal tissue (robust increases in NE activity and induced neutrophil chemoattractant- 1 levels); and ii) <b>sivelestat</b> treatment effectively attenuated all taurocholate-induced histological anomalies and biochemical aberrations.

40|$|PURPOSE: It seems {{controversial}} {{whether or}} not neutrophil elastase inhibitors are effective in attenuating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We thus investigated possible protective effects of <b>sivelestat,</b> a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, against myocardial stunning i. e., prolonged myocardial dysfunction following a brief episode of ischemia. METHODS: Swine were divided into control group (group C), low-dose <b>sivelestat</b> group (group L), and high-dose <b>sivelestat</b> group (group H) (n = 7 for each group). All the swine were subjected to myocardial ischemia through ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 12 -min, followed by 90 -min reperfusion. <b>Sivelestat</b> was infused intracoronally at concentrations of 6 and 60 mg/ml throughout the reperfusion period in groups L and H, respectively, while saline was infused in the group C. Heart rate (HR), left ventricular developed pressure (LVdP), maximum rate of LVdP (LVdP/dt (max)), LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), percentage of segment shortening (%SS, an index of regional myocardial contractility), and coronary venous interleukin- 6 concentration in the LAD perfusion area were measured before ischemic induction and during reperfusion. RESULTS: The ischemia/reperfusion insult did not cause any significant changes in HR, LVdP, LVdP/dt (max), and LVEDP in all groups. However, it significantly reduced %SS in the LAD perfusion area and increased the interleukin- 6 concentration in group C. Those changes in %SS and the interleukin- 6 concentration were both greatly attenuated, but not prevented, in groups L and H.

The clinical efficacy of the neutrophil elastase inhibitor, <b>sivelestat,</b> for patients with ALI associated with SIRS has not been convincingly demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine if there are clinical features of patients with this condition that affect the efficacy of <b>sivelestat.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective study of 110 ALI patients with SIRS. Clinical information, including the etiology of ALI, the number of organs failing, scoring systems for assessing the severity of illness, and laboratory data, was collected at the time of diagnosis. Information on the number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) and changes in PaO 2 /FIO 2 (ΔP/F) before and 7 days after the time of ALI diagnosis was also collected. The effect of <b>sivelestat</b> on ALI patients was also examined based on whether they had sepsis and whether their initial serum procalcitonin level was ≥ 0. 5 ng/mL. Results: There were 70 patients who were treated with <b>sivelestat</b> and 40 control patients. VFDs and ΔP/F were significantly higher in the treated patients than in the control patients. However, there was no significant difference in the patient survival rate between the two groups. <b>Sivelestat</b> was more effective in ALI patients with a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio ≥ 140 mmHg or sepsis. <b>Sivelestat</b> significantly prolonged survival and led to higher VFDs and increased ΔP/F in septic patients and patients with initial serum procalcitonin levels ≥ 0. 5 ng/mL.

The aim of this study was to evaluate platelet dynamics in the hepatic microcirculation after I/R by intravital microscopy (IVM) and to clarify the relationship between platelet adhesion and neutrophil activation. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into two groups: the control (administration of saline) group and the <b>sivelestat</b> group in which neutrophil activation was suppressed by <b>sivelestat</b> before I/R.

40|$|Objective: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an {{inflammatory}} demyelinating {{disease of the}} central nervous system associated with pathogenic autoantibodies against the astrocyte water channel protein aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4). The presence of neutrophils is a characteristic feature in NMO lesions in humans. Neutrophils are not generally found in multiple sclerosis lesions. We evaluated the role of neutrophils in a mouse NMO model. Methods: NMO lesions were produced in mice by intracerebral injection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from NMO patient serum and human complement. We previously reported that this mouse model produces the characteristic histological features of NMO, including perivascular complement activation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and loss of myelin, AQP 4, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Lesions are absent when AQP 4 null mice are used or when IgG from non-NMO patients is injected. Results: We found remarkably reduced neuroinflammation, myelin loss, and AQP 4 loss in brains of neutropenic mice at 24 hours and 7 days, and increased severity of NMO lesions in mice made neutrophilic by granulocyte colony stimulating factor. NMO lesions were greatly reduced by intracerebral administration of the neutrophil protease inhibitors <b>Sivelestat</b> and cathepsin G inhibitor I or by intraperitoneal injection of <b>Sivelestat</b> alone. Immunostaining of human NMO lesions for neutrophil elastase revealed many degranulating perivascular neutrophils, with no equivalent perivascular neutrophils in human multiple sclerosis lesions. Interpretation: Our data implicate a central role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of early NMO lesions and suggest the potential utility of neutrophil protease inhibitors such as <b>Sivelestat</b> in NMO therapy.

40|$|We {{have proved}} that <b>Sivelestat</b> {{preserved}} lung function after cardiopulmonary bypass（ CPB） in the rabbit model. We now report the therapeutic efficacy of <b>Sivelestat</b> {{in the clinical}} case. From July 2005, 16 patients who underwent aortic arch replacements were enrolled in this study. Diagnosis included dissected aortic aneurysm in 6 patients, true aortic arch aneurysm in 8, and traumatic aortic arch aneurysm in 1 patient. We randomly divided these patients into two groups. In the Pre-Group（ Pre:n= 8 ）, infusion of Sivelestat（ 0. 2 mg/kg/hr） was started before the operation; in the Post-Group（ Post:n= 8 ）, it was started after the operation. Serum elastase activity, interleukin- 8 （ IL- 8 ） levels were measured before the operation, before cessation of CPB {{and at the end}} of operation. Blood gas analyses were measured before the operation, at one and three hours after the CPB and the next morning. Because the preoperative P/F ratio（ arterial PO 2 /FiO 2 ） varies with each case, the value of the P/F ratio at one hour after the CPB was calculated for 100 %. Elastase activity of both groups were increased at the end of CPB（ Pre: 8. 9 ± 10. 6, Post: 4. 6 ± 3. 5 ）, then returned to baseline level at end of operation（ NS）. IL- 8 of both groups were increased at end of CPB, then in the Pre-Group decreased to 59. 3 ± 25. 0 pg/ml, but in the Post-Group increased to 97. 9 ± 45. 7 pg/ml（ p= 0. 09 ）.

However, findings on chest radiographs and venti-lation parameters improved following additional administration of <b>Sivelestat,</b> a small molecule inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. Case 1 A 16 -yr-old left-handed girl was admitted to our hospital because of menorrhagia and pancytopenia. The patient had been well a month earlier, when she had experienced a prolonged period and heavy menstrual flow. She consulted a clinic because of general fatigue, and was referred to this hospital. She had a temperature of 37. 5 C, a pulse rate of 110 /min, a respiration rate of 40 /min, and he...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pathology}} of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), {{in contrast}} to multiple sclerosis, comprises granulocyte infiltrates along extensive lengths of spinal cord, as well as optic nerve. Furthermore, IFN-beta treatment worsens NMO. We recently found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with Th 17 cells is exacerbated by IFN-beta, {{in contrast to}} disease induced with Th 1 where treatment attenuated symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study demonstrates the similarities between NMO and Th 17 EAE and how neutrophils mediate pathology in Th 17 disease. METHODS: Levels of blood biomarkers in NMO were assessed by Luminex and ELISA. Effects of IFN-beta on neutrophils were assessed by culture assays and immunofluorescence. EAE was induced by transfer of myelin-specific Th 1 or Th 17 cells and treated with <b>Sivelestat</b> sodium hydrate, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor. RESULTS: We show Th 17 cytokines, granulocyte chemokines, type 1 interferon and neutrophil elastase are elevated in patients with definitive NMO. In culture, we find that IFN-beta stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase. In Th 17 EAE, we demonstrate neutrophilic infiltration in the optic nerve and spinal cord which was not present in Th 1 EAE. Blockade of neutrophil elastase with <b>Sivelestat</b> had efficacy in Th 17 EAE but not Th 1 EAE. CONCLUSIONS: The similarities between Th 17 EAE and NMO indicate that this model represents several aspects of NMO. Neutrophils are critical in the pathologies of both Th 17 -EAE and NMO, and therefore blockade of neutrophil elastase is a promising target in treating NMO...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Fat {{embolism}} syndrome (FES) {{associated with}} acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinical condition following long bone fracture. We have reported 14 victims due to ALI with FES. Our laboratory {{has developed an}} animal model that produced fat emboli (FE). The major {{purpose of this study}} was to test whether neutrophil activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and inhibition with <b>sivelestat</b> (SVT) exert protection on the lung. Methods The lungs of Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated and perfused. FE was produced by addition of corn oil micelles into the lung perfusate. PMA and SVT were given simultaneously with FE. Parameters such as lung weight/body weight ratio, LW gain, exhaled nitric oxide (NO), protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage relating to ALI were measured. The neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and phopholipase A 2 activity were determined. We also measured the nitrate/nitrite, methyl guanidine (MG), and cytokines. Pulmonary arterial pressure and microvascular permeability were assessed. Lung pathology was examined and scored. The inducible and endothelial NO synthase (iNOS and eNOS) were detected. Results FE caused ALI and increased biochemical factors. The challenge also resulted in pulmonary hypertension and increased microvascular permeability. The NE appeared to be the first to reach its peak at 1 hr, followed by other factors. Coadministration with PMA exacerbated the FE-induced changes, while SVT attenuated the effects of FE. Conclusions The FE-induced lung changes were enhanced by PMA, while SVT had the opposite effect. <b>Sivelestat,</b> a neutrophil inhibitor may be a therapeutic choice for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following fat embolism. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{vascular}} disease (PVD) {{and lung}} hypoplasia (LH) {{are the two}} main causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Previous {{studies have shown that}} remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by elastase and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes, concomitant with smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and deposition of ECM proteins and growth factors, leads to primary pulmonary hypertension (PH) and that blockade of this pathway results in disease reversal. The aim of our study is to determine whether a similar pathway is induced in the PVD associated with CDH and to verify whether its inhibition will lead to reversal of PVD. Firstly, we confirmed various aspects of PVD in the nitrofen induced CDH rat model. These included: left lung hypoplasia, right ventricular hypertrophy, and increased arterial smooth muscle wall thickness alongside decreases in arterial lumen area and total number of distal pulmonary vessels. We also showed increases in elastase and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzyme activities within distal pulmonary arteries (PAs), which, we were able to inhibit using serine elastase (<b>sivelestat,</b> elafin, and serpina 1) and MMP (GM 6001) inhibitors. Furthermore, we confirmed increased SMC proliferation and deposition of osteopontin (OPN) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) within the diseased vasculatures. We are now working on using <b>sivelestat</b> and GM 6001 pharmaceuticals as well as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) modified to express elafin and serpina 1 to determine their abilities to reverse the PVD associated with CDH. This project is part of our translational research program with the ultimate goal of developing a novel strategy of targeting PVD in infants with CDH to improve patient survival and long-term outcome...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{development}} consumes {{huge amounts}} {{of time and money}} and the search for novel analgesics, which are urgently required, is particularly difficult, having resulted in many setbacks in the past. Drug repurposing - the identification of new uses for existing drugs - is an alternative approach, which bypasses most of the time- and cost-consuming components of drug development. Recent, unexpected findings suggest a role for several existing drugs, such as minocycline, ceftriaxone, <b>sivelestat,</b> and pioglitazone, as novel analgesics in chronic and neuropathic pain states. Here, we discuss these findings as well as their proposed antihyperalgesic mechanisms and outline the merits of pathway based repurposing screens, in combination with bioinformatics and novel cellular reprogramming techniques, for the identification of novel analgesics...|$|E
40|$|A 49 -year-old semi-conscious {{woman was}} {{admitted}} due to fever and dehydration. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), renal dysfunction and diabetic ketoacidosis were detected. Whole body computed tomography showed multiple nodular lesions in bilateral lungs and kidneys indicating septic emboli, and intrauterine lesions. We diagnosed multiple organ failure followed by intrauterine infection due to untreated diabetes mellitus. Vaginal discharge and blood culture revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae. We used multi-antibiotics for sepsis,respirator at low tidal volume ventilation, 200 mg of <b>sivelestat</b> sodium hydrate and 300 mg of hydrocortisone for respiratory failure, gabexate mesilate and anti-thrombin III for DIC, transfusion for bleeding from uterus and regular insulin {{aiming for a}} blood glucose range of from 80 to 140 mg/dl.

40|$|A 67 -year-old man visited an urological clinic with a chief {{complaint}} of urination pain. Cystourethroscopy and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) examination revealed a bladder tumor (cT 3 bN 0 M 0). Marked leukocytosis and respiratory distress with pleural effusion appeared. Pulse steroid therapy improved the general condition partially. The patient was sent to our hospital for further examination. Serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were high and the pathological findings of bladder tumor obtained by transurethral resection (TUR) revealed an urothelial carcinoma that produced G-CSF and IL- 6. Neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy was performed along with use of steroid and <b>sivelestat,</b> which ameliorated the respiratory distress. After three courses of systemic chemotherapy, serum G-CSF and IL- 6 normalized and cystoprostatectomy was performed.

40|$|Abstract Background Emphysematous {{cystitis}} (EC) is {{a comparatively}} rare {{urinary tract infection}} characterized by air within the bladder wall and lumen and is usually associated with immunosuppression or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Case presentation We report a case of EC in a 70 -year-old man who recently underwent transrectal ultrasound needle-guided prostate biopsy, after which he underwent pylorogastrectomy. He {{did not have any}} history of diabetes mellitus or any immunosuppressive disease. The patient developed severe sepsis, requiring intravenous antibiotics and urinary catheterization. Despite therapy, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, he was admitted to the intensive care unit, antibiotic coverage was broadened, and danaparoid sodium and <b>sivelestat</b> sodium hydrate was administered. After 20 [*]days, the patient’s condition improved, and on the 28 th day, the patient was discharged to home in a good condition without any sequelae. Conclusion Prompt diagnosis and treatment are warranted to prevent potential morbidity of and mortality in cases of EC. </p...|$|E
40|$|A 72 -year-old male {{diabetic}} {{patient was}} admitted due to autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). We started 1 mg/kg weight of prednisolone daily and multiple daily insulin infusion for hyperglycemia. Gall bladder cancer and early stage gastric cancer were then diagnosed. We removed the gall bladder and the spleen {{for treatment of}} AIHA without prednisolone for better control of diabetes mellitus. Five weeks later, endoscopic gastromucosal resection (EMR) was performed for gastric cancer. The patient suffered from fever and respiratory failure after 4 days. Chest computed tomography showed consolidation, bronchial wall thickening and a ground glass appearance in bilateral lungs. Although the sputum and blood culture were negative,β-D-glucan and mannan antigen increased. Neutrophilia (87 ％) was shown. The WBC count had not increased (7300 /μl) compared with the CRP elevation (21. 8 mg/dl). Therefore, we diagnosed overwhelming postsplenectomy infection syndrome followed by atypical pathogen infection. We used ciprofloxacin and fosfluconazol, respirator at low tidal volume ventilation, <b>sivelestat</b> sodium hydrate and methylprednisolone for respiratory failure and regular insulin aiming for a blood glucose range of from 80 to 140 mg/dl.

Based on the estimated propensity {{scores for each}} patient, we performed IPT-weighted analyses for the low-dose corticosteroid and control groups [31 – 33]. To estimate the propensity score, we fitted a logistic regression model for undergoing low-dose corticosteroid treatment {{as a function of}} patient demographics and medication or interventions performed on days 0 or 1. We included the following: age; sex; hospital type (academic or nonacademic) and volume; consciousness level; coexisting diseases; blood culture test performed; intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy after admission; postoperative polymyxin B hemoperfusion; type of catecholamine used; vasopressin used; initial use of two or more antibiotics and each type of initial antibiotic administered; drugs for disseminated intravascular coagulation (antithrombin, thrombomodulin, gabexate mesilate, nafamostat mesilate, or ulinastatin); use of intravenous immunoglobulin, albumin, or <b>sivelestat</b> sodium; and blood transfusion [24 – 27, 33]. We used IPT as the weights based on the propensity score; we did so to create a synthetic sample, in which the distribution of measured baseline covariates was independent of treatment assignment [31 – 33].

40|$|Abstract Background: Lung {{injury and}} acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome after cardiopulmonary bypass were described as severe postoperative complication. Although the incidence of ARDS after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is about 1 %, the mortality of ARDS is extremely high. It has been well recognized that CPB is associated with systemic inflammation. This pulmonary dysfunction after CPB {{is one of those}} inflammatory responses, activated neutrophil and neurophil elastase {{play an important role in}} this injury. Method: ELASPOL (<b>Sivelestat</b> sodium hydrate: Ono Pharmaceutical Co., in Japan) is neutrophil elastase inhibitor that was introduced in 2002 for acute lung injury with SIRS. We hypothesized that this drug would reduce lung dysfunction after CPB especially in the patient who had total arch replacement or cardiac surgery with severe preoperative condition. We compared control group and group treated with ELASPOL ® group retrospectively. The control group were cases of total arch replacement with severe lung dysfunction before 2002, therapeutic group were cases of total arch replacement with ELASPOL that included a case without operation.

40|$|A 74 -year-old {{man with}} poorly {{controlled}} diabetes mellitus {{was admitted to}} our hospital because of severe respiratory disturbance, fever, and sputum. We found massive consolidation of the right lung and nodular shadows on the left lung on chest X-ray, and detected influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen from a nasopharyngeal swab and urine sample, respectively. Co-infection with influenza virus and bacteria was suspected, and oseltamivir and biapenem were prescribed. Laboratory data improved after the addition of <b>sivelestat</b> sodium hydrate, an inhibitor of neutrophil-derived elastase; however, chest X-ray findings became worse on Day 8, and we administered 1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for two days. On Day 12, we detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum, even though we did not previously detect any acid-fast bacilli, and started anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol hydrochloride, and pyrazinamide; however, the patient died 12 days later. Severe influenza-related bacterial pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae and subsequently secondary tuberculosis infection were finally suspected in this case. This was a very rare case in which additional tuberculosis infection {{was found in a}} patient with fulminant pneumonia due to co-infection of influenza virus and bacteria. It is necessary to observe patients with influenza carefully, especially when steroids are used, even if antibiotics are also administered...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{remains one}} of the {{greatest}} burdens to global health, causing nearly 500, 000 deaths in 2014. When manifesting in the lungs, severe malaria causes acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). We have previously shown that a proportion of DBA/ 2 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) develop ALI/ARDS and that these mice recapitulate various aspects of the human syndrome, such as pulmonary edema, hemorrhaging, pleural effusion and hypoxemia. Herein, we investigated the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ALI/ARDS. Mice developing ALI/ARDS showed greater neutrophil accumulation in the lungs compared with mice that did not develop pulmonary complications. In addition, mice with ALI/ARDS produced more neutrophil-attracting chemokines, myeloperoxidase and reactive oxygen species. We also observed that the parasites Plasmodium falciparum and PbA induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) ex vivo, which were associated with inflammation and tissue injury. The depletion of neutrophils, treatment with AMD 3100 (a CXCR 4 antagonist), Pulmozyme (human recombinant DNase) or <b>Sivelestat</b> (inhibitor of neutrophil elastase) decreased the development of malaria-associated ALI/ARDS and significantly increased mouse survival. This study implicates neutrophils and NETs in the genesis of experimentally induced malaria-associated ALI/ARDS and proposes a new therapeutic approach to improve the prognosis of severe malaria...|$|E
