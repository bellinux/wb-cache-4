Sensory properties, chemical and microbiological analyses were performed on 16 samples (7 non-smoked and 9 <b>smoked</b> <b>cheeses).</b> All cheese samples were produced according to tradition. Significant unevenness was determined in sensory, chemical and microbiological quality. Domestic cooked cheese can be classified as soft cheese according to dry matter content, and as semi-hard cheese according to water content in non fat cheese matter. According to fat content in dry matter, domestic cooked cheese can be classified as fat cheese. Standardization elements are proposed...|$|R
