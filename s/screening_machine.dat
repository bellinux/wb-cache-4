25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} {{the degree to which}} they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a <b>screening</b> <b>machine</b> which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rockbreakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|E

50|$|A trommel screen, {{also known}} as a rotary screen, is a {{mechanical}} <b>screening</b> <b>machine</b> used to separate materials, mainly in the mineral and solid-waste processing industries. It consists of a perforated cylindrical drum that is normally elevated at an angle at the feed end. Physical size separation is achieved as the feed material spirals down the rotating drum, where the undersized material smaller than the screen apertures passes through the screen, while the oversized material exits {{at the other end of}} the drum.|$|E

50|$|Tensioned {{screen cloth}} is {{typically}} 4 feet by the width or {{the length of}} the <b>screening</b> <b>machine</b> depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned. Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted {{on both sides of the}} screen box. When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth. Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).|$|E

50|$|The tumbler {{screening}} {{technique has}} many applications. It is utilized in {{the chemical and}} food industry {{in order to produce}} high quality powder with sensitive property; this technique can also provide a moderate treatment for the powder. This technique can also be used as a high efficiency method of recycling high quality raw materials. In food processing, simpler tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machines</b> with 1 deck and screen sizes from 1 to 4 mm are used to removed foreign bodies and ensure the safety of the products. Furthermore, this technique is also applied in the metallurgy and ceramic industry.

50|$|Tumbler {{screening}} machines have higher output per meter square of screening {{than the other}} vibratory {{screening machines}}. It requires lower power, consumption at different speeds at different levels and sorting at each level. It has a lower maintenance and is compact. It has a disadvantage of blocking of the mesh in case of batch sieving if the particles are fed immediately inside the machine barrel. Hence, the feeding rate shouldn't be very high. Another disadvantage of tumbler screening technique {{is that it would}} not be effective for higher particle sizes, which range from six inches to +20 mesh.If a number of tumbler screening machines are operated in parallel in a building without building statics configured accordingly, dynamic residual forces can generate resonance in vibration which in worst case can eventually lead to connection elements to the <b>screening</b> <b>machine</b> shearing off.Particle - particle and machine boundary collisions in the tumbling motion of the rotating structure will dissipate kinetic energy due to normal and frictional contact losses.|$|E
50|$|Feed rate {{affects the}} {{screening}} {{performance of the}} tumbler screener as well. The amount of material presented to a screen for processing is called feed rate. It is often related to the amplitude and frequency of the vibration. When feeding to a screener in a high rate, {{the capacity of the}} screening will be pushed to a limit very fast, causing stratification. In this case, the intensity of the vibration needs to be increased to process more materials in a certain period of time. However, when feeding in a low feed rate, the efficiency of the screener will be at low state as well. The particles will stay in a loose state, which will decrease the effectiveness. Material input to a tumbler screening technique should be constant and uniform throughout the running. Otherwise, the particles will not be evenly distributed on the screen and it may cause fluctuation. And it will lead to a poor performance of the tumbler screening. Feed rate should be more constant and steady when dealing with finer particles. The common feed rate range of a tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machine</b> is 1 kg/h to 50 to/h.|$|E
