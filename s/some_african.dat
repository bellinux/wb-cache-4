5|$|Beer is {{considered}} to be a social lubricant in many societies and is consumed in countries all over the world. There are breweries in Middle Eastern countries such as Syria, and in <b>some</b> <b>African</b> countries. Sales of beer are four times those of wine, which is the second most popular alcoholic drink.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is one of}} {{the three}} colors (along with red and black, or red and gold) of Pan-Africanism. Several African {{countries}} thus use the color on their flags, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on <b>some</b> <b>African</b> flags represents the natural richness of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Most Egyptian {{vultures}} in the subtropical zone of Europe migrate {{south to}} Africa in winter. Like many other large soaring migrants, they avoid making long crossings over water. Italian birds cross over through Sicily and into Tunisia making short sea crossings by {{passing through the}} islands of Marettimo and Pantelleria. Those that migrate through the Iberian Peninsula cross into Africa over the Strait of Gibraltar while others cross further east through the Levant. In summer, <b>some</b> <b>African</b> birds fly further north into Europe and vagrants have been recorded in England and southern Sweden.|$|E

50|$|In 1859, Careysburg {{was settled}} by North American freed slaves, {{mainly from the}} United States and Barbados. However, <b>some</b> <b>Africans</b> recaptured from ships at sea, destined for sale as slaves in Europe and America, were also settled in Careysburg.|$|R

5|$|The year 1968 {{had seen}} {{turmoil in the}} United States, {{including}} riots and the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, <b>some</b> <b>African</b> Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged a boycott of the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. The atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games which left dozens dead.|$|E
5|$|Food {{power is}} an {{integral}} part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in <b>some</b> <b>African</b> countries, food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.|$|E

50|$|Ansah {{serves as}} an {{important}} precursor to the mainstream 18th century abolitionist movement in Britain. His time in England as “The Royal African” set precedence that <b>some</b> <b>Africans</b> were above slavery and comparable to British nobility. Furthermore, his visit forced London society to acknowledge the complex government and society in place in Annamaboe and presumably many other African cities.|$|R

50|$|In Ghana, <b>some</b> <b>Africans</b> were {{disturbed}} by the prominence of a person with Reitsch's past, but Shirley Graham Du Bois, a noted African-American writer who had emigrated to Ghana and was friendly towards Reitsch, agreed with Nkrumah that Reitsch was extremely naive politically.

50|$|Many Africans in Guangzhou have overstayed their visas or {{are using}} false passports, causing local police to conduct {{frequent}} visa inspections. <b>Some</b> <b>Africans</b> say that overstaying in China is inevitable {{because it is}} impossible to finish off the business they had come for within a 30-day time frame and they cannot afford a plane ticket home.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of European powers on the Gold Coast {{opened up the}} area to the outside world, and <b>some</b> <b>Africans</b> from the Gold Coast achieved a modicum of accomplishment in European society.

25|$|In <b>some</b> <b>African</b> cultures, {{visits to}} ancestors' graves, the leaving {{of food and}} gifts, and the asking of {{protection}} from them serve as important parts of traditional rituals. One such ritual is held just {{before the start of}} the hunting season.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years the line between white indentured {{servants}} and African laborers was vague, as <b>some</b> <b>Africans</b> also arrived under indenture, before more were transported as slaves. <b>Some</b> <b>Africans</b> were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong racial caste. Most of the free colored families found in North Carolina in the censuses of 1790-1810 were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men in colonial Virginia. Because the mothers were free, their children were born free. Such mixed-race families migrated along with their European-American neighbors into the frontier of North Carolina. As the flow of indentured laborers slackened because of improving economic conditions in Britain, the colony was short on labor and imported more slaves. It followed Virginia in increasing its controls on slavery, which became a racial caste of the foreign Africans.|$|R
