60|$|Plazac is {{a miserable}} place. There {{is not a}} decent hotel in it. It was perhaps on this account that the new King, Rupert, had erected for the alleged {{convenience}} of his guests of the Press a series of large temporary hotels, such as were in evidence at the St. Louis Exposition. Here each guest was given a room to himself, somewhat after {{the nature of the}} cribs in a Rowton house. From my first night in it I am able to speak from experience of the sufferings of a prisoner of the third class. I am, however, bound to say that the dining and reception rooms were, though uncomfortably plain, adequate for temporary use. Happily we shall not have to endure many more meals here, as to-morrow we all dine with the King in the State House; and as the cuisine is under the control of that cordon bleu, Gaston de Faux Pas, who so long controlled the gastronomic (we might almost say Gastonomic) destinies of the Rois des Diamants in the Place Vendome, we may, I think, look forward to not going to bed hungry. Indeed, the anticipations formed from a survey of our meagre sleeping accommodation were not realized at dinnertime to-night. To our intense astonishment, an excellent dinner was served, though, to be sure, the cold dishes predominated (a thing I always find bad for one's liver). Just as we were finishing, the King (nominated) came amongst us in quite an informal way, and, having bidden us a hearty welcome, asked that we should drink a glass of wine together. This we did in an excellent (if rather <b>sweet)</b> <b>glass</b> of Cliquot '93. King Rupert (nominated) then asked us to resume our seats. He walked between the tables, now and again recognizing some journalistic friend whom he had met early in life in his days of adventure. The men spoken to seemed vastly pleased--with themselves probably. Pretty bad form of them, I call it! For myself, I was glad I had not previously met him in the same casual way, as it saved me from what I should have felt a humiliation--the being patronized in that public way by a prospective King who had not (in a Court sense) been born. The writer, who is by profession a barrister-at-law, is satisfied at being himself a county gentleman and heir to an historic estate in the ancient county of Salop, which can boast a larger population than the Land of the Blue Mountains.|$|E
40|$|Bulk glass {{formation}} occurs over a {{very small}} part of phase space, and "good" glasses (which form even at low quench rates ~ 10 K/sec) select an even smaller part of that accessible phase space. An axiomatic theory provides the physical basis of glass formation, and identifies these <b>sweet</b> spots of <b>glass</b> formation with existence of rigid but stress-free networks for which experimental evidence is rapidly emerging. Recently, theory and experiment have come together to show that these <b>sweet</b> spots of <b>glass</b> formation occur over a range of chemical compositions identified as Intermediate Phases. These ranges appear {{to be controlled by}} elements of local and medium range molecular structures that form isostatically rigid networks. Intermediate Phase glasses possess non-hysteretic glass transitions (Tgs) that do not age much. Raman scattering has played a pivotal role in elucidating molecular structure of glasses in general, and in identifying domains of Intermediate Phases. Experiments reveal these phases to possess sharp phase boundaries and to be characterized by an optical elasticity that varies with network mean coordination number, r, as power-law. In this review, we provide examples in chalcogenide and oxide glass systems where these phases along with optical elasticity power-laws have been established. Intermediate Phase glasses represent self-organized nanostructured functional materials optimized by nature...|$|R
500|$|The Rashtrakuta empire {{controlled}} most of {{the western}} sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade. The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, {{one of the most}} prominent ports in the world at that time. The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, betel nuts, coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory. Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, Italian wines, tin, lead, topaz, storax, <b>sweet</b> clover, flint <b>glass,</b> antimony, gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants. The Rashtrakuta government levied a shipping tax of one golden Gadyanaka on all foreign vessels embarking to any other ports and a fee of one silver Ctharna ( [...] a coin) on vessels travelling locally.|$|R

6000|$|That footman {{lost ground}} in Billy's {{estimation}} because {{of using the}} word little. If he had said [...] "my boy," [...] {{it would have been}} all right; [...] "my man" [...] would have been gratifying; but [...] "my little man" [...] was repulsive. A smart servant girl who chanced to see him {{on his way to the}} library also caused him much pain by whispering to her fellow something about a sweet innocent-faced darling, and he put on a savage frown, as he was ushered into the room, by way of counteracting the <b>sweet</b> innocence. A <b>glass</b> opposite suddenly revealed to its owner the smooth rosy-brown visage, screwed up in a compound expression. That expression changed so swiftly to sheer surprise, that a burst of involuntary laughter was the result. A deep flush, and silence, followed, as the urchin looked with some confusion round the room to see if he had been observed or overheard, and a sense of relief came as he found that he was alone. No one had seen or heard him except some of the Dotropy ancestors who had [...] "come over" [...] with the Conqueror, and who gazed sternly from the walls. For, you see, being a family of note, the dining-room could not hold all the ancestors, so that some of them had to be accommodated in the library.|$|R
50|$|The deccan soil, {{though not}} as fertile {{as that of the}} Gangetic plains, was rich in minerals. The copper mines of Cudappah, Bellary, Chanda, Buldhana, Narsingpur, Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Dharwar were a source of income and played an {{important}} role in the economy. Diamonds were mined in Cudappah, Bellary, Kurnool and Golconda; the capital Manyakheta and Devagiri were important diamond and jewellery trading centres. Muslin cloth were manufactured in Paithan and Warangal and the leather industry and tanning flourished in Gujarat. Some regions of northern Maharashtra and Mysore, with its vast elephant herds, were important for the ivory industry. The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, one of the most prominent ports in the world at that time. Other important ports were Naosari, Sopara, Thana, Saimur, Dabhol, Jayagad, Kharepatan and Kalyan. The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, betel nuts, coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory.
