40|$|Abstract A {{clinical}} methylcellulose <b>sampling</b> <b>strip</b> {{is one of}} {{the popular}} means for collecting gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from dental patients for dental disease diagnosis. In this research, a microfluidic device for protein elution from a <b>sampling</b> <b>strip</b> was fabricated with poly (dimethylsilox-ane) (PDMS) polymer. Electoelution experiments were performed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) and ovalbumin (OVA). The total amount of eluted protein is measured by quantitative fluorescence imaging. About 50 % of the initial concentration of BSA and OVA was eluted by the * 20 V/cm electric field. Electroelution is an appealing method for protein elution; however, the thickness of the wet strip (* 400 lm) introduces interesting practical difficulties. During the electroelution process, unsteady electrokinetic phenomena by the pressure driven flow and the pH change of the reservoirs were observed. Several possible solutions to these problems are still under inves-tigation including modifying reservoirs and thin polymer film coating of PDMS channel surfaces. This electroelution device would be a useful component of a fully integrated micro total analysis system for oral fluid samples. ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} a methodology for structural analysis of seismically mapped horizons based on the geometrical model of the developable surface. Our method involves treating real geological surfaces as approximations to developable surfaces and determines the generator lines at different points on the surface. At these points we consider strip samples of the surface radiating in different directions and examine the variability of strike and dip within each <b>sample</b> <b>strip.</b> The optimal value of the radial scan-line length can be easily identified by geostatistical analysis of the depth data. The local plunge lines are therefore identified as the direction associated with the most constant strike and dip. The map pattern obtained by analysing the plunges and trends of plunge lines across an area allows the identification of domains where folding accords closely with a developable geometry. According to the model, deviations from these patterns correspond to regions of structural complexity...|$|E

30|$|Although the Holzapfel {{model is}} polyconvex (Schröder et al. [10]), a {{numerical}} instability known as unphysical behaviour can occur for an improper set of material coefficients {{as described in}} tension tests by Gasser et al. [11]. Considering the tests, the structural arrangement of the stiffened fibres {{in combination with the}} soft ground matrix activates a load-carrying mechanism in which the collagen fibres need to rotate towards the loading direction until they are able to carry significant load. Consequently, there is an unrealistic thickening of the <b>sample</b> <b>strip</b> in tension tests and it violates the incompressibility condition with a volume growth. To prevent this non-physical behaviour, Gasser et al. [11] took into account an effect of the dispersion of the collagen fibres whose orientations are not uniform. Admittedly, this proposal helps the model come closer to the real behaviour. In fact, by investigating terms of the strain–energy function, {{it is obvious that the}} incorporated dispersion is able to control the non-physical thickening by decreasing the difference between the orthotropic energy and the isotropic energy.|$|E
30|$|In Gregoire et al. (2011) model-assisted {{estimation}} {{was used}} for estimating aboveground biomass in Hedmark County, Norway, using sample data from laser profilers and scanners. The study triggered {{the start of a}} series of studies where the model-assisted theory, developed by Särndal et al. (1992), was applied for large-scale forest surveys based on samples of laser scanner data. Næsset et al. (2011) applied and compared two sources of auxiliary information, laser scanner data and interferometric synthetic aperture radar data for model-assisted estimation of biomass over a large boreal forest area in the Aurskog-Høland municipality in Norway and quantified to what extent the two types of auxiliary data improved the estimated precision. Gobakken et al. (2012) compared the performance of model-assisted estimation with model-based prediction of aboveground biomass in Hedmark County, Norway using data from airborne laser scanning as auxiliary data. The two approaches were found to yield similar results. Nelson et al. (2012) conducted a similar study over the same area using data from a profiling rather than scanning airborne laser, while Næsset et al. (2013 b) evaluated the precision of the two-stage model-assisted estimation conducted by Gobakken et al. (2012). The authors noted the sensitivity of variance estimators to unequal <b>sample</b> <b>strip</b> length and systematically selected strips. The latter issue was further pursued by Ene et al. (2012), who showed that the variance was often severely overestimated when estimators assuming simple random sampling were applied in this context. Similar results were reported by Magnussen et al. (2014).|$|E
40|$|GenLab is a MATLAB® {{code for}} {{structural}} analysis of digitally and seismically mapped horizons {{based on the}} geometrical model of the developable surface. This model is chosen because surfaces of this type result from the bending of a non-stretching stratum and because deviation from developable geometry implies that bed stretching during folding has occurred. The model is therefore linked with straining of the horizon {{and can be used}} for highlighting regions of deformation expressed by brittle fracturing or ductile deformation. Mathematically, a developable surface is one upon which straight lines (generators) can be drawn, and along these generators the orientations of tangent planes of the surface remain constant. Our method involves treating real geological surfaces as approximations to developable surfaces and determines the generator lines at different points on the surface. At these points we consider strip samples of the surface radiating in different directions and examine the variability of strike and dip within each <b>sample</b> <b>strip.</b> The radial scan-line length parameter is user-defined, and the optimal value can be easily identified by geostatistical analysis of the depth data. The local plunge lines (the approximation to the generatrix of a developable fold) are therefore identified as the direction associated with the least variation of surface attitude, i. e., the most constant strike and dip. The map pattern obtained by analyzing the plunges and trends of plunge lines across an area allows identification of domains where folding accords closely with a developable geometry. Such domains are recognized from straight plunge lines, defining parallel or convergent patterns. According to the model, deviations from these patterns correspond to regions of structural complexity associated with ductile or brittle straining of the surface being analyzed. The plunge-line analysis therefore offers a useful technique with potential for predicting strained zones and automatic fault recognition. GenLab allows the rapid implementation of this analysis and uses the matrix capabilities and contouring functions of MATLAB...|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} a laboratory assessment of five blood glucose meters. The instruments ' analytical characteristics under optimum laboratory conditions and examination of {{potential sources of}} errors were intercompared. All glucometers produced precise results, and {{in all but one}} meter the CV values varied between 1. 5 % and 6 %. CV's for reproducibility and within-day precision of Glucometer Gx were 10. 5 % and 7. 3 %. Sample volume, blood incubation time and colour stability of the strip may influence the results of blood glucose measurements with glucose meters. Underloading the <b>sample</b> <b>strip</b> had statistically significant effects on normal blood glucose values for all meters. One Touch II gave also significantly different results when the strip was overloaded. Incubation times shorter or longer than those recommended by the manufac-turer influenced the results of all glucose meters. After colour development of the strip, changes were small for Haemo-Glukotest 20 - 800 R strips and Glucotrix, whereas Accutrend glucose strips had to be read immediately following the prescribed incubation time. Comparison of the glucose meter results with those obtained by the hexokinase method showed good correlation coefficients for Reflolux S (r = 0. 992), Accutrend (r = 0. 988), One Touch II (r = 0. 942), Glucometer Gx (r = 0. 986) and Glucocard (r = 0. 976). Error grid analysis showed that the results of all meters were clinically correct. Variations in haematocrit are known {{to be a source of}} errors when blood glucose is determined with a test strip. In the normoglycaemic range the results obtained with Accutrend and Glucocard were not influenced by even extreme haematocrit values. In the high glucose concentration range there was a decrease in blood glucose values with increasing haematocrit for all meters. This error was smaller with Accutrend and Glucocard than with the other meters. Although the new versions of the monitors are easier to use, their analytical performance is not superior to earlier models...|$|E
40|$|The {{fire safety}} {{strategy}} in a spacecraft is (1) to detect any fire {{as early as}} possible, (2) to keep any fire as small as possible, and (3) to extinguish any fire as quickly as possible. This suggests that a material which undergoes a momentary, localized ignition might be tolerable but a material which permits a transition to flame spread would significantly increase the fire hazard. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand how the transition from localized ignition to flame spread occurs and what parameters significantly affect the transition. The fundamental processes involved in ignition and flame spread have been extensively studied, but they have been studied separately. Some of the steady state flame models start from ignition to reach a steady state, but since the objective of such a calculation is to obtain the steady state flame spread rate, the calculation through the transition process is made without high accuracy to save computational time. We have studied the transition from a small localized ignition at the center of a thermally thin paper in a microgravity environment. The configuration for that study was axisymmetric, but more general versions of the numerical scheme have been developed by including the effects of a slow, external flow in both two and three dimensions. By exploiting the non-buoyant nature of the flow, it is possible to achieve resolution of fractions of millimeters for 3 D flow domains on the order of 10 centimeters. Because the calculations are time dependent, we can study the evolution of multiple flame fronts originating from a localized ignition source. The interaction of these fronts determines whether or not they will eventually achieve steady state spread. Most flame spread studies in microgravity consider two-dimensional flame spread initiated by ignition at one end of a <b>sample</b> <b>strip</b> with or against a slow external flow. In this configuration there is only one flame front. A more realistic scenario involves separate, oppositely directed fronts in two dimensions, or a continuous, radially directed front in three dimensions. We present here some results of both the two and three dimensional codes...|$|E
40|$|This manual {{provides}} a reference guide to {{permanent sample plot}} (PSP) techniques in mixed tropical forests. It is intended as an update to Synnott's Manual of permanent plot procedures for tropical rainforests. The manual considers the objectives of PSPs as that of providing data for growth and yield models which {{will be used to}} assist forest management. The PSPs are a means of measuring tree growth, mortality, and regeneration in relation to stand density. They may be laid down either as a network of sampling plots, passively sampling existing forest management practices; or as measurement plots within an experimental design. Both approaches are properly required for the optimum capture of data. There is no satisfactory method of calculating numbers of PSPs required, but approximate indications are that one plot per 1000 ha of forest, laid in a stratified random sample, will normally be adequate. Experimental designs should concentrate on the effects of extremes of stand density, from controlled logging or poisoning, and always include untreated and unlogged forest as a control to define maximum basal area and growth under maximal competition. Randomized block design is recommended as simple, robust and statistically rigorous. Replicates should be placed on different sites. When considering plot shape and size, some compatibility is required with temporary plots used in forest inventory. Measures of basal area, competition and spatially-dependent ratio parameters will depend on plot size and shape, hence the need for some consistency. In general, a square PSP of 100 x 100 m, subdivided into 25 20 x 20 m quadrats, is recommended, but this may be varied where compatibility requirements so indicate. Compatibility can be achieved for various shapes and sizes by using a common sub-unit. For this purpose the 20 x 20 m quadrat is recommended as a basis for all permanent, temporary, and experimental plots. For plot location in the field, modern methods using global positioning satellites may greatly reduce survey time and cost, and ease the problem of relocating plots in future. Plots can be permanently demarcated by use of a combination of concrete or hardwood corner pillars, trenches to relocate boundaries, and use of tree numbers and positions to reconstruct the plot should corner markers be lost. On plots, trees above 20 cm dbh should be permanently marked with paint or tags, uniquely numbered, and measured for diameter, crown position and crown form according to the Dawkins classification. Qualitative records of damage, disease or other features should be made via coded notes. A sub-sample of two trees on each plot should be measured for crown point height. Trees below 20 cm should be measured on a subplot, and if possible regeneration on an inner subplot or <b>sample</b> <b>strip.</b> All species should be measured, without consideration of economic utility. The manual covers site assessment briefly, including topographic indicators based on altitude, slope and aspect, soil sampling and classification methods, the use of vegetation associations as site indicators, and the use of quantitative stand parameters such as mean height and form height. Data recording forms are given, together with a description of database record structures compatible with the forms, and methods for data entry verification and the management of long-term data storage. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} {{a new kind of}} mosaicing, where the position of the <b>sampling</b> <b>strip</b> varies {{as a function of the}} input camera location. The new images that are generated this way correspond to a new projection model defined by two slits, termed here the Crossed-Slits (X-Slits) projection. In this projection model, every 3 D point is projected by a ray defined as the line that passes through that point and intersects the two slits. The intersection of the projection rays with the imaging surface defines the image. X-Slits mosaicing provides two benefits. First, the generated mosaics are closer to perspective images than traditional pushbroom mosaics. Second, by simple manipulations of the <b>strip</b> <b>sampling</b> function, we can change the location of one of the virtual slits, providing a virtual walkthrough of a X-slits camera; all this can be done without recovering any 3 D geometry and without calibration.
