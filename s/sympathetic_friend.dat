500|$|In 2004, the {{producers}} Ramesh Sharma and Pahlaj Nilani announced that Ranaut {{would make her}} film debut with the Deepak Shivdasani-directed I Love You Boss. The following year, an agent {{took her to the}} office of the producer Mahesh Bhatt, where she interacted with the director Anurag Basu and auditioned for the lead role in the romantic thriller Gangster. Bhatt felt that she was too young for the role and signed Chitrangada Singh instead. However, Singh was later unavailable to do the film and Ranaut was contracted as a replacement for Gangster, opting out of I Love You Boss. She was cast in the central role of Simran, an alcoholic woman caught in a romantic triangle between a notorious gangster (played by Shiney Ahuja) and a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> (played by Emraan Hashmi). Ranaut was only seventeen while filming and said that she [...] "had difficulty first in understanding and then unwinding from the character", describing her craft as [...] "raw and immature". Released in 2006, Gangster emerged as a critical and commercial success and her performance was praised. Raja Sen of Rediff.com said that [...] "Kangana is a remarkable find, the actress coming across with great conviction. Hers is the pivotal character and an extremely difficult role to essay, but she manages it well [...] Kangana's nuances [...] are disconcertingly realistic." [...] She won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, along with various other debut awards.|$|E

60|$|Poor Mrs Bright fairly {{broke down}} {{at this point}} for a few seconds; and no wonder, for, not even to her most {{confidential}} and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> could she tell of the terrible change for the worse that came over her husband when the accursed fire-water burned in his veins.|$|E
60|$|Lady Arabella, who had her {{own game}} to play, saw in the metier of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend,</b> a series of {{meetings}} with the man she wanted to secure. She made the first use of the opportunity the day after old Chester's death; indeed, as soon as the news had filtered in through the back door of Diana's Grove. At that meeting, she played her part so well that even Caswall's cold nature was impressed.|$|E

50|$|The Schulze-Boysen/Harnack {{group in}} Berlin {{was formed by}} Harro Schulze-Boysen, a Luftwaffe staff officer, his wife Libertas, Arvid Harnack, a lawyer and economist, his American wife Mildred, {{and a number of}} <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends</b> and acquaintances.|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} after the {{occupation}} of that town that Captain Feraud found leisure to consider his future conduct {{in view of the}} fact that Captain D'Hubert had been given the position of third aide-de-camp to the marshal. He considered it a great part of a night, and in the morning summoned two <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{hope and}} purpose are gone from this woman's heart, for whom Italy {{died in her}} brother, and who has only these artless, half-bewildered words of regret to speak, and speaks them as if to some tender and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> acquainted with all the history going before their abrupt beginning. I think it most pathetic and natural, also, that even in her grief and her {{aspiration}} for heaven, her words should have the tint of her time, and she should count freedom among the joys of eternity.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a most}} excellent, respectable, well-behaved Englishwoman, a Mrs. Clermont, {16} who {{had been}} Lady Byron's governess in her youth, and was still, in mature life, revered as her {{confidential}} friend. It appears that this person had been with Lady Byron during {{a part of her}} married life, especially the bitter hours of her lonely child-bed, when a young wife so much needs a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend.</b> This Mrs. Clermont was the person selected by Lord Byron at this time to be the scapegoat to bear away the difficulties of the case into the wilderness.|$|E
60|$|No swoop {{that the}} Eagle ever made (mentally) down upon base, unworthy, arrogant man, was at all {{comparable}} to the descent which she made (physically) on that occasion {{into the arms of}} an expectant fireman! She held her breath, also the blankets, tightly, as she went down like a lightning-flash, and felt that she was about to be dashed to pieces, but to her surprise soft cushions received her, and she was immediately borne, by another of these desperate men in helmets, into an adjoining house, and left unhurt in the arms of her <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> Miss Tippet.|$|E
50|$|Attempts by his {{counsel and}} <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends</b> to secure his release were unsuccessful, despite his appeals for clemency. Initially {{he agreed to}} be bound over, but he {{retracted}} on learning that the other prisoners had refused to be bailed. He was fined 2000 marks and imprisoned in the Tower until his release in 1633, by which time his first wife had died.|$|R
60|$|Two {{weeks after}} the date on which this {{harmonious}} meeting was held, a new vessel, laden with spiritual treasure, unfurled her sails, shook out her MDSF ensign, and, amid the good wishes, silent prayers, and ringing cheers of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends</b> on shore, went forth as a beacon of love and light and hope to irradiate the toilers on the dark North Sea.|$|R
50|$|Even in death, Capt. Levett {{could not}} avoid the controversies roiling the age. Letters he carried aboard the vessel Porcupine, {{addressed}} by John Winthrop {{and other leaders}} of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends</b> in England, fell {{into the hands of}} Puritan foes in England, apparently after Levett's possessions were searched after his death. The letters stirred up some measure of controversy in England for the unfavorable stance the writers took toward the English church.|$|R
6000|$|Pearl's {{own time}} for tears came {{when her mother}} began to tell this new and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> of how she became so much {{attached}} to her rescuer that when {{she knew he would}} not be coming to the West with them, but going off to the wildest region of the far North, her health became impaired; and that it was only when Mr. Robinson promised to come back to see her within three years that she was at all comforted. And how, ever since, she had held the man in her heart and thought of him every day; sleeping as well as waking, for he was a factor in her dreams! ...|$|E
60|$|The lawyer's visit {{had given}} her {{something}} to think of and to do; forthwith she began to prepare for her fortnight's stay at Kingston with much zeal and energy. It {{was a great deal}} to her {{to be able to look}} forward to the companionship for a short time of even an elderly, perhaps very dignified, lady, her loneliness did so weigh upon her. It had not so weighed before; she had had her daily occupations, the companionship of her fellow-assistants, and had always felt tired and glad to rest in the evening. Now that this strange new life had come to her, that the days were empty yet her heart full, to be so completely cut off from her fellows and thrown back on herself, to have not one <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> among all these multitudes around her, appeared unnatural, and made all the good things she possessed seem almost a vanity and a delusion.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Pritty {{has been}} brought to this pass by Mr Charles Hazlit, whose daughter, Aileen, has been taken ill in China. Being a man of {{unbounded}} wealth, and understanding that Miss Pritty is a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> of his daughter and an admirable nurse, he has written home to that lady requesting her, in rather peremptory terms, to [...] "come out to them." [...] Miss Pritty, resenting {{the tone of the}} request as much as it was in her nature to resent anything, went off instanter, in a gush of tender love and sympathy, and took passage in the first ship that presented itself as being bound for the China seas. She did not know much about ships. Her maritime ideas were vague. If a washing-tub had been advertised just then as being A1 at Lloyds' and about to put forth for that region of the earth with every possible convenience on board for the delight of human beings, she would have taken a berth in it at once.|$|E
60|$|He slackened after a {{time and}} began to pace the streets at a rate which was less noticeable. As he passed the Kybirds' he shivered, {{and it was not}} until he had {{consumed}} a pint or two of the strongest brew procurable at the Two Schooners that he began to regain some of his old self-esteem. He felt almost maudlin at the sacrifice of character he was enduring {{for the sake of his}} old master, and the fact that he could not narrate it to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends</b> was not the least of his troubles.|$|R
25|$|Two {{children}} were born to the Churches, a son in 1862 and a daughter in 1865. The family's bucolic life at Olana was forever changed in March, 1865, with {{the deaths of the}} children from diphtheria. Grieving from this, the greatest emotional blow of their lives, the parents traveled with <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends</b> to Jamaica for four months, then to a retreat in Vermont. Late in 1865, the couple returned to Cosy Cottage to start anew. Frederic Joseph Church was born in autumn 1866, the first of three sons and a daughter that were raised to adulthood at Olana.|$|R
6000|$|At that {{precise moment}} Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting {{were in the}} parlour. They were seriously {{investigating}} the strange occurrences of the morning, and were, with Mr. Hall's permission, making a thorough examination of the Invisible Man's belongings. Jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends.</b> The stranger's scattered garments had been removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up. And on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work, Cuss had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled [...] "Diary." ...|$|R
6000|$|During all {{the years}} of her {{literary}} success her husband Lewes had been a most <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> and critic, and when he died, in 1878, the loss seemed to be more than she could bear. Her letters of this period are touching in their loneliness and their craving for sympathy. Later she astonished everybody by marrying John Walter Cross, much younger than herself, who is known as her biographer. [...] "Deep down below there is a river of sadness, but ... I am able to enjoy my newly re-opened life," [...] writes this woman of sixty, who, ever since she was the girl whom we know as Maggie Tulliver, must always have some one to love and to depend upon. Her new interest in life lasted but a few months, for she died in December of the same year (1880). One of the best indications of her strength and her limitations is her portrait, with its strong masculine features, suggesting both by resemblance and by contrast that wonderful portrait of Savonarola which hangs over his old desk in the monastery at Florence.|$|E
60|$|Whatever {{may be your}} liking or disliking of 'Aurora Leigh,' {{you will}} like to hear that it's a great success, {{and in a way}} which I the least expected, for a {{fortnight}} after the day of publication it had to go to press for the second edition. The extravagances written to me about that book would make you laugh, if you were in a laughing mood; and the strange thing is that the press, the daily and weekly press, upon which I calculated for furious abuse, has been, for the most part, furious the other way. The 'Press' newspaper, the 'Post,' and the 'Tablet' are exceptions; but for the rest, the 'Athenæum' is the coldest in praising. It's a puzzle to me, altogether. I don't know upon what principle the public likes and dislikes poems. Any way, it is very satisfactory {{at the end of a}} laborious work (for much hard working and hard thinking have gone to it) to hear it thus recognised, however I must think, with some bitterness, that the beloved and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> to whom it was dedicated scarcely lived to know what would have given him so much pleasure as this.|$|E
60|$|But {{suspicion}} {{is a hard}} metal which does not easily yield to fire. It can come to white heat easily enough, but its melting-point is high indeed. When the flame had leaped it had spent its force; the reaction came quick. Stephen's heart seemed to turn to ice, all the heat and life rushing to her brain. Her thoughts flashed with convincing quickness; {{there was no time}} for doubting amid their rush. Her life was for good or ill at the crossing of the ways. She had trusted Harold thoroughly. The habit of her whole life from her babyhood up had been to so look to him as comrade and protector and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend.</b> She was so absolutely sure of his earnest devotion that this new experience of a riper feeling would have been a joy to her, if it should be that his act was all spontaneous and done in ignorance of her shame. 'Shame' was the generic word which now summarised to herself her thought of her conduct in proposing to Leonard. But of this she must be certain. She could not, dare not, go farther till this was settled. With the same craving for certainty with which she convinced herself that Leonard understood her overtures, and with the same dogged courage with which she pressed the matter on him, she now went on to satisfy her mind.|$|E
60|$|It used {{to irritate}} me when I overheard people, as I {{occasionally}} have done, speak of Cynthia as hard. I never found her so myself, though heaven knows she {{had enough to}} make her so, to me she was always a <b>sympathetic,</b> charming <b>friend.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1840s the Orthodox Friends in America were {{exercised}} by a transatlantic dispute between Joseph John Gurney of England and John Wilbur of Rhode Island. Gurney, {{troubled by the}} example of the Hicksite separation, emphasized Scriptural authority and favored working closely with other Christian groups. Wilbur, in response, defended the authority of the Holy Spirit as primary, and worked to prevent the dilution of the Friends tradition of Spirit-led ministry. After privately criticizing Gurney in correspondence to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>Friends,</b> Wilbur was expelled from his yearly meeting in a questionable proceeding in 1842. Probably the best known Orthodox Friend was the poet and abolitionist editor John Greenleaf Whittier. Over the next several decades, a number of Wilburite-Gurneyite separations occurred.|$|R
5000|$|As Caroline {{grows up}} to be {{independent}} in her ever-disturbed state of mind, she secludes herself in a dingy apartment and ignores everyone who actually cares about her; {{her mother and her}} <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends</b> at work. She focuses on two people whom she admires and wants affection from; her callous father, and the unaware Rachel. While the Barbers forget about Caroline as her family moves away, Caroline continually observes Rachel and keeps making notes in order to emulate her in every way. She keeps failing, and as a result suffers ever more self-loathing. Caroline gets frustrated one day and devises a plan to murder Rachel and steal her identity - effectively [...] "replacing" [...] the girl she wants to be with herself.|$|R
60|$|The various figures {{playing their}} part in the story also owe their {{existence}} to no special experience but to the general knowledge of the condition of Russia and of the moral and emotional reactions of the Russian temperament to the pressure of tyrannical lawlessness, which, in general human terms, could be reduced to the formula of senseless desperation provoked by senseless tyranny. What I was concerned with mainly was the aspect, the character, {{and the fate of}} the individuals as they appeared to the Western Eyes of the old teacher of languages. He himself has been much criticized; but I will not at this late hour undertake to justify his existence. He was useful to me and therefore I think that he must be useful to the reader both in the way of comment and by the part he plays {{in the development of the}} story. In my desire to produce the effect of actuality it seemed to me indispensable to have an eye-witness of the transactions in Geneva. I needed also a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend</b> for Miss Haldin, who otherwise would have been too much alone and unsupported to be perfectly credible. She would have had no one to whom she could give a glimpse of her idealistic faith, of her great heart, and of her simple emotions.|$|E
60|$|It was {{an evening}} {{that lived in}} Julia's mind with {{particular}} vividness for years to come, and yet one which she always {{found it difficult to}} piece together in her thoughts. They went to one of the less fashionable music halls, where the turns were frequent and there was no ballet. Aaron was very soon able to re-establish his temporarily lost capacity for enjoyment. Maraton, leaning back in his place with a cigar in his mouth, appreciated everything and applauded constantly. It was Julia who found the new atmosphere most difficult. She laughed often, it is true, but she had always a semi-subjective feeling, as though it were some other person who was really there, and she the instrument chosen to give physical indication of that other person's presence. Only once life seemed suddenly to thrill and burn in her veins, to shoot through her body with startling significance, and in that brief space of time, life itself was transformed for her. Maraton by chance found her hand, as they sat side by side, and held it for a moment in his. There was nothing secret about his action. The firm pressure of his fingers, even, seemed as though they might have been the kindly, encouraging touch of a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friend.</b> But upon Julia his touch was magical. The rest of the evening faded into insignificance. She understood feelings which had come to her that afternoon in the park with absolute completeness for the first time. From that moment she took her place definitely amongst the women who walk through life but whose feet seldom touch the earth.|$|E

5000|$|Her father, sympathizing {{with her}} purpose, {{assisted}} Ewing to some extent, so from {{these and other}} sources she gathered a modest amount from <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends,</b> borrowed $150, till her resources amounted to $500. In 1857, she purchased 12 acres of land at Moss Run, about [...] east of Marietta, and set about building. Meanwhile, soon after her return from the missionary work, she had chanced to visit the county infirmary, and {{was drawn to the}} young children there, living in the same environment with adults. These children were often diseased and depraved, but {{she fell in love with}} them nonetheless, and determined to make for them a home. Many thought her crazy, others suspected a moneymaking scheme, some appreciated her motives and sacrifices and helped her.|$|R
50|$|With Jack {{presenting}} a stony front and Lily out of town, Carly {{had no one}} to turn to except Holden. They became <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends,</b> each trying to get over their exes. Soon their friendship grew and they began having an affair. Not wanting to ruin the one good relationship she had left - her friendship with Lily - Carly called a halt to the affair but Holden was too deeply involved. He told Lily the truth and she left him. Lily placed all the blame on Carly; still Carly would not consider entering into a real relationship with Holden. They finally broke things off for good when Holden and Lily decided to try again after Ethan's accident at the Snyder Farm Project. Carly couldn't understand why no one would forgive her part in the affair.|$|R
60|$|These {{expectations}} {{were brought to}} naught by the necessities of the service which separated the two officers. No official notice had been taken of their quarrel. It was now {{the property of the}} army, and not to be meddled with lightly. But the story of the duel, or rather their duelling propensities, must have stood somewhat in the way of their advancement, because they were still captains when they came together again during the war with Prussia. Detached north after Jena with the army commanded by Marshal Bernadotte, Prince of Ponte-Corvo, they entered Lubeck together. It was only after the occupation of that town that Captain Feraud had leisure to consider his future conduct {{in view of the fact}} that Captain D'Hubert had been given the position of third aide-de-camp to the marshal. He considered it a great part of a night, and in the morning summoned two <b>sympathetic</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|R
