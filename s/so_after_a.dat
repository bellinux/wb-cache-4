5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44tries, twelve {{more than in}} 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only did {{they have a new}} head coach, but also thirteen new players in their squad. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth that season. The Highlanders' 2005 season started with a loss to the Blues at Carisbrook. Following this the side won six games consecutively, the first time the franchise had ever done <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Three weeks {{from the end of the}} round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1887, two new {{buildings}} were completed {{at the hospital}} and the Prince and Princess of Wales came to open them officially. Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed. She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a Christmas card each year.|$|E
60|$|It now began {{breezing}} strongly from seaward, and no {{time was}} to be lost in {{getting away from the}} land; <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> affecting rubbing of noses between our new shipmate and his countrymen, we sailed away with him.|$|R

5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. <b>So,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} three volumes concern {{themselves with the}} battle for a third ring, which has been embedded for years {{in the body of}} a comatose young man named Emilio Lufas Getto. Gamma and company learn of Emilio's existence from his sister Wolfina, a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in the Rings of the Dead. The group of hunters offer to restore Emilio to consciousness in exchange for the ring he contains. Before they can do so, however, Emilio is kidnapped by Balmunk the Mystic, a powder hunting magician who leads a circus-themed gang. Wolfina teams up with Elwood, Gamma, and Smith to retrieve Emilio, and they succeed in doing <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> number of battles with Balmunk's henchmen. The conflict culminates in a fight between Gamma and a giant golem summoned by Balmunk, which Gamma defeats {{with the help of a}} berserk state. Balmunk is beaten but not killed, and departs, swearing revenge upon Gamma.|$|E
5|$|ZANLA {{had planned}} for four attacks {{to take place}} {{simultaneously}} but in the event only Nhongo's men did so. According to historian Elaine Windrich, Nhongo was a former employee of the tobacco farm's 37-year-old owner, Marc de Borchgrave, and held a grudge against him. The cadres shot up the farm house with AK-47 assault rifles and threw grenades through the windows, then retreated and hid amongst the local population. Nobody {{was killed in the}} attack but the farmer's eight-year-old daughter, Jane, was wounded in the foot. The isolated house had no telephone or any other means of contacting neighbours, and de Borchgrave was wary of being ambushed should he drive his car out, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> short time comforting the children he set out across country on foot to seek help and alert the authorities. This done, he returned and took his wife and children to another farm nearby, Whistlefield, which was owned by Archie Dalgluish and his family.|$|E
60|$|The elders {{would have}} sat and talked all the evening, {{but the young}} folks were bent on having their usual Christmas frolic; <b>so,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> hour of {{pleasant}} chat, they began to get restless, and having consulted together in dumb show, they devised a way to very effectually break up the family council.|$|R

It is assumed that Froissart is referring either to Catherine or to her daughter-in-law, Joan of Kent.|$|R
25|$|As {{with the}} earlier batches of Bristols, the Board had been keen to avoid the Leyland engine, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> {{favourable}} evaluation from a 1987–1988 trial, all of the buses assembled in Palmerston North were refitted with M.A.N. engines.|$|E
25|$|However, the Curtiss V-1400 engine did {{not perform}} up to expectations, {{with or without the}} supercharger, and <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> year in service, three of the {{standard}} P-2 Hawks had their engines replaced with the Curtiss D-12 and were consequently redesignated as P-1s. The fifth machine (25-243) received a Curtiss V-1570 Conqueror engine and became the XP-6.|$|E
25|$|The {{views on}} sexual self-determination, {{as it relates}} to marriage, have also changed: for {{instance}} until 1969 adultery was a criminal offense in West Germany. It was only in 1997, however, that Germany removed its marital exemption from its rape law, being one of the last Western countries to do <b>so,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> lengthy political battle that started in the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|In late 2002, {{urged by}} former Oxford classmates, Hart began testing the waters for another {{run for the}} presidency, {{launching}} a website at GaryHartNews.com and a related speaking tour to gauge reactions from the public. He started his own blog {{in the spring of}} 2003, the first prospective presidential candidate to do <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> few months of speaking, Hart decided not to run for president and instead endorsed Democrat John Kerry. According to an October 23, 2004 National Journal article and later reports in the Washington Post, Hart was mentioned as a probable Cabinet appointment if Kerry won the presidency. He was considered a top candidate for either Director of National Intelligence, Secretary of Homeland Security or Secretary of Defense.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Vickers won the Carfax 400 {{from the}} pole {{for his second}} career Sprint Cup victory, Red Bull's first victory, and Toyota's first victory at Michigan. He did <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> late race gamble of not coming in to pit during the race's final caution. On the final restart, Vickers was first and Jimmie Johnson was second. With a little over forty laps to go, Vickers stayed behind Johnson most of the time; trying to save fuel. With just over three laps to go, Johnson ran out of fuel, while Vickers barely had enough to claim the win. This victory {{was also the first}} one for Red Bull Racing and the first for Red Bull's {{sponsorship}} in NASCAR.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} {{chemical}} analysis were confirmed by measuring electrical capacitance and leakage current {{in a long-term}} test lasting 56days. Due to the chemical corrosion, the oxide layer of these capacitors had been weakened, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> short time the capacitance and the leakage current increased briefly, before dropping abruptly when gas pressure opened the vent. The report of Hillman and Helmold proved {{that the cause of}} the failed capacitors was a faulty electrolyte mixture used by the Taiwanese manufacturers, which lacked the necessary chemical ingredients to ensure the correct pH of the electrolyte over time, for long-term stability of the electrolytic capacitors. Their further conclusion, that the electrolyte with its alkaline pH value had the fatal flaw of a continual buildup of hydroxide without its being converted into the stable oxide, was verified {{on the surface of the}} anode foil both photographically and with an EDX-fingerprint analysis of the chemical components.|$|E

This particular Arbiter is voiced by David Sobolov.|$|E
500|$|After the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Afghan President Karzai's {{views about}} the {{security}} issues confronting Afghanistan {{and how best to}} deal with them reportedly changed. This impacted the working relationship between the President of Afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief. Saleh said, [...] "He [...] thought democracy had hurt him as a person. His family had been attacked by the media unfairly, and the West was criticizing him unfairly. <b>So</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> presidential election, he was a changed man, and we could not have the same relationship as before the presidential election." [...] Political analyst Ahmed Rashid in 2010 observed the same, [...] "Karzai's new outlook is the most dramatic political shift he has undergone in the twenty-six years that I have known him." [...] Both Saleh and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with Karzai on how to proceed against the Taliban, who Karzai began referring to as [...] "brothers". At that point Saleh and Atmar were increasingly isolated in the Karzai administration.|$|E
500|$|No. 2 Squadron {{converted}} to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s in January 1918. The unit generally conducted patrols with flights of six aircraft but {{found it difficult}} to lure enemy fighters into combat, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> lull in fighting early in February it began flying two-plane missions, which yielded better results. The following month, as the German Spring Offensive got under way, Phillipps shot down three German fighters in as many days: a Fokker Triplane on 22March, an Albatros the next morning, and a two-seater on 24March; the official history of Australia in the war recorded that the last-mentioned enemy lost its wings to Phillipps' machine-gun fire, and [...] "fell like a stone". With the Allies holding clear superiority over the German fighters, the main danger to the Australians was from ground fire as most combat took place at low level, and [...] "their machines came back full of bullet-holes". On 27March, Phillipps achieved two more victories, a Triplane that he sent down in flames near Albert and another German fighter over Méaulte. He was recommended for a bar to his Military Cross on 31March, and the award was gazetted on 22June: ...|$|E
