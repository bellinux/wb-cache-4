5000|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> use two {{surfaces}} lubricated {{with oil}} or grease as a friction contact. They often use porous sintered sleeves to be self-lubricating, requiring only infrequent maintenance or replacement. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are less durable at higher temperatures as the contact surfaces wear and the lubricant dries up, eventually leading to failure; however, lifetime {{is similar to}} that of ball-bearing types (generally a little less) at relatively low ambient temperatures. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> may be more likely to fail at higher temperatures, and may perform poorly when mounted in any orientation other than vertical. The typical lifespan of a sleeve-bearing fan may be around 30,000 hours at 50 °C. Fans that use <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are generally cheaper than fans that use ball bearings, and are quieter at lower speeds early in their life, but can become noisy as they age.|$|R

5000|$|Rifle {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> but are quieter and have almost as much lifespan as ball bearings. The bearing has a spiral groove in it that pumps fluid from a reservoir. This allows them to be safely mounted with the shaft horizontal (unlike <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings),</b> since the fluid being pumped lubricates {{the top of the}} shaft. The pumping also ensures sufficient lubricant on the shaft, reducing noise, and increasing lifespan.|$|R
40|$|Plastic sliding {{bearings}} in massive and composite structure mostly {{are used as}} wearing bearing. The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive {{sliding bearings}} with radial realization under different operation conditions. Experiments with initial lubrication and start-stop operation are described. The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive sliding bearings is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the sliding bearings are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic sliding bearings {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic sliding bearing works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.

40|$|Modern {{heavy duty}} diesel engines utilize turbochargers for {{increased}} power output. Also, {{a wide range}} of power levels can be achieved with one engine displacement through the use of different turbocharger configurations, eliminating the need for several different sized engines. These are the reasons that virtually all diesel truck engines currently marketed use turbochargers. However, because these turbochargers rely on ring seals and oil-lubricated floating <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> they often suffer breakdowns. These turbochargers operate at elevated temperatures which often causes the oil to degrade and even coke to the bearing surfaces. This can lead to catastrophic failure, increased particulate emissions from oil leaks, and, in extreme cases, engine fires. Replacing the oil lubricated bearings from these turbochargers with some other device is desirable to eliminate these inherent problems. Foil bearings are compliant selecting bearings lubricated by air and are well suited to high speed, light load applications. Thus, foil bearings present one potential replacement for oil-lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> Their use as such is investigated in this work...|$|R
50|$|Bearings are an {{important}} part of a fan. Sleeve-ring oil bearings are used extensively in fans. Some sleeve-ring bearings may be water-cooled. Water-cooled <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are often used when the fan moves hot gases. Heat is conducted through the shaft and into the oil, which must be cooled to prevent overheating the bearing. Lower-speed fans have bearings in hard-to-reach spots, so they use grease-packed bearings.|$|R

This allowed a longer wheelbase and overall gave the R33 and better and lower stance mixed with new technology now from the computer aerodynamic age each line on the R33 was to give the car ultimate aerodynamics and with wider gaps in the bumper and angles of air movement it gave the car better cooling. We saw the fuel tank lifted also and the battery moved to the boot/trunk.New rigidity points were added mixed with improvements on the attessa and hicas all now offered the R33 the best aerodynamics and balance and handling. Nissan engineers also found other ways to reduce weight, even by a few grams.This includes:Hollowing out the side door beams.Using high tensile steel on body panels.Reduction in sound deadening materials.Super HICAS becoming electric.Hollowing out of rear stabilizer bar.Use of high tensile springs front and rear.Shrinking the ABS actuator.Light aluminum wheels with higher rigidityThe front and rear axles were made of aluminum (as in the BNR32) but also so were engine mount insulators and bracketsNew plastics were used for : fuel tank, head lamps, super high strength [...] "PP" [...] bumpers, air cleaner, changing the headlining material, changing material of rear spoiler.All this put together meant we saw an improved time against the R32 of 21 seconds faster around the nurburgring and 23 seconds faster in V spec trim.

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E

Initial production was of a 98 cc two-stroke model that was confiscated from the German firm Wanderer as reparations. The original design for KMZ heavy motorcycles, and their cousin the IMZ, is taken from the pre-World War II German BMW motorcycle R71, which the Soviet Union licensed in 1940.

The first batch of M-72 motorcycles was produced in 1952 with the supply of 500 engines from IMZ. In 1958 KMZ replaced the plunger framed M72-N with the swingarm framed K-750. In 1964, KMZ introduced a military model, the MV-750 with a differential two-wheel drive to the sidecar wheel. In 1967, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, KMZ released their first OHV engine in the [...] "Dnepr" [...] K-650.

40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 One {{property}} of heavily to moderately loaded sleeve bearings is the resulting asymmetric stiffness and damping coefficients. These asymmetric properties often result in split {{first critical speed}}s. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal first critical speed may appear from several hundred to several thousand revolutions per minute lower than the vertical first critical. Tilting pad bearings produce more symmetric bearing properties. This symmetry usually results in a single unsplit first critical speed that is located approximately midway between the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> split peaks. Two different case histories are examined. An induction motor and a steam turbine were both initially designed with tilting pad bearings. Both rotor bearing systems resulted in first critical speeds in the operating speed range. Numerous attempts to shift the critical out of the operating range were explored without success. As a last attempt short of a complete rotor redesign, switching to sleeve bearings was successful. Analytical results that support the decision to switch to sleeve bearings are shown along with actual test stand response plots. Additionally, for the steam turbine, results from a high speed balance are presented along with actual field speed-amplitude plots. While a tilting pad to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> change is not recommended for all classes of turbomachinery to shift critical speeds, it is a powerful design tool as it may produce critical speed changes of up to 1000 rpm...|$|E
