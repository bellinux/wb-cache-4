5|$|The Singapura was {{accepted}} for registration by the CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. In between this period, breeders {{found that the}} occasional litter would have a solid colored kitten, caused by the recessive gene for <b>solid</b> <b>color.</b> In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the recessive gene. It was discovered {{that two of the}} three foundation cats carried this gene.|$|E
5|$|There are 12 default skins, {{each one}} a {{different}} <b>solid</b> <b>color.</b> The colors are randomly chosen when the player joins the server. Players {{can choose to}} customize their snake's appearances using custom skins with unique designs including different countries' flags, as well as skins with motifs and colors representing well-known YouTubers, such as Jacksepticeye, Jelly and PewDiePie. In order to unlock custom skins in browser mode, players must share the game on Twitter or Facebook using the external links found on the website. By June 2016, the ability to add skins was also added to the iOS and Android versions.|$|E

5|$|Lusitanos {{can be any}} <b>solid</b> <b>color,</b> {{although}} they are generally gray, bay or chestnut. Horses of the Alter Real strain are always bay. Members of the breed are of Baroque type, with convex facial profiles, heavy muscling, intelligent and willing natures, with agile and elevated movement. Originally bred for war, dressage and bullfighting, Lusitanos are still used today in the latter two. They have competed in several Olympics and World Equestrian Games {{as part of the}} Portuguese and Spanish dressage teams. They have also made a showing in driving competitions, with a Belgian team of Lusitanos winning multiple international titles. Members of the breed are still used in bloodless bullfighting today, where it is expected that neither horse or bull will be injured.|$|E

25|$|Yellow-poplar weevils {{are small}} black-snout beetles and are tick-like in appearance. While in its larval stage, the weevil {{presents}} {{as a white}} legless grub. Measuring approximately 1/16 of an inch long, the adult weevils are normally black or dark brown in coloring. While most weevils are a <b>solid</b> <b>color</b> it has been noted that some southern populations exhibit yellow antenna.

50|$|The German Spitz Mittel is {{the third}} largest of the 5 {{varieties}} of the German Spitz and is very similar in looks to the other sizes of German Spitz. It is usually bred in <b>solid</b> <b>colors</b> but parti-colors are acceptable. In the British and Australian show rings, all varieties and markings are acceptable. In Germany (and consequently any other country where the FCI standard is used), only <b>solid</b> <b>colored</b> dogs and particolored dogs are considered correct, mismarked <b>solids</b> (<b>colored</b> with white toes, chest, or tail-tip) are not allowed. German Spitz Mittel coat colours are black, white, brown (liver), sable, black/tan, brown/tan, blue-grey, and various shades of cream and orange. German Spitz Mittel's nose pigment may be any color and eyes should be dark. German Spitz Mittel has a long outercoat with a soft woolly undercoat.|$|R

25|$|One common {{application}} of the RGB color model is the display of colors on a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma display, or {{organic light emitting diode}} (OLED) display such as a television, a computer’s monitor, or a large scale screen. Each pixel on the screen is built by driving three small and very close but still separated RGB light sources. At common viewing distance, the separate sources are indistinguishable, which tricks the eye to see a given <b>solid</b> <b>color.</b> All the pixels together arranged in the rectangular screen surface conforms the color image.|$|E
25|$|JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format {{can produce}} a smaller file than PNG for {{photographic}} (and photo-like) images, since JPEG uses a lossy encoding method specifically designed for photographic image data, which is typically dominated by soft, low-contrast transitions, and an amount of noise or similar irregular structures. Using PNG instead of a high-quality JPEG for such images {{would result in a}} large increase in filesize with negligible gain in quality. In comparison, when storing images that contain text, line art, or graphics – images with sharp transitions and large areas of <b>solid</b> <b>color</b> – the PNG format can compress image data more than JPEG can. Additionally, PNG is lossless, while JPEG produces noticeable visual artifacts around high-contrast areas. Where an image contains both sharp transitions and photographic parts, a choice must be made between the two effects. JPEG does not support transparency.|$|E
25|$|Parka cover or Kuspuk (qaspeq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qasper in Cup'ig) is a {{traditional}} Yup'ik garment, worn in both casual and formal settings in Alaska. It is worn by both men and women, but men usually wear a kuspuk only for ceremonial such as Eskimo dancing (yuraq) or formal occasions, while for women it is common casual clothing, even among non-Yup'iks. The kuspuk is, in essence, a long-sleeved overshirt with a hood. Trim, often rickrack, edges the hood, sleeves, and the single large pocket in the front. A typical kuspuk for women has a print (usually floral), whereas a man's is a <b>solid</b> <b>color.</b> Female versions also may include a skirt of varying length (making the garment more technically a dress rather than a top), or may have no skirt at all. Traditional Yup'ik style kuspuks vary widely among villages. Colloquially, the skirted version is called Kuskokwim style kuspuk, while the skirtless type is called Yukon style kuspuk. The name of a school district (Kuspuk School District offices are located in Aniak) is derived from kuspuk.|$|E
