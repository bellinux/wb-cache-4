As generally the Diesel exhaust temperatures are below the soot light-off temperature, passive regeneration is not possible. Presently, we have investigated the dielectric heating of a monolithic <b>soot</b> <b>filter,</b> coated with a La 0. 8 Ce 0. 2 MnO 3 perovskite. This cype of perovskite has suitable dielectric properties, i. e., a high dielectric loss factor, and simultaneously acts as an oxidation catalyst. It is shown that a perovskite coated cordierite filter, covered with synthetic carbon, can be fully regenerated with selectivity towards CO 2 close to 100 %. In contrast, the same filter without such a coating can only be partially regenerated. Moreover, considerable amounts of CO are formed. The La 0. 8 Ce 0. 2 MnO 3 coating is shown to have excellent temperature shock resistance and thermo-chemical stability.

40|$|Diesel engine {{particulate}} filters {{every year}} {{are becoming more}} popular. The new EURO 5 standard is very restrictive for particulates and this will force the use of particulate filter in every engine.

During regeneration high temperature zones may occur in the filter which may change the properties of porous material and even cause its damage. The regeneration process should be effective at different engine operational conditions in which temperature and oxygen concentration vary.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the focus is}} on the {{particulate}} matter reduction of ships, as ships contribute significantly to the particulate matter concentration in ambient air. Because the fuel of sea ships contains a lot of ash, the emitted particulate matter will also contain a lot of ash. In car and truck applications the soot filters are cleaned by burning the particulate matter off of the filter. However, ash will not be burned off and accumulates in the filter. In the case of high-ash loads, like sea ships, a <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> is not applicable, because the filters cannot be cleaned properly. The goal of the research was to develop a technology to reduce particulate matter that is fuel insensitive. In this thesis such a technology is described, tested and simulated for high-ash applications. The patented technology is based on coating particulate matter with water, and subsequently capturing by an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). In the present experimental set-up this was a two-stage ESP, which has a robust construction and a reduced risk of physical contact between the electrodes at different potential. The water-coated particles will flow off the collection plates, therefore allowing continuous operation of the ESP. The water stream needs to be cleaned before it is discharged in the surface waters. The required cleaning technology, however, is similar to the cleaning technologies used in sea water scrubbers. It is proven that the technology is capable of removing 80 % of particulate matter, including the fraction of particulate matter smaller than 1 micrometer in (mobility) diameter. It was found that the new technology was rather insensitive to particle size and is thus very suitable to remove sub-micron particles. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The new {{emission}} control regulations for the diesel engines impose less soot particulate emissions. The particulates are dangerous and very harmful for the enviroment. Today, the CO and HC emissions of the diesel engines are already very low but the NOx and particulates emissions are still high. These are {{the goal of}} the modern {{emission control}} technologies. The reduction of the NOx and particulates emitted can be reduced with improvements in the engine design, fuel, oil and additive technologies and with exhaust after treatment. The soot filters collect the particulates from the diesel engine exhaust gas. The filter efficiency can be over 90 % and the durability is satisfactory. When the trap's soot load is high the regeneration is necessary to retain the efficiency and to avoid the filter failure. The regeneration methods must be further developed in order to avoid problems cause from the heat released during the combustion of the soot. These problems must be completely solved, for the soot traps to become a common used emission control device in passenger cars. Today, soot filters in passenger cars are used only from PSA, but the emission control regulations in the future will impose every vehicle with a diesel engine to have reduced particulates emissions. That will lead in the wide use of soot filters. The design and improvement of soot traps can be much more easier, more efficiently and with less cost with the use of <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> simulation software. Many tests and modifications can be made, avoiding the experimental cost. Besides, many parameters of the filter function can be computed and analysed faster and reliably. The diploma thesis with title 'Modeling of ceramic soot filters' was conducted within the purposes of the research project 'Development of computational tools for exhaust after-treatment systems design optimization' for PSA Peugeot Citroen, at the Laboratory of Thermodynamics and Thermal Engines, of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. The goal of the diploma thesis is the presentation of the basics of soot traps and the calculations conducted with the <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> simulation software Catwall. The validation of the model as well as to find the points that need to be improved {{are a part of the}} thesis.

The second chapter deals with the modeling of the experiments of the small filters, conducted by PSA. The experiments are described and the results from the calculations are compared with the measurements with SiC and Cordierite filters. In the next chapter the experiments conducted with insulated filters by the IFP are described and then the temperature and ΔΡ calculations are presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of diesel exhaust aftertreatment testing and analysis done under the FreedomCAR program. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) adsorber technology was selected based on a previous investigation of various NOx aftertreatment technologies including non-thermal plasma, NOx adsorber and active lean NOx. Particulate Matter (PM) emissions were addressed by developing a catalyzed particulate filter. After various iterations of the catalyst formulation, the aftertreatment components were integrated and optimized for a light duty vehicle application. This compact exhaust aftertreatment system is dual leg and consists of a sulfur trap, NOx adsorbers, and catalyzed particulate filters (CPF). During regeneration, supplementary ARCO ECD low-sulfur diesel fuel is injected upstream of the adsorber and CPF in the exhaust. Steady state and transient emission test results with and without the exhaust aftertreatment system (EAS) are presented. Results of <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> regeneration by injecting low-sulfur diesel fuel and slip of unregulated emissions, such as NH 3, are discussed. Effects of adsorber size and bypass strategy on NOx conversion efficiency and fuel economy penalty are also presented in this paper. The results indicate that if the supplementary fuel injection is optimized, NH 3 slip is negligible. During the FTP cycle, injection of low sulfur diesel fuel can create temperature exotherms high enough to regenerate a loaded CPF. With the optimized NOx adsorber regeneration strategies the fuel injection penalty can be reduced by 40 to 50 %. Results for various other issues like low temperature light off, reductant optimization, exhaust sulfur management, system integration and design trade-off, are also presented and discussed in this paper.

In this process, the internal parameter settings of the DPF simulation was described in detail, while the simulation results was obtained by analysis. The main conclusions are: The inner flow speed showed higher in the center part and lower in the peripheral part of DPF; the flow speed decreased {{in the direction of}} inlet channel. The soot distributed more in the frontal and rear part of DPF and less in the middle part. This is because the inlet channel of DPF at a large rate so the soot accumulated more. The accumulated soot in the middle part due to the role of air migration in the channel will move {{to the end of the}} channel. And all these reasons lead to the situation that the soot distributed more in the front and rear part.

Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and isotope exchange experiments demonstrate the key role of bulk oxygen species in the oxidation process. When "intimate" soot/YSZ contact is achieved after in situ carbon deposition via propylene cracking, lattice oxygen ions are the predominant species involved in the oxidation reaction. Based on isotopic TPO experiments performed with different oxygen partial pressures in "tight" contact mode and oxygen exchange measurements, it is proposed that the ignition of the soot oxidation on YSZ {{can be described as}} a fuel-cell-type electrochemical mechanism at the nanometric scale.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this program was to develop generic aftertreatment technologies applicable for LDV and LDT engines ranging from 55 kW to 200 kW, to develop an optimized and integrated aftertreatment system for a LDT (Light Duty Truck) type vehicle, and to demonstrate the technology which will enable light duty diesel engines to meet Federal Tier II regulation with minimum impact on fuel economy. Specifically, the development targets for emissions reduction and fuel injection penalty are given below: (1) NOx conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (2) PM conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (3) Fuel penalty over FTP- 75 Less than 5 %; and (4) Fuel penalty at Cruise condition Less than 3 %. Development of cost-effective, highly efficient diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems in combination with very low engine out emission combustion development are essential elements for realization of Federal Tier II emission standards for Light Duty Trucks and Vehicles. Evaluation of several aftertreatment technologies was completed {{as part of this}} program. A combination of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, NOx Adsorbing Catalyst and Catalyzed <b>Soot</b> <b>Filter</b> was found to provide the levels of conversion efficiency required to achieve the emission targets. While early systems required relatively large catalyst volumes, external dosing, sulfur traps, full bypass configurations and high levels of Platinum metals; the final system is a compact, scalable, flow-through, fully-integrated and engine-managed aftertreatment system capable of commercial application for Light Duty Vehicles and Trucks. NOx adsorber/particulate filter technology is particularly attractive for Light Duty applications due to the lower exhaust flow and temperature requirements as compared to Heavy Duty engines. Despite these strong positive aspects, NOx Adsorbers are challenged by their regeneration requirements and susceptibility to sulfur poisoning and thermal degradation. Capability was developed to regenerate the NOx Adsorber for NOx and SOx as well as the Particulate Filter for soot. This system was fully integrated into a truck and evaluated over the chassis dynamometer for emissions capability and in real-world winter field testing. Durability of the system was evaluated over a variety of accelerated and real-time dynamometer tests. Excellent NOx and PM conversion efficiency was demonstrated, even following 3000 hrs of endurance testing. Unregulated emissions emitted by the system were evaluated as was the fuel penalty associated with the DeNOx and DeSOx regeneration processes. In the final evaluation, the system demonstrated 90 % NOx conversion and 99 % PM conversion at a 6 % fuel penalty over the FTP- 75 test cycle. While target fuel penalty levels were demonstrated using full-bypass configuration systems, the cost associated with those systems was prohibitively high and would preclude successful commercialization of the technology. Although the flow-through configuration fell 1 % short of the 5 % fuel penalty target, the cost of this configuration is such that commercial application is feasible. Cost drivers for the final system configuration were identified and demonstrate areas where future development areas could focus...|$|E
40|$|Bad {{air quality}} is an {{increasing}} problem in most European countries {{and also in the}} Netherlands. A growing awareness of the effects of bad air quality on the environment and health has put the air quality issue high on the political agenda. Road traffic {{is one of the major}} air polluters in Europe. Especially near main arteries and in dense areas European air quality standards are being transgressed due to the presence of lively and much road traffic. Especially excessive concentrations of Nitro Oxides (NOx) and Particulate IVIatter (PM) cause problems. Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) is often mentioned as one of the possibilities to reduce the polluting character of road traffic. These observations lead to the main research question for this study: To what extend can DTM measures contribute to an improvement of air quality? The goal set for this study is to investigate the possibilities to calculate the effects of DTM measures on air quality using microscopic traffic modelling. A calculation model can then be used to answer the main research question. Polluting character of road traffic Initially the characteristics of road traffic are investigated that cause its polluting character. Here fore, road traffic characteristics are subdivided into two groups: vehicle characteristics and operational characteristics. Literature study has lead to the conclusion that both vehicle characteristics and operational characteristics contribute significantly to the polluting character of road traffic. Vehicle characteristics that increase the polluting character are: Large vehicle weights, large engine sizes, diesel engines (PM and NOx), old vehicles (outdated environmental class) and poor vehicle maintenance. Furthermore the use of exhaust after treatment devices (catalyst converter and <b>soot</b> <b>filter)</b> has a large reducing effect off vehicle emissions. Operational characteristics that increase the polluting character are: highly dynamic driving with many acceleration and deceleration activities (transient state driving), extreme high and extreme low average speeds and many stops. Driving profile description In order to be able to investigate the quantitative impact of driving profile differences on emission rates, a driving profile should be described by characteristics that can be quantified. Each describing characteristic should comply with two boundary conditions; it should have a direct relation with emission rates and it should be measurable or calculable from a microscopic traffic model. All mechanical characteristics of vehicle operation lil<e engine speed and throttle position can therefore not be included. The following 8 characteristics have been selected: Average speed, speed deviation, average acceleration rate, number of stops per minute and the four driving mode proportions (acceleration time, deceleration time, constant speed time and idling time). Measured driving profiles and emission rates from the German HBEFA model have indicated the direct relations of the characteristics with vehicle emission rates. State of the art emission modelling Literature study of emission modelling in Europe has resulted in an overview of state of the art emission models that nowadays are used for emission calculations. The Dutch traffic situation model VERSIT+ is assessed as one of the best state of the art emission models at this moment. This model uses an extensive set of parameters to describe a driving profile. Multiple regression (using an extensive database of measured driving profiles) is use d to determine the emission rates that match a driving profile. Microscopic traffic modelling and emission calculation The microscopic traffic model VISSIM is used as tool to assess the effects of DTM measures in a case study. VISSIM was developed as a simulation tool for capacity and travel time calculations. The experience with VISSIM in accurate emission modelling is few. The value of driving profiles that are generated during a VISSIM simulation is uncertain. However, for this study, the VISSIM model is the only model available. The effect of DTM measures on vehicle emissions In order to select DTM measures that have the maximal positive effect on vehicle emissions, initially a short list is made of all DTM measures stated in the "Handbook for sustainable traffic management" (Rijkswaterstaat, 2003). This short list has been assessed using the knowledge from previous literature studies. The impact of the DTM measures has been assessed based on the expected impact on the 8 characteristics of a driving profile. Two DTM measured have been selected because their effects on driving profiles are considered to be very positive: Coordinated control and Truck priority. Case study The two DTM measures have been translated into 5 simulation scenarios for testing in a VISSIM environment. The selected case study is the ring road of Almere; this is a urban string or 14 controlled intersections. The 5 DTM scenarios are compared with a Reference Situation for which no special DTM measures are implemented. The 5 DTM scenarios are: 9 ̆ 5 Coordinated Control, in the main directions all intersection controllers interchange information 9 ̆ 5 on approaching vehicle platoons. 9 ̆ 5 Truck Priority, in the main directions all intersection controllers detect trucks at long distances 9 ̆ 5 in order to guarantee a delay less intersection crossing 9 ̆ 5 Truck Advantage, in the main directions green times are extended when a truck is detected 9 ̆ 5 within the detection field at distance from the intersection. 9 ̆ 5 Coordinated control with Truck priority, a combination. 9 ̆ 5 Coordinated control with Truck advantage, a combination. Considering the driving profile characteristics from Personal Cars (PC) and Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV) that were recorded from the simulations, the coordinated control with truck priority alternative shows the best improvements w. r. t. the reference situation. Although mainly the driving profiles of traffic on the ring road (main directions) improve, also the entire network performance increases. However, maximum stopped delay times on the side roads frequently exceed the 90 second limit. In general, a DTM measure is able to reduce vehicle emission rates. The question "to what extend" can not be answered accurately based on the used calculation and simulation models. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Depositions of {{all kinds}} of urban dirt and dust {{including}} anthropogenic organic substances like <b>soot</b> change the <b>filter</b> properties of the seam filling material of pervious pavements and lead to the formation of a new soil substrate called seam material. In this study, the impact of the particular urban form of organic matter (OM) on the seam materials CECpot, the specific surface area (As), the surface charge density (SCD), the adsorption energies (Ea) and the adsorption of Cd and P b were assessed. The Cd and P b displacement through the pavement system has been simulated in order to assess the risk of soil and groundwater contamination from infiltration of rainwater in paved urban soils.

40|$|Ignition and {{combustion}} {{aids are}} added to the fuel for the regeneration of particle filters in the exhaust gas of Diesel engines. The method of action of these additives on particle ignition and oxidation in the particle filter is to be examined. The method of action of particle ignition in <b>soot</b> <b>filters</b> supported by fuel additives was examined in the engine experiment and by determination of the rate of reaction of the particles on the thermal balance. Particle combustion supported by additives is based on an ignition function of active components, local increase in the energy level by oxidation of hydrocarbons deposited on the soot and soot activation by metals/metal oxides. Wall contact of active components, reduction of deposited hydrocarbons on the soot by an increase in temperature or by catalysts and slight contact between carbon and metal oxides due to crystal growth of the metal oxides reduce the effect of the additives. At low additive concentrations, a regeneration gap can occur at filter temperatures of 350 - 400 degrees C, where the hydrocarbons deposited on the soot are missing and the temperature is not sufficient for soot oxidation by solid-solid catalysis. With higher additive concentration, the probability of regeneration increases and the regeneration gap closes. The following is recommended for the construction of particle filter systems with additive regeneration: the exhaust gas pipe in front of the filter should be short. At low load, the quantity of hydrocarbons with high boiling point should be high. The additive concentration in the range of 250 - 400 degrees C should be adapted by additive dosing controlled by the characteristic, in order that no regeneration gap will be createdZur Regeneration von Partikelfiltern im Abgas von Dieselmotoren werden Zuend- und Brennhilfen als Additive dem Kraftstoff zugegeben. Es soll die Wirkungsweise dieser Additive auf die Partikelzuendung und Oxidation im Partikelfilter untersucht werden. Die Wirkungsweise der durch Kraftstoffzusaetze (Additive) unterstuetzten Partikelzuendung in Russfiltern wurde im Motorversuch sowie durch Bestimmung der Reaktionsrate der Partikeln auf der Thermowaage untersucht. Additivunterstuetzte Partikelverbrennung beruht auf einer Zuendfunktion aktiver Komponenten, einer oertlichen Erhoehung des Energieniveaus durch Oxidation am Russ angelagerter Kohlenwasserstoffe und einer Russaktivierung durch Metalle/Metalloxide. Wandkontakt aktiver Komponenten, Verminderung angelagerter Kohlenwasserstoffe am Russ durch Temperatursteigerung oder Katalysatoren und geringer Kontakt zwischen Kohlenstoff- und Metalloxiden infolge Kristallwachstum der Metalloxide vermindern die Additivwirkung. Bei niedrigen Additivkonzentrationen kann eine Regenerationsluecke bei Filtertemperaturen von 350 C- 400 C entstehen, in der die am Russ angelagerten Kohlenwasserstoffe fehlen und die Temperatur zur Russoxidation durch Fest-Fest-Katalyse nicht ausreicht. Mit hoeherer Additivkonzentration nimmt die Regenerationswahrscheinlichkeit zu und die Regenerationsluecke schliesst sich. Fuer den Aufbau von Partikelfiltersystemen mit Additivregeneration wird empfohlen: Die Abgasleitung vor dem Filter sollte kurz sein. Bei niedriger Last sollte die Menge hochsiedender Kohlenwasserstoffe hoch sein. Die Additivkonzentration im Bereich um 250 C- 400 C sollte z. B. durch kennfeldgesteuerte Additivdosierung angepasst werden, um keine Regenerationsluecke entstehen zu lassen. (orig.)

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determination}} of water-insoluble light absorbing matter in rainwater has been developed. After collection the rainwater samples were filtered using polycarbonate membrane filter in the laboratory. After drying the filter in filtered air, {{the amount of}} water-insoluble light absorbing matter (<b>soot)</b> on the <b>filters</b> was determined with photometry at a wavelength of 555 nm.

50|$|Fibrous {{ceramic filters}} {{are made from}} several {{different}} types of ceramic fibers that are mixed {{together to form a}} porous media. This media can be formed into almost any shape and can be customized to suit various applications. The porosity can be controlled in order to produce high flow, lower efficiency or high efficiency lower volume filtration. Fibrous filters have an advantage over wall flow design of producing lower back pressure.Ceramic wall-flow filters remove carbon particulates almost completely, including fine particulates less than 100 nanometers (nm) diameter with an efficiency of greater than 95% in mass and greater than 99% in number of particles over a wide range of engine operating conditions. Since the continuous flow of <b>soot</b> into the <b>filter</b> would eventually block it, it is necessary to 'regenerate' the filtration properties of the filter by burning-off the collected particulate on a regular basis. Soot particulates burn-off forms water and CO2 in small quantity amounting to less than 0.05% of the CO2 emitted by the engine.|$|R
40|$|Many {{existing}} diesel {{particulate filter}} (DPF) models do not sufficiently describe the actual physiochemical processes that occur during the regeneration process. This {{is due to the}} various assumptions made in the models. To overcome this shortcoming, a detailed twodimensional DPF regeneration model with a multistep chemical reaction scheme is presented. The model solves the variable density, multicomponent conservation equations by the pressure implicit with splitting of operators (PISO) scheme for inlet and outlet channels as well as the porous <b>soot</b> layer and <b>filter</b> wall. It includes a non-thermal equilibrium (NTE) model for the energy equation for porous media. In addition, for the first time, experiments on the DPF were conducted to determine the interstitial heat transfer coefficient inside the DPF porous wall. The results compare well with an in-house one-dimensional model and subsequently this was used in the new two-dimensional model. By using this detailed two-dimensional model, some interesting observations of the DPF regeneration process were revealed. These included flow reversals and asymmetry in the filter channels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In diesel engine, generally, {{the removal}} of carbon {{nanoparticles}} {{has been based on}} a filtration system or oxidation reactor with O 2 at high temperatures of above 800 ºC. Recently, NO 2 {{has been found to be}} a more efficient oxidant than O 2 at lower temperatures in the range of 200 ~ 500 ºC. Small amounts of NO 2 in the range of a few hundreds of ppm by volume can promote the continuous oxidation of carbon particulates. Thus far, experiments involving diesel PM (particulate matter) oxidation by NO 2 are only practiced as regards the <b>soot</b> deposited on <b>filters</b> or plates. However, in aerosol state, depending on the surrounding temperature and the NO 2 concentration, the carbon nanoparticle removal rate is significantly different. Therefore, the study of nano-sized carbon aerosol oxidation in various gas circumstances is required. In this study, the oxidation characteristics of nano-sized carbon aerosol particles in NO 2 condition are investigated...|$|R
40|$|By {{using of}} the {{microwave}} heating setup and engine test bed, an experimental {{study has been}} carried out to investigate the regeneration performance in oxidizing atmosphere under microwave irradiation. The results indicated that the content of <b>soot</b> trapped in <b>filter</b> violently influenced the combustion of filter by microwave heating. Only when the soot content exceeded a lower limit, could the filter be heated to the ignition temperature of soot and achieve regeneration. But the soot content couldn't go beyond an upper limit, otherwise the strong exotherm resulted from the vigorous combustion of soot would destroy the filter by sintering. The window between the lower and upper limit was changeable with activity difference of catalysts impregnated in filters. The analysis of the combustion products revealed that the more acute burning of diesel soot by microwave heating led to an obvious increase in carbon monoxide compared with electric heating, the usage of catalyst for deep oxidation could increase the ratio of CO 2 to CO apparently...|$|R

For uses at over 500 °C, acidic and oxidative atmospheres, long term stability under mechanical and thermal fluctuating loads in passenger cars, trucks, buses, diesel locomotives, and ship diesel engines, in chemical facilities and catalysis engineering, the Fraunhofer-Institut Fertigungstechnik Angewandte Materialforschung (IFAM) Dresden developed jointly with the Inco GmbH of Munich a filtration material based on Ni superalloys (Incofoam® HighTemp). This material has been produced in Germany since the start of 2006 and is used by customers in the fields of interest of filters, engines, vehicles, and chemical facility construction. The metal foam is supplied at 1 - 3 mm thickness such that cutting, stacking, and shaping through bending before or after delivery can be effected. Some requirements of the foam material are low density of less than 1 g/cu cm, variable open porosity of 20 - 95 %, maximum flexibility, high tensile strength of at least 8 MPa, temperature resistance to at least 800 °C also under thermal fluctuating loads, and corrosion stability of at least 50 hr at 1 % sulfuric acid at room temperature and at 80 °C.
