50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>drum</b> or spotted {{ribbonfish}} (Equetus punctatus), is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Sciaenidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>drum</b> is {{widespread}} throughout the tropical {{waters of the}} occidental Atlantic Ocean from south Florida to Brazil including {{by the way the}} Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
50|$|The {{waters off}} the United States Virgin Islands {{are among the}} most {{productive}} in the world and host a variety of marine mammals, fish, sea turtles, corals, seabirds and invertebrates. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in the waters surrounding the archipelago, including for instance parrotfish, hogfish, surgeon fish, butterflyfish, squirrelfish, damselfish, fairy basslet, hawkfish, <b>spotted</b> <b>drum,</b> porcupinefish, barracuda, blue chromis, snapper, Creole wrasse, hamlet, French grunt, filefish, goby, wahoo, Atlantic blue marlin, and hundreds of others.|$|E

25|$|The Marching Band has {{remained}} faithful to its military roots, while also pushing for new marching innovations. The percussion section {{is a prime}} example. The percussion section of the Marching Band first added tenor duo toms in 1970. Around this time, drum corps began experimenting with marching timpani as well as duo and tri toms. The band transitioned to tri-toms in the 1980s. Drum corps continued to expand their percussion section with quad toms, adding additional <b>spot</b> <b>drums</b> to create quints or sextets, along with increasing bass drum lines with multiple sizes to allow for tonal passages to be played. In the 1990s, the Marching Band changed to quad-toms, but continued to use two-pitch bass drums. In 2005, the Band made {{the transition to a}} full tonal bass drum line, and added two additional <b>spot</b> <b>drums</b> to the quads by 2008. This gives the Marching Band a percussion section on par with many drum and bugle corps. From a marching perspective, the Ramp Entrance, at 180 beats per minute, was considered to be the fastest tempo performed by a marching ensemble until the late 1980s/early 1990s, when Star of Indiana Drum and Bugle Corps broke the 200 bpm threshold. The Marching Band is also larger than any drum corps, as the maximum performers in a DCI corps is 150.|$|R
50|$|Sciaenids {{are found}} worldwide, in both fresh and salt water, and are {{typically}} benthic carnivores, feeding on invertebrates and smaller fish. They are small to medium-sized, bottom-dwelling fishes living primarily in estuaries, bays, and muddy river banks. Most of these fish types avoid clear waters, such as coral reefs and oceanic islands, {{with a few}} notable exceptions (e.g. reef croaker, high-hat, and <b>spotted</b> <b>drum).</b> They live in warm-temperate and tropical waters and are best represented in major rivers in Southeast Asia, northeast South America, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Gulf of California.|$|E

Even so, their songs were cited as being thought-provoking and containing deep theology. One of the major focuses for the band was evangelism; they included segments of preaching in each performance. Originally these were fronted by drummer Jason Carson, who had been active in youth ministry before the Supertones found their break. In 2000 when he went back into ministry full-time the band split the responsibilities among remaining members. Adam Ferry, formerly of Plankeye, took Carson's <b>spot</b> on <b>drums.</b>|$|R

[...] Guitarists Jay Stanley and John Goff rounded out the band. The band was {{popular in the}} Orlando area, where they played in bars and nightclubs. Most of their songs were written by Thomas, including [...] "3 A.M." [...] This song, inspired by his time {{taking care of his}} mother, was the first that he had ever written and liked. In an effort to recreate that magic, his writing shifted to focus more on emotions inspired from his own life.|$|R

40|$|With {{the heat}} of the summer, inshore fishing slows {{somewhat}} compared to spring and fall. However, in summer many different fishes are available to inshore anglers. Among these are: <b>spotted</b> seatrout, red <b>drum,</b> black drum, flounders, whiting, Spanish and king mackerel, sheepshead, and crevalle jack. As a general rule, summer fishing is better at dusk and dawn. During {{this time of the year}} estuaries and coastal waters are filled with a variety of bait fishes and shrimps preyed upon by game fish. As a result, live baits will catch more fish than artificial lures at this time...|$|R
