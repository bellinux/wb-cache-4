5|$|During the march, Rajagopalachari and {{the marchers}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} Civil Disobedience Movement as well as khadi and social issues like caste discrimination. They socialised with the untouchables and refrained from entering the temples in which the former were denied entry. They also swept {{the streets of the}} villages and <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for the unity of Hindus and Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death. Philip held {{a peace conference}} in November 1188, making a public offer of a generous long-term peace settlement with Henry, conceding to his various territorial demands, if Henry would finally marry Richard and Alice and announce Richard as his recognised heir. Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself <b>spoke</b> <b>up,</b> demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor. Henry remained silent and Richard then publicly changed sides at the conference and gave formal homage to Philip {{in front of the}} assembled nobles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} motorcycles were built like bicycles, with wire wheels as bicycles had traditionally been built with. The Steffey motorcycle in 1902, essentially a bicycle with a two-stroke engine attached, used wooden rims with wire spokes. This style of wheel {{evolved into a}} stouter motorcycle specific wheel, still with <b>spokes,</b> <b>up</b> through the 1960s.|$|R

5|$|In April 1869, the U.S. Senate {{overwhelmingly}} {{rejected a}} proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator Charles Sumner <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> before congress; publicly denounced Queen Victoria; demanded a huge reparation; {{and opened the}} possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks {{had to be put}} off until matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish. A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871 in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
25|$|Cao Chong {{was known}} to be kind and understanding. He helped to review cases of indicted criminals for any {{injustice}} and successfully cleared tens of cases.

25|$|After {{returning}} to his native commandery sometime between 196 and 208, Guo Yuan served as an assistant official under the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian. He was known for being very outspoken and direct, but honest and impartial, whenever he <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> during debates in the imperial court.|$|E
25|$|Torrey was {{for many}} years an active advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Parents felt that he <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for them when much of the medical {{establishment}} had previously held that parenting was responsible for schizophrenia. Torrey helped build NAMI into a powerful political force through campaigning and donating the hardcover royalties {{from the sale of}} his book Surviving Schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, Fox {{revealed}} {{publicly that}} she was raped by Fowley on New Year’s Eve 1975 at an after-party following a Runaways performance at an Orange County club. Sixteen {{years old at the}} time, Fox was reportedly given Quaaludes by a man who she thought was a roadie, and while she was incapacitated, Fowley raped her. Currie stated that she <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> against Fowley's actions, then stormed out of the room when he refused to stop.|$|E

25|$|Apart from Pan Jun and Sun Deng, {{there were}} others who stood up to Lü Yi's abuses of power. The senior general Lu Xun, along with Pan Jun, {{frequently}} <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> about Lü Yi's behaviour in front of Sun Quan, {{to the point of}} breaking down in tears. Bu Zhi, another high-ranking general, also wrote to Sun Quan on at least four occasions to speak up for Lü Yi's victims, and advise the emperor to rely on capable officials such as Gu Yong, Lu Xun and Pan Jun.|$|E
25|$|Bradlaugh's {{political}} prospects {{were not}} {{damaged by the}} Knowlton scandal and {{he was elected to}} Parliament in 1881. Because of his atheism, he asked to be allowed to affirm rather than swear the oath of loyalty. When the possibility of affirmation was refused, Bradlaugh stated his willingness to take the oath. But this option was also challenged. Although many Christians were shocked by Bradlaugh, others (like the Liberal leader Gladstone) <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for freedom of belief. It took more than six years before the matter was completely resolved (in Bradlaugh's favour) after a series of by-elections and court appearances.|$|E
25|$|Chen Biao {{was already}} famous in his youth. He was {{selected}} to be an aide to the crown prince Sun Deng (Sun Quan's eldest son), together with Zhuge Ke, Gu Tan and Zhang Xiu. Chen Biao {{was a close friend}} of Ji Yan (曁豔), a Master of Writing (尚書). When Ji Yan was accused of negligence in his duties, the other officials shunned him for fear of being implicated, but Chen Biao <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for Ji and earned the respect of many ministers. Chen Biao was later appointed as a zhongshuzi to the Crown Prince (太子中庶子) and a Commandant of the Central Flank (翼正都尉).|$|E

25|$|During February 2015, Hamilton {{underwent}} {{shoulder surgery}} to repair the AC joint. While he was recovering, {{it was revealed that}} he had a relapse into his drug addiction, which he voluntarily reported to MLB. An outside arbitrator ruled that his voluntary admission did not violate baseball's drug policy and he could not be suspended. Despite the ruling, team owner Arte Moreno ordered all Hamilton's merchandise to be removed from the team stores and made comments to the media implying {{that he did not want}} Hamilton back on the team. The players union and several Angels players <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> in Hamilton's defense. The Angels began to layout a rehab plan for him, but shortly afterwards reports surfaced that the Angels were looking to trade Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|The Friends of Birkenhead Library were {{established}} in November 1990, under the patronage of Keith Sinclair, and continued under Thea Muldoon from 1994. They have advocated strongly for the library, most recently {{on behalf of the}} new building, drumming up support through meetings with the Community Board and in the local paper. Along with Plunkett they <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for the library at the Environment Court hearing. The Friends have also raised monies for various equipment, such as listening posts and the library's first camera, a Pentax. Speakers at their events have been diverse and have included historian Claudia Orange, writers Muriel Fisher, Sheridan Keith, and Rosemary Menzies, as well as Ann Hartley, a former mayor, Jenny Kirk, a former councillor, and Sergio Gulyaev, a Russian astronomer.|$|E
25|$|Ling Tong was {{reputed to}} have a strong sense of righteousness. During the battle at Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to attack Yiling (夷陵; around present-day Yichang, Hubei). Cao Ren sent an army to attack Gan Ning and had him surrounded. Gan Ning hurriedly {{requested}} for reinforcements, but the generals did not have enough men to spare to save him and believed it was not sagacious to send reinforcements because that would dilute the main army. Lü Meng <b>spoke</b> <b>up,</b> saying that they should help Gan Ning. He proposed to Zhou Yu that Ling Tong stay behind to keep Cao Ren in check {{while the rest of the}} generals go to reinforce Gan Ning. Lü Meng boldly asserted that he had confidence that Ling Tong could hold on for ten days. Ling Tong then took up his duties with responsibility. He countered Cao Ren's attacks alone, and bought time for the other generals to rescue Gan Ning.|$|E

25|$|Bu Zhi (died 247), {{courtesy}} name Zishan, was {{an official}} and military {{general of the}} state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period of China. Originally a scholar of humble background, he became a subordinate of the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty and gradually rose through the ranks. Between 210 and 220, he served as the governor of the remote and restive Jiao Province in southern China. During the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling of 221–222, he quelled local uprisings in Sun Quan's territories in southern Jing Province and maintained peace in the area. After Sun Quan became emperor in 229, Bu Zhi oversaw the Wu armed forces guarding the Wu–Shu border at Xiling (present-day Yichang, Hubei) for about 20 years. During this time, he also gave advice to Sun Quan's first heir apparent, Sun Deng, and <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for officials affected by Lü Yi's abuses of power. In 246, he became the fourth Imperial Chancellor of Wu, but died in office in the following year.|$|E
25|$|In the 240s, a power {{struggle}} broke out between Sun Quan's sons Sun He and Sun Ba; both of them fought for the succession to their father's throne. Wu Can sided with and <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for Sun He, whom he regarded as the legitimate heir apparent. He attempted to persuade Sun Quan to have Sun Ba relocated away from the imperial capital Jianye to Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei) and have Yang Zhu (楊笁), an official who supported Sun Ba, reassigned to another position outside Jianye. Wu Can also maintained close contact with the senior general Lu Xun, who was stationed in Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei). Both Wu Can and Lu Xun vehemently objected to Sun Quan's idea of deposing Sun He and replacing him with Sun Ba, and constantly wrote memorials to Sun Quan to dissuade him from doing so. Wu Can lost his job after Sun Ba and his supporters slandered {{him in front of}} Sun Quan. He was subsequently arrested, imprisoned and eventually executed.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{officials}} who fell victim to Lü Yi's abuses of power were the general Zhu Ju, the Imperial Chancellor Gu Yong, and the commandery administrators Diao Jia (刁嘉) and Zheng Zhou (鄭胄). In Zhu Ju's case, which happened sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi falsely accused him of embezzling military funds when some funds designated for Zhu Ju's army went missing. Zhu Ju, unable to explain himself, suffered in silence. The finance officer in his army also died under torture during interrogation. Later, another inspector discovered the real culprit and cleared Zhu Ju's name. As for Gu Yong, Lü Yi initially prepared {{to make a case}} against him for incompetence and ask Sun Quan to remove him from office. However, after an official Xie Gong (謝厷) pointed out that Pan Jun, the Minister of Ceremonies, would most likely become the next Imperial Chancellor if Gu Yong were to be removed from office, Lü Yi immediately dropped the case against Gu Yong because he knew that Pan Jun resented him and would take action against him if he became Imperial Chancellor. In Diao Jia's case, Lü Yi falsely accused him of defaming the imperial court, resulting in an angry Sun Quan ordering Diao Jia's arrest. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, they all said they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Only Shi Yi said he did not, and he eventually managed to convince Sun Quan that Diao Jia was innocent. In Zheng Zhou's case, earlier on he had arrested and executed Lü Yi's retainer(s) for breaking the law, so Lü Yi bore a grudge against him and spoke ill of him in front of Sun Quan. Sun Quan, believing what Lü Yi said, turned furious and summoned Zheng Zhou to meet him. Pan Jun and Chen Biao <b>spoke</b> <b>up</b> for Zheng Zhou and succeeded in convincing Sun Quan to spare him.|$|E
