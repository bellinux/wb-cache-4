40|$|Background: Comparability of {{the quality}} of medical care for {{children}} in different types of in-patient hospitals remains a subject of debate. Objective: Our aim was to compare the quality of emergency hospital care for children with <b>severe</b> <b>traumas</b> in pediatric and non-pediatric in-patient hospitals. Methods : Retrospective cohort (continuous) research. We analyzed medical records of intensive care patients (form 003 /u) with <b>severe</b> <b>traumas</b> at the age of 1 month to 18 years hospitalized to in-patient hospitals of Rostov Oblast in  2010 – 2014. The quality of medical care was assessed according to duration of diagnostic maneuvers that led to the diagnosis and surgical activity (frequency of surgical interventions for the condition that led to hospitalization). Results : We analyzed the data on  134 children with <b>severe</b> mechanical <b>traumas</b> hospitalized to pediatric (n = 29) and non-pediatric (n = 105) in-patient hospitals. Lifethreatening traumas (Pediatric Trauma Score 8 points) were recorded in 26 (90 %) and 79 (75 %) children, respectively (p = 0. 127).  The duration of the diagnosis stage in two groups was 135 (120; 160) and 140 (110, 210) minutes, respectively (p = 0. 548). Surgical activity was higher in pediatric in-patient hospitals: surgical interventions were performed in 16 (55 %) children compared to 37 (35 %)  cases in the group of children admitted to non-pediatric hospitals (p = 0. 052). Conclusion: The quality of emergency in-patient hospital care for children with <b>severe</b> <b>traumas</b> in pediatric and non-pediatric hospitals does not differ significantly. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{decision}} whether to perform surgery {{is determined by}} the extent of the damage and the anatomical location of the injury. Bleeding must be controlled before definitive repair may occur. Damage control surgery is used to manage <b>severe</b> <b>trauma</b> {{in which there is a}} cycle of metabolic acidosis, hypothermia, and hypotension that may lead to death, if not corrected. The main principal of the procedure involves performing the least number of procedures to save life and limb; less critical procedures are left until the victim is more stable. Approximately 15% of all people with trauma have abdominal injuries, and approximately 25% of these require exploratory surgery. The majority of preventable deaths from trauma result from unrecognised intra-abdominal bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{especially}} vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking due to their age. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy {{physical and mental health}} of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse. Victims experience <b>severe</b> <b>trauma</b> on a daily basis that devastates the healthy development of self-concept, self-worth, biological integrity, and cognitive functioning. Children who grow up in constant environments of exploitation frequently exhibit antisocial behavior, over-sexualized behavior, self-harm, aggression, distrust of adults, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, complex trauma, and attention deficit disorders. Stockholm syndrome is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.|$|E

25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. If the air supply hose is ruptured near or above the surface, the pressure difference between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The non-return valve at the connection to the helmet will prevent backflow if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or if it fails, the pressure difference will tend to squeeze the diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in <b>severe</b> <b>trauma.</b> The same effect can result from a large and rapid increase in depth if the air supply is insufficient to keep up with the increase in ambient pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{optimism}} of la belle époque was destroyed, {{and those who}} had fought in the war were referred to as the Lost Generation. For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. Many soldiers returned with <b>severe</b> <b>trauma,</b> suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder). Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, Paul Fussell, and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Population {{data are}} often used to monitor <b>severe</b> perineal <b>trauma</b> trends and {{association}} of risk factors. Within NSW, two different datasets can be used; the Perinatal Data Collection (‘birth’ data), or a linked dataset combining birth data with the Admitted Patient Hospital Data Collection (‘hospital’ data). <b>Severe</b> perineal <b>trauma</b> can be ascertained by birth data alone, or by hospital ICD- 10 -AM diagnosis and procedure coding in the linked dataset. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare rates and risk factors for <b>severe</b> perineal <b>trauma</b> using birth data alone, with those using linked data. Methods The study population consisted of all vaginal births in NSW 2001 - 2011. As perineal injury coding in birth data was revised in 2006, data were analysed separately for 2 ‘earlier data’ and ‘more recent data’. Rates of severe perineal injury over time were compared in birth data alone, and in linked data. Kappa and agreement statistics were calculated. Risk factor distributions (primiparity, instrumental birth, birthweight≥ 4 kg, Asian country of birth and episiotomy) were compared between women with <b>severe</b> perineal <b>trauma</b> identified by birth data alone, and identified by linked data.

25|$|When two workmen noticed {{blood on}} the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot {{was found on the}} ice below, river police began searching the area for Rasputin's body. His body was found under the river ice on January 1st , {{approximately}} 200 meters downstream from the bridge. An autopsy was conducted by Dr. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon. The report that Kosorotov wrote was later lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of <b>severe</b> <b>trauma,</b> including three gunshot wounds - one of which had been sustained at close range, and to the forehead - a slice wound to his left side, and many other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem. Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body, but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned. According to both Douglas Smith and Joseph Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs, and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect. Contrary to some later accounts that claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, Kosorotov found his genitals intact.|$|E
500|$|During this rapid sinking, a large {{proportion}} of the crew suffered <b>severe</b> <b>trauma,</b> as is shown by osteological analyses of the skeletal remains. Many of the remains had deep, unhealed lacerations on skulls, vertebrae, ribs and other limbs. There are two primary theories about the cause of the injuries. Osteologist Ebba Düring has suggested that discipline and social cohesion collapsed during the sinking. The crew would have resorted to [...] "all the means at their disposal, both physical as well as psychological" [...] to escape the ship, an interpretation that is echoed by historian Ingvar Sjöblom. Medical historian Katarina Villner, on the other hand, has proposed that the injuries were caused by the sudden and violent chaos of the sinking itself, which would have thrown men, heavy equipment and cannons around.|$|E
500|$|The creature's corpse was {{recovered}} {{four days after}} the encounter, and a biopsy was performed by the National Environmental Authority of Panama (ANAM). The biopsy concluded that the corpse was in fact a male brown-throated sloth, a species common in the area. André Sena Maia, a veterinarian who works at Niterói Zoo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, explained that [...] "most people know how a dead animal looks like in a dry environment", and claimed that [...] "the body must have got stuck under the water, and the movement of the currents gave the false impression that it was alive." [...] A necropsy revealed that <b>severe</b> <b>trauma</b> had been inflicted on the body of the sloth, and Melquiades Ramos, a specialist from the ANAM Department of Protected Areas, estimated that the body had been in the water for [...] "about two days" [...] prior to discovery. The hairlessness was probably caused by the fact it was submerged in water, which can lead to acceleration of fur loss, resulting in smooth skin. A post-mortem bloating further contributed to the unusual appearance of the corpse. After the sloth was identified, its body was buried by ANAM staff.|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to define}} the {{diagnostic}} and predictive value of the markers of fat embolism {{as a cause of}} acute lung injury (ALI) in <b>severe</b> concomitant <b>trauma.</b> Subjects and methods: 34 patients with <b>severe</b> concomitant <b>trauma</b> were examined. A dynamic study was undertaken to examine by biochemical tests and hemoviscosimetry and lipid metabolism (very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and triglycerides (TG)). The Murray scale was used to evaluate the severity of ALI. The authors calculated the trauma shock genicity index in accordance with the recommendations developed by the Dzhanelidze Research Institute of Emergency Care (Saint Petersburg) and the patients&# 8217; condition by the TRISS scale. Results. In all the groups, patients with <b>severe</b> concomitant <b>trauma</b> develop ALI whose severity correlates with the severity of a trauma. In the group of patients with a shock genicity index of more than 14 scores, the most significant severe hemostatic disorders develop, which are retained within 9 days. In the same group, the levels of VLDL and TG increased within the first 3 days after trauma. Conclusion. In patients with <b>severe</b> concomitant <b>trauma,</b> the parameters of the hemostatic vascular platelet link and the elevated serum VLDL and TG levels are of diagnostic and predictive value in the development of ALI and fat embolism.

500|$|In contusions, torn {{capillaries}} leak fluid {{into the}} tissues around them. The membrane between alveoli and capillaries is torn; damage to this capillary–alveolar membrane and small blood vessels causes blood and fluids to leak into the alveoli and the interstitial space (the space surrounding cells) of the lung. [...] With more <b>severe</b> <b>trauma,</b> {{there is a}} greater amount of edema, bleeding, and tearing of the alveoli. [...] Pulmonary contusion is characterized by microhemorrhages (tiny bleeds) that occur when the alveoli are traumatically separated from airway structures and blood vessels. Blood initially collects in the interstitial space, and then edema occurs by an hour or two after injury. An area of bleeding in the contused lung is commonly surrounded by an area of edema. In normal gas exchange, carbon dioxide diffuses across the endothelium of the capillaries, the interstitial space, and across the alveolar epithelium; oxygen diffuses in the other direction. Fluid accumulation interferes with gas exchange, and can cause the alveoli to fill with proteins and collapse due to edema and bleeding. The larger the area of the injury, the more severe respiratory compromise will be.|$|E
