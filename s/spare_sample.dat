40|$|The photon {{detection}} efficiency of {{two sets of}} R 10560 - 100 - 20 superbialkali photomultiplier tubes from Hamamatsu were measured between 200 nm and 750 nm to quantify a possible degradation of the photocathode sensitivity {{after four years of}} operation in the cameras of the VERITAS Cherenkov telescopes. A sample of 20 photomultiplier tubes, which was removed from the telescopes was compared with a sample of 20 spare photomultiplier tubes, which had been kept in storage. It is found that the average photocathode sensitivity marginally increased below 300 nm and dropped by 10 % to 30 % above 500 nm. The average photocathode sensitivity folded with the Cherenkov spectrum emitted by particles in air showers, however, reveals a consistent detection yield of 18. 9 +/- 0. 2 % and 19. 1 +/- 0. 2 % for the sample removed from the telescope and the <b>spare</b> <b>sample,</b> respectively.

40|$|We {{present a}} tool for Design for Additive Manufacturing by {{internally}} structuring bulk volumes for lightweight construction. Essential to cost efficient, rapid prototyping is a reliable assessment of mechanical properties without having to build <b>spare</b> <b>samples</b> for testing. Due to its regular nature, our structure allows a beforehand calculation of the mechanical properties like strength and stiffness, even for large geometries with many cells. To improve the mechanical performance of the entire component, {{the structure of the}} cells can be adapted in response to a pre-determined load. This adaptation is achieved by locally increasing the diameter of selected struts. Moreover, the mechanical performance of the optimized structure can also be predicted by Finite Element Modeling. The adaptation significantly enhances the load bearing capacity of the product with a low increase in material and production time...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to test the optical behavior of 20 components and coatings subjected to space exposure. Most of them are commonly used for their reflective or transmittive properties in spaceborne optics. They consist in several kind of metallic and dielectric mirrors designed for the 0. 12 to 10 microns spectrum, UV, and NIR bandpass filters, visible, and IR antireflecting coatings, visible/IR dichroic beam splitters, and visible beam splitter. The coatings were deposited on various substrates such as glasses, germanium, magnesium fluoride, quartz, zinc selenide, and kanigened aluminum. Several coating materials were used such as Al, Ag, Au, MgF 2, LaF 3, ThF 3, ThF 4, SiO 2, TiO 2, ZrO 2, Al 2 O 3, MgO, Ge, and ZnSe. Five samples of each component were manufactured. Two flight samples were mounted {{in such a way}} that one was directly exposed to space and the other looking backwards. The same arrangement was used for the <b>spare</b> <b>samples</b> stored on ground in a box identical to the flight one and they were kept under vacuum during the LDEF mission. Finally, one set of reference components was stocked in a sealed box under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. By comparing the preflight and postflight optical performances of the five samples of each component, it is possible to detect the degradations due to the space exposure...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{accurate}} rate of classification multi-spectral remote sensing images, {{in this paper}} we construct a classification algorithm based on adaptive sparse representation (ASP). The geometrical explanation of ASP algorithm is to approximate the hyper-spherical cap with least hyper-planes, clustered the error vectors of each step, and signed the cluster center as new atoms which made the dictionary more suitable for <b>spare</b> representation of <b>samples.</b> we made testing samples as a linear combination of a few training samples of structured dictionary, this make the dictionary more suitable for <b>spare</b> representation of <b>samples.</b> A sample of remote sensing image of Dadukou areas Chongqing containing forest, land, water, building, green is used to examine the proposed approach.

40|$|Forecasting crop {{chemical}} characteristics based on soil properties {{is not only}} a possible way to <b>spare</b> supplementary <b>sampling</b> and testing, but also a potential method of instructing cultivation planning based on regional soil surveys. In this paper, taking the data of regional agricultural geological survey on Helianthus annuus sources {{in the western part of}} the Jilin province as an attempt, radial basis function neural networks were used to forecast the quality indexes of Helianthus annuus seeds based on the non-linear relationship between soil and crop. The results indicate the following: (1) The mean relative errors of vitamin E, protein, fat, and TAA concentration forecasting neural networks are 2. 63 %, 2. 19 %, 2. 19 %, and 2. 80 %, respectively. The root mean square errors are 1. 7 mg/ 100 g, 0. 59 %, 1. 09 %, and 0. 77 %. The forecasting radial basis function neural networks are of high prediction accuracy, which introduces an empirical case of forecasting the quality of crop based on a systematical soil environmental quality investigation along with a sampling survey of the crops. To set a proper model, interrelation between the selected indexes of input layer and output layer needs to be confirmed first, and a low setting of spread can improve the accuracy; (2) Soil in the studied area is under severe salinization, and concentrations of soil chemical properties mostly show an evident regional difference between the three experimental fields. However, the vitamin E, protein, and TAA concentrations of Helianthus annuus seeds all stabilize in a certain range despite the different soil environments. The mean fat concentration of Helianthus annuus seeds collected from Nongan and Daan exceeds those from Tongyu by approximately 5 %, which shows a relatively evident regional difference...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{were produced}} to Streptomyces lividans spore surface antigens. One particular hybridoma cell line, 43 H 6, produced a monoclonal antibody that reacted exclusively with Streptomyces cluster group 21 in an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Antibody 43 H 6 {{was found to be}} of subclass IgG 1, kappa light chain. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed that 43 H 6 recognized a major outer spore polypeptide of about 37000 Da. The epitope was stably maintained in S, lividans spores over at least seven sporulation cycles on laboratory medium and for at least 14 weeks in sterile soil systems. The species group specificity of antibody 43 H 6 was exploited in the development of an immunocapture technique for the isolation of streptomycetes from soil. Magnetic beads coated with antibody 43 H 6 were mixed with soil samples seeded with 5, lividans spores. Spore-bead complexes were recovered using magnets. Treatment of beads with blocking agents and the inclusion of detergents in the recovery system lessened non-specific binding of spores to beads and improved recovery. In buffer solutions decreasing the spore concentration increased the recovery values for a fixed bead concentration. At a spore concentration of 5 x 10 (7) ml(- 1) the recovery was 4. 3 % whilst at 5 x 10 (2) ml(- 1) it was 76 % for a fixed bead concentration of 0. 6 mg ml(- 1). Using a bead concentration of 2 mg per 10 g soil, approximately 30 % of the target spore population of 10 (6) c. f. u. was recovered from sterile soil and 4 % from non-sterile soil. This method offers a rapid means of selectively recovering and concentrating Streptomyces <b>spares</b> from soil <b>samples...</b>|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{neopterin}} is {{an excellent}} marker of inflammation and is found in elevated levels in plasma of patients with cardiovascular disease. Neopterin originates as the oxidation product of 7, 8 -dihydroneopterin (7, 8 -NP), which is secreted by human macrophages when stimulated with interferon-y during inflammation. 7, 8 -NP {{has been shown to}} be a very efficient free radical scavenger and a potent antioxidant which can protect macrophages from a range of oxidative stresses. The uptake of oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) by macrophages which lead to the formation of foam cells is a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions. OxLDL-induced cell death is also considered to be an important process in the formation of necrotic lipid rich plaques and in atherosclerotic plaque destabilisation. This thesis examined the extent of oxLDL-induced damaged to HMDMs and whether 7, 8 -NP can inhibit oxLDL-mediated cell death in HMDMs. Foam cells had previously been defined as cholesteryl ester (CE) macrophages that stained positive with oil red-O. This thesis shows that the foamy appearance and presence of lipid droplets stained with oil red-O was not dependent on accumulation of CE which raises the suitability of using oil-red-O staining to identify the foam cells. In addition, HPLC but not GC analysis showed an increased in CE levels of the macrophages when the macrophages were incubated with oxLDL. The HPLC approach <b>spared</b> the <b>samples</b> of lengthy manipulations that might cause ex vivo oxidation. It also avoided subjecting the samples to high temperature treatment that could alter the lipid composition and therefore quantification of the lipid contents. Previous studies showed that 7, 8 -NP is a potent antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. Exposure of HMDMs to 1 mg/ml oxLDL caused 50 % loss of cell viability as measured by the MTT reduction and trypan blue exclusion assays. The development of apoptotic features including caspase- 3 activity, cytochrome c release from mitochondria and phophatidyserine (PS) exposure was examined. OxLDL did not cause caspase- 3 activation as shown by Western Blot analysis and did not cause DEVD-AMC cleavage in HMDMs. However, cytochrome c release and phosphatidylserine exposure were observed when HMDMs were incubated with oxLDL as shown by Western Blot analysis and Annexin V-FITC staining respectively. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining showed that oxLDL treatment caused mitochondrial superoxide generation in HMDMs. OxLDL-induced oxidative stress appeared to cause a rapid loss of HMDMs' intracellular glutathione (GSH) as analysed by HPLC technique. Incubation of HMDMs' with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) caused similar loss in GSH as incubation with oxLDL but did not result in HMDMs' death. This showed that oxLDL-induced decrease in GSH alone was not sufficient to cause cell death. The loss of cell viability by oxLDL was inhibited by 7, 8 -NP in the concentration range of 50 to 200 lM. HMDMs' GSH loss caused by oxLDL was similarly inhibited by 7, 8 -NP supporting the idea that preventing the cellular GSH loss will protect the HMDMs from death. Incubation of HMDMs with 7, 8 -NP showed reduction in DHE fluorescence intensity staining suggesting that 7, 8 -NP inhibited or scavenged oxLDL-dependent generation of superoxide. 7, 8 -NP also effectively inhibited oxLDL-induced PS externalisation to the outer membrane but failed to inhibit the oxLDL-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol. The labelling of oxLDL with DiI showed that 7, 8 -NP significantly inhibited the uptake of oxLDL. However, the inhibitory effect was only measured at non-toxic concentration of oxLDL. The ability of 7, 8 -NP to inhibit oxLDL uptake raised the possibility that 7, 8 -NP protective effect against oxLDL involved modulation of the scavenger receptors'expression in particular SRA and CD 36. The Western Blot analysis showed that incubation of HMDMs with 7, 8 -NP did not affect HMDMs' SRA protein expression. In 50 % of the experiments, it was demonstrated that certain isoforms of CD 36 protein were significantly down regulated by 7, 8 -NP suggesting that various factors might interact with 7, 8 -NP or CD 36. The ability of 7, 8 -NP to protect HMDMs from oxLDL-induced death provides further evidence that this antioxidant is secreted by HMDMs to protect them against the oxidative damage in the highly oxidative environment of atherosclerotic plaque...|$|R
