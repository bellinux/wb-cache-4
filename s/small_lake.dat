5|$|Scotch Run {{flows through}} the Scotch Valley. The stream flows over the lowest point between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain. Scotch Valley is {{relatively}} narrow, but becomes somewhat wider downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads. A pond or <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> {{is located at the}} stream's headwaters. A few patches of wetland on the National Wetlands Inventory are near the stream. It is flanked by a 100 year floodplain throughout its entire length.|$|E
5|$|The 300-seat {{restaurant}} at Kampoeng Rawa floats in a <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> and serves Indonesian dishes using locally produced ingredients, including catfish, gourami, and tilapia. Dishes included nasi goreng and mie goreng. Customers {{can sit in}} the main hall {{or one of the}} floating gazebos. All are floated by plastic drums, and to reach the main hall customers must use covered boats which are guided by a rope.|$|E
5|$|The <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> {{is a local}} {{favorite}} for fishing. Lake Winfield Scott is stocked with rainbow trout and also contains local species of warmwater fish such as largemouth bass and sunfish. Also on the lake are a boat ramp, boat dock and swimming area with a sand beach. The Forest Service allows only man-powered and electric-powered watercraft on the lake.|$|E

5|$|Indicated by {{artifacts}} {{found near}} Lake Sepasco, a <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> along NY308, the highway began its history in about 1685, {{when a group}} of Native Americans called the Sepasco built the Sepasco Trail; this trail ran from the Hudson River, eastward through modern-day Rhinebeck (then Sepasco or Sepascoot), and ended at Lake Sepasco, following roughly Route308 and its side roads. The trail remained until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike — also known as the Salisbury Turnpike — was chartered over the trail and extended from Salisbury, Connecticut to the Susquehanna River at or near the Town of Jericho (now Bainbridge).|$|E
5|$|NY333 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with CR11 and CR24 in Risingville, an isolated hamlet within the Steuben County town of Thurston. It headed eastward, following Michigan Creek along {{the base of}} a valley surrounding the waterway. Due to the terrain of the area, NY333 intersected only a handful of roads, one of which was Cranberry Lake Road (CR2), a north–south highway that met NY333 midway between the hamlets of Risingville and Thurston. The route continued onward, turning northeastward toward Thurston Pond and the small hamlet of Thurston at {{the eastern edge of the}} <b>small</b> <b>lake.</b> Here, NY333 curved back to the east as it met Savona–Thurston Road (CR12) in the western half of the community.|$|E
5|$|NY99 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY30 {{west of the}} hamlet of Duane Center {{in the town of}} Duane. The route headed eastward as the Port Kent–Hopkinton Turnpike, passing through the small community of Duane Center before entering an isolated, wooded area of Franklin County and Adirondack Park. At the Franklin town line, NY99 curved southeastward, roughly paralleling Hatch Brook as it climbed up the northeastern portion of Baldface Mountain. Past the mountain's summit, the route continued onward, winding its way southward along Hatch Brook to a <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> known as Duck Pond.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the {{wilderness}} area, {{is one of}} the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one <b>small</b> <b>lake,</b> Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.|$|E
5|$|Póvoa de Varzim's most {{relevant}} garden squares are Praça do Almada (19th century) and Praça Luiz de Camões (20th century). Near the A28 motorway, {{there are three}} small parks: Espaço Agros, Argivai Picnic Park (Parque de Merendas de Argivai), and Travessa de Calves Green Space. Espaço Agros is a private-sponsored park with 22 hectare in the former Anjo woodland. This woodland was damaged by the construction of high speed roads {{in the beginning of}} the 1990s. Agros kept the essential rural setting, with some landscaping and environmental improvements, including a <b>small</b> <b>lake.</b> This is also the location of the city-owned Picnic Park, used for Easter Monday picnics.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish commanders {{had decided}} they {{must try to}} make a stand. A few {{kilometers}} west of Nyborg the Swedish forces of about 5,500 men stood in battle formation {{in the way of the}} advancing forces. The Swedes had a good position, with a <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> on the left flank and a forest on the right, providing good cover for a retreat to Nyborg should it be necessary. Opposing them were 9,000 men, with Eberstein in command that day. They divided into two lines, each commanded by the respective commanders. Thrice Eberstein attacked; only to be rebuffed by intensive Swedish fire and cavalry attacks. Eberstein himself was almost captured, only narrowly escaping.|$|E
50|$|The {{source of}} the river, Beaufort Lake, is the last and largest {{in a series of}} three <b>small</b> <b>lakes.</b> Ruth Lake is fed by Nestoria Creek from the west and Canal Town Creek from the south. The outflow from a series of <b>smaller</b> <b>lakes</b> to the east, Coon Lake, Middle Lake, and Trout Lake enters Ruth Lake from the northeast. George Lake lies between Ruth Lake and Beaufort Lake.|$|R

5|$|The {{eruption}} produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> {{that was}} observed in Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.|$|E
5|$|Indicated by {{artifacts}} recovered {{close to}} the road in Milan and in other areas along the Hudson River, the earliest inhabitants of the northern Dutchess County region were the Mohicans, a Native American nation, about 3,000years ago. The range of the Mohicans extended from northern Dutchess County to {{the southern tip of}} Lake Champlain, and from the Catskill Mountains to the Berkshires in Massachusetts. The total population of the Mohicans was estimated at 8,000 during the time of first contact with the Europeans, although only 800 remained after the American Revolution. Artifacts were also recovered along the shore of Lake Sepasco—a <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> NY308 passes near its ending terminus. Those artifacts recovered included ancient arrowheads, and are now on display at the Museum of Rhinebeck History.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a <b>small</b> <b>lake</b> about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

5|$|Flooding was {{considered}} worst in Puebla, {{and were the}} worst floods in about 400years, according to newspaper reports. A total of 21,342people evacuated their houses to 116shelters, mostly in the state's northern portion. The floods affected 16,511houses and 199schools. In Teziutlán, {{with a population of}} about 50,000, it is estimated the city received nearly half of its annual rainfall in about three days. Nine entire communities became isolated due to the floods, and the small village of Patla sustained heavy damage after the Necaxa River changed its course closer to the town. Widespread landslides occurred, including over 80 in Teziutlán alone; one mudslide there destroyed 80houses. Some of the landslides occurred along rivers and produced new lakes, but 85% of these broke within the first year. Population growth, primarily in Teziutlán and Zaragoza, occurred in landslide-prone areas along mountains. Along Sierra Norte de Puebla, deforestation contributed to additional landslides. A landslide covered the Zacatepec River near Zempoala, creating a natural dam and a <b>small</b> <b>lake.</b> Mudslides buried at least 16people at a school in Pantepec, and a deforested hill caused a landslide in the Indigenous village of Acalama, which covered up to 170people. Most had fled to a church that was also covered, and it is estimated that only 30people survived in the village. Statewide, 263people were killed, including 107 in Teziutlán who were buried by mudslides, becoming the worst disaster {{in the history of the}} town. In the village of Tetela de Ocampo, 31people died. In Puebla, 30,000people were injured, and 81 municipalities sustained damage, with statewide damage estimated at about $240million (2.1billion pesos).|$|E
5|$|On 19January Rewa {{started to}} affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However {{it did not}} make its {{predicted}} landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100km (60mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain, leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore {{the brunt of the}} wind, while on Heron Island, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over 144mm (5.7in) in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's flood water and got trapped in a storm drain. Within Brisbane, 100homes and 20cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after the Gabba resembled a <b>small</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
