5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E
50|$|The media {{narrative}} of a <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> highlighting egregious offenses as typical behavior of any <b>sex</b> <b>offender,</b> and media distorting {{the facts of}} some cases, has led legislators to attack judicial discretion, making <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> registration mandatory based on certain listed offenses rather than individual risk or the actual severity of the crime, thus practically catching less serious offenders under the domain of harsh <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> laws.|$|R

McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area. DNA that had been found on Yeates' body was tested for a potential profile. Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred registered <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals' whereabouts on 17 December.|$|E

In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry, and another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year.

5|$|The {{theoretical}} concerns surrounding throffers {{have been}} practically applied concerning workfare programmes. In such systems, individuals receiving social welfare have their aid decreased if they refuse {{the offer of}} work or education. Robert Goodin criticised workfare programmes which presented throffers to individuals receiving welfare, and was responded to by Daniel Shapiro, who found his objections unconvincing. Several writers have also observed that throffers presented to people convicted of crimes, particularly <b>sex</b> <b>offenders,</b> can result in more lenient sentences if they accept medical treatment. Other examples are offered by psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez, who presents concerns about throffers in community psychiatry, and management expert John J.

5|$|As a maximum-security prison, it hosts {{dangerous}} {{as well as}} highly dangerous criminals, such as rapists, murderers, and child molesters.

There is also a special unit (C8) focused on addiction recovery. Most inmates live in Units B and C, which are freer and have mixed cell blocks. Halden Prison receives both domestic and international criminals; as only around three-fifths of the prisoners are Norwegians (as of 2015), both Norwegian and English are used, and the prison has English teachers. However, fluency in Norwegian is a requirement to live in C8, because group and individual counseling is conducted in Norwegian.|$|E

She was responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, as SB 232 on November 4, 2008. Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts, create a childhood and family learning center, couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones, allow police to suspend driver's licenses of teenagers with problems at school, and create a state-run internet database providing information on the quality of health care providers. Mount was responsible for legislation that made Louisiana water fluoridation mandatory, and, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee, Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform.|$|E

Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery.

Alaska Justice Forum 25 (1 – 2) : 2 – 5 (Spring/Summer 2008). ([URL] paper provides a look at the parameters of the Alaska’s <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> registration statute. At the time of its enactment in 1994, the Alaska <b>Sex</b> <b>Offender</b> Registration Act {{was one of the most}} stringent in the U. S., far exceeding the miniumum requirements imposed on the states by the federal Jacob Wetterling Act. The federal Adam Walsh Child Protection Act, signed into law in 2006, has the net effect of bringing all the states closer to Alaska’s registration and publication requirements. However, Alaska’s statute and its federal counterpart were based on assumptions about <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> recidivism and the effectiveness of <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> treatment which are contradicted by much of the research conducted since creation of Alaska’s <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> registry. Empirical evidence also shows that Alaska’s <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> registration and notification system and others like it do not demonstrably serve their stated purpose of increasing public safety. The severity of the registration requirements may prohibit the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community, and the increasing burden on law enforcement to monitor and maintain very broad registries may prevent police from focusing on the more serious sexual predators...|$|R
