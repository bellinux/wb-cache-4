5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E

25|$|At that time, {{the city}} of Turin had a {{population}} of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside {{in search of a}} better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and market places. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief Memoires.|$|E

In this wildly expensive failure, it’s possible to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of NBC's flaws, all in the same package." [...] However, she was pleased the show's production for featuring contestants who were [...] "friendly" [...] and [...] "relatable," [...] rather than [...] "chosen for their reprehensibility."

500|$|Ernest was {{fortunate}} in {{his support of}} victorious Prussia; many other petty German dukes, princes, and kings who had supported Austria suffered immensely at Hohenzollern hands. Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, and Nassau for instance were all annexed to Prussia {{at the expense of}} their respective rulers. Though he had only recently changed his political views, Ernest was allowed to ride at the head of his battalion during the victory parade. His eldest niece Prussian Crown Princess Victoria ("Vicky") was for one pleased with his Prussian support and commented [...] "I am not accustomed to hearing so much praise of Coburg here. [...] was not among the crushed and beaten foe, it is sad enough as it is to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of one's friends suffering from the effects of their miscalculations". Victoria's husband Crown Prince Frederick was also pleased with Ernest's decision, writing in his journal 28 September 1871, that the duke's [...] "society always affords me peculiar pleasure, especially...when his heart beats so warmly for Germany".|$|E
500|$|In 1576, in a {{move that}} {{endangered}} Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown. On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the Edict of Beaulieu. The treaty became known as the Peace of Monsieur because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown. Francis died of consumption in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred. Catherine wrote, the next day: [...] "I am so wretched to live long enough to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us." [...] The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under Salic law, by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.|$|E

2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way.
