40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} the biomechanical strength of two all suture anchors (ASA) of reduced diameter (1. 4 mm) and compared {{them with the}} standard <b>screw</b> <b>anchor</b> (SA) with larger diameter (5. 5 mm) used in rotator cuff tears. METHODS: We conducted 30 uniaxial vertical pullout tests using Material Testing System Instron 5566 A until failure of the anchorage defined as rupture of the threads or anchor or detachment of the anchor. Anchor fixation was on tuberosities of fresh bovine humerus bone. ASAs were spaced four millimetres apart and were compared with a control SA implanted on the same greater tubercle at two centimetres. The tests were all performed at room temperature in a dry environment. Tensile loads (10 mm/min) were applied parallel to the axis of insertion. A preloading of 10 N was used to overcome loading artifacts of the test sample {{at the beginning of}} the test. RESULTS: Student's t test showed no statistically significant difference between anchors in terms of load to failure (ASA: force 265. 06 ± 87. 25 N versus SA : 325. 35 ± 113. 46 N; p = 0. 09) and mean elongation at rupture (ASA : 23 ± 7 mm versus SA : 21 ± 6 mm; p = 0. 46).

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the experimental investigations on the behaviour {{of a group}} of single, double and triple helical <b>screw</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded vertically at the same level in sand. The tests were carried out on one, two, three and four numbers of anchors in sand for different depths of embedment keeping shallow and deep mode of behaviour in mind. The testing program included 48 tests conducted on three model anchors installed in sand whose density kept constant throughout the tests. It was observed that the ultimate pullout load varied significantly with the installation depth of the anchor and the number of anchors. The apparent coefficient of friction (f*) between anchor and soil was also calculated based on the test results. It was found that the apparent coefficient of friction varies between 1. 02 and 4. 76 for 1, 2, 3 and 4 numbers of single, double and triple helical <b>screw</b> <b>anchors.</b> Plate load tests conducted on model soil showed that the value of ф increases from 35 o for virgin soil to 48 o for soil with four double <b>screw</b> helical <b>anchors.</b> The graphs of ultimate pullout capacity {{of a group of}} two, three and four no. of anchors with respect to one anchor were plotted and design equations have been proposed correlating them.

40|$|For {{capacity}} evaluation, {{the structural}} assessment of existing structures is necessary. Concrete strength {{is an important}} parameter for such assessment. Non-destructive tests (NDTs) are used along with the traditional approach of core testing for strength assessment of concrete in existing structures. The low reliability of NDT results leads to uncertainty in assessing concrete strength. A new method of non-destructive testing is {{presented in this paper}} with the aim of achieving better reliability and reducing uncertainty in the assessment of mortar strength. This approach is based on a modified pullout of post-installed <b>screw</b> <b>anchors.</b> The technique involves a pushin mechanism for a steel screw inside the mortar where a void underneath the screw is left to allow for the uninterrupted movement of the screw inside the concrete. The failure pattern involves local crushing of concrete between the threads of the screw.

40|$|Conventionally, {{noncompliance}} distal {{movement of}} molars relies exclusively on intraoral anchorage. The distal screw, a distal jet appliance supplemented by two paramedian mini-implants, is an innovative alternative. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the suitability of this device to move molars bodily and distally. The effects of the distal screw were evaluated in a sample of 18 consecutively treated preadolescent and adolescent individuals (nine females and nine males; mean age at the start of treatment, 11. 2 years). Two conical mini-implants (length 11. 0 mm, diameter 1. 5 to 2. 2 mm) were placed in the anterior paramedian area of the palate of each patient. The coil springs of the device were activated to deliver a force of 240 cN per side. The dental and skeletal effects were investigated on pre- and posttreatment cephalometric radiographs. The distal screw produced a Class I occlusion of the first molars by moving them distally 4. 7 mm, which is more than conventional appliances can accomplish. Although this took longer than conventional devices (9. 1 months), it had the advantage of a roughly 2. 1 -mm premolar distal movement (ie, no anchorage loss as with traditional techniques).

40|$|Introduction: The cranioplasty is a {{classical}} surgical procedure to repair large skull defects. The prosthesis fracture was one rare complication following cranioplasty, {{which was only}} known to happen in traumatic head injury or child growing skull. Presentation of case: In the current report, we documented the first reported case of cranioplasty prosthesis fracture in an adult neurological trauma patient at the proximal pterion point region without head trauma. During the first cranioplasty, due to the cerebromalacia at temporal lobe, patient’s temporalis muscle was not stripped from the dura mater and the prosthesis was anchored outside the temporalis muscle. Thus, no screw was used for anchoring the prosthesis at the basitemporal skull. The prosthesis fracture was observed on 12 th-month post-surgically at the proximal pterion point region. During the second cranioplasty, the temporalis muscle was semi-partitioned from the back due to cerebromalacia recovery and five screws were used to anchor the prosthesis onto the basitemporal skull. The follow-up result was unremarkable on 21 st-month post-second-cranioplasty. Discussion: A dynamic load was generated on the prosthesis due to head-pillow contact during sleeping. Via the parietal tuber-temporozygomatic suture line, this inward load generates an outward force at the proximal pterion point region, where became a shearing force locating just right below the lowest <b>screw</b> <b>anchoring</b> in this region. This shearing force eventually led to prosthesis fracture at the proximal pterion point due to the fatigue effect. Conclusion: This case presented the importance of prosthesis anchoring location on the skull, especially when temporalis muscle was required to be preserved due to clinical necessity...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} fractionator {{designed for}} {{more efficient and}} accurate separation of medium and fine silt frac-tions from soils and unconsolidated geological sediments i described. Directions are given for its construction and use, including a scaled drawing and photograph of the apparatus. Fractionation of soils and unconsolidated geo-logical sediments into particle-size separates for subsequent mineralogical analysis is a laborious and time consuming procedure. A sliding-base mechanical fractionator that permits more effi-cient and accurate separation of medium and fine (20 - 5 ~ and 5 - 2 #, respectively) silt fractions from unconsolidated sediments has been de-veloped. For the coarse silt (50 - 20 /z) fraction, the unit developed by Beavers and Jones (1962, p. 303 - 304) is satisfactory and efficient. However, be-cause of long sedimentation times, this unit is too time consuming when separating the medium and fine silt fractions. In {{order to reduce the}} sedimentation time but retain the same prin-ciple of operation, the design was modified so the unit could be placed under a centrifugal force. The fractionator developed is shown in figures 1 and 2. The apparatus consists of a plexiglas cylinder mounted on a plexiglas slide, the latter being held under pressure against a teflon plate by two adjustable plexiglas slide clamps. The teflon plate is cemented to the slide base with a Flurocarbon teflon bonding kit and fixed in place with 10 flathead brass screws.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{subsidence}} displacement after cyclic loading among 4 sacral pedicle screw fixations of bicortical, tricortical, standard polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation, and sub-endplate PMMA augmentation in osteoporotic condition. Summary of background data: Implant failure caused by screw loosening is a clinical problem for lumbosacral fusions, especially in osteoporotic patients. To improve sacral <b>screw</b> <b>anchoring</b> strength, the main fixation techniques {{need to be}} evaluated biomechanically. Methods: For this study, 11 fresh osteoporotic cadaver sacra were harvested and bone mineral density was measured with dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry. A 7 mm diameter monoaxial pedicle screw (S 1) was randomly assigned by side (left vs. right) and placed bicortically or tricortically. The 2 screws, followed 2000 cyclic compression loading of 30 to 250 N, were removed. The screw tracts were filled up with PMMA, then, screws 5 mm shorter than the bicortical or tricortical fixation were reinserted (defined as standard and sub-endplate PMMA augmented sacral screw fixations, respectively). The PMMA augmented screws were then retested as before. Screw subsidence displacement after 2000 cyclic loading was measured and compared. Results: The average bone mineral density of 11 specimens was 0. 71 g/cm, ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 78 g/cm. No significant difference of subsidence displacement was detected between tricortical and standard PMMA augmented screws (P> 0. 05), however, the 2 fixations exhibited markedly less subsidence than bicortical screw (P< 0. 05). Sub-endplate PMMA augmented screw showed the least subsidence among all the screws (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: PMMA augmentation can increase the bonding strength of sacral screw-bone interface and the sub-endplate PMMA augmented sacral screw could obtain the highest stability among the 4 fixation techniques in osteoporotic condition. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionDual {{mobility}} cups {{are especially}} indicated in total hip replacement revision, {{the risk of}} recurrent instability being greater than in primary surgery.

Patients and methodsTwenty three patients were operated on by the same surgeon between January 1999 and December 2006 and prospectively followed up to a mean 4 ½ years (range, 2 – 10 yrs). A Collégia™ cup (Wright Medical France, Créteil, France) was impacted in 23 total hip arthroplasty acetabular component revisions, including 17 cases of SOFCOT grade- 1 bone-stock loss and six of grade 2. ResultsThere were six clinically poor results on the Merle D’Aubigné scale. One case of early migration occurred, in a multioperated acetabulum. There was one isolated dislocation and one recurrent dislocation associated with loose greater trochanter nonunion, but tolerated as it was infrequent. DiscussionThis option simplifies revision surgery and limits the risk of dislocation if the abductor muscles unit is continuous. It is indicated when local bone-site compromise encompass a wall-contained cavitary defect at most.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report open {{reduction}} and joint stabilization using a prosthetic capsule technique {{for treatment of}} a craniodorsal coxofemoral luxation in a lightweight pony. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical report. ANIMALS: Pony stallion (8 years old, 113 kg). METHODS: A craniodorsal approach to the coxofemoral joint was performed under general anesthesia. After open reduction, a prosthetic capsule technique was used. Four 3. 5 mm self-tapping cortical <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> were implanted: 2 screws were inserted above the cranial aspect of the dorsal acetabular rim, and 2 screws were inserted into the femoral neck. Subsequently, a # 5 USP ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene suture was placed through these <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> in figure- 8 fashion {{to serve as a}} prosthetic capsule. Routine closure and a medial patellar desmotomy completed the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the pony was cross tied for 4 weeks to prevent it from lying down. RESULTS: Neither short-term nor long-term complications occurred and the pony was sound at the follow-up examination performed 15 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: A prosthetic capsule technique can be used successfully to stabilize the coxofemoral joint after open reduction of a craniodorsal luxation in a lightweight pony...|$|R
50|$|Being able {{to degrade}} into {{innocuous}} lactic acid, PLA {{is used as}} medical implants {{in the form of}} <b>anchors,</b> <b>screws,</b> plates, pins, rods, and as a mesh. Depending on the exact type used, it breaks down inside the body within 6 months to 2 years. This gradual degradation is desirable for a support structure, because it gradually transfers the load to the body (e.g. the bone) as that area heals. The strength characteristics of PLA and PLLA implants are well documented.|$|R
