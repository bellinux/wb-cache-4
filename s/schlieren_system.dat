The warm air rising from the second candle provided the schliere.The conventional <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> is credited mostly to German physicist August Toepler, though Jean Bernard Léon Foucault invented the method in 1859 that Toepler improved upon. Toepler's original system was designed to detect schlieren in glass used to make lenses. In the conventional <b>schlieren</b> <b>system,</b> a point source is used to illuminate the test section containing the schliere. An image of this light is formed using a converging lens (also called a schlieren lens). This image {{is located at the}} conjugate distance to the lens according to the thin lens equation: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{classical}} {{implementation of}} an optical <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> uses {{light from a}} single collimated source shining on, or from behind, a target object. Variations in refractive index caused by density gradients in the fluid distort the collimated light beam. This distortion creates a spatial variation in {{the intensity of the}} light, which can be visualised directly with a shadowgraph system.|$|E

50|$|The {{major element}} of the tunnel complex is its drive system, {{consisting}} of four intercoupled electric motors. The transonic wind tunnel is a closed-return, variable density tunnel with a fixed geometry, ventilated throat, and a single-jack flexible nozzle. Airflow is produced by a three-stage, axial-flow compressor powered by four-wound-rotor, variable-speed induction motors. For conventional steady-state tests, models are generally supported on a string. A <b>Schlieren</b> <b>system,</b> one that allows regions of varying refraction in a transparent medium caused by pressure or temperature differences and detectable by photographing {{the passage of a}} beam of light, is available for studying flow patterns, either by direct viewing or by photographs.|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} schlieren photography, the {{collimated light}} is focused with a converging optical element (usually a lens or curved mirror), and a knife-edge is {{placed at the}} focal point, positioned to block about half the light. In flow of uniform density this will simply make the photograph half as bright. However, in flow with density variations the distorted beam focuses imperfectly, and parts which have been focused in an area covered by the knife-edge are blocked. The result {{is a set of}} lighter and darker patches corresponding to positive and negative fluid density gradients in the direction normal to the knife-edge. When a knife-edge is used, the system is generally referred to as a <b>schlieren</b> <b>system,</b> which measures the first derivative of density {{in the direction of the}} knife-edge. If a knife-edge is not used, the system is generally referred to as a shadowgraph system, which measures the second derivative of density.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic idea}} is that the {{illumination}} pattern is imaged onto a geometrically congruent cutoff pattern (essentially a multiplicity of knife edges) with focusing optics, while density gradients lying between the illumination pattern and the cutoff pattern are imaged, typically by a camera system. As in classical schlieren, the distortions produce regions of brightening or darkening corresponding to the position and direction of the distortion, because they redirect rays either away from or onto the opaque part of the cutoff pattern. While in classical schlieren, distortions over the whole beam path are visualized equally, in focusing schlieren, only distortions in the object field of the camera are clearly imaged. Distortions away from the object field become blurred, so this technique allows some degree of depth selection. It also has the advantage that a wide variety of illuminated backgrounds can be used, since collimation is not required. This allows construction of projection-based focusing <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems</b> which are much easier to build and align than classical <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems.</b> The requirement of collimated light in classical schlieren is often a substantial practical barrier for constructing large systems due to the need for the collimating optic to be {{the same size as the}} field of view. Focusing <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems</b> can use compact optics with a large background illumination pattern, which is particularly easy to produce with a projection system. For systems with large demagnification, the illumination pattern needs to be around twice the size of the field of view to allow for defocusing of the background pattern.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 20th century, R.A. Burton {{developed}} an alternative form of schlieren photography {{which is now}} usually called focusing schlieren or lens and grid schlieren, based on a suggestion by Hubert Schardin. Focusing <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems</b> generally retain the characteristic knife edge to produce contrast, but instead of using collimated light and a single knife edge, they use an illumination pattern of repeated edges with a focusing imaging system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> {{with high}} {{time and space}} {{resolution}} was developed to diagnose the hypersonic flow field with high speed, low density and intensive shock interactions. The key technique of color filter used for color schlieren was developed. The time resolution reached to 100 ns and the space resolution reached to 0. 1 mm. In shock tunnel with Mach 5, bow shock controlled by single laser pulse was investigated with the <b>schlieren</b> <b>system,</b> and the interaction of oblique shocks generated by double ramps was detected with color schlieren. The complex flow fields are clearly exploded, which proves that the <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> designed in this paper supplies an efficient method in the diagnostics of hypersonic flow field...|$|E
30|$|Because of {{the double}} folding, the {{parabolic}} mirrors in Fig.  1 d appear to both be tilted in the same direction, but they are actually tilted toward {{opposite sides of the}} parallel schlieren beam. There is a tendency to tilt PM 1 to the other side, making a <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> of “Ω-type.” This is unwise, though, because it doubles rather than cancels the astigmatic aberration of the <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> [16, 22].|$|E

40|$|The {{photochromic}} {{property of}} bacteriorhodopsin films is exploited {{in the application}} of a focusing <b>schlieren</b> optical <b>system</b> for the visualization of optical phase information. By encoding an image on the film with light of one wavelength and reading out with a different wavelength, the readout beam can effectively see the photographic negative of the original image. The potential advantage of this system over previous focusing <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems</b> is that the updatable nature of the bacteriorhodopsin film allows system adaptation. I discuss two image encoding and readout techniques for the bacteriorhodopsin and use film transmission characteristics to choose the more appropriate method.

40|$|Schlieren {{techniques}} are valuable tools for the {{qualitative and quantitative}} visualizations of flows {{in a wide range}} of scientific and engineering disciplines. A large number of <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed and documented in the literature; majority of applications involve flows of gases, typically air. In this work, a schlieren technique is applied to visualize the buoyancy-induced flow inside vertical ribbed channels using water as convective fluid. The test section consists of a vertical plate made of two thin sheets of chrome-plated copper with a foil heater sandwiched between them; the external sides of the plate are roughened with transverse, square-cross-sectioned ribs. Two parallel vertical walls, smooth and unheated, form with the heated ribbed plate two adjacent, identical and asymmetrically heated, vertical channels. Results include flow schlieren visualizations with colour-band filters, reconstructions of the local heat transfer coefficient distributions along the ribbed surfaces and comparisons with past experiments performed using air as working flui...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop an optical method of leak detection. Various modifications of schlieren optics were explored with initial emphasis on leak detection of the plumbing within the orbital maneuvering system of the space shuttle (OMS pod). The schlieren scheme envisioned for OMS pod leak detection was that of a high contrast pattern on flexible reflecting material imaged onto a negative of the same pattern. We find that the OMS pod geometry constrains the characteristic length scale of the pattern to the order of 0. 001 inch. Our experiments suggest that optical modulation transfer efficiency will be very low for such patterns, which will limit the sensitivity of the technique. Optical elements which allow a negative of the scene to be reversibly recorded using light from the scene itself were explored for their potential in adaptive single-ended <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems.</b> Elements studied include photochromic glass, bacteriorhodopsin, and a transmissive liquid crystal display. The dynamics of writing and reading patterns were studied using intensity profiles from recorded images. Schlieren detection of index gradients in air was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{reflective}} focused <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> {{that was}} developed {{for use in the}} 10 - by 10 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel (10 x 10 SWT) at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field as part of the Unstart Test Program was improved this past year. In April 1999, the development and use of the system was presented at the Supersonic Tunnel Association International in Bedford, England. A focused <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> is similar to a standard <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> in that shock waves coming from an object in supersonic flow can be seen using a standard video camera. Unlike the standard <b>schlieren</b> <b>system,</b> which produces a two-dimensional schlieren image, a focused <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> can produce a threedimensional image. The preceding drawing shows the components of the reflective focused <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> being developed for use in the 10 x 10 SWT. Although the system worked well for the Unstart Test Program, it was not sensitive enough to be classified as a facility capability. Therefore, a program was implemented to improve the sensitivity of the reflective focused <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> so that it could be a facility capability for Glenn's 10 x 10 SWT. Several techniques were implemented to increase the sensitivity and to improve the overall operation of the system. These included refinement of the source grid, improvement in the cutoff grid production, improvement of the source grid and cutoff grid alignment, installation of an improved light source, and incorporation of an image-enhancing system. These changes are being implemented with the system set up in the laboratory. A checkout test of the system is planned in the 10 x 10 SWT in March 2000. Of these techniques, the most developed is the refinement of the source grid. The original system had a pattern of -in. by -in. squares on -in. centers (distance between the center points of adjacent squares). This gave a ratio of light to dark (reflective to nonreflective area) of 3 : 1. The recommended ratio is 1 : 1. In order to accomplish this, a pattern of -in. -diameter dots on 3 / 8 -in. centers was developed. Preliminary tests with this pattern showed an increase in system sensitivity and image clarity. Further testing and refinement are scheduled. The former and improved dot patterns are shown. The use of glass plates to produce the cutoff grid improved the cutoff grid's quality and helped to align it with the source grid. The cutoff grid, which is the negative of the source grid, is made by exposing photography film (or glass plates) to the proper light while it is installed in the focused <b>schlieren</b> <b>system.</b> The exposed film or plate is removed from the system and then developed as a photograph negative. Because the glass plates are rigid, they eliminate the risk of distortion when the negative is reinstalled in the system and realigned with the source grid...|$|E

30|$|The folded z-type <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> is {{especially}} useful for {{looking through the}} windows of a test facility such as a wind tunnel (indicated by a dashed outline in Fig.  1 c, d). Wind tunnels tend to be housed in long narrow rooms, the narrow dimension necessitating the folding of schlieren optics. In extreme cases the parallel schlieren beam can be folded twice, as shown in Fig.  1 d. Such a compact <b>schlieren</b> <b>system</b> serves the transonic wind tunnel of DLR Göttingen, for example, where it is entirely inside the pressure plenum of the facility. Note that the large first-surface folding mirrors FM 1 and FM 2 must be flat to better than ¼ wavelength of light across their surfaces. They may cost as much or more than the parabolic mirrors.|$|E

50|$|A {{third major}} type of schlieren {{photography}} relies measuring or visualizing shifts in focused images. In these techniques, {{the background and}} the schlieren object (the distortion to be visualized) are both in focus and the distortion is detected because it moves part of the background image relative to its original position. Because of this focus requirement, {{they tend to be}} used for large-scale applications where both the schlieren object and the background are distant (typically beyond the hyperfocal distance of the optical system). Since these systems require no additional optics aside from a camera, they are often the simplest to construct but they are usually not as sensitive as other types of <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems,</b> with the sensitivity being limited by the camera resolution. The technique also requires a suitable background image. In some cases, the background may be provided by the experimenter, such as a random speckle pattern or sharp line, but naturally occurring features such as landscape or even the edge of the Sun have been used. Background-oriented schlieren is most often performed using software techniques such as digital image correlation and optical flow analysis to perform synthetic schlieren, but it is possible to achieve the same effect in streak imaging with an analog optical system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The interrelationship between {{variables}} {{involved in}} focusing <b>schlieren</b> <b>systems</b> is fairly well understood, however how changing the variables affects the resultant images is not. In addition, modified grids and arrangements, such as two dimensional, colour and retroreflective systems {{have never been}} directly compared to a standard system. The existing theory is developed from first principles to its current state. An apparatus was specifically designed to test grid and arrangement issues while keeping the system geometry, optical components and the test object identical. Source grid line spacing and clear line width to dark line width ratio were varied to investigate the limits of diffraction and banding and to find an optimum grid for this apparatus. Two dimensional, colour, retroreflective and a novel projected arrangement were then compared to this optimum case. In conclusion, the diffraction limit is accurately modelled by the mathematical equations. The banding limit is slightly less well modelled as additional factors seem to affect the final image. Inherent problems with the two dimensional and colour systems indicate that while they can be useful, they are not worth developing further though chromatism in the system meant that colour systems were not fully investigated. The retroreflective and projected systems have the most potential for large scale use and should be developed further...|$|R
