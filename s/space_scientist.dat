5|$|Moonraker is a 1979 British spy {{film and}} the {{eleventh}} in the James Bond series {{to be produced}} by Eon Productions, and the fourth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The third and final film in the series to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, it co-stars Lois Chiles, Michael Lonsdale, Corinne Cléry, and Richard Kiel. Bond investigates the theft of a space shuttle, leading him to Hugo Drax, {{the owner of the}} shuttle's manufacturing firm. Along with <b>space</b> <b>scientist</b> Dr. Holly Goodhead, Bond follows the trail from California to Venice, Rio de Janeiro, and the Amazon rainforest, and finally into outer space to prevent a plot to wipe out the world population and to re-create humanity with a master race.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a {{scientist}} after becoming {{a member of the}} Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned <b>space</b> <b>scientist.</b> In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of <b>space</b> <b>scientist</b> Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E

25|$|With the Ministry of Human Resource Development giving {{its green}} signal {{for setting up}} of an IIT in Dharwad, the 17-year long wait ended. It was the late Union Human Resources Development Minister, S. R. Bommai, who had moved the {{proposal}} to the Centre seeking an IIT in Dharwad in the 1990s. In 1998, a committee headed by former ISRO chairman and <b>space</b> <b>scientist</b> U R Rao submitted its report recommending an IIT in Hubballi-Dharwad. In the 2015-16 union budget, an IIT was sanctioned for Karnataka state and the state government suggested three locations for IIT in Karnataka. The short listed cities were Dharwad, Mysuru and Raichur. The high powered committee appointed by the HRD ministry chose Dharwad city, after visiting all the three short listed cities. Leaders from all political parties, plus a few prominent citizens, including a few ex-NRIs from Dharwad city {{put a lot of}} efforts to get this prestigious institute to Dharwad city, as {{there was a lot of}} competition among cities to get this premier institute of technology.|$|E

500|$|In late 2012, {{researchers}} reported that particle {{data from the}} spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause. Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles (above 70 MeV), which {{are thought to be}} cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the Solar System, with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August. At the same time, in late August, there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles, which are thought to originate from the Sun. Ed Roelof, <b>space</b> <b>scientist</b> at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft declared that [...] "Most scientists involved with Voyager 1 would agree that [...] have been sufficiently satisfied." [...] However, the last criterion for officially declaring that Voyager 1 had crossed the boundary, the expected change in magnetic field direction (from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond), had not been observed (the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees), which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged. On December 3, 2012, Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology said, [...] "Voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there. We're still inside, apparently. But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside. So it's like a highway letting particles in and out." [...] The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than Voyager 1 encountered before the termination shock. It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space.|$|E
