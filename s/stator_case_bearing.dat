50|$|The {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} (SRM) {{is a type of}} a stepper motor, an electric motor that runs by reluctance torque. Unlike common DC motor types, power is delivered to windings in the <b>stator</b> (<b>case)</b> rather than the rotor. This greatly simplifies mechanical design as power {{does not have to be}} delivered to a moving part, but it complicates the electrical design as some sort of switching system needs to be used to deliver power to the different windings. With modern electronic devices, precisely timed switching is not a problem, and the SRM is a popular design for modern stepper motors. Its main drawback is torque ripple. However, motor company Striatech developed controller technology that limits torque ripple with the same high torque at low speeds shown in switched reluctance.|$|R

30|$|Several hundred traps {{were laid}} that {{included}} pheromones as attractants {{for either the}} webbing clothes moth or less commonly the <b>case</b> <b>bearing</b> clothes moth.

The catch rate was 2.67 moths per trap where pheromone was present, as expected e.g. [9] much greater than the 0.065 moths per trap caught when it was absent; a more than thirty-fold increase in catch rate (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Some 29 % of the traps showed the presence of moths in the case of pheromone traps compared with 3.3 % presence {{in the absence of the}} pheromone. This situation was repeated in the Southeast where the catch rate was 3.18 and 0.03 for the pheromone and non-pheromone traps (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Fewer pheromone traps were laid for the <b>case</b> <b>bearing</b> clothes moth and most of these were in the West.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is dynamic {{analysis}} of shaft of booster pump QHD- 200. In the beginning we offer basic equations generally used in dynamics and common/possible methods for their solution. Then we focus on specific problems connected with rotor dynamics and using simple Laval rotor we show their mathematical interpretation. Based on given load as accelerogram we create response spectrum in different ways (using different methods) and compare their CPU time demand. In the next part we make three finite element models of different physical level. We perform modal analysis and comparison of eigen frequencies, mode shapes. In following chapter transient analysis was performed on all models. As load we use accelerogram. We evaluate translations in particular positions of model. After that, we {{decide whether or not}} gap between impeller and <b>stator</b> <b>case</b> will be erased. Finally we make assessment of force acting upon bearings...|$|R

To investigate the IGHV mutational status impact on genetic lesions, this study combined single nucleotide polymorphism-arrays and IGHV sequencing in 83 cases. Clinical features and outcome were similar between U- and M-IGHV cases. Recurrent lesions frequency was higher in U-IGHV cases, including poor prognosticators.

40|$|A {{multiblock}} Navier-Stokes analysis {{code for}} turbomachinery has been modified to allow analysis of multistage turbomachines. A steady averaging-plane approach {{was used to}} pass information between blade rows. Characteristic boundary conditions written in terms of perturbations about the mean flow from the neighboring blade row were used to allow close spacing between the blade rows without forcing the flow to be axisymmetric. In this report the multiblock code is described briefly and the characteristic boundary conditions and the averaging-plane implementation are described in detail. Two approaches for averaging the flow properties are also described. A two-dimensional turbine <b>stator</b> <b>case</b> {{was used to compare}} the characteristic boundary conditions with standard axisymmetric boundary conditions. Differences were apparent but small in this low-speed case. The two-stage fuel turbine used on the space shuttle main engines was then analyzed using a three-dimensional averaging-plane approach. Computed surface pressure distributions on the stator blades and endwalls and computed distributions of blade surface heat transfer coefficient on three blades showed very good agreement with experimental data from two tests...|$|R

Finally, the results of classification for 540 flaw images are presented.|$|R
50|$|The {{pattern of}} {{repeated}} thefts and brief appearances on campus, {{as well as}} the receipt of letters and postcards from the cannon, continued from the 1970s until the present time (2007).

It's unclear that the cannon was actually taken to those places, though the shipping <b>case</b> <b>bearing</b> the cannon in 1994 did have Venezuelan customs seals on it. There's suspicion of university complicity in these later appearances and disappearances of the cannon; certainly the November 2007 appearance indicates that the cannon is under university control.|$|R

This rod is intended to slow forward motion of the firing pin (similarly to striking a live primer) to avoid breaking the firing pin by the abrupt stop within the bolt if no resistance was encountered within the chamber.|$|R
