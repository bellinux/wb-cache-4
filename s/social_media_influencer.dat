40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>media</b> is {{connecting}} individuals {{all over}} the world, where the power of interaction and information sharing has shifted from companies to consumers. Since companies now {{have a harder time}} reaching out to consumers, <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> have been used as a solution to influence the purchase decisions of consumers and thereby drive purchases. However, while <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> are said {{to have an impact on}} the purchase decisions of consumers, less is actually known about the influence on all stages of the purchase decision process. As the purchase decision is not solely based on its own but rather follows from a series of steps, also called the purchase decision process, more research based on this area is of importance. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to explore how consumers perceive the influence of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> during the different stages of the purchase decision process. In order to gather consumers’ perceptions about the influence of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers,</b> a qualitative study has been conducted where thoughts and experiences of participants have been studied. The findings of this study show that <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> ability to provide content, expertise, attractiveness, social identity and trust shows evidence of how the influence of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> play an important role in each and every stage of the purchase decision process of consumers. The implications of this thesis is that the study could be of use to companies who seek to engage in influencer marketing and want to better understand how <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> affect consumers. The original value of the study is that it acknowledges how the influence of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> affects all stages of the purchase decision process, as no previous study has explored this context...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Increasingly in today’s climate the way {{in which}} modern day {{companies}} communicate their brand messages to consumers has changed from the traditional method of using celebrities through endorsements to now using <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as a means to communicate the brands message. In that companies are now looking to utilise <b>social</b> <b>media</b> and <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> as a means of communication to their customers. It is increasingly becoming more and more popular for brands and companies to engage in this method of marketing as it could be seen as a more personalised approach to marketing. This concept of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> and <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers,</b> needs to be explored in regards to their effectiveness as a communications tool for customers especially around the areas of brand awareness, brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Aims and Objectives: The main aim of this dissertation was to investigate the relationship that <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> are having in regards to the formulation of brand attitudes, brand awareness and purchase intentions around particular brands for customers. This topic of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> and <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> has gained considerable traction in parts of Asia, however there has been a lack of significant research from a European perspective but more so an Irish perspective. Hence it was paramount to try and understand it from an Irish context. Methodology: In order to suitably investigate these particular topics, the appropriate methodology was undertaken based on certain criteria of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> such as the amount of followers they would have, their daily interactions on the different <b>social</b> <b>media</b> platforms and finally a relationship with companies in regards to the content they populate on their channels. The central method that was used was that of in-depth interviews. There was four interviews with <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers,</b> there was two male and two female. The interviews lasted between 45 - 90 minutes in length and they followed a semi-structured approach. Results and Findings: The results of the interviews were derived via a thematic analysis approach, by engaging in this level of analysis it conveyed some level of clarity in regards to the topics of brand awareness, brand attitudes and purchase intentions. In that the main underlying themes from the interview process were: 1. Advertising exposure 2. Consumer preferences 3. Personalised celebrity 4. Monetary value The connection was made how the themes of consumer preferences and personalised celebrity could be linked to the concept of brand attitudes. Furthermore, the theme of advertising exposure could be linked to brand awareness and finally the theme of monetary value was suitably linked to the topic of purchase intentions. Future recommendations: In the future, these topics should be discussed with brands themselves and the followers of these <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>influencers</b> by doing so it may give a revealing insight which could benefit marketing practices in the future. Furthermore, these topics should be explored in other European countries like that of the UK, France and Germany. As their cultures would be slightly different to that of Ireland and may also give revealing insights to brands and companies who are engaging in <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as communications tool...|$|R
