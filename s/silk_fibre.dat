Silk {{appears to be a}} promising fibre as a reinforcing agent in composite due to its mechanical properties consisting of a combination of high strength, high toughness, extensibility and compressibility. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of span length on the tensile properties of raw and alkali treated <b>silk</b> <b>fibres.</b> The fibres were characterized using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Tensile testing of raw and alkali treated <b>silk</b> <b>fibres</b> was carried out by varying span length. Newly developed equations were used to correct the Young’s modulus and strain to failure values. It is observed that tensile strength and strain to failure decreased, while Young’s modulus increased with an increase in span length of single fibre. This is because larger span length minimizes the slippage effect more compared to smaller span length. Alkali treated <b>silk</b> <b>fibres</b> had better tensile properties, smoother surface and lower thermal stability compared to raw <b>silk</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} composition or structure of glow-worm snares, or the extent of possible convergence between glow-worm and arachnid capture silks. We characterised Arachnocampa richardsae silk and mucus using X-ray scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. Silk but not mucus contained crystallites of the cross-beta-sheet type, which occur in unrelated insect silks but have not been reported previously in fibres used for prey capture. Mucus proteins were rich in Gly (28. 5 %) and existed in predominantly a random coil structure, typical of many adhesive proteins. In contrast, the <b>silk</b> <b>fibres</b> were unusually rich in charged and polar residues, particularly Lys (18. 1 %), which we propose is related to their use in a highly hydrated state. Comparison of X-ray scattering, infrared spectroscopy and amino acid analysis data suggests that <b>silk</b> <b>fibres</b> contain a high fraction of disordered protein. We suggest that in the native hydrated state, <b>silk</b> <b>fibres</b> are capable of extension via deformation of both disordered regions and cross-beta-sheet crystallites, and that high extensibility is an adaptation promoting successful prey capture.

However, their mechanical and biodegradable properties {{have not yet been}} fully understood by many researchers, scientists and bio-medical engineers although these properties would govern the usefulness of resultant products. Considering the increasing demand and potential use of biodegradable and bioresorbable polymers in coming centuries, elevated environmental awareness of the general public in reducing carbon footprints and non-naturally decomposed solid waste, as well as foreseeable drawbacks of using metallic materials for biomedical engineering, a comprehensive study on the mechanical and materials properties of a silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced Polylactic acid (PLA) composite is conducted through experimental and theoretical approaches in this project. Current study aims at investigating various properties of degummed and non- degummed silkworm silk fibres and, the effect on the mechanical and thermal properties and biodegradability of their reinforced PLA composites. An extensive review is provided to introduce the properties of the natural fibres and degradable polymers. Some critical issues including poor wettability, biodegradability and bonding properties at the fibre/matrix interface and, damage of the fibre during the manufacturing processes which are the main causes of the reduction of the composites‟ strength are addressed. Furthermore, different manufacturing processes and their suitability for natural fibre composites, based on the materials, mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres and matrics are discussed in detail. The potential applications on the degradable fibre reinforced polymer composites are also addressed. Following the comprehensive review, results obtained from preliminary experimental studies are given. The hybridization of a glass fibre reinforced composite is achieved by using short silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> as a medium to enhance its cross-ply strength. The comparison on the tensile and impact properties of the glass fibre composite reinforced by the short silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> with a neat glass fibre composite sample is conducted. Experimental results indicated that the higher Young's modulus and ductility index (DI) of a silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced glass fibre composite was obtained as compared with the neat sample. Moreover, the visual examination on drop-weight test samples proved that the impact resistance of the silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced glass fibre composite was better than that of the neat sample as well. Nevertheless, as the non-fully biodegradable issue rose from the ultilization of glass fabrics and resin, the combination of the silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> and a biodegradable polymer- PLA is chosen for the following study. Mechanical properties of different silkworm silk fibres including Bombyx mori, twisted Bombyx mori, and Tussah silk fibres were investigated. Their ultimate tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young's modulus were examined by performing a uniaxial tensile test on a single fibre. The apparent diameters of the silkworm silk fibres were measured for stress-strain analysis. Based on the experimental results, it was found that Tussah <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> has a relatively high extensibility as compared to Bombyx mori <b>silk</b> <b>fibre.</b> When producing a biodegradable silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PLA composite, hydrophilic sericin has been found to cause poor interfacial bonding with most polymers and thus, it results in affecting the resultant properties of the composite. Besides, a sericin layer on fibrils surface may also cause an adverse effect toward biocompatibility and hypersensitivity to silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> for implant applications. Therefore, degumming should be done for sericin removal. Different degumming processes and their influences on silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> are discussed. The effectiveness of degumming parameters including degumming time and temperature on Tussah silk by using boiling water are discussed. Based on the results obtained, {{it was found that the}} mechanical properties of Tussah silk are affected by the degumming time due to the change of fibre structure and fibrils alignment. It was also found that the degumming time has a little effect on the thermal properties and the secondary structure of the fibre. Besides, silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> was degummed by different concentrations of NaHCO 3 (Sodium Bicarbonate) solution to study its tensile properties. Measurement of weight loss, tensile property test and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis were conducted to elucidate the effect of NaHCO 3 to the fibre. Experimental results revealed that the disruption of hydrogen bonds (water effect) dominated the effect of the fibre at low NaHCO 3 concentration. Increasing the concentration of NaHCO 3 resulted in increasing the pH level and thus, distorted the binding force between fibrils of the fibre. DSC analysis revealed that the fibre degummed in the solution over 5 wt% NaHCO 3 requires higher energy for melt and thermal decomposition from their crystalline states. However, using NaHCO 3 would minimize the risk of damage of silkworm silk fibrils as compared with commonly used strong alkali solutions for degumming. A microbond test of the composite was conducted to investigate the bonding effect of the silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> with/ without the sericin layer. The results showed that the fibres degummed by both processes increased the interfacial shear strength. A novel biodegradable composite for biomedical engineering applications was developed by mixing chopped silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> and PLA through the injection moulding process. A study on the mechanical properties and biodegradability of a silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PLA composite was conducted. It was found that the Young's and flexural moduli of the composite increased with the use of silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> as reinforcement while their tensile and flexural strengths decreased. This phenomenon is attributed to the disruption of inter- and intra- molecular bonding on the silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> with PLA during the mixing process, and consequent reduction of the strength of the composite. Bio-degradability tests showed that the silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> altered the biodegradable properties of the composite as compared with a pristine PLA sample. The initial storage modulus of the composite increased while its glass transition temperature decreased as compared with the PLA sample. Besides, the coefficient of linear thermal expansions (CLTE) of the composite was reduced by 28 %. This phenomenon was attributed to the fibre-matrix interaction that restricted the mobility of polymer chains to adhere to the fibre surface, and consequently reduced the Tg and CLTE. As compared with the composite, it was found that the degraded composite exhibited lower initial storage modulus, loss modulus and tan delta (Tan(δ)) but the Tg had higher than that of a non-degraded sample. A linear, elastic and isotropic theoretical model to evaluate the differential stress between a core fibre and a sericin layer with different thicknesses of the layer is firstly introduced in this report. The influence of moisture absorption during the early degradation stage, on shear stress between the fibre and the sericin is also discussed. Finally, concluding remarks and the suggestions for the further study in the development of the silkworm <b>silk</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PLA composite for fracture bone fixator are addressed. ...|$|E
