50|$|The Internal Revenue <b>Service</b> <b>denies</b> {{tax-exempt status}} under the Internal Revenue Code to racially discriminatory private schools, and has {{established}} guidelines {{and procedures for}} determining whether a particular school is in fact racially nondiscriminatory. As a consequence, those private schools deemed by the IRS to be racially discriminatory are not eligible to receive tax deductible charitable contributions.|$|R
5000|$|Calhoun Academy (CA) {{was founded}} on December 30, 1969, as a {{segregation}} academy. [...] The school's racially discriminatory charter made it ineligible to operate as a tax-exempt charity organization. In 1985 CA changed its charter to allow non-white students to attend. The school applied for tax-exempt status in 1986. The Internal Revenue <b>Service</b> <b>denied</b> the school's application {{on the grounds that}} it had never, to that time, had a black student or teacher. This decision was upheld by the United States Tax Court in 1990.|$|E

The Internal Revenue <b>Service</b> <b>denied</b> the application under § 501(c)(3), because it appeared that a substantial part of the corporation's activities would consist of attempting to influence legislation, which is not permitted by § 501(c)(3).|$|E

5000|$|... 2 Million Bikers to DC {{initially}} {{asked for}} a permit to demonstrate around the National Mall, but the National Park <b>Service</b> <b>denied</b> the request stating that such a large gathering of motorcycles would cause “a severe disruption of traffic” and that the D.C. police {{would not be able}} to accommodate it. However, D.C. law states that it is not an offense to assemble or parade on a public thoroughfare in the District without having provided notice or obtained an approved assembly plan. For this reason the event commenced anyway and was legal without the permit. But because the permit was denied the riders did not have a police escort through the traffic — a sore spot with organizers who thought the denial was for political purposes.|$|E

Femen accused Brok of soliciting the services of Ukrainian prostitutes and insulting Ukrainian women. Although Femen never disclosed its source, instead mentioning [...] "reliable informations"(sic), the Kyiv Post reported shortly after that circumstantial evidence points to First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin being involved. The European External Action <b>Service</b> <b>denied</b> all allegations against Brok, citing his intensive agenda during his visit.

He was charged with attempted hijacking, but claimed he was only on his way with a group of others to an Islamic conference in Birmingham. An organiser of the conference in Birmingham said however that it was [...] "highly unlikely" [...] that the suspected hijacker was due to attend the conference. A military intelligence source cited by Reuters said that [...] "We know for sure that the plan was to crash the plane into a US embassy in Europe."

5000|$|An {{article in}} The Economist {{suggested}} that the BBC's desire to continue using local transmitters in Russia may conflict with its neutrality. [...] The BBC World <b>Service</b> <b>denied</b> it and said the problems it faced in acquiring carriage on FM in Russia emanated from the growing impact its distinctive programmes were having with audiences rather than weakening {{the quality of its}} output. They said it was the awkward journalistic questions the BBC had asked that inspired the authorities to bring persistent pressure to bear upon its FM partners to drop its programmes until the threat of losing their licences altogether became too strong. In November 2008 the BBC World Service announced a far-reaching strategy rethink, seeing most of the Russian Service's standalone news bulletins end and two blocks of current affairs programming widened. The strategy envisioned closure of longer, lighter feature programmes and aggregating some of their elements such as insights on British culture into a new weekend programme.|$|E
5000|$|Police Major General Vitaliy Zakharchenko {{was born}} in Kostiantynivka, in the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union.

From May 2008 to June 2010 he held leading positions in the State Tax Administration in Poltava Oblast. President Viktor Yanukovych appointed Zakharchenko as head of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine on 25 December 2010. On 7 November 2011 the president appointed him Minister of Internal Affairs, replacing Anatolii Mohyliov who had been named the new Prime Minister of Crimea; simultaneously, Yanukovych appointed Oleksandr Klymenko as head of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine. According to Ukrainian media Zakharchenko is a close friend of President Yanukovych' son, Viktor Viktorovych Yanukovych, though President Yanukovych, through his press <b>service,</b> <b>denied</b> that he appointed individuals to top government positions based on their personal loyalty and closeness to his family rather than qualifications.

The delegation made the immediate observation that three years after their first visit, the Pavshino facility [...] "- in terms of material conditions, staff and medical care - was still clearly unsuitable {{for the needs of}} the people being held there." [...] The delegation requested the withdrawal from service of this facility and that replacement facilities be designed and put in place without delay. They noted that the authority appointed to take charge of foreign nationals would require adequate resources, including budgetary resources. In a letter sent in response by the Ukrainian authorities dated 23 January 2006, provided information about how this immediate observation was being addressed. The CPT observed that this response was inadequate, and constituted a significant violation of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The report further notes that the Council of Ministers had decided to transfer the responsibility for the detention of foreign nationals to the Ministry of Internal Affais, but that this ministry was only prepared to take responsibility for new centres, which the letter of 23 January 2006 confirmed had received a budget. Meanwhile, the State Border Guard <b>Service</b> <b>denied</b> having responsibility for the facility, whilst in fact exercising day-to-day control.

These judgments are followed by actions such as blatant, overt discrimination (refusal of <b>service,</b> <b>denying</b> of human rights). Mentalism impacts how individuals are treated by the general public, by mental health professionals, and by institutions, including the legal system.

2500|$|The {{history of}} Bank of America {{dates back to}} October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy served the needs of many {{immigrants}} settling in the United States at that time, providing <b>services</b> <b>denied</b> {{to them by the}} existing American banks which typically discriminated against them and often <b>denied</b> <b>service</b> to all but the wealthiest. Giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather Lorenzo Scatena, as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee. [...] When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, Giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires. Because San Francisco's banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults, Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster. From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels, he lent money to those who wished to rebuild.|$|R
