40|$|BACKGROUND: Transfer of {{discharge}} medication related information to community pharmacies could improve continuity of care. This requires for community pharmacies to accurately update <b>their</b> <b>patient</b> <b>records</b> when new information is transferred. An instruction manual that specifies how to document information regarding medication changes and clinical information (i. e. allergies/contraindications) could support community pharmacies. OBJECTIVE: To explore {{the effect of}} instruction manuals sent to community pharmacies on completeness of <b>their</b> <b>patient</b> <b>records.</b> SETTING: A before-after study was performed (July 2009 -August 2010) in the St Lucas Andreas Hospital, a general teaching hospital in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. METHODS: Patients discharged from the cardiology and respiratory ward were included consecutively. The intervention consisted of a training session for community pharmacies regarding documentation problems and faxing an instruction manual to community pharmacies specifying how to document discharge information in their information system. Usual care consisted of faxing a discharge medication overview to community pharmacies without additional instructions. Two weeks after discharge the medication records of community pharmacies were collected by fax. These were compared with the initial discharge overviews regarding completeness of medication changes (i. e. explicit explanation that medication had been changed) and clinical information documentation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE OUTCOMES: were the number and percentage of completely documented medication changes (either needing to be dispensed or not) and clinical information items. The sample size was calculated at 107 patients per measurement period. Multivariable logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighteen patients (112 before- 106 after) were included. Completeness of medication changes documentation increased marginally after the intervention (46. 6 vs 56. 3 %, adjusted Odds Ratio 1. 4 [95 % confidence interval 1. 07 - 1. 83]). Documentation increased when medication was actually dispensed by the community pharmacy. No significant improvements were seen for allergy and contraindication documentation. CONCLUSION: The intervention is insufficient to increase the completeness of documentation by community pharmacies as marginal improvements were achieved. Future studies should evaluate whether electronic infrastructures may help in achieving updated medication records to improve continuity of pharmaceutical care...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There is {{uncertainty}} {{regarding the}} completeness of death recording by civil registration and by health centres in South Africa. This paper aims to compare death recording {{by the two}} systems, in cohorts of South African patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). Methods: Completeness of death recording was estimated using a capture–recapture approach. Six ART programmes linked <b>their</b> <b>patient</b> <b>record</b> systems to the vital registration system using civil identity document (ID) numbers and provided data comparing the outcomes <b>recorded</b> in <b>patient</b> files and in the vital registration. Patients were excluded if they had missing/invalid IDs or had transferred to other ART programmes. Results: After exclusions, 91, 548 <b>patient</b> <b>records</b> were included. Of deaths <b>recorded</b> in <b>patients</b> files after 2003, 94. 0 % (95 % CI: 93. 3 – 94. 6 %) were recorded by civil registration, with completeness being significantly higher in urban areas, older adults and females. Of deaths recorded by civil registration after 2003, only 35. 0 % (95 % CI: 34. 2 – 35. 8 %) were <b>recorded</b> in <b>patient</b> files, with this proportion dropping from 60 % in 2004 – 2005 to 30 % in 2010 and subsequent years.

When {{the information from the}} two systems was combined, an estimated 96. 2 % of all deaths were recorded (93. 5 % in children and 96. 2 % in adults). Conclusions: South Africa's civil registration system has achieved a high level of completeness in the recording of mortality.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} primary care in 34 countries from {{the perspectives of}} GPs and <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> For the study, data were collected through surveys among around 7, 000 GPs and 70, 000 patients. Patients were invited to complete questionnaires after their consultation to gain insight in their experiences and what they find important. Data were analyzed using multilevel models in which patients are nested in GPs, which are nested in countries. The range of the services of GPs were measured in four areas: the extent to which GPs are the first contact to care, the treatment of chronic diseases, minor technical procedures and prevention. During the past two decades, GPs have become more involved in the treatment of chronic diseases, but less active in prevention. In countries with a stronger growth in health care expenditures, the range of services provided by GPs have expanded more during the past decades. A broad range of services can be supported by the way GPs organize their practices. For example, GPs who keep <b>their</b> <b>patients</b> <b>records</b> routinely offer more preventive services. This confirms that the <b>patient</b> <b>record</b> can be of support in these tasks. In this study the experiences of patients were measured regarding different areas, such as the communication with their GP. The communication with GPs is perceived as good in all countries. In countries with better financial and economic conditions for primary care, such as higher relative expenditures on primary care and better insurance coverage for primary care, patients see less potential for improvement regarding the accessibility, continuity and comprehensiveness of primary care. In addition, the range of the services provided by GPs was found to be important. Patients who visited GPs who offered a broader range of services experienced better accessibility, continuity and comprehensiveness of primary care and they experienced to be more involved by the GP in decisions about their treatment...|$|R

With eHealth, patients will have the option to, via Internet, in different ways communicate with health care. A growing population of elderly, many with limited experience of internet use, are expected to take part in eHealth. Aims: The aim {{of the study was to}} examine elderlies experience and view on eHealth. Method: Data was collected through two semi-structured focus group interviews. Eleven participants who had reached retirement participated in the study. Collected data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis with inductive approach. Result: The most prominent of the results was a sense of insecurity related to eHealth. Several participants expressed uncertainty about the practical use in relation to their own knowledge and who would provide technical support and guidance. The results also reflected a sense of uncertainty towards what the term eHealth includes in addition to a fear that the physical contact with healthcare will be cut back in favor of eHealth services. Positive experiences of eHealth mainly concerned the opportunity to take part of <b>their</b> <b>patient</b> <b>record</b> and services that made it easier to get in contact with health care in general.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} the rate {{and means of}} suicide among people taking 10 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs: dothiepin, amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, flupenthixol, lofepramine, mianserin, fluoxetine, doxepin, and trazodone. DESIGN [...] Open cohort study with a nested case-control analysis. SETTING [...] General practices in the United Kingdom that used VAMP computers to maintain <b>their</b> <b>patient</b> <b>records</b> from January 1988 to February 1993. SUBJECTS [...] 172, 598 people who {{had at least one}} prescription for one of the 10 antidepressants during the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Suicide confirmed by general practitioner or on death certificate, or both. RESULTS [...] 143 people committed suicide. The overall rate of suicide was estimated to be 8. 5 per 10, 000 person years (95 % confidence interval 7. 2 to 10. 0). Rates of suicide were higher in men than women (relative risk 2. 8 (95 % confidence interval 1. 9 to 4. 0)), people with a history of feeling suicidal (19. 2 (9. 5 to 38. 7)), and people who had taken several different antidepressants (2. 8 (1. 8 to 4. 3)). People who received high doses of antidepressants and those who had had a prescription in the 30 days before they committed suicide were also at higher risk than those who had received low doses and had had their prescriptions 30 or more days previously (2. 3 (1. 4 to 3. 7) and 2. 3 (1. 6 to 3. 4)) respectively. Rates of suicide were higher in patients who received fluoxetine, but this may be explained by selection biases which were present for those drug users. CONCLUSION [...] Several factors correlate with the risk of suicide in people taking antidepressants. After controlling for these factors, the risk of suicide was similar among the 10 study antidepressants. Overdose with antidepressants accounted for only 14 % of the suicides...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{estimate}} the overall prevalence of normal tension glaucoma for a predominantly Chinese population who underwent sleep polysomnography for suspected {{obstructive sleep apnea}} in a specialty sleep clinic in a publicly-funded tertiary care hospital in Hong Kong. Methods This was a retrospective cross sectional study. In total, 1678 subjects underwent polysomnography (PSG) between 1 st of January, 2005 and 31 st of December, 2014. <b>Their</b> <b>patient</b> <b>records</b> were retrieved for data collection and analysis. The PSG apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was considered as the diagnostic definition for obstructive sleep apnea while Anderson’s criteria {{was used for the}} diagnosis of normal tension glaucoma. Univariate analysis was conducted for potential risk factors, including patient age, gender, presence of hypertension, body mass index (BMI) and severity of OSAS. Results Amongst the 1678 subjects who underwent PSG during the study period. 426 of them were seen by at the ophthalmology specialty outpatient clinic of Queen Mary Hospital. The cumulative prevalence of NTG among them was 7. 04 %. Patients with severe OSAS had a higher prevalence of NTG than the normal population (7. 69 % versus 1. 6 %). Risk factors including older age, male gender, presence of hypertension and severity of OSAS had trends for higher prevalence of NTG but they were shown to be statistically insignificant. Conclusions Chinese patients with symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are at significantly higher risk of developing normal tension glaucoma than the normal population. This suggests that screening measures for glaucoma in this asymptomatic population should be further investigated. However, the underlying mechanism linking the two conditions remains to be understood. Lastly, continuous positive airway Pressure (C-PAP) therapy was postulated to be a potential protective factor for NTG but further study is required to define this relationship...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In family practice, chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is usually not}} diagnosed until clinically apparent and of moderately advanced severity. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the diagnostic process from early development onwards and to assess the current state of underpresentation and underdiagnosis of COPD and asthma in primary care in the Netherlands. METHODS: The population-based study sample consisted of formerly undiagnosed subjects (n = 532) from family practice. Family physicians' (FPs) chronic respiratory disease diagnoses (as recorded over 10 years in <b>their</b> <b>patient</b> <b>records)</b> were compared to a cross-sectional but extensive diagnostic assessment by a chest physician. Logistic regression modelling was used for a retrospective analysis on the relation between respiratory symptoms, practice visit rate and FPs' diagnosis of COPD. RESULTS: After 10 years, the chest physician diagnosed 26 % of subjects as COPD and 16 % as (late-onset) asthma. Underpresentation of these patients in family practice was 46 %, whereas underdiagnosis occurred in 37 % of patients. A chest physician diagnosis of COPD was associated with the presence of chronic cough [odds ratio (OR) = 2. 3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 1 - 4. 6], a FP diagnosis of COPD with chronic phlegm (OR = 10. 6, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 83. 6). Repeated practice visits (OR = 1. 8) and presence of wheeze and breathlessness (OR = 5. 5) appeared to trigger the diagnostic process in family practice. CONCLUSIONS: There is still considerable underpresentation and underdiagnosis of COPD in family practice. As FPs focus on presented symptoms and as detection increases with the frequency of practice visits, diagnostic guidelines should stress the importance of persistent cough and phlegm to support timely diagnosis of COPD in family practice...|$|R

50|$|Cases with {{integrative}} agnosia {{appear to}} have medial ventral lesions in the extrastriate cortex. Those who have integrative agnosia {{are better able to}} identify inanimate than animate items, which indicates processes that lead to accurate perceptual organization of visual information can be impaired. This is attributed to the importance of perceptual updating of stored visual knowledge, which is particularly important for classes of stimuli that have many perceptual neighbors and/or stimuli for which perceptual features are central to <b>their</b> <b>stored</b> representations. <b>Patients</b> also show a tendency to process visual stimuli initially at a global rather than local level. Although the grouping of local elements into perceptual wholes can be impaired, patients can remain sensitive to holistic visual representations.|$|R

The differences between therapists were identified from audiotaped treatment sessions of 1837 <b>patients,</b> <b>recorded</b> by physical therapists in non-institutional care in the Netherlands. Trained judges assessed the quantity {{and the quality of the}} education by means of a checklist. Therapists' opinions about <b>patient</b> education and <b>their</b> work setting were also examined as possible factors associated with between-therapist diffences. The results showed that the therapists differed in <b>their</b> opinions about <b>patient</b> compliance, the number of exercise instructions given to <b>their</b> <b>patients,</b> the amount of stress-related counselling and the attention given to patients' demands and perceptions. Those therapists with high expectations about the effects of education compliance paid more attention to the education of <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> The results also indicated that therapists who spent more time with <b>their</b> <b>patients</b> had a better relationship with them.
