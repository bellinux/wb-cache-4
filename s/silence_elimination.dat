40|$|Infant cry is a {{multimodal}} {{and dynamic}} behaviour that {{it contains a}} lot of information. Goal of this investigation is recognition of two groups of infants by new acoustic feature that has not used in infant cry classification. The cry of deaf infants and normal hearing infants is studied. ‘Mel filter-bank discrete wavelet coefficients (MFDWCs) ’ have been extracted as feature vector. Infant cry classification is a pattern recognition problem such as ‘automatic speech recognition’, which in signal processing stage the authors performed some pre-processing included <b>silence</b> <b>elimination,</b> filtering, pre-emphasising and, segmentation. After applying the discrete wavelet transform on the Mel scaled log filter bank energies of a cry signal frames, MFDWCs feature vector was extracted. The feature vector, MFDWCs, of each cry sample has large length, so they used principle components analysis to reduce in feature space dimension, after training of neural network as classifier, they achieved to 93. 2 % correction rate in cry recognition of test data set. This result shows better efficiency in comparison with previous familiarised approaches...|$|E
30|$|In {{at least}} some genomes, polyploidization is {{followed}} by extensive genomic change resulting in the <b>silencing</b> and <b>elimination</b> of duplicated genes [1]. In grasses, polyploidy has been a recurrent theme, with many lineages exhibiting full genome duplications {{over the last few}} million years. Local sequence comparisons in these species, such as maize [40, 53, 64], wheat [27, 46, 90, 34, 16, 15] and sugarcane [42], have revealed interesting features of gene and genome evolution in recent polyploids. LTR retrotransposon amplification and altered regulation (e.g., silencing) or loss of duplicated genes are repeated themes. Inactivation and eventual elimination of duplicated genes can be mediated by altered epigenetic regulation, deletions, TE insertions, and/or point mutations causing premature stop codons.|$|R
40|$|B {{chromosomes}} are non-essential {{components of}} numerous {{plant and animal}} genomes. Because many of these “extra” chromosomes enhance their own transmission {{in ways that are}} detrimental {{to the rest of the}} genome, they can be thought of as genome parasites. An extreme example is a paternally inherited B chromosome known as paternal sex ratio (PSR), which is found in natural populations of the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. In order to ensure its own propagation, PSR severely biases the wasp sex ratio by converting diploid female-destined embryos into transmitting haploid males. This action occurs at the expense of the other paternally inherited chromosomes, which fail to resolve during the first round of division and are thus eliminated. Recent work has revealed that paternal genome elimination by PSR occurs through the disruption of a number of specific histone post-translational modifications, suggesting a central role for chromatin regulation in this phenomenon. In this review, we describe these recent advances in the light of older ones and in the context of what is currently understood about the molecular mechanisms of targeted genome <b>silencing</b> and <b>elimination</b> in other systems...|$|R
40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are mobile {{entities that}} densely populate most eukaryotic genomes {{and contribute to}} both their structural and functional dynamics. However most TE-related sequences found in both plant and animal genomes correspond to inactive, degenerated elements, due to the combined effect of <b>silencing</b> pathways and <b>elimination</b> through deletions. Therefore, {{one of the major}} difficulties in fully characterizing the molecular basis of genetic diversity of a given species is to establish its genome-wide transpositional activity. In this report, we provide an extensive survey of the transpositional landscape of a plant genome using a deep sequencing strategy. This was achieved through Paired-End Mapping (PEM) of a 4 x coverage of the genome of rice mutant line derived from in vitro callus culture using the Illumina technology. Our study reveals that at least 13 TE families are active in this genotype, causing 34 new insertions. This NGS-based strategy provides new opportunities to quantify the impact of TEs on the genome dynamics of the species...|$|R
40|$|The {{glutamate}} synapse {{is by far}} {{the most}} common synapse in the brain and acts via postsynaptic AMPA, NMDA and mGlu receptors. During brain development there is a continuous production of these synapses where those partaking in activity resulting in neuronal activity are subsequently selected to establish an appropriate functional pattern of synaptic connectivity while those that do not are elimimated. Activity dependent synaptic plasticities, such as Hebbian induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and low frequency (1 Hz) induced long-term depression (LTD) have been considered to be of critical importance for this selection. However, in the neonatal brain the glutamate synapse displays a seemingly distinct plasticity in that even very low frequency stimulation (0. 05 - 0. 2 Hz) results in depression of the AMPA receptor mediated signaling and hence to possible synaptic elimination. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the relationship and interaction between this very low frequency induced plasticity and the more conventional forms of synaptic plasticity, such as mGlu receptor dependent LTD and NMDA receptor dependent LTP and LTD, using the neonatal rat hippocampal CA 3 -CA 1 synapse as a model synapse. This thesis shows that very low frequency induced depression is related to NMDA receptor dependent LTD. While elicited even during NMDA receptor blockade, this plasticity is facilitated and stabilized by NMDA receptor activity and largely occludes NMDA receptor dependent LTD. Surprisingly, considering their role in conventionally induced LTD, mGlu receptors were not found to participate in either the very low frequency induced depression or in low frequency induced long-lasting depression. A preceding LTP-inducing Hebbian stimulation was found to only partially stabilize against the very low frequency induced depression, and possibly also only in a temporary manner. In conclusion; during brain development glutamate activated AMPA receptors are very easily lost upon activation rendering these synapses AMPA silent, and Hebbian activity will only temporarily rescue them from AMPA silence. Thus, synapses in the developing brain will maintain their AMPA signaling only by more or less continuous participation in cooperative neuronal activity, synaptic activity outside this context leading to AMPA <b>silencing</b> and possible <b>elimination...</b>|$|R
