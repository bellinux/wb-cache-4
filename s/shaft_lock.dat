The problem with taper keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a tapered <b>shaft</b> <b>lock</b> in that tapered keys have a matching taper on the keyway, while tapered shaft locks do not.|$|E

50|$|A tapered lock {{is a form}} of keyless <b>shaft</b> <b>locking</b> {{device that}} does not require any {{material}} to be removed from the shaft. The basic idea is similar to a clamp coupling but the moment of rotation is closer {{to the center of the}} shaft. An alternative coupling device to the traditional parallel key, the tapered lock removes the possibility of play due to worn keyways. It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.|$|R

50|$|The Rothensee {{boat lift}} was {{originally}} envisaged {{as part of}} a larger project. The lift is at the Eastern end of the Mittellandkanal, it was intended that this canal would cross the Elbe on an aqueduct and then be connected to the Elbe-Havel Canal by a double boat lift at Hohenwarthe. The Rothensee lift is about 500m from the junction of the Elbeabstiegcanal and the MittellandKanal lowering boats to the level of the Elbe. The Rothensee lift was completed in 1938 but as a result of the Second World War the aqueduct and Hohenwarthe lift were not constructed. As part of a German re-unification transport project the Elbe aqueduct was completed after a 60 year delay, however two <b>shaft</b> <b>locks</b> were built instead of the proposed Hohenwarthe lift. For 60 years, therefore, the Rothensee lift, which was originally intended to allow passage just from the Mittellandkanal to the Elbe carried all the navigation traffic from the West German industrial centres to West Berlin.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a <b>shaft</b> <b>locking</b> and releasing mechanism. A locking and releasing mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and releasing mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade. With the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and releasing mechanism, a preliminary design for a three-dimensional propeller was created...|$|R

5000|$|While the {{standard}} (Type 1 or T1) Torsen supports a static torque ratio of 50:50; i.e., input torque is supported equally across both output shafts, the T1 has a Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) of 2.7-4:1; i.e., it allows about 3 to 4 times the torque {{to be supplied}} to the most tractive output shaft than that {{is available on the}} least tractive shaft or, a torque split of between 25% to 75%. However, by nature the T1 Torsen is locked under most circumstances (output <b>shafts</b> <b>locked</b> together). Only when the TBR is reached (i.e., there is a greater torque difference across the output shafts than can be supported by the TBR) do the output shafts turn relative to each other, and the differential unlocks. This characteristic results in a relatively free torque movement between both outputs of the (centre) differential, within the limits of the TBR. Thus the static torque distribution of the T1 Torsen in a centre differential installation, rather than being 50:50, will mirror the weight distribution (both static and dynamic) of the vehicle due to the traction available at either (front:rear) output shaft. In a standard car, this is desirable from the perspective of stability, acceleration and traction, but can be undesirable in terms of handling (understeer). While {{the standard}} quattro Torsen T1 with 2.7:1 TBR is more than sufficient in most conditions, Torsen T1 differentials with higher TBRs (4:1) are available and can further limit understeer by supporting a wider torque split. A better solution, however, is to apportion a torque split directly between both output shafts (front & rear) and for this reason Audi has adopted the Type 3 (T3) Torsen design in the latest generations of quattro.|$|R

2500|$|... was sunk on 10 December 1941, {{from what}} was {{believed}} to have been hits by six aerial launched torpedoes and a 500kg bomb. However, an extensive 2007 survey by divers of the wreck of Prince of Wales determined definitively that there had been only 4 torpedo hits. Three of these four hits had struck the hull outside the area protected by the SPS. In the case of the fourth, the SPS holding bulkhead appeared intact abreast the area where the hull was hit. The conclusion of the subsequent 2009 paper and analysis was that the primary cause of the sinking was uncontained flooding along [...] "B" [...] propeller shaft. The propeller shaft external shaft bracket failed, and the movement of the unsupported shaft then tore up the bulkheads {{all the way from the}} external propeller shaft gland through to B Engine Room itself. This allowed flooding into the primary machinery spaces. The damage and flooding was exacerbated by poor damage control and the premature abandonment of the after magazines and a telephone communications switchboard. [...] "B" [...] propeller shaft had been stopped, and then restarted several minutes after being struck by a torpedo. Subsequent inquiries into her loss at the time identified the need for a number of design improvements, which were implemented to a lesser or greater degree on the other four ships of the class. Ventilation and the watertightness of the ventilation system were improved, while internal passageways within the machinery spaces were redesigned and the communications system made more robust. Improved propeller shaft glands and <b>shaft</b> <b>locking</b> gear were introduced. Some of the supposed failures of the ship were nevertheless predicated on the assumption that a torpedo had hit and defeated the SPS at or about frame 206 at the same time as the hit that damaged B propeller shaft. The 2007 survey's [...] video footage evidence showed however that the hull is basically intact in this area. The inability to survey the wreck during the war no doubt frustrated efforts to arrive at a definitive cause for the loss of Prince of Wales and, subsequently, that somewhat flawed analysis has led to a number of incorrect theories regarding the reasons for the sinking being inadvertently disseminated over the years.|$|R
5000|$|Most modern manual-transmission {{vehicles}} are {{fitted with a}} synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be <b>locked</b> to the <b>shaft.</b> The <b>locking</b> mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or dog collar) on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or dogs) on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft hub. When the rings are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally <b>locked</b> to the <b>shaft</b> and determines the output speed of the transmission. The gearshift lever manipulates the collars using a set of linkages, so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when [...] "shifting gears", the locking collar from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, {{in the other direction}} selects another.|$|R

50|$|A new Shift-on-the-move {{four-wheel drive}} system with {{two-speed}} dual range New Process 208 aluminium transfer case was introduced on K-Series pickups for the 1981 model year. It replaced the {{permanent four-wheel drive}} system, on pre-1980 models. The shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive system featured new automatic self locking hubs and synchronized direct high range planetary gearing, such that the truck could be shifted from two-wheel drive, to fully locked four-wheel drive at speeds of up to 25 mph. Once the shift from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive was made, the vehicle could be driven at any forward or reverse speed. Four drive modes were offered: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, with Four High yielding a locked 50:50 torque split through direct synchronized gearing. Four Low applied reduction gearing with a 2.61:1 ratio, compared to the previous New Process 205's 1.96:1. The front and rear propeller <b>shafts</b> were <b>locked</b> at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral was provided for disengagement of both propeller shafts.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} develop a locking T-plate and to {{evaluate}} its mechanical properties in synthetic models. A titanium 2. 7 mm T-plate was designed with a <b>shaft</b> containing three <b>locked</b> screw holes and one dynamic compression hole, and a head with two locked screw holes. Forty T-shaped polyurethane blocks, and 20 T-plates were used for mechanical testing. Six bone-plate constructs were tested to failure, three in axial compression and three in cantilever bending. Fourteen bone-plate constructs were tested for failure in fatigue, seven in axial compression and seven in cantilever bending. In static testing higher values of axial compression test than cantilever bending test were observed for all variables. In axial compression fatigue testing all bone-plate constructs withstood 1, 000, 000 cycles. Four bone-plate constructs failure occurred before 1, 000, 000 cycles in cantilever bending fatigue testing. In conclusion, the locking T-plate tested has mechanical properties that offer greatest resistance to fracture under axial loading than bending forces...|$|R

Findings The proximal tibiofibular joint was analyzed in 30 patients, who reported knee pain after tibial nailing, and standard radiograph and computed tomography were performed to examine the proximal third of the tibia. Twenty patients (68. 9 %) presented the proximal screw crossing the proximal tibiofibular joint and 13 (44. 8 %) had already removed the nail and/or screw. Four patients (13. 7 %) reported complaint of knee pain. However, the screw did not reach the proximal tibiofibular joint. Five patients (17. 2 %) complained of knee pain although the screw toward the joint did not affect the proximal tibiofibular joint. Conclusion When using nails with oblique proximal lock, surgeons should be careful not to cause injury in the proximal tibiofibular joint, what may be one of the causes of knee pain.

5000|$|Four High and Four Low modes {{were also}} {{featured}} on both Explorer and Expedition. Four High mode tells the intelligent locking multi-disc differential to lock, providing a permanently locked 50:50 torque distribution. The {{front and rear}} drive <b>shafts</b> are fully <b>locked,</b> forcing them to rotate {{at the same speed}} regardless of tractive conditions. Four Low mode also tells the intelligent locking multi-disc differential to lock, however it instructs the BorgWarner transfer case to select low range off road reduction gearing. Reduction gearing is utilized to reduce the vehicle’s speed to a manageable crawl, and to increase (multiply) the supplied torque coming from the engine. Thus the drive wheels have ample torque to move the vehicle at low speeds. It is also used to control downward speeds while descending steep gradients and to improve the vehicle’s off road crawl ratio. Both Four High mode and Four Low mode cannot be used on pavement as [...] "driveline binding" [...] and [...] "torque windup" [...] can occur, causing damage to the four-wheel-drive system.|$|R
