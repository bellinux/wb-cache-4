5|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} <b>sewerage</b> was {{processed}} at a plant near the town, which also handles <b>sewerage</b> from nearby Hadspen. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into {{a tributary of}} the Liffey River. As of 2003 the reticulated water supply in the town was untreated and both were operated by the Meander Valley council. By 2011 Carrick's water was supplied from the Mount Leslie Water Treatment Plant. This plant was built in 1996 and supplies treated water from the Trevallyn Dam.|$|E
5|$|Carrick Post Office {{opened on}} 5 November 1841. Carrick never grew large—the {{population}} varied from around 200 to 439—and {{today it is}} largely a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and <b>sewerage,</b> though reticulated services for both are now connected. Volunteer labour enabled piped water supply, from the Liffey, from 1961 and a <b>sewerage</b> plant {{was built in the}} mid-1970s on the towns outskirts. The local councils' strategic plan aims for the town to stay small with only infill development.|$|E
5|$|Poulton's {{water and}} <b>sewerage</b> {{facilities}} {{are provided by}} United Utilities. The distribution network operator for electricity is Electricity North West. Home Office policing is provided by Lancashire Constabulary. There is one police station in Poulton.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sewerage.</b> Sewage {{collection}} {{systems do}} not have sufficient hydraulic capacity to handle wastewater flows, especially in poor neighborhoods, which results in combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|The Puri Municipality, Puri Konark Development Authority, Public Health Engineering Organisation and Orissa Water Supply <b>Sewerage</b> Board {{are some}} of the {{principal}} organisations that are devolved with the responsibility of providing for civic amenities such as water supply, <b>sewerage,</b> waste management, street lighting and infrastructure of roads. The major activity, which puts maximum pressure on these organisations, is the annual event of the Ratha Yatra held during June- July. According to the Puri Municipality {{more than a million people}} attend this event. Hence, development activities such as infrastructure and amenities to the pilgrims, apart from security, gets priority attention.|$|E
5|$|The government-owned ACTEW Corporation manages Canberra's {{water and}} <b>sewerage</b> infrastructure. ActewAGL {{is a joint}} venture between ACTEW and AGL, and is the retail {{provider}} of Canberra's utility services including water, natural gas, electricity, and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary TransACT.|$|E
5|$|Water {{services}} used to {{be provided}} by the Metropolitan Waterworks and <b>Sewerage</b> System, which served 30% of the city with most other sewage being directly dumped into storm drains, septic tanks, or open canals. MWSS was privatized in 1997, which split the water concession into {{the east and west}} zones. The Maynilad Water Services took over the west zone of which Manila is a part. It now provides the supply and delivery of potable water and <b>sewerage</b> system in Manila, but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water. Electric services are provided by Meralco, the sole electric power distributor in Metro Manila.|$|E
5|$|An early {{focus of}} the new {{authority}} was on policing and crime, with {{construction of a new}} borough prison begun in 1842. The Leeds Improvement Act of 1842 gave the council further powers over markets, streets, street lighting, <b>sewerage,</b> building regulations, public cleansing and smoke regulation in the rapidly growing industrial city.|$|E
5|$|As well as railway engineering, Brassey {{was active}} in the {{development}} of steamships, mines, locomotive factories, marine telegraphy, and water supply and sewage systems. He built part of the London <b>sewerage</b> system, still in operation today, and was a major shareholder in Brunel's The Great Eastern, the only ship large enough at the time to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic, in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Both the East Riding and Hull {{are still}} {{covered by the}} Humberside Police area and the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service. Piped water is {{supplied}} by Yorkshire Water who also maintain the <b>sewerage</b> system. About 1% of the population use water from private supplies. They are usually in the more remote parts of the East Riding. The majority are bore holes {{but they can be}} wells or natural springs.|$|E
5|$|Deptford {{railway station}} {{is one of}} the oldest {{suburban}} stations in the world, being built (c.1836-38) as part of the first suburban service (the London and Greenwich Railway), between London Bridge and Greenwich. Close to Deptford Creek is a Victorian pumping station built in 1864, part of the massive London <b>sewerage</b> system designed by civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette.|$|E
5|$|Empresas Departamentales de Acueducto y Alcantarillado (ACUAS) or Departmental Water and <b>Sewerage</b> Companies were created, {{consisting}} of the departments, the municipalities and INSFOPAL, which took care of managing and maintaining the infrastructure of the member communities. In that way, investment {{at the national level}} was channelled into this important area of public health.|$|E
5|$|Hadspen {{has grown}} without any area {{set aside for}} small {{commercial}} operations, a fact {{that has led to}} just a single shopping complex. There was another service station, in the main street, but it closed in 2008 after operating for approximately forty years. Rutherglen is a holiday village, conference and event centre, and retirement village on the town's west. It is the only premises in Hadspen with a general liquor licence. Rutherglen, or a similarly named premises at the same location, has been used for accommodation since at least 1923. The town has access to reticulated water and <b>sewerage.</b> The town's <b>sewerage</b> has been, since the mid-1970s, processed at a plant near Carrick that also serves that town. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into a tributary of the Liffey River.|$|E
5|$|Mains {{water and}} <b>sewerage</b> {{services}} {{are provided by}} Thames Water Utilities Limited, a private sector water supply company, whilst water abstraction and disposal is regulated by the Environment Agency. Reading's water supply is largely derived from underground aquifers, {{and as a consequence}} the water is hard.|$|E
5|$|North Yorkshire County Council waste {{management}} services provide a {{household waste recycling centre}} at Whitby Industrial Estate, and operates an alternate weekly collection of household waste, whereby {{the type of}} waste collected alternates between recyclables and landfill waste. The water supply, predominantly from the River Esk, is treated at Ruswarp Water Treatment Works and distributed from there by Yorkshire Water who also deal with the town's <b>sewerage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plymouth City Council is {{responsible}} for waste management throughout the city and South West Water {{is responsible}} for <b>sewerage.</b> Plymouth's electricity is supplied from the National Grid and distributed to Plymouth via Western Power Distribution. On the outskirts of Plympton a combined cycle gas-powered station, the Langage Power Station, which started to produce electricity for Plymouth {{at the end of}} 2009.|$|E
5|$|Thames Water is {{responsible}} for all waste water and <b>sewerage</b> provision. Residents {{in most parts of}} Crawley receive their drinking water from Southern Water; areas in the north of the town around Gatwick Airport are provided by Sutton & East Surrey Water; and South East Water supplies Maidenbower.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan <b>Sewerage</b> & Water Supply {{authority}} {{took over}} control of the pumping station from 1901 until 1910, when both the prison and town were connected to Perth's metropolitan water supply. The tunnels were closed in 1910, but the groundwater continued to be used for the prison's gardens. In 1989, oil leaking from nearby tanks contaminated the water. The pollution was eventually cleared by 1996 through bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by {{government}} to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. Mains water and <b>sewerage</b> services are provided by Yorkshire Water.|$|E
5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the <b>sewerage</b> system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof downpipes), cross connections, around manhole covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.|$|E
5|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had further doubled to 10,104. The {{early twentieth century}} saw a period of increased urbanization of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and <b>sewerage,</b> were completed. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} Vedaranyam is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Nagapattinam circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply project through the Vedaranyam Municipality is approved by the Commissioner of Municipal Administration, Chennai. Water is obtained from hand pumps and fountains located {{in various parts of}} the town. Door to door collection of garbage is done by sanitary workers of the municipality and about 6 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day. Vedaranyam municipality does not have underground drainage system and the current <b>sewerage</b> system for disposal of sullage is through septic tanks and public conveniences.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} the town is {{regulated}} and distributed by the Sirkazhi Circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply {{is provided by the}} Sirkazhi municipality from the Kollidam river; it is distributed through five water tanks which supply 2million (two million) litres a day. Push carts and tricycles are used to collect solid waste, which is deposited in marsh lands located outside the town. Sirkazhi municipality is implementing underground drainage and the current <b>sewerage</b> system is through septic tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry away untreated sewage, which is released into the sea or accumulates in low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the <b>sewerage</b> system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, <b>sewerage,</b> and fire and police protection. Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street. Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported annexation {{perhaps because of the}} city’s water system for fire prevention or because of the belief that township government had become too unwieldy. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, she {{enrolled}} at the University of Chicago, where she studied music and languages, intending to become an orchestral musician. She studied the harp under Walfried Singer, the Chicago Symphony's harpist. She left after three years before graduating, lonely and bitterly disillusioned. In 1918, she married Albert Dilling, an engineer studying law who attended the same Episcopalian church as Elizabeth. The couple were well off financially, thanks to Elizabeth's inherited money and Albert's job as chief engineer for the Chicago <b>Sewerage</b> District. They lived in Wilmette, a Chicago suburb, and had two children, Kirkpatrick in 1920, and Elizabeth Jane in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{was born}} at Mascot, Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth of five children. He had one younger sister, two older sisters {{one of which was}} Eileen Lindwall who married Frank Weston and an older brother. The {{grandson}} of Swedish and Irish immigrants, Lindwall had a difficult childhood with his mother Catherine dying of pneumonia when he was seven. His father Arthur had a job at the Water and <b>Sewerage</b> Board, but the children were aware that their father could not financially support them beyond school-leaving age.|$|E
5|$|The Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) was validly {{established}} in October 1976 under The Punjab Development of Cities Act (1976) to regulate, supervise and implement development activities in its jurisdiction area. The FDA {{acts as a}} policy-making body {{for the development of}} the city and is in charge of arranging and supervising major developments within the city. It is responsible for the administration of building regulations, management of parks and gardens and subsoil water management. The FDA works with the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) to control and maintain the water supply, <b>sewerage</b> and drainage. The FDA works to improve conditions in the slums.|$|E
5|$|The Kolkata Municipal Corporation {{supplies}} {{the city with}} potable water that is sourced from the Hooghly River; {{most of it is}} treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North24 Parganas district. Roughly 95% of the 4,000tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper <b>sewerage,</b> leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.|$|E
5|$|The jurisdictions of the city's {{administrative}} agencies are, in {{ascending order}} of size: the Hyderabad Police area, Hyderabad district, the GHMC area ("Hyderabad city") and the area under the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). The HMDA is an apolitical urban planning agency that covers the GHMC and its suburbs, extending to 54 mandals in five districts encircling the city. It coordinates the development activities of GHMC and suburban municipalities and manages the administration of bodies such as the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and <b>Sewerage</b> Board (HMWSSB).|$|E
5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a <b>sewerage</b> system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of <b>sewerage</b> connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge forms {{part of the}} Western {{water and}} <b>sewerage</b> regions of Scotland. Waste {{management}} {{is provided by the}} North Lanarkshire local authority. Water supplies are provided by Scottish Water, a government-owned corporation of the Scottish Government. Coatbridge's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is Scottish Power. Coatbridge is served by Monklands Hospital, sited on the Airdrie side of the Coatbridge/Airdrie border. The NHS board is NHS Lanarkshire. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is the statutory fire and rescue service which operates in Coatbridge. Policing in Coatbridge is provided by the Police Service of Scotland (Lanarkshire Division). The Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, a public body in Scotland, has direct operational responsibilities, such as supporting (and in some cases running) local bus services, and managing integrated ticketing in Coatbridge and other areas from the former Strathclyde region. Transport Scotland manages the local rail network.|$|E
5|$|During 1890 {{work began}} on an eighth fort, known as Linkuva; new {{construction}} techniques were introduced, particularly reinforced concrete. The Linkuva fort {{became the most}} modern entrenchment, equipped with electricity, <b>sewerage,</b> and casemates for a garrison of 1,000 personnel. At the same time, massive groundworks were laid along with additional defensive structures, effecting the complete enclosure of the city center between the Rivers Nemunas and Neris. By 1890, seven forts had been completed, supporting roads had been constructed, and a railroad bridge over the Nemunas had been adapted for military transport. By now, expenditures on the fortress had amounted to over nine million rubles. The first bricks for a church that would serve the garrison were laid in 1891; it was completed in 1893. The following year construction began on a dedicated narrow gauge railway.|$|E
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, <b>sewerage</b> was non-existent, and water supply was a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} the town is {{regulated}} and distributed by the Ramanathapuram circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply {{is provided by the}} Rameswaram Municipality – the head works is located at Nambunayaki Amman Kovil, Meyyambuli, Semmamadam & Natarajapuram and distributed through four over head tanks having a total capacity of 1430,000 litres. About 6 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day in the four zones covering the whole of the town. Rameswaram does not have a <b>sewerage</b> system for disposal of sullage and the disposal system consists of septic tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry untreated sewage out of the town to let out raw into the sea or accumulates in low-lying area.|$|E
