5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though no {{terrestrial}} {{birds are}} {{found on the}} atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, fairy tern, great frigatebird, bristle-thighed curlew, masked booby and red-footed booby. A number of gull species, including the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern,</b> blue noddy, brown noddy, lesser noddy and white tern, have been recorded, as have {{several members of the}} Procellariidae family: Kermadec petrel, Trindade petrel, Murphy's petrel and Christmas shearwater.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The <b>sooty</b> <b>tern</b> is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Terns are {{normally}} monogamous, although trios or female-female pairings {{have been observed}} {{in at least three}} species. Most terns breed annually {{and at the same time}} of year, but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or asynchronously. Most terns become sexually mature when aged three, although some small species may breed in their second year. Some large sea terns, including the sooty and bridled terns, are four or older when they first breed. Terns normally breed in colonies, and are site-faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable. A few species nest in small or dispersed groups, but most breed in colonies of up to a few hundred pairs, often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or skimmers. Large tern species tend to form larger colonies, which in the case of the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern</b> can contain up to two million pairs. Large species nest very close together and sit tightly, making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them. Smaller species are less closely packed and mob intruders. Peruvian and Damara terns have small dispersed colonies and rely on the cryptic plumage of the eggs and young for protection.|$|E

Species breeding in larger numbers that year included the great frigatebird and red-footed booby. Their numbers appear reduced due {{to the destruction of}} the Pisonia forests. Other breeding species include the red-tailed tropicbird, white-tailed tropicbird, the masked booby, brown booby, white tern, brown noddy, and <b>sooty</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E
25|$|The atoll {{supports}} {{a large population}} of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, <b>sooty</b> <b>tern,</b> white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, golden plover, and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets {{to the north of}} Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.|$|E
25|$|UPOV {{was first}} {{isolated}} on Upolu Cay in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia in 1966, from soft-bodied ticks {{of the species}} Ornithodoros capensis associated with the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern</b> (Onychoprion fuscatus). No natural vertebrate host has been identified, but the virus is highly pathogenic to mice in laboratory infections. The virion can either be spherical, with a diameter in the range 75–95nm, or slightly ovoid, {{with a range of}} dimensions from 75nm × 85nm to 105nm × 120nm. The genome has six RNA segments. It is most similar to ABV, with some similarity to THOV and JOSV.|$|E

500|$|Caroline Island is an {{important}} breeding site {{for a number of}} species of seabirds, most notably the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern</b> (Onychoprion fuscata), numbering around 500,000 [...] a colony of sooty terns dominates the eastern islets [...] and the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), numbering over 10,000. Caroline Island and its neighbor, Flint Island, also host some of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab. (Birgus latro). Other native animals include the Tridacna clam, which is abundant in the central lagoon, hermit crabs, and multiple species of lizards.|$|E
500|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{is found}} on Ascension Island, , [...] and [...] On Ascension Island, J.lagostoma is {{restricted}} outside the breeding season to {{the slopes of}} Green Mountain, where there is sufficient moisture and vegetation, {{the rest of the}} island being too arid for the crab to survive. All the land above [...] is suitable habitat for the crabs, as is much of the land above [...] They are occasionally found at lower altitudes, including the well-watered gardens of Georgetown, and the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern</b> breeding colony in the south-west of the island (known as the Wideawake Fairs). On , J.lagostoma is abundant wherever plants grow, included the highest parts of the island.|$|E
500|$|J.lagostoma {{is active}} {{at night and}} after rain, when it emerges from its burrows, which can be up to [...] deep. In 1915, H. A. Baylis {{reported}} that it feeds on [...] "decaying vegetation and perhaps {{a certain amount of}} excreta from sea-birds"; most of its diet is thought to be made up of plant matter, but can also include animals. In the Wideawake Fairs, J.lagostoma feeds on chicks and eggs of the <b>sooty</b> <b>tern,</b> and they have been proposed as a limiting factor in the breeding of petrels on Ascension Island. In May, green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) hatch, and J.lagostoma is one of several predators to target the emerging hatchlings, alongside the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila) and feral cats. The crabs find water on and under rocks, especially after condensation has begun to form on their cool surfaces at night.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a very large colony of about 100,000 pairs of <b>sooty</b> <b>terns,</b> as well as 100 pairs of brown noddies. There are no resident landbirds.|$|R
50|$|It {{involved}} an annual competition {{to retrieve the}} first egg laid by migrating <b>sooty</b> <b>terns.</b> The contest was held at ‘Orongo, and the winning man became Makemake’s representative for the following year. The last ceremony {{is thought to have}} been held in 1866 or 1867.|$|R
50|$|The {{islands are}} home to Dry Tortugas National Park, and are {{accessible}} only by boat or seaplane. The large seabird colony, including <b>sooty</b> <b>terns,</b> brown noddy, masked booby and magnificent frigatebird, and the regular occurrence of Caribbean vagrant birds makes them a popular birding destination.|$|R

2500|$|The Norfolk Island Group Nepean Island [...] is {{also home}} to {{breeding}} seabirds. The providence petrel was hunted to local extinction {{by the beginning of the}} 19th century, but has shown signs of returning to breed on Phillip Island. Other seabirds breeding there include the white-necked petrel, Kermadec petrel, wedge-tailed shearwater, Australasian gannet, red-tailed tropicbird and grey ternlet. The <b>sooty</b> <b>tern</b> (known locally as the whale bird) has traditionally been subject to seasonal egg harvesting by Norfolk Islanders.|$|E
2500|$|Nineteen {{bird species}} are {{presently}} known on Toke Atoll. These include the reef heron, the migratory pectoral sandpiper and accidental {{examples of the}} spotted sandpiper and skua, for which Toke is their only sighting in Marshall Islands. Others include the resident [...] crested tern, <b>sooty</b> <b>tern,</b> brown noddy, black noddy, white tern, black-naped tern, and the migrant wedge-tailed shearwater, red-tailed tropicbird, red-footed booby, brown booby, great frigatebird, golden plover, bristle-thighed curlew, wandering tattler, and ruddy turnstone.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant can}} be used for Hawaiian {{ecosystem}} restoration and erosion control. <b>Sooty</b> <b>terns</b> and red-footed boobies use this plant as nesting material. The Hawaiian people used the wood of this plant to make shark hooks, and the cooked leaves were eaten like spinach.|$|R
50|$|Localities {{within the}} site include three Saint Helena plover {{breeding}} sites - Broad Bottom, Southern Pastures, and Man and Horse. Apart from red-billed tropicbirds, breeding seabirds include band-rumped storm petrels, Atlantic masked boobies, Atlantic <b>sooty</b> <b>terns,</b> brown and black noddies, white terns and, possibly, brown boobies.|$|R
50|$|Great {{frigatebirds}} {{will also}} hunt seabird chicks at their breeding colonies, taking mostly the chicks of <b>sooty</b> <b>terns,</b> spectacled terns, brown noddies and black noddies. Studies show that only females (adults and juveniles) hunt in this fashion, {{and only a}} few individuals account for most of the kills.|$|R
