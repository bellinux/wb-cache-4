50|$|In {{an attempt}} to revive his company’s {{flagging}} fortunes, Fred Francis began to look at alternatives. He was inspired by seeing model car racing tracks, but wanted to develop the player’s control of the car so as to increase the sense of competition. He experimented by putting small electric motors into Scalex cars and running them on model railway track. Next he introduced rubber <b>slotted</b> <b>track</b> and gave the cars a ‘gimbal’ wheel {{to pick up the}} electric current in the groove of the track. Original tin-plate cars had one hard plastic rear wheel and one rubber-tired wheel, with gave different handling characteristics depending on direction of travel on corners! Power was supplied by batteries hidden in a little cardboard hut, with players having their own on-off button to control their cars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of {{variable}} structure motorcycle helmet is proposed in this paper, in which that the helmet’s chin-guard can be transformed between the full-helmet status and the half-helmet status as needed. The helmet creatively adopts double movement nails and double track grooves to constraint the chin-guard movement according to the predetermined trajectory, and thus smoothly accomplishing the chin-guard’s lifting, climbing, passing zenith, falling and closing in the helmet shell. The paper introduces the chin-guard’s trajectory planning principles, realizing methods and designing steps, and then gives a design case for the constraint <b>slot</b> <b>tracks</b> in detail. The {{results show that the}} new type helmet can reliably realize helmet structure conversion between full-helmet and half-helmet and fully meets the design requirements...|$|R

50|$|The data {{structure}} and operation of a MiniDisc {{is similar to that}} of a computer's hard disk drive. The bulk of the disc contains data pertaining to the music itself, and a small section contains the table of contents (TOC), providing the playback device with vital information about the number and location of tracks on the disc. Tracks and discs can be named. Tracks may easily be added, erased, combined and divided, and their preferred order of playback modified. Erased tracks are not actually erased at the time, but are marked so. When a disc becomes full, the recorder can simply <b>slot</b> <b>track</b> data into sections where erased tracks reside. This can lead to some fragmentation but unless many erasures and replacements are performed, the only likely problem is excessive searching, reducing battery life.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} vacant parking <b>slot</b> {{detection}} and <b>tracking</b> system that fuses the sensors of an Around View Monitor (AVM) system and an ultrasonic sensor-based automatic parking system. The proposed system {{consists of three}} stages: parking slot marking detection, parking slot occupancy classifica-tion, and parking <b>slot</b> marking <b>tracking.</b> The parking <b>slot</b> marking detection stage recognizes various types of parking slot markings using AVM image sequences. It detects parking slots in individual AVM images by exploiting a hierarchical tree structure of park-ing slot markings and combines sequential detection results. The parking slot occupancy classification stage identifies vacancies of detected parking slots using ultrasonic sensor data. Parking slot occupancy is probabilistically calculated by treating each parking slot region as a single cell of the occupancy grid. The parking <b>slot</b> marking <b>tracking</b> stage continuously estimates {{the position of the}} selected parking slot while the ego-vehicle is moving into it. During tracking, AVM images and motion sensor-based odometry are fused together in the chamfer score level to achieve robustness against inevitable occlusions caused by the ego-vehicle. In the experiments, it is shown that the proposed method can recognize the positions and occupancies of various types of parking slot markings and stably track them under practical situations in a real-time manner. The proposed system is expected to help drivers conveniently select one of the available parking slots and support the parking control system by continuously updating the designated target positions.

40|$|The {{profiles}} for aluminium {{structures are}} usually obtained {{by means of}} extrusion process that, as well-known, allows many possibilities of cross-sectional shapes. In particular, extruded shapes can be customized according to the different possible uses by incorporating essential design features, such as stiffener, rib, bulbs, <b>slots</b> and <b>tracks.</b> These features can be exploited to conceive more rational joining systems by providing the cross-section with <b>slots</b> and <b>tracks</b> in which mechanical fasteners can be located. These systems, generally named "special joints", represent a very competitive solutions with respect to conventional joining systems thank {{to the possibility of}} easy and rapid execution, treatments and machining reduction. Special joints are mainly employed in complementary building structures, such as façades, support structures for solar panels, doors and windows frames. In the last years, other structural applications like staircases, floors, pedestrian bridge, industrial furniture and shelves have been developed involving special joints. Although special joints are widely used in structural applications, few literature about this topic is available and no clear design rules are provided by the main aluminium structural codes. As an attempt to overcome this lack of information, a research about the mechanical behaviour of special joints was undertaken at University of Naples Federico II with the financially support of METRA S. p. A. This paper presents the main results obtained for "screw port" e "bolt-channel" systems...|$|R
