5|$|<b>Scandium</b> {{is present}} {{in most of the}} {{deposits}} of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic <b>scandium,</b> which was first done in 1937, applications for <b>scandium</b> were not developed until the 1970s. The positive effects of <b>scandium</b> on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of <b>scandium</b> oxide is about 10 tonnes per year.|$|E
5|$|To produce {{metallic}} <b>scandium,</b> the oxide {{is converted}} to <b>scandium</b> fluoride and reduced with metallic calcium.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{that feature}} <b>scandium</b> in the {{oxidation}} state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 {{is one of}} the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. <b>Scandium</b> hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic <b>scandium</b> hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. <b>Scandium</b> borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>scandium</b> is {{considered}} non-toxic, though extensive animal testing of <b>scandium</b> compounds {{has not been}} done. The median lethal dose (LD50) levels for scandium(III) chloride for rats have been determined as 4mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 755mg/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results, compounds of <b>scandium</b> should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity.|$|E
5|$|In Earth's crust, <b>scandium</b> is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which is {{comparable}} to the abundance of cobalt (20–30ppm). <b>Scandium</b> is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, <b>scandium</b> is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of <b>scandium</b> in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>scandium</b> was {{produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and <b>scandium</b> chlorides, at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure <b>scandium</b> metal {{was produced}} in 1960. Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scandium</b> {{chemistry}} is almost completely {{dominated by the}} trivalent ion, Sc3+. The radii of M3+ ions in the table below indicate that the chemical properties of <b>scandium</b> ions {{have more in common}} with yttrium ions than with aluminium ions. In part because of this similarity, <b>scandium</b> is often classified as a lanthanide-like element.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scandium</b> has no {{biological}} role, but it {{is found}} in living organisms. Once reached a human, <b>scandium</b> concentrates in the liver and {{is a threat to}} it; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic, even through in general <b>scandium</b> is not toxic. <b>Scandium</b> is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1micrograms per day. Once released into the environment, <b>scandium</b> gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, animals and humans. <b>Scandium</b> is mostly dangerous in the working environment, {{due to the fact that}} damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Some tables, {{including}} the one published by IUPAC refer to all lanthanides and actinides as being in group 3: 30 lanthanide and actinide elements together with <b>scandium</b> and yttrium. Lanthanides, as electropositive trivalent metals, all have a closely related chemistry, and all show many similarities to <b>scandium</b> and yttrium, but they also show additional properties characteristic of their partially filled f-orbitals which are not common to <b>scandium</b> and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|The main {{application}} of <b>scandium</b> by weight is in aluminium-scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components. These alloys contain between 0.1% and 0.5% of <b>scandium.</b> They {{were used in}} the Russian military aircraft, specifically the MiG-21 and MiG-29.|$|E
5|$|The world {{production}} of <b>scandium</b> {{is in the}} order of 10 tonnes per year, in the form of <b>scandium</b> oxide. The demand is about 50% higher, and both the production and demand keep increasing. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare-earth mines in Bayan Obo, China, and the apatite mines in the Kola peninsula, Russia; since then many other countries have built scandium-producing facilities. In each case <b>scandium</b> is a byproduct from the extraction of other elements and is sold as <b>scandium</b> oxide.|$|E
5|$|Because of its rarity, it {{is among}} the most {{expensive}} elements. Price for pure <b>scandium</b> fluctuates between 4 000 and 20 000 US dollars per kilogram. Meanwhile, the limited market generates a variety of prices at any given time. In 2010, {{at the peak of the}} rare-earths shortage, the price of <b>scandium</b> rose to over 15,000 US dollars per kilogram, and the widely commercially used <b>scandium</b> oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per kilogram. Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.|$|E
5|$|Some {{items of}} sports equipment, which rely on {{high-performance}} materials, {{have been made}} with scandium-aluminium alloys, including baseball bats and bicycle frames and components. Lacrosse sticks are also made with <b>scandium.</b> The American firearm manufacturing company Smith & Wesson produces semi-automatic pistols and revolvers with frames of <b>scandium</b> alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of <b>scandium</b> compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship {{exists between the}} behavior of magnesium and <b>scandium,</b> {{just as there is}} between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.|$|E
5|$|The stable form of <b>scandium</b> {{is created}} in supernovas via the r-process.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar and Iveland-Evje {{region in}} Norway have the only {{deposits}} of minerals with high <b>scandium</b> content, thortveitite (Sc,Y)2(Si2O7) and kolbeckite ScPO4·2H2O, {{but these are}} not being exploited.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scandium</b> is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. <b>Scandium</b> turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scandium</b> is {{distributed}} sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as gadolinite, euxenite, and thortveitite {{are the only}} known concentrated sources of this element, the latter containing up to 45% of <b>scandium</b> {{in the form of}} scandium(III) oxide. Yttrium has the same trend in occurrence places; it is found in lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project in a relatively high content as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioactive}} isotope 46Sc {{is used in}} oil refineries as a tracing agent. <b>Scandium</b> triflate is a catalytic Lewis acid used in organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The α- and γ- {{forms of}} <b>scandium</b> oxide {{hydroxide}} (ScO(OH)), are isostructural with their aluminium oxide hydroxide counterparts. Solutions of Sc3+ in water are acidic because of hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. <b>Scandium</b> (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only <b>scandium</b> and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group; chemical properties of both actinium and especially lawrencium are not well-characterized. The remaining elements of the group (<b>scandium,</b> yttrium, lutetium) are reactive metals with high melting points (1541°C, 1526°C, 1652°C respectively). They are usually oxidized to the +3 oxidation state, even through <b>scandium,</b> yttrium and lanthanum can form lower oxidation states. The reactivity of the elements, especially yttrium, is not always obvious due to the formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. Scandium(III) oxide, yttrium(III) oxide, lanthanum(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide are white high-temperature-melting solids. Yttrium(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide exhibit weak basic character, but scandium(III) oxide is amphoteric. Lanthanum(III) oxide is strongly basic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scandium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21. A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it {{has historically been}} classified as a rare earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scandium,</b> yttrium, lanthanum, and {{lutetium}} tend {{to occur}} {{together with the}} other lanthanides (except promethium) tend to occur together in the Earth's crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30parts per million (ppm); the abundance of <b>scandium</b> is 16ppm, while that of lutetium is about 0.5ppm. The abundance of lanthanum is greater, being about 35ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50ppm, that of chromium is 160ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5ppm.|$|E
5|$|The most {{available}} {{element in}} group 3 is yttrium, with annual production of 8,900tonnes in 2010. Yttrium is mostly produced as oxide, {{by a single}} country, China (99%). Lutetium and <b>scandium</b> are also mostly obtained as oxides, and their annual production by 2001 was about 10 and 2tonnes, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (<b>scandium,</b> yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, <b>scandium</b> and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners <b>scandium</b> and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to <b>scandium,</b> yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of <b>scandium</b> {{range from}} 36Sc to 60Sc. The primary decay mode at masses {{lower than the}} only stable isotope, 45Sc, is electron capture, and the primary mode at masses above it is beta emission. The primary decay products at atomic weights below 45Sc are calcium isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are titanium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of titanium {{range in}} atomic weight from 39.99 u (40Ti) to 57.966 u (58Ti). The primary decay mode before {{the most abundant}} stable isotope, 48Ti, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before 48Ti are element 21 (<b>scandium)</b> isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 (vanadium) isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The trends {{going down}} from <b>scandium</b> and yttrium to {{lanthanum}} {{tend to be}} more similar to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from <b>scandium</b> and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, {{lanthanum}} {{has been placed}} under <b>scandium</b> and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} yttrium {{and to a lesser extent}} <b>scandium</b> are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also goes into a d-orbital, both lutetium and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, <b>scandium,</b> yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends going down the group for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, {{are similar to those}} found among their group 4–8 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of all {{elements}} {{is based on}} properties of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, in range of oxidation states) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to <b>scandium</b> and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus {{reviewed the}} definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include <b>scandium</b> (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, indium, and osmium (too rare).|$|E
5|$|In other tables, {{lutetium}} and lawrencium {{are classified}} as the remaining members of group 3. In these tables, lutetium and lawrencium end (or sometimes succeed) the lanthanide and actinide series, respectively. Since the f-shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals, they behave most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals {{compared to the other}} lanthanides and actinides, and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of <b>scandium</b> and yttrium. However, this resemblance in not unique to lutetium and lawrencium, but is common among all the late lanthanides and actinides.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{chemical}} behaviour, and trends going down group 3 for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, <b>scandium,</b> yttrium, lanthanum and actinium {{are similar to}} their group 1–2 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the most common (trivalent) ions of the f-block elements consistently matches {{their position in the}} f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the trivalent ions of the first three f-block elements are Ce 1, Pr 2 and Nd 3.|$|E
