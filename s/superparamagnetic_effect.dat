The heat reduces the coercivity of the material, hence allowing the head to write on materials with higher coercivity, which in turn allow for smaller grain size which is limited by the <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> hence increasing the maximum possible areal density. The net effect of HAMR is to allow writing on a much smaller scale than before, greatly increasing the amount of data that can be held on a standard disk platter.|$|E

Both samples were prepared by rf magnetron sputtering. Parts of them were rapidly annealed at 600, 650, and 750 °C. All samples displayed giant magnetoresistivity which decays from its maximum value with a Tm behavior, with m' 0. 8 – 0. 9, suggesting that the decrease in the maximum magnetoresistivity {{is due to the}} reduction in the particle magnetization associated with the spin wave excitation, which is a different mechanism to the electron-magnon interaction responsible for the T dependence of GMR in magnetic multilayers. Magnetoresistivity r M decreases with temperature sharing essentially the same temperature decrease as the square of the macroscopic magnetization M in the whole magnetic field range studied, which is due to the reduction in the particle magnetization and to <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effects.</b> The {{effect of the}} width of the particle size distribution and interparticle interactions on the linear relation r M vs M 2 are discussed. Care should be taken when representing r M /r(T,H 50) vs (M/Ms) 2 because the strong temperature-dependent slope shown in these plots is mainly due to the temperature dependence of both the resistivity r(T,H 50) and Ms, and it is not an intrinsic T dependence of GMR in granular alloys. Experimental results suggest that in granular materials, magnetoresistivity is dominated by magnetic moments at the surface of the particles, which also play a very important role in the demagnetization processes, and small magnetic particles.

40|$|Abstract. The idea of {{establishing}} coherent relaxation in an assembly of magnetic moments by {{placing it in}} a passive resonator [1, 2] {{is applied to the}} case of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles. The magnetodynamics of a particle is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz equation modified by adding the resonator feedback field. The particle uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and the interparticle dipole-dipole interactions are taken into account. We consider an assembly of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles maintained at a temperature that is sufficiently low, so that <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effects</b> could be neglected. The particles magnetic moments are initially aligned and then a constant magnetic field H 0 in an opposite direction is applied compelling the system to invert its magnetization. Therefore, the magnetodynamics of the system starts from a strongly non-equilibrium state tending to a complete inversion of the magnetization. The particle assembly is placed into a resonator, which we model by an LCR circuit. As soon as the relaxation motion of the magnetic moments sets out, it induces in the coil (L) an electromotive force, which, in turn, generates an AC current in the circuit. The magnetic field of this current acts on the magnetic moments of the particles thus modifying their individual relaxation behavior.

Introduction of newer method such as E-beam, X-ray lithography etc. has demonstrated possibility of scaling to lower dimensions. However most of these methods are too expensive, too complex or too slow. Hence a method is required which can provide high resolutions at low cost, is easy to implement and can be integrated with current processing technologies. Block copolymer self assembly promises to do just that. An immiscible block copolymer will microphase separate into individual domains due to unfavorable mixing enthalpy. These microphase-separated blocks can have domain sizes of very low dimensions, {{to the order of}} 15 - 20 nms. By careful preparation, microphase-separated thin films of immiscible block copolymers can act as nanomasks for a variety of applications in electronic, optoelectronic and storage media fields. One such application is patterned media. With ever increasing areal densities, {{there is a limit to}} which the grain size within a bit can be decreased, for a conventional thin film media. Beyond a certain limit, which is dictated by the <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect,</b> these grains will spontaneously reverse, resulting in undesired data loss. Patterned media has been proposed as an alternative to surpass this thermal instability criterion. In patterned media, lithographically defined nano-scale magnetic elements form single bits onto which the data is stored. Due to its unique structure in which each magnetic dots act as a single magnetic domain it can postpone the arrival of <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> beyond densities much higher than 10 Terabits/inch².

The wide range of possible architectures and the unique performance characteristics of probe-based storage require that standard file system algorithms for disks, including scheduling and layout, must be revisited to determine their efficiency domain.

40|$|For {{the past}} 50 years, the {{magnetic}} storage {{industry has been}} the ultimate provider, covering the ever-expanding needs of digital mass storage. Up to now, scaling to smaller dimensions has been the core approach for achieving higher areal densities in conventional media. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that further miniaturisation is physically bound by <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Bit patterned media (BPM) {{is one of the most}} promising solutions for extending the areal densities beyond 1 Tbit/in². The ability to magnetically characterise novel BPM is a key requirement for its future commercialisation. The work presented in this thesis describes the investigation of the Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) and the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) techniques, used in the characterisation of BPM samples. These samples were produced as part of this work using a customised subtractive fabrication process. Continuous thin magnetic films with Ptseed(10 nm) /[Co(0. 4 nm) /Pt(1 nm) ]x 15 composition and perpendicular anisotropy, were deposited using electron-beam (e-beam) evaporation, and subsequently patterned into magnetic nano-islands through means of e-beam lithography and Ar⁺ ion milling. In terms of the MOKE technique, a fully customised polar MOKE system has been developed and successfully used to observe the hysteretic behaviour of magnetic nano-island arrays with varying dimensions. An expected reduction in the MOKE signal due to pattering has been observed, as well as an additional signal reduction due to the scattering effect arising from the non-vertical sidewalls of the dome-shaped islands. In the case of islands with improved shape profile, the magnetic reversal of BPM arrays with islands sizes down to 35 nm has been successfully detected, demonstrating a sensitivity of approximately 6 x 10 ⁻¹³emu for the MOKE system. In terms of the AHE technique, Au Hall crosses were deposited on top of the BPM arrays that had been previously characterised by MOKE, allowing the direct comparison and cross-verification of the results obtained by the two techniques. A revised Hall cross design, where the Hall crosses were generated by direct patterning of the Pt seed layer, has provided a significant improvement in AHE signal. This has allowed the detection of the magnetic reversal of individual sub- 50 nm magnetic islands, demonstrating a sensitivity of approximately 6. 6 x 10 ⁻¹⁵emu for the AHE technique. The spatial sensitivity of these Hall cross structures has been experimentally determined, indicating a decrease in sensitivity with increasing distance from the cross centre and with decreasing island diameter. In conclusion, the sensitivity profile of Hall cross structures must be taken into account for the accurate interpretation of BPM characterisation results obtained by the AHE technique. Finally, some suggestions are outlined with regard to the future improvement of the developed characterisation techniques and the further continuation of the work presented in this thesis.

40|$|As {{the data}} storage density in cutting edge microelectronic devices {{continues}} to increase, the <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> poses {{a problem for}} magnetic data storage media.

It is also possible, however, to use other kinds of media for thermomechanical data storage, and in the following work, we explore the possibility of using thin film Ni-Ti shape memory alloy (SMA).

We employ preparation routes that are based on (i) self-assembly of Au nanoparticles and (ii) homogeneous size-reduction of self-assembled polystyrene particles. On such non-close-packed nanostructures thin Fe films or Co/Pt multilayers are grown with in-plane and out-of-plane easy axis of magnetization. The impact of the particles on the magnetic switching behavior is measured by both integral magnetometry and magnetic microscopy techniques. We observe enhanced coercive fields while the switching field distribution is broadened compared to thin-film reference samples.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of storage media with highest bit densities {{is vital for}} modern computer technol-ogy. In conventional magnetic storage media, information is stored in a granular medium, where several grains form a bit. The information is given by {{the orientation of the}} magnetization in the grains. This imposes certain limits onto the possible storage capability, which is given by the bit density of the medium. Reducing the number of grains increases the signal-to-noise ratio, while a further decrease of the grain size is prevented by the superparamagnetic limit. The maximum bit density reached with this method is currently about 1000 Gbit/inch 2. A possible improvement in bit size might be reached with a patterned medium where the bits consist of single homogeneously magnetized object instead of a certain amount of grains. In this case, the volume of each object is relevant rather than the volume of a single grain. This method has three advantages: Firstly, the onset of the <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> is shifted to signiÞcantly smaller sizes.

The increase of the internal relaxation induces higher coupling of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of grain with important consequences to thermal trapping of grains. In terms of the alignment of grains by radiative torques, which is currently is the prefered mechanism for alignment, first of all, the enhanced Barnett magnetization induces faster Larmor precession of grains, which affects, for instance, {{the moment when the}} radiative torque alignment occurs in respect to light direction rather than the direction of magnetic fields. More importantly, we show that the alignment of grains with superparamagnetic inclusions is different from that of ordinary paramagnetic grains.

The principal objectives are to test alternative methodologies for quantitative modeling and inversion to extract the spatial variation of IP parameters using the inductively thin-sheet model. The methods tested first fit, by nonnegative least squares, an AEM decay to the early delay time data, using thin-sheet basis functions. This modeled AEM decay is assumed to represent the IP source. It is then convolved with a few Cole-Cole models spanning the range of parameter sensitivity to get IP basis functions appropriate for the AEM excitation. Method 1 fits a linear sum of several AEM basis functions plus one IP basis function at a time and chooses the model with least-fitting error at late delay times. Method 2 fits a linear sum of several IP and several AEM basis functions. Both methods fit IP affected airborne data well, with normalized fitting errors being reduced by a significant factor when IP affects the data and is taken into account. Using penalty weights, <b>superparamagnetic</b> (SPM) <b>effects</b> can be simultaneously estimated in the fitting process. Without such weighting, SPM and IP parameter estimations are unstable. Cole-Cole models predict that the sensitivity of inductive airborne IP collected at 25 or 30 Hz base frequency indicates little overlap with galvanic ground IP collected with a 0. 125 Hz waveform.

Among them, the most promising in this stage of evolution of magnetic recording {{seems to be the}} magnetic recording media with thermal stabilization layers and the recording media comprising monodisperse high-anisotropy nanoparticles in a self-organized patterning. Both these types of media have been found to have higher thermal stability (delaying the <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect),</b> low noise and higher signal resolution which, in turn, led to higher areal density and a better signal-to-noise ratio. The media with thermal stabilization layers consist of two antiferromagnetically coupled ferro-magnetic layers. Their higher areal density and better thermal stability are due to the reduced value of the so-called magnetic thickness Mrδ (Mr – remanent magnetization, δ – layer thickness) and to the increased grain volume as compared to conventional (monolayer) media. On the other hand, the self-organized patterned media permit the better control of the film surface, of the uniformity of the composition, of the geometry of constituent nanoparticles and their magnetic easy axis orientation which led to the improvement of recording properties. Understanding the magnetic properties of these media ensures the control of the reversal and stability of these systems, and is essential in determining their storage potential and in achieving their design...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties and {{the correlation between}} the magnetic and geometric structures of Ni and Fe clusters on sapphire were studied. The {{magnetic properties}} were investigated by ferromagnetic resonance under UHV conditions, and the geometrical structures were conducted for Ni samples by AFM experiments under UHV conditions and ex-situ SEM experiments. The system of high coverage of Ni on Al 2 O 3 (11 - 20) shows a narrow ferromagnetic resonance signal due to a magnetic well ordered two-dimensional film. This film is characterized by a strong uniaxial out-of-plane anisotropy which aligns the magnetisation parallel to the substrate. The origin of this strong anisotropy is a substrate induced anisotropy due to the misfit between Ni and the surface of the substrate. After annealing the film breaks up and forms large clusters in the range of 50 - 100 nm, causing an increase in the FMR linewidth which can be understood as the influence of clusters with different sizes and shapes. Concurrently, we observe a decrease of effective anisotropy. Cooling of this system leads to a reorientation of magnetisation from the parallel to the perpendicular direction relative to the substrate. This spin reorientation transition is due to the balance of shape anisotropy which favours a magnetisation parallel to the substrate and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy which favours in this case a magnetisation perpendicular to the substrate. Additionally, we investigated the small cluster in the range of a few Å nominal coverage. AFM measurements performed on Ni on Al 2 O 3 (0001) (√ 31 ×√ 31) R± 9 ° revealed a three-dimensional growth mode. After annealing the FMR intensity increased, due to coalescence and crystallisation of clusters. The coalesced clusters were larger as compared to clusters in the non-annealed sample. Larger clusters show a smaller <b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect.</b> This leads to an increase of the intensity. The crystalline structure of clusters showed the formation of ordered, low index surfaces with relatively high packing density compared with the non-annealed sample. This causes a more effective ferromagnetic coupling of the atoms in the cluster and an increase of the magnetic moment of the cluster. This interpretation was confirmed by AFM measurements of Ni. A splitting of the FMR signal was observed after annealing, which was interpreted as the influence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The temperature dependence of the magnetic moment of an ensemble of small Ni clusters on sapphire shows a Curie-like behaviour. The Curie temperature of clusters depends on the cluster size and is lower than the Curie temperature of Ni in the bulk and higher than the Curie temperature of Ni thin films of comparable coverage. This can be understood by a model which connects the Curie temperature with the average coordination number. In contrast to Ni, the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment of an ensemble of small Fe clusters on reconstructed Al 2 O 3 (0001) (√ 31 ×√ 31) R± 9 ° exhibit a Langevin-like behaviour. This can be interpreted by a model based on the thermal fluctuation of the magnetic moment of small single domain clusters (<b>superparamagnetic</b> <b>effect)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) technique is a promising tool that improves cancer detection, facilitates diagnosis and monitors therapeutic <b>effects.</b> <b>Superparamagnetic</b> iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) have emerged as MRI contrast agents for tumor imaging and as potential vectors for targeted anti-cancer drug delivery; nevertheless, the application of SPIOs has been hampered {{due to a lack}} of specificity to tumor tissues and premature drug release. This project aims at developing multifunctional SPIOs for both cancer imaging and targeted drug delivery via conjugation of tumor specific antibodies with SPIOs. The application of anti-TAG- 72 antibodies as tumor targeting modalities was evaluated in cultured colorectal cancer cells and in xenograft models by using fluorescent imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. It was demonstrated that antibody-labeled SPIOs were superior imaging agents and drug carriers for increased tumor specificity. The regulation and kinetics of intracellular drug release from SPIOs were explored by means of fluorescence imaging. In vitro and in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging was employed to investigate the mechanisms of premature drug release from nanocarriers. The large volume and high hydrophobicity of cell membranes were found to play an important role in premature drug release. The encapsulation of SPIOs into nanocarriers decreased drug release in a dose-dependent mode. This study provided future opportunities to improve the efficiency of nanocarriers by exploring the mechanism of drug release and disassembly of SPIO-loaded polymeric nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} have attracted a broad interest for applications in scientific and engineering fields {{due to their}} extraordinary properties stemming from the nanoscale dimensions. This dissertation presents the development of nanomaterials used for different applications, namely biomedicine and dye lasing. Various inorganic nanoparticles have been developed as contrast agents for non-invasive medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray computed tomography (CT), owing to their unique properties for efficient contrasting <b>effect.</b> <b>Superparamagnetic</b> iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are synthesized by thermo-decomposition method and phase-transferred to be hydrophilic used as MRI T 2 (negative) contrast agents. Effects of surface modification of SPIONs by mesoporous silica (mSiO 2) coating have been examined on the magnetic relaxivities. These contrast agents (Fe 3 O 4 @mSiO 2) {{were found to have}} a coating-thickness dependent relaxation behavior and exhibit much higher contrast efficiency than that for the commercial ones. By growing thermo-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide -co-acrylamide) (P(NIPAAm-co-AAm)) as the outermost layer on Fe 3 O 4 @mSiO 2 through free radical polymerization, a multifunctional core-shell nano-composite has been built up. Responding to the temperature change, these particles demonstrate phase transition behavior and were used for thermo-triggered magnetic separation. Their lower critical solution temperature (LCST) can be subtly tuned from ca. 34 to ca. 42 ˚C, suitable for further in vivo applications. An all-in-one contrast agent for MRI, CT and fluorescence imaging has been synthesized by depositing gadolinium oxide carbonate hydrate [Gd 2 O(CO 3) 2 ·H 2 O] shell on mSiO 2 -coated gold nanorod (Au NR), and then the particles were grafted with antibiofouling copolymer which can further link with the fluorescent dye. It shows both a higher CT and MRI contrast than the clinical iodine and gadolinium chelate contrast agent, respectively. Apart from the imaging application, owing to the morphology of Au NR, the particle has a plasmonic property of absorbing near-infrared (NIR) irradiation and suitable for future photothermal therapy. Cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of aforementioned nanoparticles have been evaluated and minor negative effects were found, which support their further development for medical applications. Gold nanoparticles embedded in the optical gain material, water solution of Rhodamine 6 G (Rh 6 G) in particular, used in dye lasers can both increase and damp the dye fluorescence, thus, changing the laser output intensity. The studies of size effect and coating of gold nanoparticles on photostability of the gain media reveal that small sized (ca. 5. 5 nm) gold nanoparticles are found detrimental to the photostability, while for the larger ones (ca. 25 nm) fluorescence enhancement rather than quenching is likely to occur. And a noticeable improvement of the photostability for the gain material is achieved when gold is coated with SiO 2. QC 2012060...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, a {{remarkable}} {{progress has been}} witnessed {{in the development of}} affinity biosensors and their applications in areas such as medical diagnostics, drug screening, environmental monitoring, biotechnology, food safety, and security. Trace amounts of specific bio molecules may indicate the presence of a disease or may have a life threatening effect to some individuals, hence accurate monitoring, with high frequency and accuracy, has become a necessity in many sectors. Optical affinity biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) present one of the most advanced label-free optical sensing technologies. Their ability to monitor the interaction between a molecule immobilized {{to the surface of the}} sensor and the interacting molecular partner in a solution have made SPR sensors a very powerful tool for biomolecular interaction analysis. One of the drawbacks of a typical SPR sensing instrument is its cost, its bulky size and the presence of various optical and mechanical (moving) parts, which make it difficult to optimize and commercialize it on a large scale, e. g. for biosensor applications. Miniaturization of SPR components is a key factor which can be achieved by using optical fibers. Recently, the MeBioS-Biosensor research group (www. biosensors. be) of the K. U. Leuven has developed an innovative technology based on fiber optic surface plasmon resonance. The biosensor has a great potential as reusable, cost-effective and label free biosensor for measuring antibody-antigen, DNA hybridization and DNA-protein interactions as has been demonstrated in a recently published paper (Pollet et al., 2009. Biosensors and Bioelectronics). The fiber optic sensor is a versatile platform with many applications for medical diagnostics, food quality and safety and environmental diagnostics. Examples include disease biomarker detection, food toxin and pathogen detection, and analysis of polluted surface waters. The technology might even be implemented in handheld point of care devices. A raising important challenge for the food industry with both societal and economic impact is food allergy detection. Accurate and reliable product information is essential to inform a rising number of food allergic patients. Tracing allergens, however, is not obvious, since they generally occur in very low quantities, hidden in a food matrix. In this research we present the development of a cost-effective surface plasmon resonance probe for peanut allergen detection. In order to further improve the detection limit and to deal with variable matrix <b>effects,</b> <b>superparamagnetic</b> nanobeads are used to purify and concentrate allergens from different extracts of chocolate samples. The use of MNB as carriers for the allergen proteins, also strongly amplifies the SPR response, and opens the door towards subnanomolar detection limits. The low detection limit provide producers and policy makers with a tool to correctly inform, warn and protect the potential allergic consumers. status: accepte...|$|R
