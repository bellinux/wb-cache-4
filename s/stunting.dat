5|$|Through {{ecological}} {{modeling and}} retrospective studies, {{research has shown}} a link between bee colony collapse and climate change. Although the shifting weather conditions themselves negatively affect bees, the link between colony collapse and climate change is also {{closely tied to the}} interaction between bees’ climatic niches and food-plant reductions. Climate change affects the floral environment by <b>stunting</b> flower development and nectar production, which in turn directly impacts colonies’ abilities to collect pollen and sustain themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause <b>stunting</b> of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid {{significant}} damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E

50|$|When {{a player}} {{does not wish}} to create a <b>stunt</b> from scratch, he or she may go to the <b>Stunt</b> Coordinator on <b>Stunt</b> Island. The <b>Stunt</b> Coordinator {{possesses}} a built-in list of 32 <b>stunt</b> scenes. If the player is participating in the optional <b>Stunt</b> Pilot of the Year competition, these <b>stunts</b> must be completed to improve ranking.|$|R

50|$|A <b>stunt</b> coordinator, {{usually an}} {{experienced}} <b>stunt</b> performer, is hired by a TV, film or theatre director or production company for <b>stunt</b> casting {{that is to}} arrange the casting (<b>stunt</b> players and <b>stunt</b> doubles) and performance of <b>stunts</b> for a film, television programme or a live audience.|$|R
25|$|Besides having landlocked, rugged geography, few {{tangible}} {{natural resources}} and poor infrastructure, the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in <b>stunting</b> the nation's economic growth and development.|$|E
25|$|Particulate matter can clog stomatal {{openings}} {{of plants}} and interfere with photosynthesis functions. In this manner high particulate matter concentrations in the atmosphere can lead to growth <b>stunting</b> or mortality in some plant species.|$|E
25|$|Canutt {{tried to}} get into directing; he was growing older and knew his <b>stunting</b> days were numbered. Harry Joe, Canutt's second son, was born in January 1937. Joe and Tap would become {{important}} stuntmen, working with their father.|$|E

50|$|The second <b>stunt</b> {{was meant}} to mentally {{challenge}} the contestants. The three most common types of <b>stunts</b> {{in the second round}} were eating <b>stunts,</b> animal <b>stunts,</b> and retrieval <b>stunts.</b> Eating <b>stunts</b> entailed ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple gross items; animal <b>stunts</b> entailed immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, snakes, or worms).|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{the first}} [...] "World <b>Stunt</b> Awards" [...] were {{presented}} in Los Angeles by actor Alec Baldwin. The event had A-list stars presenting the statues to Hollywood's unsung heroes. Arnold Schwarzenegger was presented with the first [...] "Lifetime Achievement" [...] award. He presented the awards in 2001. The awards show hands out eight awards: Best Fight, Best Fire <b>Stunt,</b> Best High Work, Best Overall <b>Stunt</b> by a <b>Stunt</b> Man, Best Overall <b>Stunt</b> by a <b>Stunt</b> Woman, Best Speciality <b>Stunt,</b> Best Work with a Vehicle and Best <b>Stunt</b> Coordinator and/or 2nd Unit Director.|$|R
25|$|Undernutrition {{encompasses}} {{stunted growth}} (<b>stunting),</b> wasting, and deficiencies of essential {{vitamins and minerals}} (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term hunger, which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, {{has been used to}} describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.|$|E
25|$|Disciplinary {{problems}} annoyed his commander, but Beurling {{was promoted}} to flight lieutenant. However, his <b>stunting</b> of a de Havilland Tiger Moth at zero feet over his airfield eventually led to his Wing Commander, Hugh Godefroy, threatening him with a court martial. Subsequently, Beurling was transferred to 126 Wing HQ and then to 412 Squadron.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Canutt's {{first son}} Edward Clay {{was born and}} nicknamed 'Tap', short for Tapadero, a Spanish word for a stirrup covering. It was in 1932 that Canutt broke his {{shoulder}} in four places while trying to transfer from horse to wagon team. Though work was scarce, he got by combining <b>stunting</b> and rodeo work.|$|E
50|$|Where the {{programme}} {{requires a}} <b>stunt,</b> and {{involves the use}} of <b>stunt</b> performers, the <b>stunt</b> coordinator arranges casting and performance for the <b>stunt,</b> working closely with the television director.|$|R
50|$|The normal format {{involves}} {{three men}} and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who have to complete three professional <b>stunts</b> to win US$50,000. If a contestant/team is too scared to attempt a <b>stunt,</b> failed to complete a <b>stunt,</b> or (in some cases) had the worst performance on a <b>stunt,</b> they are eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completes the first or the second <b>stunt,</b> they automatically win $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the <b>stunt</b> along with {{the winner of the}} <b>stunt</b> return for the next <b>stunt</b> to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second <b>stunt,</b> then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the <b>stunt</b> would return to the next <b>stunt</b> to compete for a reduced $25,000 (this rule did not apply for non-elimination <b>stunts).</b> The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the <b>stunt,</b> then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the film}} {{requires}} a <b>stunt,</b> and {{involves the use}} of <b>stunt</b> performers, the <b>Stunt</b> Coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the <b>stunt,</b> working closely with the Director.|$|R
25|$|At 412 Squadron, Beurling again {{came into}} {{conflict}} with his commander for <b>stunting</b> and his lack of teamwork, leading to his eventual grounding. He claimed his last kill on 30 December, shooting down and wounding Uzz. Wyrich of 5 Staffel, JG 26 flying a Fw 190, when the squadron was covering returning American bombers near Compiègne, France.|$|E
25|$|Swine flu {{has been}} {{reported}} numerous times as a zoonosis in humans, usually with limited distribution, rarely with a widespread distribution. Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry, primarily by causing <b>stunting</b> and extended time to market. For example, this disease costs the British meat industry about £65 million every year.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{it had to}} be {{considered}} that a sudden halting or <b>stunting</b> of the movement of merchandise, as would occur with a large and sudden vacating of the cargo-transportation workforce, would have similar consequences. Even the 1974 nationwide speed-limit reduction to 55mph, which merely slowed the movement of merchandise, was followed by the recession of the late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stunts</b> {{were all}} similar to Beat the Clock <b>stunts,</b> {{but they were}} all {{designed}} to be messy. Sometimes Johnathan would perform another magic trick prior to the <b>stunt.</b> Many <b>stunts</b> often awarded around $500 to be split amongst the teams, and some <b>stunts</b> allowed for bonus money.|$|R
50|$|In <b>Stunts</b> mode, the player, {{in order}} to win, must {{accumulate}} the highest amount of points by performing successful <b>stunts.</b> To perform a <b>stunt,</b> a rider must gain enough height in mid-air and then is able to perform any of the six <b>stunts.</b> A failed <b>stunt</b> results from the rider crashing while attempting to perform a <b>stunt.</b> In <b>stunts,</b> there is no restriction as to where the player may go, and so he may also roam freely across the map.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{the film}} {{requires}} a <b>stunt,</b> and {{involves the use}} of <b>stunt</b> performers, the <b>stunt</b> coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the <b>stunt,</b> working closely with the director and the 1st AD.|$|R
25|$|In humans, an {{unhealthy}} diet can cause deficiency-related {{diseases such as}} blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition {{can lead to the}} wasting of kwashiorkor in acute cases, and the <b>stunting</b> of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 2002, {{after a day}} of <b>stunting</b> with {{construction}} noises, the quadcast adopted a Tropical music format branded Rumba 107. The format was ill-suited to the quadcast suburban signals, {{and at the end of}} the year, Big City Radio filed for bankruptcy and sold the quadcast to Nassau Broadcasting. Nassau broke up the quadcast, leasing WYNY to Pamal Broadcasting under a Local marketing agreement (LMA).|$|E
25|$|John Conrad Waterlow {{established}} a new classification for malnutrition. Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age {{to show the}} <b>stunting</b> that results from chronic malnutrition. One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.|$|E
50|$|Muay Thai <b>Stunt</b> is a Thailand-based {{group of}} <b>stunt</b> doubles, formed by Panna Rittikrai to work {{alongside}} him on action films. Members of the <b>stunt</b> team are skilled in acrobatics and gymnastics, weapons-related fighting arts, Muay Thai and other martial arts including Wushu and Tae Kwon Do. The <b>stunt</b> team specializes in fight choreography, fall <b>stunts,</b> wire-work, vehicular <b>stunts</b> and explosion <b>stunts.</b> A trademark of Panna's films {{is the use}} of full contact rather than pulling punches or the use of camera tricks in the fight scenes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{actors are}} known to have {{performed}} their own <b>stunts.</b> Jackie Chan is particularly famous for doing most of his own <b>stunts,</b> as are fellow martial arts star and movie partners Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung. Indian actor Jayan was well known for performing extremely dangerous <b>stunts</b> by himself and was killed while performing a helicopter <b>stunt.</b> Akshay Kumar is also famous for doing all of his own <b>stunts</b> and has done several dangerous <b>stunts.</b> Thai martial artist and actor Tony Jaa performs his own <b>stunts,</b> likewise.|$|R

During Italy's final victorious offensive at Vittorio Veneto, the naval squadron delivered overland strikes in support of the Italian Army. On 2 November 1918, a <b>stunting</b> squadron member named Pagliacci realized that the city below, Trieste, was devoid of retreating enemy forces. The pilot landed and was the first Italian serviceman to re-enter the city.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{and hunters}} {{continue}} to work together for the best good of all concerned parties: the reindeer, the hunters, the general populace of Greenland, and the very sensitive and vulnerable range grounds, since Greenland's tundra is more sensitive than elsewhere in the Arctic due to the ever-present inland ice sheet. This ice sheet acts like an open refrigerator door, <b>stunting</b> the growth of vegetation along the coastal regions and making recovery a slow process.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} poverty in Tanzania is very high. Tanzania has made little {{progress}} towards reducing extreme hunger and malnutrition. The 2010 Global Hunger Index ranks the situation as “alarming”. Children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger, although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both <b>stunting</b> and underweight. Low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment; limited access to farm inputs, extension services and credit; limited technology as well as trade and marketing support; and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources.|$|E

5000|$|Mixed Team and Individual <b>Stunts</b> (Seasons two, five, and six):In most episodes, contestants competed {{individually}} or in teams of {{two for the}} entire competition. However, there were three episodes in which contestants paired up into teams for the first and/or second <b>stunt</b> but competed individually in the final <b>stunt.</b> The first instance of this was a Season 2 episode in which three pairs of twins competed as teams in the first <b>stunt,</b> and competed individually {{the second and third}} <b>stunts.</b> In Season 5's [...] "New York vs. L.A." [...] episode, the first <b>stunt</b> narrowed a pool of eight contestants down to four (one man and one woman from each city); contestants from the same city then teamed up in the second <b>stunt,</b> and all contestants competed as individuals in the final <b>stunt.</b> A Season 6 celebrity episode had contestants competing as teams in the first two <b>stunts</b> and individually in the final <b>stunt.</b> In the latter episode, contestants were allowed to attempt the <b>stunts</b> alone if their partner quit before the <b>stunt</b> started.|$|R
