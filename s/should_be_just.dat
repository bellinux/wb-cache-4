25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a television receiver designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the intermediate frequency stage of a superheterodyne system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as easily adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts pulse-to-pulse, and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency step-down like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After trying a variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E

Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes noted the song {{as some of the}} album's generic work, stating, [...] "with its run-of-the-mill lyrics about longing hearts, it sounds like the work of any middling R singer." [...] Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said [...] "I Need A Girl" [...] was among the album's best songs, that it and [...] "Neighbors Know My Name", [...] "thump as they should." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic noted the song as a standout track from Ready. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that on the track, Songz [...] "displays a more flexible delivery than usual." [...] DJBooth said, [...] "Traditional R depends on three things: vocals, writing, and production. [...] In a nutshell, I Need A Girl has the whole trifecta, and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> what Trey needs to get Ready a solid release date." [...] Reviewing the remix of the song featuring Teyana Taylor and Fabolous, DJBooth said, [...] "Expect the combo of Taylor’s cooed vocals and Trey and Loso’s time-tested musical chemistry to leave listeners more amped than ever before for the release of Songz’ [...] latest LP—after waiting this long, I think it’s safe to say they’re more than Ready." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the basic}} {{premises}} of continuum mechanics, stress is a macroscopic concept. [...] Namely, the particles considered in its definition and analysis <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> {{small enough to}} be treated as homogeneous in composition and state, but still large enough to ignore quantum effects and the detailed motions of molecules. [...] Thus, the force between two particles is actually the average of {{a very large number of}} atomic forces between their molecules; and physical quantities like mass, velocity, and forces that act through the bulk of three-dimensional bodies, like gravity, are assumed to be smoothly distributed over them. Depending on the context, one may also assume that the particles are large enough to allow the averaging out of other microscopic features, like the grains of a metal rod or the fibers of a piece of wood.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of raising taxes, Petty was a {{definite}} proponent of consumption taxes. He recommended that in general taxes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> sufficient to meet {{the various types of}} public charges that he listed. They should also be horizontally equitable, regular and proportionate. He condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively. He recommended a much higher quality of statistical information, to raise taxes more fairly. Imports should be taxed, but only {{in such a way that}} would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce. A vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies. Linked to this, and aware of the scarcity of money, Petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver, which he estimated to be less than 1% of national wealth. To him, too much importance was placed on money, 'which is to the whole effect of the Kingdom… not [...] one to 100'.|$|E

Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you {{never have to worry about}} the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1920s {{and most}} of the 1930s, the Labour Party's {{official}} policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." [...] During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said [...] "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible." [...] Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created [...] "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position." ...|$|E
