60|$|This further is {{observable}} in number, {{that it is}} {{that which}} the mind makes use of in measuring all things that by us are measurable, which principally are EXPANSION and DURATION; and our idea of infinity, even when applied to those, seems to be nothing but the infinity of number.

For such an inexhaustible <b>stock,</b> <b>number</b> (of all other our ideas) most clearly furnishes us with, as is obvious to every one.
