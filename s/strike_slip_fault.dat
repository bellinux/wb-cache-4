40|$|This {{research}} project used 3 D seismic data located {{in deep water}} fold and thrust belt in the Levant Basin eastern Mediterranean, to investigate the nature and kinematics of compartmentalized thrust related folds. The principal aim is to better understand thrust related fold development and interactions in compressional settings. The fold and thrust belt in the Levant Bain is mainly comprised of overlapping thrust faults of similar and opposing dips segmented or bounded by conjugate sets of <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults.</b> Detailed interpretation {{and analysis of the}} 3 D geometry of the structures revealed that thrust faulting is an early process {{in the development of the}} thrust and fold pair, thrust interact with each other, and <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> along <b>strike.</b> A preliminary end member interaction of thrust <b>faults</b> and <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> is proposed based on observation of their bounding or segmenting pattern. The concept of fault interaction was mainly developed from the investigation of the propagation of thrust <b>fault</b> compartmentalised by <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults.</b> This involves a combination of kinematic analysis which includes fault displacement and shortening profiles, and the patterns of syn kinematic sediments above fold limb. Kinematic data suggests that <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> are acting as barriers to thrust fault propagation. Similar barrier to fault propagation are observed between overlapping thrust faults within a single fold formed by the linkage of smaller thrust folds. The results showed that the faults are restricted as they link and transfer displacement. In addition to the propagation of thrust faults, vertical distribution of fault displacement suggests that they ramp up from detachment, this agrees with the classical models of thrust propagation folds...|$|R
50|$|On {{a larger}} scale, a zone between offset <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> may have minor en echelon fault strands that {{accommodate}} the shearing motion induced in the region. On rock undergoing these shearing stresses en echelon veins may occur as fracture fillings.|$|R
50|$|The Aire Valley Fault (also {{known as}} the Keighley Fault) is an {{inactive}} <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> in Yorkshire, England. It {{is connected to the}} Denholme Clough Fault.The fault runs underneath the Keighley bus station and Airdale Shopping Centre, and has caused cracks in the shopping centre.|$|E
50|$|The Blanco Fracture Zone is a {{fracture}} zone running between the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Gorda Ridge. The dominating {{feature of the}} fracture zone is the 150 km long Blanco Ridge, which is a high-angle, right-lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> with some component of dip-slip faulting.|$|E
50|$|The Imperial Fault Zone {{is a right}} lateral-moving <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault,</b> {{representing}} the northernmost transform fault associated with the East Pacific Rise. It {{is connected to the}} San Andreas Fault by the Brawley Seismic Zone. It terminates on its southern end at the Cerro Prieto spreading center.|$|E
50|$|The {{continuing}} sinistral slip of the Indochina block {{resulted in}} thermal subsidence of Yinggehai Basin during 21-16 Ma {{after the end}} of active <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faulting.</b> Within this period, the sinistral strike-slip continued but the clockwise rotation of Indochina block slowed down.|$|R
5000|$|Most large {{events in}} this zone {{occur on the}} Blanco Ridge, the motion on this fault {{accounts}} {{for the majority of}} the plate movement. <b>Strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faulting</b> occurs in this region, motion on the fault is parallel to the motion of the plate.|$|R
50|$|The 1986 San Salvador {{earthquake}} {{occurred within}} the upper crust of the Caribbean Plate along the Central American volcanic chain. It {{was a result}} of left-lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faulting</b> perpendicular to the Central American volcanic chain. The earthquake also caused landslides located in the San Salvador area.|$|R
50|$|Strain {{partitioning}} {{is common}} within transpressive and transtensive tectonic domains. Both regimes involve {{a component of}} pure shear (transpression - compressive, transtension - extensive) and a component of simple shear. Strain may be partitioned {{by the development of}} a <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> or shear zone across the actively deforming region.|$|E
50|$|A {{regional}} <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> {{is referred}} to as a principle displacement zone (PDZ). Connecting the tips of step over faults to the opposite fault are bounding basin sidewall faults. Recent sandbox models have shown that the geometry and evolution of pull-apart basins varies greatly in pure-strike slip situations versus transtensional settings. Transtensional settings are believed to generate greater surface subsidence than pure-strike slip alone.|$|E

It is an active fault, located inside and parallel to the Fuegian fold and thrust belt, and marks the boundary between a southern belt of Paleozoic meta sediments and a northern Mesozoic belt of sedimentary sequences.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that deformation of the India/Sunda plate {{is the result}} of partitioned hyper oblique convergence. Presently, sub-meridian dextral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faulting</b> accommodates this India/Sunda motion in a buffer zone, the Burma platelet. This wide dextral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> shear zone is complicated by the side effect of the Tibet plateau collapse that can be described in term of crustal flow and gravity tectonics. The loss of potential energy related to this plateau collapse affects most of the Burmese platelet particularly in its northernmost part. Interaction of these two distinct geodynamic processes is recorded in the GPS based regional strain field, the analysis of seismic focal mechanism but also from direct geologic observations both onshore and offshore Myanmar and Bangladesh. We propose the apparent E-W shortening component of this so called partitioned hyper-oblique subduction is only the effect of regional gravitational forces related to the Tibet plateau collapse whereas the NS <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faulting</b> accommodates the India/Sunda motion...|$|R
30|$|In the B–U area, {{the major}} inelastic strain {{tendency}} {{is for the}} tensor to have a non-double-couple component, which implies deformation by <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faulting</b> as well as normal faulting. The amount of elastic strain in the normal fault component is almost {{the same as that}} in the <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> component. This suggests that the formation in this area cannot be explained by the development of a simple graben structure.|$|R
50|$|Central Burma {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. In this area the collision is highly oblique {{and much of}} the plate convergence is accommodated by right lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults,</b> of which the largest is the north-south trending Sagaing Fault, which takes up 18mm per year of this movement.|$|R
50|$|Death Valley {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{geological}} examples of a basin and range configuration. It lies at the southern end of a geological trough known as Walker Lane, which runs north into Oregon. The valley is bisected by a right lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> system, represented by the Death Valley Fault and the Furnace Creek Fault. The eastern end of the left lateral Garlock Fault intersects the Death Valley Fault. Furnace Creek and the Amargosa River flow through the valley but eventually disappear into the sands of the valley floor.|$|E
50|$|Right {{lateral motion}} of a <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> at a right step over (or overstep) {{gives rise to}} extensional bends characterised by zones of subsidence, local normal faults, and pull apart basins. On extensional duplexes, normal faults will {{accommodate}} the vertical motion, creating negative relief. Similarly, left stepping at a dextral fault generates contractional bends; shortening the step overs which is displayed by local reverse faults, push-up zones, and folds. On contractional duplex structures, thrust faults will accommodate vertical displacement rather than being folded, as the uplifting process is more energy efficient.|$|E
50|$|The {{general strike}} of the Tian Shan ranges is East-Northeast, {{but there are}} {{significant}} deviations, especially near the major Talas-Fergana fault. A striking feature of western Tian Shan is {{the large number of}} basins containing Cenozoic rocks, prominent basins include the Fergana Basin in the southwest, the Issyk-Kul Basin in the east and Naryn Basin in the south. On the edges of the Tian Shan, there are foreland basins with Cenozoic sediments several kilometers thick. The Talas-Fergana fault is an active <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> in which Quaternary offset is about 10 km and the total offset since the Paleozoic is about 200 km.|$|E
30|$|There are six {{critical}} active faults (OYO and IMM 2007 and Ayca 2012) in the Sea of Marmara {{according to}} the previous studies: Prince’s Islands <b>Strike</b> <b>Slip</b> (PI) <b>fault,</b> Prince’s Islands Normal (PIN) <b>fault,</b> Ganos <b>Strike</b> <b>Slip</b> (GA) <b>fault,</b> Yalova Normal (YAN) fault, Central Marmara Normal (CMN) fault, and the combination of Prince’s Islands and Ganos <b>Strike</b> <b>Slip</b> (PI + GA) <b>faults.</b> According to the presented results by Ayca (2012), it has been revealed that the tsunami generated at YAN, PIN, and CMN increases the water level, flow depth, and current velocities near Haydarpaşa Port, unlike tsunamis originating elsewhere. Thus, these segmented faults were selected for comparison in the new simulations for Haydarpaşa Port, and the most critical one {{was used in the}} high-resolution simulation as the final source.|$|R
50|$|Convergent margins {{where the}} angle of {{subduction}} is oblique will often result in the partitioning of strain into an arc parallel component (accommodated by <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> or shear zones) and an arc normal component (accommodated through thrust faults). This occurs {{as a response to}} shear stress exerted {{at the base of the}} overriding plate that is not perpendicular to the plate margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} a depth of around 10 km in a transform fault zone known as the Swan Islands Transform Fault in the Cayman Trench. It was a result of left-lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faulting.</b> The Cayman Trench forms the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate, and continues onshore as the Motagua Fault and the Chixoy-Polochic Fault.|$|R
5000|$|Dunite {{was named}} by the German geologist, Ferdinand von Hochstetter in 1859 after Dun Mountain near Nelson, New Zealand. Dun Mountain was given its name because of the dun colour of the {{underlying}} ultramafic rocks. This color results from surface weathering that oxidizes the iron in olivine in temperate climates (weathering in tropical climates creates a deep red soil). Dun Mountain is separated from its sister massif, Red Mountain, {{at the southern end}} of South Island, New Zealand, by the Alpine Fault, an approximately 600 km long right lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> similar to the San Andreas fault in California, USA.|$|E
50|$|An {{idealized}} strike-slip fault runs in {{a straight}} line with a vertical dip and has only horizontal motion, thus there is no change in topography due to motion of the fault. In reality, as strike slip faults become large and developed, their behavior changes and becomes more complex. A long <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> follows a staircase-like trajectory consisting of interspaced fault planes that follow the main fault direction. These sub parallel stretches are isolated by offsets at first, but {{over long periods of time}} they can become connected by step overs in order to accommodate the strike slip displacement. In long stretches of strike-slip the fault plane can start to curve, giving rise to structures similar to step overs.|$|E
50|$|The Passage {{was also}} {{the site of a}} devastating {{earthquake}} and resulting tsunami that hit western Puerto Rico in 1918. It is the site of frequent small earthquakes. The passage is underlain by a seismically active rift zone that overprints an older partly eroded tilted-block structure. Desecheo Island sits on the Desecheo ridge, a narrow east-west ridge that extends west from the northwest corner of Puerto Rico. The ridge forms the southern boundary of the 4000 m deep Mona rift which extends toward the north to the <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> zones which bound Puerto Rico and Hispanola. The east face of the rift has a sharp relief of 3 km and is controlled by the N - S trending Mona Rift Fault. The epicenter of the 1918 earthquake was located along the east or southeast edge of the Mona Rift.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} {{is the youngest}} {{in a group of}} formations which belong to the Challis Sequence rocks. The formation unconformably overlies rocks of the Eocene Sanpoil Volcanics and much older Triassic and Permian formations. The {{formation is}} bounded on its edges by a series of high-angle <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults,</b> which have contained the Klondike Mountain Formation in a series of graben structures, such as the Republic Graben.|$|R
40|$|<b>Strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> are {{important}} structures in crustal deformation among d ifferent tectonic environrnents {{and have been}} largely studied in field approach and analogue modelling (Sylvestre, 1988; Richard et al, 1989; Ueta et al., 2000). The {{aim of this study}} is to understand the role of rheologie heterogeneity in the evolution of strike-s lip faults by means of analogue modelling, with a hypotheticaJ comparison to the Domeyko Fault System (DFS...|$|R
30|$|Thus, up to {{this point}} in our study, we have {{obtained}} transpressive local stress tensors for the two clusters of aftershocks. It is obvious from the studies of Gökaşan et al. (2001) and Cormier et al. (2006) that the source of the compressive component in the stress field could also be structural, emerging from the restraining zones created by segmentation and offset of right-lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> beneath the Gulf of Izmit.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} narrow trough trends east-northeast to west-southwest and has {{a maximum}} depth of 7686 m. Within the trough is a slowly spreading north-south ridge {{which may be the}} result of an offset or gap of approximately 420 km along the main fault trace. The Cayman spreading ridge shows a long-term opening rate of 11-12 mm/yr. The eastern section of the trough has been named the Gonâve Microplate. The Gonâve plate extends from the spreading ridge east to the island of Hispaniola. It is bounded on the north by the Oriente and Septentrional fault zones. On the south the Gonâve is bounded by the Walton fault, the Jamaica restraining bend and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone. The two bounding <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> zones are left lateral. The motion relative to the North American Plate is 11 mm/yr to the east and the motion relative to the Caribbean Plate is 8 mm/yr.|$|E
5000|$|A paper {{written by}} Gerya theorizes that the {{creation}} of the transform faults between the ridges of the mid-oceanic ridge is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the mid-oceanic ridge. This occurs {{over a long period of}} time with the spreading center or ridge slowly deforming from a straight line to a curved line. Finally, fracturing along these planes forms transform faults. As this takes place, the fault changes from a normal fault with extensional stress to a <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> with lateral stress. In the study done by Bonatti & Crane, peridotite and gabbro rocks were discovered in the edges of the transform ridges. These rocks are created deep inside the Earth’s mantle and then rapidly exhumed to the surface. [...] This evidence helps to prove that new seafloor is being created at the mid-oceanic ridges and further supports the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5000|$|Mindanao Fault - a {{prominent}} NW-trending linear fracture zone {{on the western}} third of Mindanao Island and has 2 distinct segments, including that which separates the Daguma Range from the Cotabato Basin corresponding to the Cotabato Fault segment. This segment is highly linear and has features suggestive of normal faulting although {{it may have been}} a left lateral <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>fault</b> during its early history. The Quaternary Mt. Parker volcano is located at the western end of this fault and, on radar images, seems to be cut by the fault and terraces formed by Quaternary limestone mark the Daguma Range. These, together with the young morphology of incised river valleys, suggests a young age for the fault along which the Daguma Range was uplifted. Although Quaternary in age, it still has to be ascertained whether the fault is active or not (Quebral, 1994). The Sindangan Fault segment represents the northern continuation of the fault towards northern Zamboanga. Focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes offshore and narrow shear zones transecting recent gravel deposits suggest active left-lateral faulting (Pubellier and others, 1991).|$|E
50|$|The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden {{fault zone}} (EPGFZ or EPGZ) {{is a system}} of coaxial left lateral-moving <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> which runs along the {{southern}} {{side of the island}} of Hispaniola, where Haiti and the Dominican Republic are located. The EPGFZ is named for Lake Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic where the fault zone emerges, and extends across the southern portion of Hispaniola through the Caribbean to the region of the Plantain Garden River in Jamaica.|$|R
50|$|In {{defining}} {{whether this}} model is correct {{it is important to}} understand if the <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> of south China extend through the South China Sea as far as Borneo. Three major faults are known to traverse Indochina and South China are the Three Pagodas, Mae Ping and the Red River Fault, but not where they continue off the coast. It is not confirmed how far they cut into the South China Sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{extrusion}} model {{links the}} India-Asia collision to {{the extension of}} the South China Sea. The collision would cause the lateral extension of <b>strike</b> <b>slip</b> <b>faults</b> in the South China Sea. This is where crust is squeezed out to the sides as India barges north into the Eurasia continent. The northward movement of India pushes the southeast Asia block away from the collision resulting in the clockwise rotation of Borneo forming a large extensional basin.|$|R
