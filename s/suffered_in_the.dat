5|$|After World WarII, the {{forget-me-not}} flower {{was again}} {{used as a}} Masonic emblem at the first Annual Convention of the United Grand Lodges of Germany in 1948. The badge is now worn in the coat lapel by Freemasons {{around the world to}} remember all who <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of Freemasonry, especially those during the Nazi era.|$|E
5|$|After {{making peace}} with his family, Takanohana regained {{some of his}} {{consistency}} in 2000, although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> July tournament. His brother had retired in March, and several {{other members of his}} stable were now past their best. With Akebono dominant once more his best results that year were two runner-up performances.|$|E

5|$|Casualties <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> action were {{relatively}} heavy on both sides. The British ships, with their reduced crews, suffered 61 men {{killed or wounded}} while the French lost over 50 on Pomone alone. There were no casualties on Persanne, and Paulines losses are unknown, although believed to be heavy given her battered condition. The French also lost the cargo aboard Persanne and Pomone, which amounted to 201 bronze and iron cannon, 220 iron wheels for gun carriages and numerous other military stores.|$|E
5|$|Despite the disappointment, the Commonwealth {{was able}} to take {{advantage}} of the Russian weakness and through the territorial advances accomplished to reverse the eastern losses <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earlier decades. In the Truce of Deulino of 1619 the Rzeczpospolita was granted the Smolensk, Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi regions.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Chiluba, {{the leader}} of Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), {{who went on to}} become the President of Zambia in 1991, {{obtained}} majority mandate during the 1991 elections. The province was the least affected among all areas in the country during the 1991 famine. Agriculture <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region on account of removal of agricultural subsidies and rural credit schemes during the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Christ brings God's {{providence}} {{to the bar}} of God’s own promise. In Christ, God {{is fully}} justified by Himself. If any man thinks he has anything to <b>suffer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flesh, God more. In all their afflictions He was more afflicted.|$|R

5|$|The 1958 FIFA World Cup finals saw Scotland {{draw their}} first game against Yugoslavia 1–1, but they then lost to Paraguay and France {{and went out}} at the first stage. Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe {{injuries}} he <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker {{took charge of the}} team instead.|$|E
5|$|The French <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{course of}} a ruinous retreat, {{including}} from the harshness of the Russian Winter. The Armée had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the Berezina River in November 1812. The Russians had lost 150,000 in battle {{and hundreds of thousands}} of civilians.|$|E

50|$|His indecision {{in which}} emperor to support (Vitellius or Vespasian), and his {{resulting}} inactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> containment of the Batavian rebellion, made his later reputation <b>suffer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> works of Tacitus. He {{was murdered by}} his own troops (still loyal to Vitellius) after trying to celebrate the victory of Vespasian.|$|R
50|$|Bennett's films {{tended to}} be sombre, but were very popular with <b>the</b> moviegoing public. <b>In</b> 1947, Bennett {{accepted}} an invitation to go to Hollywood, but his directing style appeared to <b>suffer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American studio system of the era. It was, however, during this time that he directed King Solomon's Mines.|$|R
5|$|The King's prestige, {{which was}} based {{in large part on}} his support by the {{combined}} Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacifico incident of 1850, when British Foreign Secretary Palmerston sent the British fleet to blockade the port of Piraeus with warships, to exact reparation for injustice done to a British subject.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{bank had}} total assets of CHF 202million {{and a total}} shareholders' equity of CHF 46million. In 1917, UBS completed {{the construction of a}} new headquarters in Zurich on Bahnhofstrasse, considered to be the Wall Street of Switzerland. By 1923, offices were established throughout Switzerland. Although the bank <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of World War I and the Great Depression, it was able to make several smaller acquisitions; in 1937 it established Intrag AG, an asset management business responsible for investment trusts, (i.e. mutual funds).|$|E
5|$|During the 2002 season, Air Force {{allowed an}} average of 360.7yards per game, fourth in the Mountain West and 57th nationally. This was an {{improvement}} over the 2001 season, when the Falcons allowed 452.7yards per game on average. Air Force also was allowing far fewer points per game. In 2002, the Falcons allowed {{an average of}} 23.6points per game, down from more than 32per game in 2001. Air Force was successful in its kicking defense as well. Between 1990 and 2002, Air Force ranked second in terms of blocked kicks with 79. Virginia Tech was first, with 85. Air Force strong safety Mark Marsh was pronounced doubtful for the game due to a lower leg injury he <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{days leading up to}} the San Francisco Bowl.|$|E

The court has issued notices to all corporate sponsors, the state cricket associations & the BCCI against terminating valid contracts of players joining the ICL.|$|R
50|$|As Ksitigarbha {{is seen as}} the saviour {{of souls}} who have to <b>suffer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> underworld, his statues are common in cemeteries. He is also {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} protective deities of travellers, the dōsojin, and roadside statues of Jizō are a common sight in Japan. Firefighters are also believed to be under his protection.|$|R
5|$|In 1828, after {{recovering}} from wounds <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sandbar Fight, Bowie {{decided to move}} to Coahuila y Texas, at that time a state in the Mexican federation. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico banned religions other than Roman Catholicism and gave preference to Mexican citizens in receiving land. Bowie was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith in San Antonio on April 28, 1828, sponsored by the alcalde (chief administrator) of the town, Juan Martín de Veramendi, and the wife of the administrator, Josefa Navarro. For the next 18months, Bowie traveled through Louisiana and Mississippi. In 1829, he became engaged to Cecilia Wells, who died in Alexandria, on September 29, two weeks before they were to be married.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this defeat, and with rumours circulating in Constantinople of his death, Theophilos's position was precarious. He abandoned the campaign and withdrew to Dorylaion, whence he soon departed for the imperial capital. Ancyra itself was left abandoned, and plundered by the Arab army on 27 July. Then the united Abbasid army marched unopposed to Amorion, which fell after a siege of two weeks. Out of its entire population of some 70,000, only about half survived the brutal sack, to be sold as slaves. The fall {{of the city was}} one of the heaviest blows Byzantium <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire 9th century, both in material and symbolic terms. Fortunately for the Empire, news of a rebellion in the Caliphate forced al-Mu'tasim to withdraw soon after.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} {{following}} his junior year, Farmer {{was named to}} the Kentucky Junior All-Star Team, which played exhibition games throughout Europe, including stops in Iceland, the Netherlands, and West Germany. After the European trip, he helped lead Clay County to a 150 record in Amateur Athletic Union play. It was the first AAU season which recognized the three-point field goal, and Farmer made 53 of his 73 three-point attempts. In July 1987, the Kentucky Junior All-Stars finished second to a team from South Carolina in the Kentucky Prep All-Star Festival at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington; Farmer sat out the championship game with a hand injury he <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous game.|$|E
40|$|Universities {{that teach}} {{practical}} music subjects in Australia are excellent at providing academic and solo instrumental lessons, but can <b>suffer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of pedagogical frameworks that encourage lifelong-learning skills in {{personal and professional}} development.

Rajendra Prasad far exceeds the expectations.|$|R
50|$|After church, {{the family}} returns home. The Governess {{goes into the}} children's schoolroom where she sees the ghost of Miss Jessel seated at the teacher's desk. The spectre bemoans her fate, and sings about how she <b>suffers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife. The Governess confronts the spirit, which vanishes. Believing the ghosts may not yet have the upper hand, the Governess changes her mind, {{deciding}} to stay at Bly House after all. Instead, she writes to the children's uncle, informing him that she must speak with him.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the area}} where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Trépezet and his troop, who were {{attempting}} {{to return to the}} French lines, encountered Phineas Lyman's Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe's column was near the action, so he led it in that direction. As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute. Trepézet died the next day of wounds <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} {{to board the}} French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal {{surrender}} except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had been alone {{it would have been}} Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle. Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona, in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1322, the English {{army was}} routed by the Scots, {{under the command}} of Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire. The English commander, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, was taken prisoner, while the king himself barely escaped capture. It was the worst defeat the English had <b>suffered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wars since the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Harclay had {{received}} a summons to join the royal army, but {{had not been able to}} bring his troops south in time to come to the king's rescue. The event convinced him that the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king. Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots, without the king's sanction. On 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce at Lochmaben.|$|E
50|$|After death, {{the human}} soul leaves the body. The body is buried by {{relatives}} on the other bank of a river, looking towards east. If the soul had been good, {{it gets to the}} Other World (Túlvilág), for eternal peace.
