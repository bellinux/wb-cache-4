One of the thesis’s tasks is to realize the computational concept of a particular machine component. The beginning of the thesis focuses {{on the principle of}} lathe turning, the basic calculations, brief description of lathe blades, the main parts of <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> machines, and kinds of <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> machines. There are described machines of contemporary production with their main parameters and manufacturers in The Czech Republic and in foreign countries further on.

40|$|Abstract — Now a days, {{products}} {{can be produced}} by modern technology, which uses computer software, hardware and firm ware in industries. It is needed to use CNC lathe machine to get more accurate dimensions and irregular shape. So, CNC machines {{are becoming more and}} more important in modernized industrialization. There are many conventional lathe machines in our country. To build a new modern developed country, it is required to convert these conventional lathe machines into semi-automatic control lathe machine by retrofitting. Developing and changing into semi-automatic control lathe machine, there are three required portions, namely, mechanical electronics and hydraulic. In this project we convert the convention lathes which have 5 ft bed length in to the <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>lathe.</b> In mechanical side we replace the ball screw in place of lead screw for better accuracy and remove some unnecessary component like gears for providing space for motors. We add an extra plates or structure for installation of motors. Also provides a hydraulic circuit for coolant. In electronic side we used a servo / stepper motor for both Z and X axis and provide controller for the efficient operation. Keywords—Automation, Retrofitting, CNC Turning Cente...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Titanium {{is one of}} the {{important}} kinds of material used in different engineering fields. They have very good properties like high strength to weight ratio, superior corrosion resistance and thermal properties. They are very attractive materials and has application aerospace, biomedical and automotive field. they are classified to be “difficult-to-Machine materials ” as they posses poor thermal properties, poor machinability, etc. The prime important is with the study of machining characteristics and the optimization of the cutting parameters. In this paper Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) is taken, the dry turning experiments are carried out in <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> using poly crystalline diamond (PCD) cutting tool insert. The taguchi’s design of L 27 orthogonal array is done by four machining factors namely cutting speed, feed, nose radius and depth of cut at three levels. The optimal machining conditions are arrived by Signal-Noise ratio method with respect to surface roughness (Ra). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the percentage of contribution of feed, cutting speed, nose radius and depth of cut for better surface roughness is validated using S/N ratio. In this result indicated that the feed is a vital parameter followed by cutting speed, the nose radius and then by depth of cut. The worn out surface of the insert is examined by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|E
40|$|Subject of investigation: multitool single-support setups on {{automatic}} and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>lathes.</b> Classification is {{provided for the}} multitool single-supports setups for which methods are developed for determining the maximum precision feed. Developed are the methods for computing the conditions for the multitool single-support setups on the automatic and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>lathes</b> {{as well as a}} set of standartization charts for correction of feed with regard to the structure of the multitool single-support setups. The general mechanical engineering authorizing documents on the design of the setups and the standards for the time and conditions of turning on lathes are being introduced.

5000|$|Sometimes {{machines}} {{similar to}} those above, but with power feeds and automatic turret-indexing {{at the end of}} the return stroke, are called [...] "semi-automatic turret lathes". This nomenclature distinction is blurry and not consistently observed. The term [...] "turret lathe" [...] encompasses them all. During the 1860s, when <b>semi-automatic</b> turret <b>lathes</b> were developed, they were sometimes called [...] "automatic". What we today would call [...] "automatics", that is, fully automatic machines, had not been developed yet. During that era both manual and <b>semi-automatic</b> turret <b>lathes</b> were sometimes called [...] "screw machines", although we today reserve that term for fully automatic machines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term screw machine has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term screw machine was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic screw machine was applied, and the term hand screw machine or manual screw machine was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic screw machines, and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term screw machine no longer was used to refer to manual or <b>semi-automatic</b> turret <b>lathes,</b> having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of screw machine remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called screw machines there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|R
40|$|The work aims {{to create}} methods of compilating {{compensation}} algorithms of thermo-elastic deformations of machine tools. In the algorithms comp., such procedures are preferred, {{by means of}} which the indirect and combined comp. are created. The main objective is the on-line parameter determination of the comp. equations directly on the machine tool. Theoretical and detailed analyses of transfer mechanisms and thermal energy sources within machine construction inclusive of comparison of the particular mechanisms effect are mentioned. An analysis of the main thermal sources follows. Spindle drives, feed drives, bearings, guide ways and the own technological process together with tool cooling belong among those sources. Machine tools thermal behaviour {{by means of the}} finite elements method is modelled and calculated. Procedures of creation of the linear and non-linear indirect comp. models of machine tools thermal errors are stated. Data reading and processing for the equation compilation are dealt with. Criteria of evaluation and causes of the comp. models failure are also briefly mentioned. Methods of the comp. relation determination are verified for both machine types. At the machining centre, optimisation of number and position of the measuring points is made, based on the thermal analysis of the machine tool by means of FEM calculation. The efficiency of method of on-line parameter determination of the comp. equation is verified. At the <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>lathe,</b> the combined comp. method to reduce effect of thermal errors in feed axis Z is applied. By means of application of the comp. algorithms, inaccuracy of parts machining caused by thermal errors will be reduced by more than 2 / 3.
