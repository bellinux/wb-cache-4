The cost of delays caused by frequent false alarms outweighs any reduction in the probability of an attack in an expected cost analysis. We extend existing methodology in three ways to demonstrate how additional factors affect the value of screening investments. We examine the effect that screening has in discouraging terrorists. We model multiple levels of screening. Finally, we consider additional objectives beyond cost.

40|$|Currently applied {{methods for}} X-ray {{backscattering}} radiography use a scanning pencil beam and a large-area {{and a highly}} sensitive detector.

The advantage of the widely used process is the low radiation dosage hitting the inspected object. However, the disadvantage remains that some structures remain undiscovered and details or even dangerous objects might be masked by a surrounding backscattering environment. The new X-ray backscatter camera with a special twisted slit collimator offers an imaging method for resolving those problems.

40|$|Might a nuclear-armed {{terrorist}} group or state use ordinary com-merce {{to deliver a}} nuclear weapon by smuggling it in a cargo container or vehicle? This delivery method {{would be the only}} one available to a sub-state actor, and it might enable a state to make an unattributed attack. Detection of a weapon or fissile material smuggled in this manner is difficult because of the large volume and mass available for shielding. Here I review methods for <b>screening</b> <b>cargo</b> containers to detect the possible presence of nuclear threats. Because of the large volume of innocent international commerce, and the cost and disrup-tion of secondary screening by opening and inspection, it is essential that the method be rapid and have a low false-positive rate. Shielding can prevent the detection of neutrons emitted spontaneously or by in-duced fission. The two promising methods are muon tomography and high energy X-radiography. If they do not detect a shielded threat object they can detect the shield itself. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} need to rapidly scan bulk air cargo for {{contraband}} such as illicit drugs and explosives. Ideally, cargo containers must be imaged without unpacking and with scan times of less than one minute. Fast neutron techniques are particularly attractive for <b>screening</b> <b>cargo</b> {{as they can be}} used to determine cargo composition. The Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has developed a scanner that combines fast (14 MeV) neutron and gamma-ray (or X-ray) radiography (FNGR). This direct, dual-beam radiography technique is much more efficient than methods that measure secondary radiation and has much better material discrimination sensitivity than the dual-energy X-ray technique. A full-scale prototype FNGR scanner was trialed by Australian Customs Service to <b>screen</b> incoming air <b>cargo</b> at Brisbane International Airport in 2005 / 6. The trial of the scanner demonstrated the material discrimination capability of the technology and its ability to make concealed organic materials more obvious. CSIRO and Nuctech Company Limited have recently developed {{a new version of the}} scanner suitable for commercial deployment that combines a 14 MeV fast neutron radiography system with dual-energy X-ray radiography. The X-ray system uses a 6 MeV LINAC X-ray source and Binocular Stereoscopic imaging with much better spatial resolution than the scanner trialed at Brisbane airport. The improved resolution, combined with binocular stereoscopic imaging, allows complex cargo images to be separated into multiple layers, making it easier to identify threat items. The first unit of the commercial scanner was recently commissioned in Beijing and initial results are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cognitive {{engineering}} {{methods in}} a large-scale homeland security program are described. <b>Screening</b> <b>cargo</b> containers at seaports for illicit radioactive material involves substantial staff, technology, and human operator decision making. The systems engineering model {{used by the}} radiation portal monitor (RPM) program entails elements similar to the incremental commitment model, which provides a risk-based focus for applications of cognitive engineering. This model includes meth-ods for defining opportunities and context of use, methods for requirements and design solutions, and methods for evaluation. The application examples illustrate each of these general areas through work domain analysis, signal detection modeling, design of displays for radiation threat likelihood, and evaluation of the design concepts with field test data. The signal detection analysis shows how system detection sensitiv-ity requirements for design can be established for low-probability, high-consequence events such as threats. The threat display concept developed by cognitive engineers has been implemented in new fielded systems. The success of cognitive engineering in the RPM program is largely a result of working with an incremental approach to systems engineering. This perspective provides application focus to those areas most likely to benefit from cognitive engineering within the overall constraints of the work domain, program schedule, and budget...|$|R
40|$|<b>Screening</b> <b>cargo</b> for illicit {{substances}} {{is in need}} {{of rapid}} high-throughput inspection systems that accurately identify suspicious cargo. Here we investigate the ability of a parasitic wasp, Microplitis croceipes to detect and respond to methyl benzoate, the volatile component of cocaine, by examining their response to training concentrations, their sensitivity at low concentrations, and their ability to detect methyl benzoate when two concealment substances (green tea and ground coffee) are added to the testing arena. Utilizing classical associative learning techniques with sucrose as reward, we found that M. croceipes learns individual concentrations of methyl benzoate, and they can generalize this learning to concentrations 100 × lower than the training concentration. Their sensitivity to methyl benzoate is very low at an estimated 3 ppb. They are also able to detect methyl benzoate when covered completely by green tea, but were not able to detect methyl benzoate when covered completely by coffee grounds. Habituation to the tea and coffee odors prior to testing improves their responses, resulting in effective detection of methyl benzoate covered by the coffee grounds. With the aid of the portable device called ‘the wasp hound’, the wasps appear to have potential to be effective on-site biosensors for the detection of cocaine...|$|R

40|$|Each year some 48 million cargo {{containers}} move {{between the}} world's ports. More than 6 million of these enter the U.
