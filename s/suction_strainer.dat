40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author advanced a proposal on {{the method of}} fish transportation through a piping without using any fish pump. In this system based on these suggestions, a fish hold is closed and suppose {{it to be a}} large <b>suction</b> <b>strainer</b> box. When a pump draw up fishes together with water, the fishes can be intercepted by a screen plate, and only water will be discharged from the fish hold through the pump. Therefore, the pump need not passing any fish, and so, every type of pump can be useful for this purpose. The experiments performed with model or living fishes, shows that the fish body is not damaged at all, and the pump handling is quite simple. Generally, a mass produced pump has merits of low cost, small size and high efficiency. This method is now practicable to lift mackerel from a purse net into the fish hold. And, a further application of this method, will enable to establish a technique of netless fishing. ...|$|E
40|$|In this research, the {{problems}} encountered in HP feed system in Dr. Sharief power station, were studied. To achieve this, the author studied carefully the manuals and procedures {{available in the}} station given for solving {{the problems}} encountered in the steam power plant. Some of the problems need more studying, and further work to be done. In this research, the following problems were investigated: 1. The <b>suction</b> <b>strainer</b> problem and the appropriate solutions were suggested. 2. The cavitation problems; {{and how they can}} be solved. 3. The HP heaters emergency drains problems, and solutions were adopted. 4. The HP heaters level problems; and solutions are suggested for solving these problems. 5. The HP heaters tube failures problem; and how they were solved. 6. The HP heaters tube erosion failures; and how these problems were solved. 7. The HP heaters vibration problems failures; and how these problems were solved. 8. The HP heaters valves erosion problems; and solutions were suggested. Many proposals were raised which could assist to improve the plant in Dr. Sharief Power Station. Other recommendations for future research work were also given, regarding design and operational problems...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} (NPPs) {{must ensure that}} the {{emergency}} core cooling system (ECCS) or safety-related containment spray system (CSS) remains capable of performing its design safety function throughout {{the life of the}} plant. This requires ensuring that long-term core cooling can be maintained following a postulated loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). Adequate safety operation can be impaired if the protective coatings which have been applied to the concrete and steel structures within the primary containment fail, producing transportable debris which could then accumulate on BWR ECCS <b>suction</b> <b>strainers</b> or PWR ECCS sump debris screens located within the containment. This document will present the data collected during the investigation of coating specimens from plants...|$|R
50|$|After the 1986 Chernobyl {{accident}} in Ukraine, {{the question of}} security of nuclear energy was again raised. In July 1992 an incident at Barsebäck 2 showed that the five older boiling water reactors had had potentially reduced capacity in their emergency core cooling systems since they started operation. Mineral wool was dislodged {{and ended up in}} the suppression pool where it clogged the <b>suction</b> <b>strainers.</b> It was classified as a grade 2 incident in the IAEA INES scale, due to the degradation of defence-in-depth. All five reactors were ordered down by the Nuclear Inspectorate for remedial action where backwash and additional strainers were installed. Most of the reactors were back in operation by next Spring, but Oskarshamn 1 remained down till January 1996 due to other work being carried out.|$|R
40|$|This letter {{serves to}} provide you with the final report of the audit {{conducted}} by the NRC staff on March 29 - 31, 1999, of Commonwealth Edisons (the licensee) resolution for NRC Bulletin 96 - 03, Potential Plugging of Emergency Core Cooling <b>Suction</b> <b>Strainers</b> by Debris (NRCB 96 - 03), for Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3. Commonwealth Edison was subsequently succeeded by Exelon Generation Company, LLC, as the licensee. The purpose of the audit was to verify the implementation of NRCB 96 - 03. Specifically, we: 1) assessed the adequacy of your resolution, and 2) evaluated the need for additional review on a generic basis of licensee resolutions through the NRC inspection program. On the basis of our review of the strainer documentation onsite at Dresden and our confirmatory calculations, we concluded that: 1) You have adequately designed their ECCS strainers to withstand the high debris loads anticipated during a LOCA. 2) You have implemented an appropriate inspection program to ensure the operability of the ECCS (strainer and suppression pool cleanliness) ...|$|R
40|$|The BLOCKAGE 2. 5 {{code was}} {{developed}} by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as a tool to evaluate license compliance regarding the design of suction strainers for emergency core cooling system (ECCS) pumps in boiling water reactors (BWR) as required by NRC Bulletin 96 - 03, ``Potential Plugging of Emergency Core Cooling Suction Strainers by Debris in Boiling Water Reactors``. Science and Engineering Associates, Inc. (SEA) and Software Edge, Inc. (SE) developed this PC-based code. The instructions to effectively use this code to evaluate the potential of debris to sufficiently block a pump <b>suction</b> <b>strainer</b> such that a pump could lose NPSH margin was documented in a User`s Manual (NRC, NUREG/CR- 6370). The Reference Manual contains additional information that supports the use of BLOCKAGE 2. 5. It contains descriptions of the analytical models contained in the code, programmer guides illustrating the structure of the code, and summaries of coding verification and model validation exercises that were performed to ensure that the analytical models were correctly coded and applicable to the evaluation of BWR pump suction strainers. The BLOCKAGE code {{was developed by}} SEA and programmed in FORTRAN as a code that can be executed from the DOS level on a PC. A graphical users interface (GUI) was then developed by SEA to make BLOCKAGE easier to use and to provide graphical output capability. The GUI was programmed in the C language. The user has the option of executing BLOCKAGE 2. 5 with the GUI or from the DOS level and the Users Manual provides instruction for both methods of execution...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} a plant-specific {{study for}} a BWR/ 4 with a Mark I containment that evaluated {{the potential for}} LOCA generated debris and the probability of losing long term recirculation capability due ECCS pump <b>suction</b> <b>strainer</b> blockage. The major elements of this study were: (1) acquisition of detailed piping layouts and installed insulation details for a reference BWR; (2) analysis of plant specific piping weld failure probabilities to estimate the LOCA frequency; (3) development of an insulation and other debris generation and drywell transport models for the reference BWR; (4) modeling of debris transport in the suppression pool; (5) development of strainer blockage head loss models for estimating loss of NPSH margin; (6) estimation of core damage frequency attributable to loss of ECCS recirculation capability following a LOCA. Elements 2 through 5 were combined into a computer code, BLOCKAGE 2. 3. A point estimate of overall DEGB pipe break frequency (per Rx-year) of 1. 59 E- 04 was calculated for the reference plant, with a corresponding overall ECCS loss of NPSH frequency (per Rx-year) of 1. 58 E- 04. The calculated point estimate of core damage frequency (per Rx-year) due to blockage related accident sequences for the reference BWR ranged from 4. 2 E- 06 to 2. 5 E- 05. The {{results of this study}} show that unacceptable strainer blockage and loss of NPSH margin can occur within the first few minutes after ECCS pumps achieve maximum flows when the ECCS strainers are exposed to LOCA generated fibrous debris in the presence of particulates (sludge, paint chips, concrete dust). Generic or unconditional extrapolation of these reference plant calculated results should not be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|The BLOCKAGE 2. 5 code {{described}} in this User`s Manual {{was developed by the}} US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as a tool to evaluate licensee compliance with NRC Bulletin 96 - 03, ``Potential Plugging of Emergency Core Cooling <b>Suction</b> <b>Strainers</b> by Debris in Boiling Water Reactors. `` As such, BLOCKAGE 2. 5 provides a generalized framework into which a user can input plant-specific and insulation-specific data for performing analyses in accordance with Regulatory Guide 1. 82, Rev. 2. This user`s manual describes the capabilities of BLOCKAGE 2. 5 along with a description of the graphics user`s interface provided for data entry. Each input/output dialog is {{described in}} detail along with special considerations related to developing and executing BLOCKAGE. Also, several sample problems are provided such that user can easily modify them to suit a particular plant of interest. The models used in BLOCKAGE 2. 5 and their validation are presented in the accompanying NUREG/CR- 6371. The BLOCKAGE models were designed to be parametric in nature, allowing the user flexibility to examine the impact of several modeling assumptions and to conduct sensitivity analyses. As a result, BLOCKAGE 2. 5 results are known to be very sensitive to the user provided input. It is therefore strongly recommended that users become thoroughly familiar with BLOCKAGE models and their limitations as described in NUREG/CR- 6224...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter {{is to provide a}} status of the NRC staffs review of the {{hydrodynamic}} load portion of the General Electric (GE) Licensing Topical Report NEDC- 32721 P, Application Methodology for the General Electric Stacked Disk ECCS <b>Suction</b> <b>Strainers.</b> As I stated in my May 18, 2000, letter to Mr. Tom Green of GE (Reference 1), the staff believes that the hydrodynamic mass coefficient, Cm, value used in strainer designs is important for postulated loss of main condenser and large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) events, particularly with regard to demonstrating appropriate safety margins relating to containment penetration integrity following such blowdown events. Based on our review of the GE Licensing Topical Report and supporting analytical reports, the staff does not believe that the testing performed to date on the GE strainers is sufficient to support the value of Cm used in the analysis. As I stated in my September 6, 2000, letter (Reference 2), the staff has undertaken a contract with a third party, Distinguished Professor T. Sarpkaya of the Naval Postgraduate School, to provide an expert opinion on the expected values of Cm for structures similar to the GE strainers. Dr. Sarpkaya is a respected authority in the field of hydrodynamics, someone who is well qualified to render an expert opinion in this area. We have received Dr. Sarpkayas fina...|$|R
40|$|A {{serious problem}} of scale and other solid {{material}} settling in heat transfer equipment {{was threatening to}} shut down our ethylene plant. All evidence pointed to the cooling tower {{as the source of}} the contamination. Visual inspection of the cooling tower pump suction basin was accomplished by diving into the basin using SCUBA gear. It was possible to see a build-up of debris on the pump <b>suction</b> basket <b>strainers</b> and {{on the floor of the}} sumps. Also, it was discovered that one of the four baskets had been installed incorrectly. Photographs of the basket strainers were taken to aid in describing their exact condition. With the aid of SCUBA it was possible to sufficiently clean the pump sumps so that costly downtime was avoided. Likewise, using this technique, steps were taken to greatly reduce the chance for further contamination of the circulating cooling water system...|$|R
