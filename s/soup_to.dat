5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed <b>soup</b> <b>to</b> the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each {{had a number of}} tickets which they could give to those people who they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of <b>soup,</b> <b>to</b> the delight of her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be}} better to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
