25|$|A {{free agent}} {{following}} the season, Jokinen chose {{to return to}} the Flames, signing a two-year, $6 million contract. The deal generated a strong reaction in Calgary, as some fans expressed <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> against his reacquisition. Flames' Head Coach Brent Sutter sought to simplify Jokinen's game and force greater defensive responsibility on the forward. He finished the 2010–11 season with 17 goals and 54 points and was praised by his coach.|$|E
25|$|Fans of {{the series}} often have <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> over {{the order in which}} the books should be read. The issue {{revolves}} around the placement of The Magician's Nephew and The Horse and His Boy in the series. Both are set significantly earlier in the story of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main story arc connecting the others. The reading order of the other five books is not disputed.|$|E

25|$|Phelps served {{aboard the}} Bonita and Jamestown during the Mexican–American War, giving naval support to Winfield Scott's Army during the Siege of Veracruz. Much {{of his time}} was also spent patrolling the Mexican coast on {{blockade}} duty. In little time Phelps had already developed <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> about how the war should be conducted, and was displeased that the Navy was lending much of their service protecting merchant ships while sailors were coming down with scurvy for want of provisions.|$|E
25|$|People {{not only}} use these three {{slightly}} differing spelling systems, {{but they also}} write words more or less as they pronounce them. Because of this words are often spelt in various ways, for example sena/sina 'that, there', kothai/kothay/kothei/kothey/kothe 'back of head, occiput'. Variation like this depends on age, family, island, and other factors such as poetic speech. It can be difficult at times to decide which is most correct — different people have different opinions (and sometimes have very <b>strong</b> <b>opinions).</b>|$|E
25|$|Encouraged by Jessie, the Morse family held {{relatively}} formal nightly {{discussions about}} crops, animals, education, religion, and most frequently about politics. Like {{many of their}} neighbors, the family was Progressive and discussed ideas championed by Robert M. La Follette, Sr., {{a leader of the}} Progressive movement who served as Wisconsin's governor from 1900 to 1906 and thereafter {{as a member of the}} U.S. Senate. During these family discussions, Morse developed debating skills and <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> about political corruption, corporate domination, labor rights, women's suffrage, education, and, on a personal level, hard work and sobriety.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, Kweisi Mfume {{was elected}} to the Baltimore City Council, serving there until 1986. His {{political}} stance was against that of then-mayor William Donald Schaefer, who Mfume believed had ignored the many poor neighborhoods of the city. It was a contentious matter, but despite his <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> he learned the art of political compromise. He was perceived by many to have had some success during his stay in office, a fact perhaps reflected by his subsequent election to the United States House of Representatives in 1986 despite a torrent of criticism, directed in no small part against his early past.|$|E
25|$|Easty was {{the lowest}} ranking author of the {{surviving}} journals of the First Fleet. He describes events on the voyage and in the colony in simple, irregular English. Incidents include accidents, crimes and punishments, and encounters with Aboriginal people. In March 1788 he received a flogging for bringing a female convict into the camp. Some of the journal is hearsay or was written later. Most of the events are reported {{in a matter of}} fact way, but Easty sometimes expresses his own <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> on matters such as the administration of the colony and religious beliefs. On 22 February 1790, he writes that he and a private in the 53rd Regiment, Thomas Brimage, signed and sealed their lasts wills and testaments to each other.|$|E
25|$|New levies {{were imposed}} to finance these {{large-scale}} projects. Lack of manpower, however, caused the Company {{to rely on}} local chieftains as agents for revenue collection. Among those who cooperated with the Company, some abused their authority and overtaxed the natives, exacerbating dissatisfaction among local people already burdened by other new laws imposed by the Company. Mat Salleh viewed the Company’s new rules as an infringement of native rights, refused to acknowledge the Company's authority, and continued to collect taxes from traders traveling via the Sugut River as he had before the rules were imposed, without turning {{them over to the}} Company. Numerous other local chiefs shared Mat Salleh's <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> against the Company's new rules. Many of them later joined his cause.|$|E
30|$|The <b>strongest</b> <b>opinion</b> {{was on the}} ease-of-use of Acclaim as a {{platform}} for video blogging. While the survey demonstrated the highest mean value (3.95) and a relatively small deviation (1.00) in opinion, we think the survey is limited in having follow up questions about video annotation tools in particular, and newer technologies in general. Indeed, the second <b>strongest</b> <b>opinion</b> in the survey was that students were very comfortable in working with new technologies (question 3, mean 3.71). Students who scored 2 and lower on question 3 reported lower levels of satisfaction with the video blogging exercises, suggesting that the more comfortable the students were with new technologies, the more positively they responded to video blogging activities.|$|R

During her tenure there one of her jobs was to translate corporate documents relating to offers and proposals {{for the construction of}} nuclear power plants. After this exposure she became increasingly interested in the subject, and formed <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> on the environmental and social dangers of nuclear power. Subsequently, she became an activist in the anti-nuclear movement. In 1962 she returned with her family to Vienna, where her husband worked for the International Atomic Energy Agency. Meissner became general secretary of the newly formed Institute for Advanced Studies. She and Georges gave birth to twins, Alexandra and Nicholas, in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Arnold was {{an outspoken}} critic of the trend towards high levels of {{abstraction}} in mathematics {{during the middle of the}} last century. He had very <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France—initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well. Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics. In an interview, he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century —a book he often recommended to his students. He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincaré, and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.|$|E

On Garage Mahal, Taxiride had three active singer-songwriters, with their <b>strong</b> <b>opinions</b> on musical content clashing frequently. Singh told Dan Grunebaum of Metropolis Tokyo that the arguments came about [...] "because we were very passionate about what goes down onto tape", {{and so they were}} resolved by recognising the overall goal of the band's work.|$|E
