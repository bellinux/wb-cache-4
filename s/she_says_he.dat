Blake Madden praises Grohl's [...] "precise and powerful drumming" [...] and Modern Drummer Magazine states that Grohl's work with Nirvana was the [...] "...most impassioned and expertly crafted drumming" [...] in rock history. Bobbitt states that Jimmy Chamberlin had a [...] "jazz background", which infused his band's grunge sound with the [...] "lightness and versatility" [...] of Buddy Rich-style swing jazz drumming. [...] Bobbitt states that while Patty Schemel struggled with drugs and alcohol during her tenure in Courtney Love's musical groups from 1992 to 1998, Schemel turned [...] "clean and sober", enabling her to garner recognition for [...] "...her ability to tear up the percussion" [...] kit; Bobbitt notes that Love hired Schemel based on Cobain's recommendation of Schemel's drum skills.

She calls him [...] "grunge's [...] guru" [...] and praises his [...] "forceful" [...] playing and huge dynamic (loudness and softness) changes. As well, she notes that Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell stated that Cameron's playing was an important source of confidence for the band. [...] Bobbitt also praises Lori Barbero, a [...] "self-taught" [...] player with [...] "inimitable" [...] drumkit style who [...] "finds...strength [...] tribal" [...] playing and who could [...] "summon hellfire" [...] with the power of her drum sound.|$|E
