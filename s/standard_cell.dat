In <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> culture, diffusion {{is often the}} sole means of nutrient and metabolite transport.

25|$|Standard {{electrode}} potentials {{are usually}} tabulated as reduction potentials. However, the reactions are reversible {{and the role}} of a particular electrode in a cell depends on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of both electrodes. The oxidation potential for a particular electrode is just the negative of the reduction potential. A <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> potential can be determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes (sometimes called half cell potentials). The one that is smaller will be the anode and will undergo oxidation. The cell potential is then calculated as the sum of the reduction potential for the cathode and the oxidation potential for the anode.|$|E

The proposed several <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> attain large leakage reductions. A mode- 10 counter is verified with the proposed <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> by using commercial EDA tools. The leakage and total dynamic power dissipations of the mode- 10 counter using the proposed <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> provide a reduction of 21. 27 and 3. 06 %, respectively.

25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E

50|$|The {{technology}} and market {{idea behind the}} foundation of NanGate was to address and solve the inherent shortcomings of <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> based ASSP/ASIC design as compared to full custom IC design. In <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> design the designer uses cells from a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> library to implement the desired logic functionality of the IC while trying to obtain the target operating frequency at the lowest possible cost in terms of die area and power consumption. The standard cells form the basic building blocks used to build the IC together with macro blocks such as embedded memory, Input-Output (IO), mixed-signal and analog blocks. Each <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> represents a relatively primitive logic function, such as a NAND gate, with fixed area, timing and power characteristics and is constructed from transistors most often arranged in the pull-up/pull-down fashion of CMOS. A typical standard-cell library for e.g. 40 nanometer CMOS has 500-1500 standard cells and about 150-300 different logic functions.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} stated {{that one of}} the main {{advantages}} of back-contacted (BC) Si solar <b>cells</b> over <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> is that shading due to the front-finger metallization is avoided - while it is also often stated that BC cells are prone to "electronic shadowing", which means that the carrier collection efficiency in front of the back-surface-field (BSF) may be reduced. We compare these two cell concepts in two ways: by means of an extensive collection of measured IV data from literature, and by interpreting as well as quantifying the differences with the aid of numerical device simulation. Both literature data and simulations indicate that BC cells have a Jsc-advantage of maximally about 1 mA/cm 2, but in Voc and FF there is no clear advantage or disadvantage over <b>standard</b> <b>cells.</b> With a parameter study, we reveal the main design advantages and weaknesses in each cell type. Our numerical device modeling indicates {{that one of the}} most crucial design advantages of BC over <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> is that the collection of minority carriers in the emitter is rather unimportant, which leaves greater flexibility in emitter design than in <b>standard</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{of the size}} and sophistication of the circuits, and {{in the presence of}} the blockage, the old standard-cell oriented placement methods are not working properly. There is a need to consider blockage effect early in the design flow along with <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> for wirelength minimization purposes. A new wirelength estimation method, having blockage into consideration, is needed to be used in the design flow of large-scale circuits. Using this method, gives us some guidelines where in the chip area to put the blockages. Up to now, wirelength estimation methods either did not consider blockage or estimated wirelength in a flat framework in the presence of blockage which does not work properly for large-scale circuits. Also, for <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> placement inside the chip area, considering <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> and their connections are not working any more. We need to consider the effects of blockages parameters such as their place, aspect ratio and area. In this paper, we propose a methodology for hierarchical derivation of wirelength estimation in the presence of blockage. Our experiments show that the proposed method is well-correlated with the real wirelength in the presence of blockage. By accurately estimating the wirelength, we can get some guidelines to determine area, aspect ratio and displacement from the center of the blockage. In order to minimize wirelength for mixed-size benchmarks, we introduce another step, namely placement planning into the placement flow right before doing placement for <b>standard</b> <b>cells.</b> This step denotes how to determine good boxes based on some measures to place <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> inside them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{practicability}} {{and methodology}} of applying regularly placed contacts on layout design of <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> are studied. The regular placement enables more {{effective use of}} resolution enhancement technologies, which in turn allows for a reduction of critical dimensions. Although placing contacts on a grid adds restrictions during cell layout, overall circuit area can be made smaller by a careful selection of the grid pitch, allowing slight contact offset, applying double exposure, and shrinking the minimum size and pitch. The contact level of 250 nm <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> was shrunk by 10 %, resulting in an area change ranging from 20 % to + 25 % with an average decrease of 5 % for the 84 cells studied.

The results on industrial 45 nm node <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> show up to 76 % im-provement in non-rectangular delay variation under nominal process condition, 24 % reduction in the delay difference be-tween the fastest and slowest process corners, and up to 90 % reduction in leakage current at the fastest process corner...|$|R
