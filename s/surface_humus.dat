The nature of the surface of the preparations was characterized by means of analysis of the shapes of water vapour adsorption isotherms at 20 and 40 Ã‚Â°C, and by analyzing such physical parameters as the specific surface area and the molar energy of adsorption, those properties perfectly characterizing the surface of an organic-mineral adsorbent...|$|R
50|$|The {{forces with}} which water {{is held in}} soils {{determine}} its availability to plants. Forces of adhesion hold water strongly to mineral and <b>humus</b> <b>surfaces</b> and less strongly to itself by cohesive forces. A plant's root may penetrate a very small volume of water that is adhering to soil and be initially able to draw in water that is only lightly held by the cohesive forces. But as the droplet is drawn down, the forces of adhesion of the water for the soil particles make reducing the volume of water increasingly difficult until the plant cannot produce sufficient suction to use the remaining water. The remaining water is considered unavailable. The amount of available water depends upon the soil texture and humus amounts {{and the type of}} plant attempting to use the water. Cacti, for example, can produce greater suction than can agricultural crop plants.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the effect of afforestation of previously arable land to soil characteristics changes. One of the main aims was to evaluate the effects of each forest species on the soil structure quality after afforestation. Soil samples were taken at two climatically distinct subregions within the Czech Republic. Based on the different site conditions, two study sites were chosen at each locality for a total of four research sites. Detailed soil survey and basic forest stand inventories were conducted at all four sites. The first locality was established in the Rychnov nad Kněžnou district in the Protected Landscape Area of the Orlické mountains (soil type a Haplic Cambisol). The second locality was established in the Prague-East district (soil type a Haplic Cambisol and a Haplic Stagnosol). Afforestation had a positive influence on the soil physical characteristics which are important for the maintenance of soil stability. Forest cover has a major influence on increasing the soil porosity, by decreasing the reduced bulk density and increasing capillary and gravitational pores, which is crucial. Afforestation was also found to be positively related to increases in soil organic matter content in different forms, both stable and unstable, and tendency of considerable soil organic matter accumulation not only in the layer of <b>surface</b> <b>humus</b> but also in the entire soil profiles of the research sites. The main contributor to soil improvement after afforestation is the formation of stable soil aggregates. This is typical also for spruce and pine cover...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains {{evaluation of}} the growth dynamics and nutritional status of tree species plantations after application of biological and chemical amelioration treatments, impact of trees on quality of soil and on the accumulation of <b>surface</b> <b>humus.</b> There were evaluated: Norway spruce (Picea abies L.), Blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.), Birch (Betula spp.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), Gray alder (Alnus incana Moench.), Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.), Eastern White pine (Pinus strobus L.) and Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.). On 4 research plots in Boleboř (Ore Mts.) was measured height, thickness of root collar, breast-height diameter. Were taken samples of soil, weed and assimilation apparatus. There was determined yellowing, browsing, plants mortality and calculated amount of accumulated <b>surface</b> <b>humus.</b> Application of fertilizer Silvamix Forte on spreading windrows reduced mortality and increased increment for the first 3 years, the effect is evident even after 10 years. It was not confirmed the attractiveness of plants for wildlife after Silvamix Forte application. Silvamix Mg fertilizer application had minimal effect on the growth dynamics and nutrient contents in needles. Positively impacted soil characteristics, increased {{the value of the}} cation exchange capacity, decrease in hydrolytic acidity, increase the saturation of sorption bases, decrease of aluminium ions Al 3 + and decrease of Fe 2 O 3. On fertilized plots increased content of available nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium, increase of the total supply of nitrogen, calcium and magnesium. The rapid increase in the content of Ca and Mg is related to the liming in 2002. Fertilizer application significantly supported the development of ground-weed on plots of Colorado blue spruce mixed with birch, while in pure stands of Colorado blue spruce led to a reduction in aboveground biomass. For the Colorado blue spruce mixed with birch plot compared with only Colorado blue spruce plot were documented favourable soil properties, increased supply of total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Rowan tree on an intact soil surface exhibits the lowest reaction pH as humus and in the mineral, high hydrolytic acidity, extremely sorption unsaturated soil state, high content of ion Al 3 + and low content of available calcium, although was applied liming. Technical and biological reclamation (Boleboř III.) has a long-term positive effect on the average height and breast-height diameter of Colorado blue spruce and white pine. The growth dynamics of European larch and Lodgepole pine were affect only at the beginning. Meliorated stand of Gray Alder has very good growth dynamics, comparable with Larch and Lodgepole pine. The big problem is the game impact, especially in Lodgepole pine, which led to the destruction of all individuals. Colorado Blue spruce in terms of biological reclamation is totally inappropriate. This Spruce has reduced resistance to abiotic factors, which often suffer uprooting and breakage. During the 21 years the Clorado Blue spruce mixed with birch accumulated of 66, 09 t. ha- 1 humus matter with better properties also in the deeper horizon. Colorado Blue spruce accumulated 54, 11 t. ha- 1 of humus matter. Rowan tree accumulated on the intact soil largest amount of humus matter (194, 98 t. ha- 1), however acidifies the deeper horizons. The stand of Norway Spruce occurred during the reporting period a decrease of 47 % to 107, 03 t. ha- 1. The decline may be associated with more open stand and due to air liming...|$|E
30|$|The {{study showed}} that at high altitude, both the soils under savanna and grazing land use systems had the highest mean soil total {{nitrogen}} content (0.36 %) followed by those under natural forest cover (0.30 %), while those under farmland system had the lowest. At this altitude, mean soil total nitrogen at the surface (0 – 15  cm) layer showed no significant difference (P >  0.01) between the soils under all the land use/land cover systems. It was observed that pasture density under grazing land use systems at the higher altitude was higher compared to that at lower altitudes. This has a direct relationship with organic matter content. Again, the similarities in results between savanna and grazing land may probably {{be due to the}} similarities in observed conditions (burning and cattle grazing) under the two land use systems in the area. The high amounts of nitrogen in soils under grazing land {{may be due to the}} burning of grass that produce ash which is rich in nitrogen and other major nutrients. It is well known that fire simulates cycling of nitrogen and thus, relatively high amounts of nitrogen in the ash could be found under such disturbed land use sites. Grazing land is also subjected to deposition of cow dung waste, which enhances the soil organic matter content. A high soil organic matter content strongly correlates with high nitrogen content. However, strong fires on sandy soils may give long-lasting loss of soil <b>surface</b> <b>humus</b> and nitrogen, which may lead to site impoverishment. Also, studies have suggested that grazing can promote nutrient cycling because livestock feces and urine provide large amounts of soluble nitrogen that is readily available to plants for growth and livestock excretions can promote soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization rates (McNaughton et al. 1997).|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the characteristics of volcanic ash soils in southwestern Tanzania. Twelve pedons of volcanic origin were studied, and 66 soil samples were analyzed. Soil morphology revealed volcanic ash layers of varying thicknesses. Most pedons had a dark thick <b>humus</b> <b>surface</b> and buried A, AB, and BA horizons with melanic indices of 1. 7 or less. Except in two pedons, the NaF pH was 9. 4 or more, reflecting an exchange complex dominated by amorphous materials and/or Al–humus complexes. The phospate-retention capacity ranged from 65 to 100 %, except in two pedons, and {{was positively correlated with}} NaF pH. Both Tanzanian and Japanese volcanic ash soils showed comparable ranges of base saturation (BS) values, but the distribution patterns of BS basic cations, for example, showed some differences. Some Tanzanian volcanic ash soils had higher BS values than their Japanese counterparts. While the Japanese soils were generally more calcic and magnesic, the Tanzanian soils were more potassic and sodic than their counterparts, most likely reflecting lithological differences among parent materials in the two study areas.

40|$|A {{landfill}} site in southern Finland was converted into urban green space by covering {{it with a}} layer of fresh forest humus transferred from nearby construction sites. The aim was to develop the 70 m high artificial hill into a recreational area with high biodiversity of flora and fauna. Forest humus was used as a source of organic matter, plant roots, seeds, soil fauna and microorganisms in order to enable rapid regeneration of diverse vegetation and soil biological functions. In this study we report the results of three years of monitoring of soil enzyme activity and plant species compositional patterns. Monthly soil samples were taken each year between June and September from four sites on the hill and from two standing reference forests using three replicate plots. Activities of 10 different enzymes, soil organic matter (SOM) content, moisture, pH and temperature of the surface layer were monitored. Abundances of vascular plant species were surveyed on the same four hill sites between late May and early September, three times a season in 2004 and 2005. Although the addition of organic soil considerably increased soil enzyme activities (per dw), the activities at the covered hill sites were far lower than in the reference forests. Temporal changes and differences between sites were analysed in more detail per soil organic matter (SOM) in order to reveal differences in the quality of SOM. All the sites had a characteristic enzyme activity pattern and two hill sites showed clear temporal changes. The enzyme activities in uncovered topsoil increased, whereas the activities at the covered Middle site decreased, when compared with other sites at the same time. The different trend between Middle and North sites in enzyme activities may reflect differences in humus material transferred to these sites, but difference in the succession of vegetation affects enzyme activities strongly. Middle yielded higher β-sitosterol content in 2004, as an indication of more intense plant impact. All reclaimed sites had characteristic plant species assemblages and parallel temporal changes, reflecting vegetation succession, occurred across all the sites. Rapid growth of vegetation on the covered sites restored the rhizosphere and contributed to the persistence of microbial activity.

40|$|The {{alkali metals}} K, Rb and Cs, and the {{alkaline}} earth metals Ca, Sr and Ba were analyzed in the rocks, minerals, soils, snow, stream water and soil moisture films of Thompson Canyon, a glacially scoured watershed {{in the central}} crest region of the Sierra Nevada in east central California. The stable isotope dilution method was used. 1. The mass balance of metals entering and leaving the watershed, the denudation rate, and chemical and mineralogical details of the weathering process: In the batholithic source rock, two major minerals, microcline and plagioclase, and one minor mineral, biotite, contain most {{of the mass of}} the six metals. Snow is the main source of water to the valley, and contains much lower concentrations of metals than has been previously reported. These metals originate from distant sources. The mass of metals leaving the watershed annually in stream outflow indicates that the watershed is being denuded at a rate of less than 1 cm per 1000 yr, and that the principal process is chemical removal. Ca and Sr are being denuded more rapidly from the batholithic rock than the alkalies or Ba. This is shown by the greater proportion of Ca and Sr in stream water in contrast to the greater proportion of alkalies and Ba in the source rock. Rapid breakdown of plagioclase is responsible for this differential removal. In rock and grus, ratios among metals present in plagioclase (Ca and Sr) and those in K-feldspar (K and Ba) show that plagioclase is preferentially removed as rocks weather and crumble to grus. Rivulets running away from melting snow banks in mid summer dissolve large amounts of Ca and Sr at only short distances away from the snow banks, and hold these metals for transport out of the watershed. Particles from the snow banks, rich in Rb and Cs, similar in composition to mica, are deposited in soils by the rivulets. Comparison of metal compositions of rock and grus show that mica particles are freed as the rocks break down. 2. Metals in soils: Masses and distribution of the six metals were determined in the soil reservoir. Three soil fractions were analyzed: (1) organic matter (humus), (2) clay (+ silt) size and (3) igneous minerals (sand size). The Rb/K and Cs/K ratios are greater in humus than in whole soil or in the source rocks. On the other hand, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios are lower in the humus. The metal ratios in humus are similar to those in soil moisture films in subsaturated soils. Area and humus content of soil types show that about 100, 000 tons of humus are present in the watershed. The mass of metals in humus is about 100 times greater than that mobilized annually by weathering or present in soil moisture films. Metal composition of the clay fraction is similar to batholithic rock, but richer in Rb and Cs. The igneous mineral fraction shows that soils are not the residue rich in quartz and alkali feldspar which would be predicted from rock composition and data on metal loss from the watershed. Instead, the soils are enriched in plagioclase and depleted in K-feldspar, necessitating a hypothesis that the weathering products of K-feldspar in soils are periodically swept out of the watershed. Data on metals in turbid streams after violent rains support this. 3. Metals in soil moisture films: Soil moisture films may be regarded as the final geological occurrence of metals in a food chain, because in this form metals are available to the roots of growing plants. A technique was developed for collecting minute samples (300 mg) of moisture from undisturbed soils in the field by rapid blotting onto stacks of cleaned absorbent paper discs. The proportions of metals in soil moisture films are different from those in source rocks. In soil moisture the heavy metal Cs is greatly enriched in the alkali family, and in the alkaline earth family the heavy metal Ba is depleted. Metal concentrations in soil moisture films collected in the field are quite different from those in soil solutions prepared in the laboratory by traditional methods, and from "exchangeable" and "soluble" ions determined in [ammonium] acetate buffered solutions: soil moisture films show K/Ca ratios commonly as high as 4, while other traditional methods give values below unity for the same soils. Compared to other types of water, such as phreatic and stream samples, soil moisture films have much higher concentrations of alkalies relative to alkaline earths. Metal concentrations in soil moisture films vary seasonally, concentrations of alkalies increasing in the autumn near the <b>surface</b> of <b>humus</b> rich soil...|$|R
