500|$|Apart {{from those}} within his circle, Heseltine drew {{inspiration}} from other composers whose work he respected: Franz Liszt, Gabriel Fauré, and Claude Debussy. He had, however, a particular dislike for the works of his fellow <b>song-writer</b> Hugo Wolf. Heseltine's songs demonstrate moods of both darkness and warm good humour, a dichotomy that helped to fuel {{the idea of a}} split Warlock/Heseltine personality. This theory was rejected by the composer's friends and associates, who tended to see the division in terms of [...] "Philip drunk or Philip sober".|$|E
500|$|The song's B-side, titled [...] "There For Me", was a {{leftover}} track from Carey's Rainbow (1999), {{which she}} wrote alongside David Foster and Diane Warren. After Carey abandoned work with longtime collaborator Walter Afanasieff, she {{began working with}} Foster throughout Rainbow. During their many creative meetings, Foster introduced Carey to Warren, a <b>song-writer</b> {{in which he had}} collaborated several times in the past. Throughout the process of writing and producing the song, the female pair did not work well with each other, as Carey accused Warren of repeating lyrical phrases too often, while Warren did not agree with some of Carey's production choices. After they completed the song, Carey wrote two other ballads with Warren for Rainbow, entitled [...] "After Tonight" [...] and [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)".|$|E

60|$|The {{critics of}} the day, headed by Professor Wilson, {{declared}} he was Burns's rival as a <b>song-writer,</b> and his superior in anything relating to external nature! indeed they wrote of him as unsurpassed by poet or painter in his fairy tales of ancient time, dubbing him Poet Laureate to the Queen of Elfland; and yet his unrefined manner tempted these friends to speak of him familiarly as the greatest hog in all Apollo's herd, or the Boar of the Forest, etc. etc.|$|E
60|$|Hero, Prophet, Poet,--many {{different}} names, {{in different}} times, and places, do we give to Great Men; according to varieties we note in them, {{according to the}} sphere {{in which they have}} displayed themselves! We might give many more names, on this same principle. I will remark again, however, as a fact not unimportant to be understood, that the different sphere constitutes the grand origin of such distinction; that the Hero can be Poet, Prophet, King, Priest or what you will, according to the kind of world he finds himself born into. I confess, I have no notion of a truly great man that could not be all sorts of men. The Poet who could merely sit on a chair, and compose stanzas, would never make a stanza worth much. He could not sing the Heroic warrior, unless he himself were at least a Heroic warrior too. I fancy there is in him the Politician, the Thinker, Legislator, Philosopher;--in one or the other degree, he could have been, he is all these. So too I cannot understand how a Mirabeau, with that great glowing heart, with the fire that was in it, with the bursting tears that were in it, could not have written verses, tragedies, poems, and touched all hearts in that way, had his course of life and education led him thitherward. The grand fundamental character is that of Great Man; that the man be great. Napoleon has words in him which are like Austerlitz Battles. Louis Fourteenth's Marshals are a kind of poetical men withal; the things Turenne says are full of sagacity and geniality, like sayings of Samuel Johnson. The great heart, the clear deep-seeing eye: there it lies; no man whatever, in what province soever, can prosper at all without these. Petrarch and Boccaccio did diplomatic messages, it seems, quite well: one can easily believe it; they had done things a little harder than these! Burns, a gifted <b>song-writer,</b> might have made a still better Mirabeau. Shakspeare,--one knows not what he could not have made, in the supreme degree.|$|E
