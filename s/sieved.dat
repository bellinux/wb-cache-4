In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} gratin, <b>sieved</b> and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from Liguria, or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
5|$|To {{underscore}} {{that the}} feast represents an exotic bygone world of pre-partition Poland, Mickiewicz {{added to this}} a list of random dishes, ingredients and additives, whose names he found in Compendium ferculorum and which had already been forgotten in his own time: kontuza (soup of boiled and <b>sieved</b> meat), arkas (sweet milk-based jelly), blemas (blancmange), pomuchla (Atlantic cod), figatele (meatballs), cybeta (civet), piżmo (musk), dragant (tragacanth), pinele (pine nuts) and brunele (prunes). This {{is followed by a}} similar enumeration of various kinds of fish, whose names are likewise taken from the inventory at the beginning of Czerniecki's book. A description of a white-apron-clad chef and a reference to Prince Ossoliński's banquet in Rome, both found in Book 11, are also clearly inspired by Czerniecki's characterization of a master chef and his dedication, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are <b>sieved</b> from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E

5|$|When <b>sieved</b> {{from the}} water, food is {{swallowed}} and travels through the esophagus where it enters a three-chambered-stomach. The first compartment {{is known as}} the fore-stomach; this is where food gets ground up into an acidic liquid, which is then squirted into the main stomach. Like in humans, the food is mixed with hydrochloric acid and protein-digesting enzymes. Then, the partly digested food is moved into the third stomach, where it meets fat-digesting enzymes, and is then mixed with an alkaline liquid to neutralize the acid from the fore-stomach to prevent damage to the intestinal tract. Their intestinal tract is highly adapted to absorb the most nutrients from food; the walls are folded and contain copious blood vessels, allowing for a greater surface area over which digested food and water can be absorbed. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food; however, the salt content of most of their prey (invertebrates) are similar to that of seawater, whereas the salt content of a whale's blood is considerably lower (three times lower) than that of seawater. The whale kidney is adapted to excreting excess salt; however, while producing urine more concentrated than seawater, it wastes a lot of water which must be replaced.|$|E

Three versions of the <b>sieve</b> were considered, namely: traditional <b>sieve,</b> improved traditional <b>sieve</b> and mechanized <b>sieve.</b> Their constructions, use and associated problems were highlighted. The need to consider <b>sieve</b> aperture size in both traditional and mechanized <b>sieve</b> design and construction was emphasized. This was necessary as the speed of <b>sieve</b> and the strain on the operator has an inverse relation to this. From the expression derived for effective <b>sieving</b> technology, {{it was discovered that}} <b>sieve</b> aperture is directly proportional to <b>sieving</b> speed but inversely proportional to operators strain. This mean that as the aperture size is increased to the optimum, the speed of <b>sieve</b> will increase remarkably whereas on the other hand, the operators reciprocating shearing and compressive force and hence associated strain will reduce. For mechanized <b>sieving</b> machines utilizing shearing and compressive force principle, using an optimum aperture, while increasing <b>sieving</b> speed will reduce compressive impact and friction in the interacting surfaces which will prolong the machine life...|$|R

25|$|Egyptian bread {{was made}} almost {{exclusively}} from emmer wheat, {{which was more}} difficult to turn into flour than most other varieties of wheat. The chaff does not come off through threshing, but comes in spikelets {{that needed to be}} removed by moistening and pounding with a pestle to avoid crushing the grains inside. It was then dried in the sun, winnowed and <b>sieved</b> and finally milled on a saddle quern, which functioned by moving the grindstone back and forth, rather than with a rotating motion.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} main {{ingredients}} of traditional Libyan food: olives (and olive oil), dates, grains and milk. Grains are roasted, ground, <b>sieved</b> {{and used for}} making bread, cakes, soups and bazeen. Dates are harvested, dried and can be eaten as they are, made into syrup or slightly fried and eaten with bsisa and milk. After eating, Libyans often drink black tea. This is normally repeated a second time (for the second glass of tea), and {{in the third round}} of tea, it is served with roasted peanuts or roasted almonds known as shay bi'l-luz (mixed with the tea in the same glass).|$|E
25|$|Most <b>sieve</b> {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet <b>sieving.</b> This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry <b>sieving</b> process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the <b>sieve</b> meshes and this would make a further <b>sieving</b> process impossible. A wet <b>sieving</b> process is set up like a dry process: the <b>sieve</b> stack is clamped onto the <b>sieve</b> shaker and the sample is placed on the top <b>sieve.</b> Above the top <b>sieve</b> a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the <b>sieving</b> process additionally to the <b>sieving</b> motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the <b>sieves</b> have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet <b>sieving</b> it is very important not to change the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).|$|R
50|$|In number theory, {{the larger}} <b>sieve</b> is a sifting device invented by P. X. Gallagher.

25|$|Microscopy of beer residue {{points to}} a {{different}} method of brewing where bread was not used as an ingredient. One batch of grain was sprouted, which produced enzymes. The next batch was cooked in water, dispersing the starch and then the two batches were mixed. The enzymes began to consume the starch to produce sugar. The resulting mixture was then <b>sieved</b> to remove chaff, and yeast (and probably lactic acid) was then added to begin a fermentation process that produced alcohol. This method of brewing is still used in parts of non-industrialized Africa. Most beers were made of barley {{and only a few}} of emmer wheat, but so far no evidence of flavoring has been found.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all that}} remains is bone. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and {{surgical}} implants, such as hip replacements.

Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground). Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as gleanings) are <b>sieved</b> out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.|$|E

500|$|In {{his history}} of the club, Peter Wynne-Thomas {{describes}} MacLaren as the dominant figure in Lancashire cricket from his debut until the First World War. Gibson accepts that MacLaren was tactically a good captain, but observes that in his 12 seasons as leader of a strong Lancashire team, he only once won the County Championship. In addition, as the appointed captain in four series against Australia, he was beaten in each one, something no other England captain has repeated. Gibson suggests that [...] "the excuses begin to run thin, <b>sieved</b> through such a tale of failure."

500|$|The {{actual number}} of recipes {{deviates}} from that claimed by the author. On the one hand, {{there may be more}} than one recipe under a single numbered heading. For example, under number 4 in chapter 1, there are three disparate recipes, one for stewed meat in saffron sauce, one for a thick sauce of <b>sieved</b> vegetables and one for boiled meatballs, as well as a tip to add raisins only to those dishes that are meant to be sweet. Chapter 2 opens with five unnumbered recipes for sauces to be used with fish. On the other hand, some of the numbered headings are not followed by any actual recipe, serving only to reiterate that various dishes may be prepared using the same basic technique. For instance, in chapter 3, the recipe for a puff-pastry apple tart, is followed by eleven numbered headings saying, [...] "pear tart likewise", [...] "woodland strawberry tart likewise", [...] "sour cherry tart likewise", and so on for fig, prune, date, gooseberry, peach, plum, currant and quince tarts.|$|E

50|$|Disadvantages: many PSDs are {{concerned}} with particles too small for separation by <b>sieving</b> to be practical. A very fine <b>sieve,</b> such as 37 μm <b>sieve,</b> is exceedingly fragile, {{and it is very}} difficult to get material to pass through it. Another disadvantage is that the amount of energy used to <b>sieve</b> the sample is arbitrarily determined. Over-energetic <b>sieving</b> causes attrition of the particles and thus changes the PSD, while insufficient energy fails to break down loose agglomerates. Although manual <b>sieving</b> procedures can be ineffective, automated <b>sieving</b> technologies using image fragmentation analysis software are available. These technologies can <b>sieve</b> material by capturing and analyzing a photo of material.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sieve</b> {{cells are}} long, slender, {{conducting}} {{cells of the}} phloem that do not form a constituent element of a <b>sieve</b> tube, but which are provided with relatively unspecialized <b>sieve</b> areas, especially in the tapering ends of the cells that overlap those of other <b>sieve</b> cells. <b>Sieve</b> cells are typically associated with gymnosperms, because angiosperms have the more derived <b>sieve</b> tube members and companion cells in their phloem. They have a narrower diameter and are more elongated compared to <b>sieve</b> tube members. <b>Sieve</b> cells are associated with albuminous cells (also called Strasburger cells), which lack starch, thus {{making it possible to}} differentiate them from phloem parenchyma.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>sieve</b> analysis, a {{coarse-grained}} soil sample is shaken {{through a series}} of woven-wire square-mesh <b>sieves.</b> Each <b>sieve</b> has successively smaller openings so particles larger than the size of each <b>sieve</b> are retained on the <b>sieve.</b> The percentage of each soil size is measured by weighing the amount retained on each <b>sieve</b> and comparing the weight to the total weight of the sample.

2500|$|While {{the process}} is secret, the general method for making yeast extract on a {{commercial}} scale is to add salt to a suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, {{which leads to the}} cells shrivelling up; this triggers [...] "autolysis", in which the yeast self-destructs. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, and since yeast cells have thick cell walls which would detract from the smoothness of the end product, the husks are <b>sieved</b> out. As with other yeast extracts, Marmite contains free glutamic acids, which are analogous to monosodium glutamate.|$|E

Normally, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1 part per million. Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10μm vs. 120–150μm for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.|$|E
