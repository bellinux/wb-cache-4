25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E

While public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies, consumers' efforts to do so in real life have remained sketchy at best.|$|E

2500|$|The concept {{itself was}} {{certainly}} not a new one, but putting it into practice under the military dogma and commander egos {{of the day was}} easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> Throughout 1942 in particular, the coordination and flexibility exercised between Coningham's Western Desert Air Force (WDAF) and the 8th Army has been contrasted with the more rigid relationship between the Luftwaffe and German ground forces. During the first week of July, 1942, WDAF flew 5,458 sorties against Axis forces, using the innovative tactic of leap-frogging airfields, and Erwin Rommel informed Berlin on 4 July that he was abandoning his El Alamein offensive to concentrate on defence.

2500|$|By a {{handbook}} or a portolan chart, a navigator {{could see}} immediately that, for example, Pisa lay 85 miles southeast ("Scirocco" [...] {{in the traditional}} compass rose nomenclature) of Genoa, and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that bearing for that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat. [...] A mariner wishing to sail from Majorca to Naples could tell the latter was due east ("Levante") by some 600 miles – but the island of Sardinia lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route. [...] This is easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done,</b> as geographical coordinates did not exist during this era.

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "...while I can’t say I LOVED “The Bear King”, I {{can at least}} say I {{respected}} what it was going for: It’s clear that Merida (Amy Manson) {{is going to be}} important to the endgame of this King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) storyline, so we needed to establish why and to what degree. And this is easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done,</b> considering Merida is a character who, up until this point, hasn’t even been particularly likable. I like Amy Manson in the role of Merida, but she hasn’t always been given the best material, often coming across as unnecessarily combative and standoffish. And so this episode was necessary to soften the character and illustrate why she’s as hard-nosed as she is. This episode also gave Manson the opportunity to really shine, while also bringing back some OUAT alums I didn’t realize I’d missed, such as Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Ruby (Meghan Ory). We also get to meet more of Merida’s family, such as Queen Elinor (Caroline Morahan), and — through flashbacks — the late King Fergus (Glenn Keogh). It’s a story that details how Merida is shaped into a warrior and a ruler who inspires leadership in her people, and from that standpoint, it’s one of the season’s more effective character studies." ...|$|E

Gravel left the armor behind on the southern bank to provide direct fire support. As he remembered, the American M-48s were too heavy for the bridge and the ARVN tankers [...] "refused to go." [...] As the Marine infantry started across, an enemy machine gun {{on the other end}} of the bridge opened up, killing and wounding several Marines. One Marine, Lance Corporal Lester A. Tully, later awarded the Silver Star for his action, ran forward, threw a grenade, and silenced the gun. Two platoons successfully made their way to the other side. They turned left and immediately came under automatic weapons and recoilless rifle fire from the Citadel wall. The Marines decided to withdraw. This was easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> The enemy was well dug-in and firing from virtually every building in Huế city north of the river. The number of wounded was rising, the Marines commandeered some abandoned Vietnamese civilian vehicles and used them as makeshift ambulances to carry out the wounded. Among the casualties on the bridge was Major Walter M. Murphy, the 1st Battalion S-3 or operations officer, who later died of his wounds.|$|E
2500|$|Sender (1999), Ingebretsen (1999), and Bhat et al. (1998) {{point out}} that there are {{advertisers}} who do use gay and lesbian models to promote directly to the gay and lesbian community, but wish to remain innocuous to heterosexuals. Gay and lesbian advertisers do not actively pursue national recognition (which is essentially to a much larger demographic of heterosexuals) mostly due to fear and criticism. However, some very notable corporations, such as [...] "Sony, Toyota, Microsoft, Levi's, Banana Republic, American Express, Miller, and Absolut now commonly use gay media. Some firms (IKEA, Calvin Klein, Benetton) have gone further into using homosexual imagery in advertising to [...] more general audiences" [...] (Bhat et al., 1998, p.10). The gay and lesbian advertisers should be creating ads that appeal to all sexual preferences, even though this may be easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> The gay and lesbian advertisers must go beyond their select audience for ad campaigns targeting gays and lesbians to look at the inclusion, instead of exclusion, of heterosexuals. Sender (1999) suggests that on the heterosexual side, [...] "images which are arousing for lesbians, but which may not have originally been intended for , may actually offer greater pleasure than those which are implicitly coded to suggest a lesbian reading" [...] (p.191). If such is the case for [...] "hot lesbian" [...] advertisements, then there is nothing to say that actual lesbian advertisements might find heterosexuals left wanting something as well from them.|$|E

Participants are asked to respond to forty-five questions using a Likert scale of 1 to 6 (1 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). Questions measure respondents’ own attitudes toward individuals with learning disabilities, in addition to their perceptions of other students’ attitudes. Although data collection is ongoing, preliminary data analysis has been conducted on responses from two male and three female undergraduate students, recruited from undergraduate psychology courses, and that have attended Central for one to three years. Data indicate that the majority of respondents view Central as welcoming towards individuals with disabilities (Mean = 5. 56), in addition to providing more services for <b>said</b> individuals <b>than</b> <b>do</b> other universities (Mean = 4. 44). While respondents agree with the statement that other students may ostracize those with disabilities (Mean = 4. 11), they disagree that they, themselves, would feel nervous around someone with a disability (Mean = 1. 89).

Results confirm {{significant differences between the}} contractor's productivity rates {{for each of the three}} countries investigated (Germany, France and the UK). German firms are the most efficient at reinforcement and concrete placing operations, whereas French firms are most productive at formwork. UK firms are the least productive for two operations, namely formwork and concrete. French firms are least productive at fixing reinforcement. Based on a specific model project, it is determined that French and German firms require significantly fewer man-hours to carry out the <b>said</b> concrete operations <b>than</b> <b>do</b> UK firms. UK contractors achieve the lowest levels of labour productivity for the operations involved. The UK also exhibited greater productivity variation, i. e. providing evidence of extreme (most and least efficient) levels of labour output for several concrete operations. Leading on from these analyses, a construction (labour) cost comparison indicates that French contractors are the least expensive. Furthermore, the ideal solution for clients would be to have French firms build their projects in the UK, since this combination provides the most economic solution to the model building overall.
