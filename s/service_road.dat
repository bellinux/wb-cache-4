5|$|In April 1863, {{the fort}} was {{named in honor}} of the {{recently}} deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the time of its dedication, the fort was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A <b>service</b> <b>road</b> crossed the trenches in the southern half of the fort, connecting with River Road behind the fort. Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons. A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an outwork of the fort and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest of the fort.|$|E
5|$|NY454 {{continues}} as a four-lane arterial {{through a large}} commercial district, intersecting with CR93 (Lakeland Avenue). There, the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport and bends to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial {{for the last two}} miles (3.2km) of NY454. About three miles (4.8km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY454 connects to the Sunrise Highway (NY27) at exit51, a partial interchange in Holbrook. Here, the NY454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound <b>service</b> <b>road</b> of NY27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY454 itself; instead, the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>service</b> <b>roads</b> are {{somewhat}} uncommon on most New Jersey highways (as {{they use a}} [...] "Stroad" [...] design), they do exist. In northern New Jersey, Route 3 has several <b>service</b> <b>roads</b> throughout much of its length, {{due in part to}} the heavy commercial development in the area. Notably, commuters will often use these <b>service</b> <b>roads</b> to get ahead of regular traffic back ups, often causing accidents which lead to the shut down of said <b>service</b> <b>roads,</b> defeating their purpose.|$|R
40|$|There are {{claims that}} <b>service</b> <b>roads</b> (frontage roads) reduce the rent {{and value of}} {{adjacent}} commercial properties.

5|$|Shortly {{north of}} the I-495 interchange, the {{northbound}} off-ramp and southbound on-ramp at NY25A split, then run under a pedestrian bridge that connects 46th Avenue. Other pedestrian bridges cross over the highway near 42nd Avenue and at 33rd Avenue. The northbound exit 5 uses 206th Street as a de facto <b>service</b> <b>road,</b> while 207th Street {{is used in the}} same way for the northbound on-ramps. Real service roads run beneath the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road to connect NY25A and 35th Avenue (exit6A). The service roads merge into the expressway north of 26th Avenue (exit6B).|$|E
5|$|The 300 Bloor–Danforth bus {{provides}} late-night {{service to}} {{the area around the}} stations when the subway is not in operation. This service operates frequently along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue between East/West Mall and Kennedy Stn via Danforth Road, Brimley Road, Eglinton Avenue East, North/South <b>Service</b> <b>Road,</b> Transway Crescent and Kennedy Road. On Sundays, these routes operate through the early morning hours, because the subway starts at 9:00a.m. instead of the usual 6:00a.m. Frequency is 6–30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The SJTA {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a major road improvement project that would link the Atlantic City International Airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with an overpass above Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a <b>service</b> <b>road</b> with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass {{at the end of}} Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township.|$|E

5|$|The {{first person}} to climb the {{mountain}} was Thomas Gerdine, along {{with a group of}} United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and Darcy Bard, in 1897. The volcano is also available to skiers. To reach the mountain itself, it takes 5 miles of walking along the White Chuck River Trail (Forest Service Trail No. 643) and up the Sitkum Glacier. The trail is reached via Forest <b>Service</b> <b>Road</b> No. 23. Mainly, the slopes consist of black diamonds for both the ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} north, {{serving as}} the boundary between Searingtown and Albertson as it proceeds past side streets lined by homes. At I.U. Willets Road, CR101 serves Henry Wiscardi School and enters Searingtown. Just inside of the community, CR101 intersects Hilldale Drive and Dogwood Road, two local streets connecting to Herricks Middle School. The route continues on through Searingtown into the village of North Hills, where the homes give way to trees as it turns to the northeast and passes under the Northern State Parkway. A short distance after the Northern Parkway overpass, CR101 meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) by way of Nassau Boulevard—the southern service road—and North <b>Service</b> <b>Road.</b>|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on {{a span of}} the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a frontage road named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the <b>service</b> <b>road</b> and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until {{the northern end of}} the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall. NY384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY5 turns east onto Church.|$|E

5|$|NY144 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US9W {{in the town}} of New Baltimore, just north of US9W's junction with County Route51 (CR51). The route heads northeastward through New Baltimore as a two-lane rural roadway, crossing CSX Transportation's West Shore Line before intersecting with a <b>service</b> <b>road</b> that connects to the New Baltimore Travel Plaza on the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY144 passes by a stretch of homes alongside the Thruway and crosses over the toll road, at which point the road enters a residential but wooded area of the town. This stretch leads to the hamlet of New Baltimore, located on {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River. In the residential center of the community, NY144 intersects with the northern terminus of CR61 (River Road). At this junction, NY144 makes a turn northward, following the riverbank out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Route 124 {{crosses the}} Passaic River and {{runs along the}} border of Millburn, Essex County {{to the north and}} Summit, Union County, coming to a large {{interchange}} with the Route 24 freeway and CR649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR657, where the Route 124 frontage road has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 frontage road has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old road section from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects Essex CR608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 frontage road along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South <b>Service</b> <b>Road</b> that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR512 near an interchange with Route 24. There is a direct ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.|$|E
5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service will continue to serve the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow <b>service</b> <b>road.</b> Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would be new stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E

Shortly afterward the expressway crosses under both directions of NY27 on separate bridges. After that, Seamans Neck Road (CR 191) becomes the <b>service</b> <b>road</b> to the expressway, running parallel to the east. There is a bridge over Clark Street in the nearby community of Massapequa, where West Seamans Neck Road, the southbound <b>service</b> <b>road,</b> ends. After a short distance, Seamans Neck Road ends at exit3 for NY105.|$|E
50|$|As Sunrise Highway was {{upgraded}} {{during the}} 1970s and 1980s many interchanges were redesigned and replaced. The original interchange with the Robert Moses Causeway in West Islip had two parkway-style arch bridges over two lanes of NY 27. When the <b>service</b> <b>roads</b> {{were built in}} Western Islip Township between 1969 and 1972, parkway-style bridges were added for them as well. The interchanges at Fifth Ave and Brentwood Road in Bay Shore had parkway-style arch bridges and cloverleafs. When the <b>service</b> <b>roads</b> were added, the parkway-style bridges were removed and replaced with the modern structures that exist today and the original cloverleafs were modified to align with the new <b>service</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
