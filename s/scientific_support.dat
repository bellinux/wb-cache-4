5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers {{also tend to be}} more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species {{can be attributed to the}} direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E

25|$|Because {{ethology}} {{is considered}} a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the evolution of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour {{in terms of the}} theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé George Romanes, who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an anthropomorphic method, anecdotal cognitivism, that did not gain <b>scientific</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
25|$|Certain abiogenic {{hypotheses}} {{gained some}} popularity among geologists {{over the past}} several centuries. Scientists in the former Soviet Union widely held that significant petroleum deposits could be attributed to abiogenic origin, though this view fell out of favor {{toward the end of the}} 20th century because they did not make useful predictions for the discovery of oil deposits. It has now been generally accepted that the theory of abiogenic formation of petroleum has insufficient <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> and that oil and gas fuels on Earth are formed almost exclusively from organic material.|$|E

25|$|Craniosacral {{therapy is}} an {{alternative}} medical practice whose main hypothesis is that restrictions at cranial sutures of the skull affect rhythmic impulses conveyed via cerebrospinal fluid, and that gentle pressure on external areas can improve the flow and balance of the supply of this fluid to the brain, relieving symptoms of many conditions. There is no <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> for major elements of the underlying model, there is little scientific {{evidence to support the}} therapy, and research methods that could conclusively evaluate the therapy's effectiveness have not been applied.

25|$|Based on the {{speculation}} that heavy metal poisoning may trigger {{the symptoms of}} autism, particularly in small subsets of individuals who cannot excrete toxins effectively, some parents have turned to alternative medicine practitioners who provide detoxification treatments via chelation therapy. However, evidence to support this practice has been anecdotal and not rigorous. Strong epidemiological evidence refutes links between environmental triggers, in particular thiomersal containing vaccines, and the onset of autistic symptoms. No scientific data supports {{the claim that the}} mercury in the vaccine preservative thiomersal causes autism or its symptoms, and there is no <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> for chelation therapy as a treatment for autism.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the controversies}} facing bite mark {{analysis}} {{are due to}} the lack of empirical supporting evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960–1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question whether or not there is enough <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.|$|E

However, because Central Java is a volcanic region, the charring may have resulted from natural fires, and there is no conclusive proof that Homo erectus in Java controlled fire.

500|$|Darwin's view – that gaps in {{the fossil}} record {{accounted}} for the apparently sudden appearance of diverse life forms – still had <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> over a century later. In the early 1970s Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden {{by the lack of}} fossils. However, Preston Cloud held a different view about the origins of complex life, writing in 1948 and 1968 that the evolution of animals in the Early Cambrian was [...] "explosive". This [...] "explosive" [...] view was supported by the hypothesis of punctuated equilibrium, which Eldredge and Gould developed in the early 1970s—which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis [...] "punctuated" [...] by short periods of rapid change.|$|E
500|$|In the essay, Carr {{introduces}} {{the discussion of}} the <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche {{is said to have been}} influenced by technology. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler in his book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand. The idea that Nietzsche's writing style had changed for better or worse when he adopted the typewriter was disputed by several critics. Kevin Kelly and Scott Esposito each offered alternate explanations for the apparent changes. Esposito believed that [...] "the brain is so huge and amazing and enormously complex that it's far, far off base to think that a few years of Internet media or the acquisition of a typewriter can fundamentally rewire it." [...] In a response to Esposito's point, neuroscientist James Olds stated that recent brain research demonstrated that it was [...] "pretty clear that the adult brain can re-wire on the fly". In The New York Times it was reported that several scientists believed that it was certainly plausible that the brain's neural circuitry may be shaped differently by regular Internet usage compared with the reading of printed works.|$|E
500|$|On 17 July 1980, an {{expedition}} sponsored by Texan oilman Jack Grimm set off from Port Everglades, Florida, {{in the research}} vessel H.J.W. Fay. Grimm had previously sponsored expeditions to find Noah's Ark, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, and the giant hole in the North Pole predicted by the pseudoscientific Hollow Earth hypothesis. To raise funds for his Titanic expedition, he obtained sponsorship from friends with whom he played poker, sold media rights through the William Morris Agency, commissioned a book, and obtained the services of Orson Welles to narrate a documentary. He acquired <b>scientific</b> <b>support</b> from Columbia University by donating $330,000 to the Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory {{for the purchase of}} a wide-sweep sonar, in exchange for five years' use of the equipment and the services of technicians to support it. Drs. William B. Ryan of Columbia University and Fred Spiess of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California joined the expedition as consultants. They nearly stayed ashore when Grimm introduced them to a new consultant – a monkey called Titan, which was trained to point at a spot on the map to supposedly indicate where Titanic was. The scientists issued an ultimatum: [...] "It's either us or the monkey." [...] Grimm preferred the monkey, but was prevailed upon to leave it behind and bring the scientists instead.|$|E
