2500|$|Corium (and {{also highly}} {{irradiated}} uranium fuel) has an interesting property: spontaneous dust generation, or spontaneous self-sputtering of the surface.

However the level of radioactivity is such that, {{over the course of}} a hundred years, the self irradiation of the lava [...] αdecays per gram and 2 to [...] of β or γ) will fall short of the level of self irradiation which is required to greatly change the properties of glass (1018 α decays per gram and 108 to 109Gy of β or γ). Also the rate of dissolution of the lava in water is very low (10−7 g·cm−2 day−1) suggesting that the lava is unlikely to dissolve in water.|$|E

Presynaptically, axonal boutons undergo <b>submicron</b> displacements that indent the dendritic spines. Postsynaptically, innervation causes dendritic spines to remodel {{by as much as}} 30% over a period of seconds. The spines show a lateral expansion that envelops the presynaptic axonal indentation.

50|$|Archimedes {{belongs to}} the {{well-known}} family of TCAD software, i.e. tools utilized to assist the development of technologically relevant products.

Today Archimedes is used in several big companies for simulation and production purposes.|$|E
50|$|During {{direct contact}} {{one must be}} careful because the stamp can easily be {{physically}} deformed causing printed features that {{are different from the}} original stamp features. Horizontally stretching or compressing the stamp will cause deformations in the raised and recessed features. Also, applying too much vertical pressure on the stamp during printing can cause the raised relief features to flatten against the substrate. These deformations can yield <b>submicron</b> features even though the original stamp has a lower resolution.|$|E

In 1985, Davari began the task of defining IBM’s next generation of CMOS integrated circuits, which {{came to be called}} CMOS-5X. He led the research efforts that produced the first generation of high-performance, low voltage deep <b>submicron</b> CMOS technology. CMOS-5X served {{as the basis for the}} PowerPC® 601+ and several other microprocessors, including those used in IBM System/390 servers.|$|E
50|$|At <b>submicron</b> scales, 3D {{materials}} {{no longer}} have the same behavior as their 2D form, which can be an advantage. For example, graphene has a very high carrier mobility, and accompanying lower losses through the Joule effect. But graphene has zero bandgap, which results in a disqualifyingly low on/off ratio in transistor applications. TMDC monolayers might be an alternative: they are structurally stable, display a band gap and show electron mobilities comparable to those of silicon, so they can be used to fabricate transistors.|$|E

50|$|Fougèrite {{was first}} found in forested soils near Fougères, Brittany, France, and {{recognised}} as a valid mineral species by the International Mineralogical Association in 2002. It is blue-green to bluish-gray in colour, and resembles clay minerals in habit, forming hexagonal platelets of <b>submicron</b> diameter. In this environment, it is intimately intergrown with trébeurdenite, to give varying overall ratios of Fe2+:Fe3+. The existence of two intergrown fixed-composition phases {{has been demonstrated}} by Mössbauer spectroscopy. The mineral is unstable in air, and decomposes by oxidation, dehydration and decarbonation, to ferrihydrite, and ultimately to lepidocrocite or goethite, Fe3+O(OH).|$|E
50|$|Archimedes is a TCAD {{package for}} use by {{engineers}} to design and simulate <b>submicron</b> and mesoscopic semiconductor devices. Archimedes is free software and thus it can be copied, modified and redistributed under GPL. Archimedes uses the Ensemble Monte Carlo method {{and is able to}} simulate physics effects and transport for electrons and heavy holes in Silicon, Germanium, GaAs, InSb, AlSb, AlAs, AlxInxSb, AlxIn(1-x)Sb, AlP, AlSb, GaP, GaSb, InP and their compounds (III-V semiconductor materials), along with Silicon Oxide. Applied and/or self-consistent electrostatic and magnetic fields are handled with the Poisson and Faraday equations.|$|E
5000|$|Specifically, the lab develops, validates and applies {{simulation}} techniques, {{from the}} <b>submicron</b> scale to full system scale, to engineer low-CO2 energy systems. Examples of the simulation work include studies of thermoacoustic instability and multiphysics multiscale simulations of entrained flow gasification. [...] These simulations {{are supported by}} high-performance computing systems and high-resolution optical diagnostics. The long-term goals of the lab include innovation in clean combustion for propulsion and power, gasification for power and biofuel production, and oxy-combustion and electrochemical/thermochemical conversion in ion transport membrane reactors and high-temperature fuel cells.|$|E
50|$|The way microrobots {{move around}} is a {{function}} of their purpose and necessary size. At <b>submicron</b> sizes, the physical world demands rather bizarre ways of getting around. The Reynolds number for airborne robots is close to unity; the viscous forces dominate the inertial forces, so “flying” could use the viscosity of air, rather than Bernoulli's principle of lift. Robots moving through fluids may require rotating flagella like the motile form of E. coli. Hopping is stealthy and energy-efficient; it allows the robot to negotiate the surfaces of a variety of terrains. Pioneering calculations (Solem 1994) examined possible behaviours based on physical realities.|$|E
50|$|The term {{waveguide}} can {{be applied}} not only to fibres, but also to other waveguiding structures such as silicon photonic subwavelength waveguides. The term <b>submicron</b> is often synonymous to subwavelength, as the majority of experiments are carried out using light with a wavelength between 0.8 and 1.6 µm. All the names with the prefix nano- are somewhat misleading, since it is usually applied to objects with dimensions {{on the scale of}} nanometers (e.g., nanoparticle, nanotechnology). The characteristic behaviour of the SDF appears when the fibre diameter is about half of the wavelength of light. That is why the term subwavelength is the most appropriate for these objects.|$|E
50|$|To {{quantify}} microstructural features, both morphological {{and material}} property must be characterized. Image processing is a robust technique for determination of morphological {{features such as}} volume fraction, inclusion morphology, void and crystal orientations. To acquire micrographs, optical as well as electron microscopy are commonly used. To determine material property, Nanoindentation is a robust technique for determination of properties in micron and <b>submicron</b> level for which conventional testing are not feasible. Conventional mechanical testing such as tensile testing or dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) can only return macroscopic properties without any indication of microstructural properties. However, nanoindentation {{can be used for}} determination of local microstructural properties of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials.|$|E
5000|$|Cong’s {{research}} on interconnect-centric design for integrated circuits plays {{a significant role}} in overcoming the timing closure challenge in deep <b>submicron</b> designs in 1990s. His work on VLSI interconnect planning, synthesis, and layout optimization as well as highly scalable multi-level analytical circuit placement are embedded in the core of all physical synthesis tools developed by the EDA industry. The best-known industry adoption example was Magma Design Automation, which was founded in 1997 aiming at achieving timing closure through physical synthesis. Cong served on its Technical Advisory Board since its inception until its IPO, and later as its Chief Technology Advisor from 2003 to 2008. A [...] Magma was acquired by Synopsys in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the β(2,1) linkages, inulin is not digested by enzymes in {{the human}} {{alimentary}} system, contributing to its functional properties: reduced calorie value, dietary fiber and prebiotic effects. Without color and odor, it has little impact on sensory characteristics of food products. Oligofructose has 35% of the sweetness of sucrose, and its sweetening profile is similar to sugar. Standard inulin is slightly sweet, while high performance inulin is not. Its solubility {{is higher than the}} classical fibers. When thoroughly mixed with liquid, inulin forms a gel and a white creamy structure, which is similar to fat. Its three-dimensional gel network, consisting of insoluble <b>submicron</b> crystalline inulin particles, immobilizes large amount of water, assuring its physical stability. [...] It can also improve the stability of foams and emulsions.|$|E
