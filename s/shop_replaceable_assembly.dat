40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the human resource development process supporting the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS). The CASS Implementation Plan and related Navy Training Plan are established to deliver CASS hardware/software and a trained workforce to the fleet for system operation and maintenance throughout its life cycle. This study involves an overview of both plans, a definition of basic personnel development requirements for any weapons system, a review of historical ATE training deficiencies, and the current status of CASS technician training at the Naval Aviation Maintenance Training Group Detachments (NAMTRAGRUDETs). Its conclusions are that the plans collectively address the elements essential to develop a skilled workforce to support CASS throughout its life cycle. However, delivery delays of CASS Station hardware, Test Program Sets (TPSs), and a representative sample of various aircraft Weapons Repairable <b>Assemblies</b> (WRAs) and <b>Shop</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Assemblies</b> (SRAs) pose problems that must be resolved before training can satisfy the majority of acquisition, fleet maintenance, and training management desires.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn investigation {{was made into}} the characteristics of program elements and removals of Weapon <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Assemblies</b> aggregated at the system level {{for the purpose of}} developing a method to predict removals during initial provisioning periods. From examination of nine avionic systems over a 28 month period a binomial model was developed using a removal rate based on aircraft-months as a program element. The model is to be used before Fleet data are generated by obtaining aircraft-month estimates from the contractor and removal rate estimates from similar operational equipments. A probability distribution reflecting the degree of certainty is selected as a prior estimate. Then, as Fleet experience is accumulated the distribution is updated using Bayesian techniques and maturity growth curves. This distribution is used to give an estimate of current removal rate and to extrapolate to future removal rates. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

It verifies that WRA allowances, developed by the Aviation Readiness Requirements oriented to WRAs (ARROWs) model, achieve a target level of Ao given stated assumptions. It expands on ARROWs by characterizing not just the expected value of Ao but also its variability and probability distribution function. The simulation is expanded to include {{a variety of factors}} not considered by ARROWs. Examples of these factors include actual flight schedules, variable and prioritized requisitioning and repair, and cannibalization. The impact of these factors on the distribution of Ao is quantified. Simultaneous examination of all factors reveals that the full simulation predicts actual Ao approximately as well as ARROWs. In general, the full simulation overestimates Ao, and ARROWs underestimates Ao[URL] Commander, Supply Corps, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe {{objective}} of this project was to identify and more accurately predict the maintenance and supply chain costs and savings related to the Agile Rapid Global Combat Support (ARGCS) system. The project focused on {{a portion of the}} ARGCS business case analysis (BCA) model developed by CDR David Crosby. CDR Crosby's BCA model listed various potential savings associated with ARGCS technologies that were difficult to quantify during his initial BCA research. The focus of this research was to determine the likely benefits and cost savings that ARGCS may have on maintenance and supply functions. Using pre-existing maintenance and supply data, a model was developed to more accurately determine any maintenance and supply related cost benefits. The only F/A- 18 Weapons <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Assemblies</b> (WRA) that were analyzed during this research were those that will be tested during the summer 2007 Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) at NAS Lemoore. Results of the simulation indicate there is an expected increase in operational availability and several cost savings associated with the implementation of ARGCS technologies.

Malicious software represents a significant and growing threat to Defense systems. Threats to airborne systems in particular can be characterized not by system vulnerability to Internet based exploits but rather by the risk posed by malicious code already present in the system's software. Although there are software techniques to detect and prevent certain types of attacks, a Systems Engineer has access to system level information and system design techniques that can quantify and in many cases mitigate the risks posed by potential malicious code present in the system. These techniques are especially applicable to malicious code in embedded airborne system although they can be applied to other systems that share certain traits.

40|$|The Drill for the Mars Science Laboratory {{mission is}} a rotary-percussive sample {{acquisition}} device {{with an emphasis}} on toughness and robustness to handle the harsh environment on Mars. The unique challenges associated with autonomous drilling from a mobile robot are addressed. A highly compressed development schedule dictated a modular design architecture that satisfies the functional and load requirements while allowing independent development and testing of the Drill subassemblies. The Drill consists of four actuated mechanisms: a spindle that rotates the bit, a chuck that releases and engages bits, a novel voice-coil-based percussion mechanism that hammers the bit, and a linear translation mechanism. The Drill has three passive mechanisms: a <b>replaceable</b> bit <b>assembly</b> that acquires and collects sample, a contact sensor / stabilizer mechanism, and, lastly a flex harness service loop. This paper describes the various mechanisms that makeup the Drill and discusses the solutions to their unique design and development challenges...|$|R
5000|$|In 1951, he {{developed}} the concept of microprogramming from the realisation that the Central Processing Unit of a computer could be controlled by a miniature, highly specialised computer program in high-speed ROM. This concept greatly simplified CPU development. Microprogramming was first described at the University of Manchester Computer Inaugural Conference in 1951, then published in expanded form in IEEE Spectrum in 1955. This concept was implemented {{for the first time}} in EDSAC 2, which also used multiple identical [...] "bit slices" [...] to simplify design. Interchangeable, <b>replaceable</b> tube <b>assemblies</b> were used for each bit of the processor. The next computer for his laboratory was the Titan, a joint venture with Ferranti Ltd begun in 1963. It eventually supported the UK's first time-sharing system and provided wider access to computing resources in the university, including time-shared graphics systems for mechanical CAD[...] Control Memory (CM) which is extremely used in today's computer was developed by using the concept of this Microprogramming.|$|R
40|$|Drosophila laminin alphabetagamma trimer {{assembly}} in Kc 167 cells was perturbed by chain-specific RNA interference (RNAi). The intracellular pool of alpha and gamma chains remained unchanged under beta-chain RNAi by lipofection of double-stranded RNA encoding a beta-chain partial sequence. This {{was also the}} case for the intracellular pool of alpha and beta chains under gamma-chain-specific RNAi. Nonetheless, the intracellular pool of beta and gamma chains increased markedly under alpha-chain-specific RNAi. Non-reducing SDS/PAGE revealed that some of the increased beta and gamma chains migrated as disulphide-linked betagamma dimers but that the rest migrated as monomers. Since the monomeric beta and gamma bands detected under alpha-chain RNAi were denser than the beta band under gamma-chain RNAi and the gamma band under beta-chain RNAi, respectively, beta and gamma also appeared to accumulate by forming betagamma dimers without the disulphide linkage. We suggest that interconversion of these betagamma dimers is crucial for the <b>replaceable</b> and selective <b>assembly</b> of the alpha chain for alphabetagamma trimer formation...|$|R
