40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between confidence and risk {{in relation to the}} initial education and continuing professional development of teachers. The context for this examination is the Lifelong Learning sector in England, which sits between secondary schools and universities, and the discussion is illustrated with data gathered from trainee teachers in this <b>sector.</b> <b>Understandings</b> of confidence are considered and it is argued that the inculcation of confidence through risk-taking is important for new teachers in their journey to praxis. Confidence, whether seen as imbued in the self or as inculcated through professional training and development, correlates with both the new teacher’s vulnerability and their capacity to take risks. Central to the inculcation of confidence are the opportunities available to teachers as they develop, which are circumscribed by the conditions and expectations of their teacher education course and their workplace. The article concludes by arguing that the transformative potential of critical engagement with professional knowledge on teacher education courses and through work-based learning should be balanced with the need for the good and appropriate time necessary for the risky political act of reflection, not merely the immediate technical evaluation of practice...|$|E

30|$|Results of {{our study}} could have {{important}} implications for organic soil conditioner market and biogas <b>sector.</b> <b>Understanding</b> attributes affecting farmers’ WTP for digestate can promote the market of digestate among farmers with positive effects on soil quality and soil fertility due to its promptly available nutritional contribution to crops. Moreover, our results could be important for biogas industry since digestate is currently mainly used in those geographic areas where anaerobic digesters are widespread. Understanding factors affecting purchasing process of digestate can boost the diffusion of digestate also in other areas like the Mediterranean basin where high quantities of biomasses are available, but the use of digestate as soil conditioner is even limited since it is not well-known among farmers. Moreover, since the profitability of digesters is traditionally dependent on state subsidies, opening new markets to commercialise digestate could create new income opportunities for digester managers especially in those areas where the spread of anaerobic digesters is still low.|$|R
