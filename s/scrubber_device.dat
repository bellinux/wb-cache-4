25|$|Managing CO2 levels was a {{particular}} challenge, {{and a source of}} controversy regarding the Biosphere 2 project's alleged misrepresentation to the public. Daily fluctuation of carbon dioxide dynamics was typically 600 ppm because of the strong drawdown during sunlight hours by plant photosynthesis, followed by a similar rise during the nighttime when system respiration dominated. As expected, there was also a strong seasonal signature to CO2 levels, with wintertime levels as high as 4,000-4,500 ppm and summertime levels near 1,000 ppm. The crew worked to manage the CO2 by occasionally turning on a CO2 scrubber, activating and de-activating the desert and savannah through control of irrigation water, cutting and storing biomass to sequester carbon, and utilizing all potential planting areas with fast-growing species to increase system photosynthesis. In November 1991, investigative reporting in the Village Voice alleged that the crew had secretly installed the CO2 <b>scrubber</b> <b>device,</b> violating Biosphere 2's advertised goal of recycling all materials naturally.|$|E

40|$|Shipping burns {{approximately}} 300 {{million tonnes}} of fuel per year, and 12 million tonnes of sulphur oxides (SOx) are emitted, annually. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) set {{the standards for}} the safety, security and environmental performance of international shipping, globally and have even stricter standards in Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The maritime industry is facing challenges in meeting imposed requirements given by IMO. Among others, Regulation 14 in MARPOL Annex VI sets limitations on sulphur oxides and particulate matter. On and after January 1 st 2020 the sulphur content of any fuel oil used onboard ship shall not exceed 0. 50 % m/m. However, the implementation date is to be reviewed in 2018 {{to see if the}} limit is achievable within the set time frame. Besides, on and after January 1 st 2015 the sulphur content of any fuel oil used onboard ship shall not exceed 0. 10 % m/m in ECA. Exhaust gas cleaning systems, also known as scrubbers, have extensive land-bases experience. Regulation 4 in MARPOL Annex VI states that it is allowed to use an alternative compliance method which is at least as effective in terms of emission reductions as required in MARPOL Annex VI, and the standards in Regulation 14. Hence, 2009 Guidelines for Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (i. e. MEPC. 184 (59)) was adopted on July 17 th 2009 by IMO, where the intention is to specify the requirements for the testing, survey, certification, and verification of scrubbers. The objective of this master thesis was to evaluate an open loop system through Formal Safety Assessment to gain greater understanding on the challenges this technology has in relation to system risks and safety. The Formal Safety Assessment is a new approach in the maritime industry, and {{can be used as a}} tool to help evaluate new regulations or to compare proposed changes within existing standards. The technique consists of five steps: identification of hazards, risk analysis, risk control options (RCOs), cost-benefit assessment, and recommendations for decision-making. All steps of the Formal Safety Assessment were carried out on an open loop system manufactured by Wärtsilä. The basis of the assessment was a preliminary version of a P&ID of the open loop system, which was further simplified by the author. The qualitative (e. g. failure modes, failure causes) and quantitative (i. e. λ/E 6, MTTR) inputs through the analysis were extracted from the handbook Offshore Reliability Data (OREDA). A FMECA and a risk matrix were created in the first step to identify hazards. Risk Control Tree (RCT) was modelled in the second step, where the material from the first step was evaluated quantitatively. In the third step, the results from the second step were utilised to propose effective and practical risk control measures of the given open loop system. Benefits and costs associated with implementing the risk control options were identified and compared in the fourth step. Finally, recommendations for decision-making were determined on the basis of the previous steps. On the grounds of 153 cases of components with a specific failure mode in the FMECA, 52 % are ranked with low risk, 45 % with medium risk, and 3 % with high risk. The scrubber system has the highest risk within medium and high risk, where the drainpipe and the injection nozzles are the most critical components. The modelled Risk Contribution Tree (RCT) consists of six fault trees and three event trees, distributed within three accident categories (i. e. Overpressure, Hazards related to loading/discharging operations, Purification failure). The fault trees were constructed and quantitatively analysed in software CARA-FaultTree. The observations showed that the most critical top events are overpressure in <b>scrubber</b> <b>device</b> and venturi, and difficulties with purifying washwater. The end events with high material damage in the event trees have relatively low frequencies per year, as an effect of reliable safety systems within the scrubber system and low frequencies of the initiating events. The following risk control options increase the reliability of the open loop system: improvement of corrective maintenance, review the preventive maintenance procedures, redundancy in inlet monitor and outlet monitor, and reinforcement of joints between nozzles, pipelines and scrubber casing. In a cost-benefit aspect, redundancy of monitors and reinforcement of joints are the most beneficial solutions to increase the open loop system s reliability in a feasible and safe matter. Based on the results from the Formal Safety Assessment, it is concluded that the open loop system is considered to be highly reliable. However, with improvement of risk control options, as additional monitors and reinforcement of joints inside the <b>scrubber</b> <b>device,</b> the system increases its availability significantly. The adoption will increase the time of operation of the system, and assist the system to meet the guidelines in resolution MEPC. 184 (59). The results are applicable for shipowners, class societies, and manufactures. By knowing the critical components, the open loop system(s) can increase operation performance and reliability. The perfections are especially of great importance since the purpose of scrubbers is to meet the imposed limitations on sulphur oxides...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} mercury from flue gases in {{scrubbers}} is greatly facilitated if the mercury is present as water-soluble oxidized species. Therefore, increased mercury oxidation upstream of <b>scrubber</b> <b>devices</b> will improve overall mercury removal. For this purpose heterogeneous catalysts have recently attracted {{a great deal}} of interest. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR), noble metal and transition metal oxide based catalysts have been investigated at both the laboratory and plant scale with this objective. A review article published in 2006 covers the progress in the elemental mercury (Hgel) catalytic oxidation area. This paper brings the review in this area up to date. To this end, 110 papers including several reports and patents are reviewed. For each type of catalyst the possible mechanisms as well as the effect of flue gas components on activity and stability are examined. Advantages and main problems are analyzed. The possible future directions of catalyst development in this environmental research area are outlined...|$|R

50|$|A wet scrubber's {{ability to}} collect small {{particles}} is often {{directly proportional to}} the power input into the <b>scrubber.</b> Low energy <b>devices</b> such as spray towers are used to collect particles larger than 5 micrometers. To obtain high efficiency removal of 1 micrometer (or less) particles generally requires high-energy devices such as venturi <b>scrubbers</b> or augmented <b>devices</b> such as condensation scrubbers. Additionally, a properly designed and operated entrainment separator or mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal efficiencies. The greater the number of liquid droplets that are not captured by the mist eliminator, the higher the potential emission levels.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The Venturi <b>scrubber</b> is a <b>device</b> {{which uses}} liquid {{in the form}} of {{droplets}} to efficiently remove fine particulate matter from gaseous streams. Droplet size is of fundamental importance for the scrubber performance. In the present experimental study, a laser diffraction technique was used in order to measure droplet size in situ in a Venturi scrubber with a rectangular cross section. Droplet size distribution was measured as a function of gas velocity (58. 3 to 74. 9 m/s), liquid-to-gas ratio (0. 07 to 0. 27 l/m 3), and distance from liquid injection point (64 to 173 mm). It was found that all these variables significantly affect droplet size. The results were compared with the predictions from correlations found in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Summary. This {{carried out}} work is aimed {{enhancing}} {{the efficiency of}} the spray scrubber by combining processes and improving hydraulic conditions in the device. The problem of treating waste gases is often characterized by unique features and the significant factor that makes it difficult to find {{a solution to the problem}} of treatment is the low and/or variable concentration of the pollutant. With a removal efficiency of up to 98 %, wet treatment technology in <b>scrubber</b> type <b>devices</b> is the only practical method advantageous to the treatment of waste gases. The set objective is solved by developing a two-stage treatment system for pyrolysis gas based on ejector scrubbers. Their advantage - a central nozzle supply that allows the scrubber to operate on the principle of an ejector pump. A drift eliminator of the developed device is located on the case unit and a chain is suspended from a clamp mounted on the lower part of the tube neck by pins and two detachable joints. The operation of the scrubber was checked in compliance with the absorption gas treatment of sulfur dioxide. A chemical sorbent, calcium carbonate which is produced as a by-product in the manufacture of nitroammophos at JSC “Minudobrenia” factory is used. Preliminary results indicate that the stiochiometric inlet ratio of Ca/S equals about 2. 0 and SO 2 emissions reduce by 80 - 90 %, significantly larger than the planned 70 % and subsequently corresponds to the residue concentration of less than 30 mg/m 3. This is explained by the greater degree of capture and deposition of the sorbent on the chain curtain (not more than 20 mg/m 3). The proposed device for treating gases enables: improvement in the efficiency of gas treatment; increased reliability; increase in the degree of treatment of the gas flow without the use of additional equipment; reduction in metal and design complexity; reduction on the cost of the treatment process and simplification in the device design...|$|R
40|$|A wet <b>scrubber</b> is a <b>device</b> used in {{underground}} {{coal mines}} for the exhaust treatment system of various internal combustion engines (generally diesel) {{primarily as a}} spark arrestor with a secondary function to remove pollutants from the exhaust gas. A pool of scrubbing liquid (generally water based) is {{used in conjunction with}} a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). Scrubbers are widely used in underground applications of diesel engines as their exhaust contains high concentration of harmful diesel particulate matter (DPM) and other pollutant gases. Currently the DPFs have to be replaced frequently because moisture output from the wet scrubber blocks the filter media and causes reduced capacity. This paper presents experimental and theoretical studies on the heat and mass transfer mechanisms of the exhaust flow both under and above the water surface, aiming at finding the cause and effects of the moisture reaching the filters and employing a solution to reduce the humidity and DPM output, and to prolong the change-out period of the DPF. By assuming a steady flow condition, heat transfer from the inlet exhaust gas balances energy required for the water evaporation. Hence the exit humidity will decrease with the increase of exit temperature. Experiments on a real scrubber are underway...|$|R
