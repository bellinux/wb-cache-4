It {{is based on the}} conventional slow-freezing method with 10 % DMSO and modified mainly in a thawing protocol without specific equipment or reagents. Recovery rate of the cells cryopreserved by this method was equally high, which is comparable to that of the cells frozen by the vitrification method. In the case of vitrification method, it requires practiced hand because cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process and strict maintenance of low temperature is required throughout the cryopreservation. On the contrary, our method is available for novices and cryopreserved cells can maintain cell recovery rate for one week after transfer from - 150 °C to - 80 °C condition. This simple modified method would gain widespread acceptance. ### Introduction Human embryonic stem (hES) cells 1 and human induced pluripotent (hiPS) cells 2, 3 have great potential as a possible source of cells for the regenerative medical transplantation of various tissues and also for other research applications, such as developmental biology, toxicology, and drug discovery. Today, a number of hES and hiPS cell lines have been established around the world. To promote these great potential researches using hES and hiPS cell lines, the prerequisite is the foundation of cell banks of well-characterized and safety-tested cells for research which serve as seed stocks for therapeutic applications. Currently, several cell banks are distributing such cell lines all over the world. The International Stem Cell Banking Initiative has developed a consensus on the principles of best practice for the banking, testing, and distribution of hES cells 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. During cell banking, although most of the procedures share many of the principles of routine cell culture, a number of significant steps exist in the case of hES and hiPS cells. One of them is cryopreservation 9. Both hES and hiPS cells have been well-known {{to be sensitive to the}} cryopreservation 9, 10, 11. Two cryopreservation methods are commonly used for hES and hiPS cells which are vitrification 12, 13, 14, 15 and slow freezing 16, 17, 18, 19. At this moment, vitrification method is considered to be preferable for the local storage because of the high survival rate 12, 15, 16, 20. However, vitrified cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process without practiced hand compared to slow-frozen cells. Furthermore, if the low temperature is not strictly maintained, cell viability decreases rapidly. Therefore, when vitrified cells are transported, it needs liquid nitrogen dry-shippers with careful documentation for the regulatory requirements and transports companies with technical expertise to undertake such shipments, resulting in the high costs involved. As for slow-freezing method with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), although it has been long trusted as a stable cryopreservation for a wide variety of cells including mouse ES cells, it produces low levels of recovery or spontaneously differentiation for hES and hiPS cells. Until now, several approaches have been investigated for the improvement of cryopreservation for hES and hiPS cells such as the technique based on stabilizing hES colonies adherent to or embedded in a Matrigel matrix 17, and the protocol using of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor 21, 22. Considering clinical application of hES and hiPS cells, xeno-free defined freezing medium should be required. An effective serum- and xeno-free chemically defined freezing procedure was reported by Hovatta’s group 23. Another group has proposed in situ cryopreservation using gas permeable culture casettes 24. However, there is not any evidence that the cells can stably preserve their phenotypes for more than 10 years, excluding the conventional cryopreservation of the cells with DMSO. Thus, it is suggested that although these new methods would be worth to be challenged, the conventional cryopreservation should be backed up as a precaution. We here show that a simple modification of the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation with 10 % DMSO increased cell viability after thawing. This method requires neither specific equipment nor reagents and only the thawing way is changed, but resulting cells have comparable growth ability to those of vitrified cells. Even when using defined medium, such as our growth factor defined medium hESF 925, 26, 27, 28, or Thomson’s mTeSR medium 29, this method could work well. Because the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation is quite familiar, this simple method would gain widespread acceptance. ### Materials Critical: All reagents and materials used must be sterile. 1.

Passage colonies every 5 - 7 days depending on colony growth. Exchange culture medium every day except the day following the passaging. Freeze stock of hES/iPS Cells: 1. Remove the differentiated area completely by using the Pasteur pipette in advance. - Examine all the plates containing hES/iPS Cells by inverted phase-contrast microscopy. Cultures used for cryopreservation should show no signs of microbial contamination and should be subconfluent (the distance between the colonies is < 10 - 20 % of the average colony diameter). Confluent cultures may be less amenable to freezing. - Label cryogenic vials with the name of the cell line, passage number, lot number and the date. - Remove the culture medium from flasks. - Add 1. 5 ml dispase (1 U/ml) per the T 25 flask and incubate for 2 - 5 min until the edges of the colonies start to curl. - CRITICAL: Treatment time of dispase varies and depends on the cell lines and quality of colonies used. 6. Gently scrape with scraper and pipetting with 10 ml pipette so as not to be small clumps. - CRITICAL: Cell colonies should not be disrupted in small size. - Transfer to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and spin at 20 X g, 2 min, 4 °C. - CRITICAL: It is recommended to centrifuge at low g forces (20 x g) to prevent feeder cells collecting at the bottom of the tube together. - Carefully aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. CRITICAL: Finger tap the tube gently to disperse the pellet. - Resuspend the cells in freshly prepared ice-cold freezing medium (10 % DMSO/culture medium). CRITICAL: The freezing medium should be prepared freshly and kept on ice before use. - Transfer 200 µl aliquots into each labeled cryogenic vial. - CRITICAL: Small volume may result in higher cell survival rates. It is recommended the volume of fluid during cryopreservation is 200 ul rather than 500 ul. - Place the vials on ice for a few minute. - CRITICAL: Vials are allowed to sit on ice for 15 min. A prolonged storage on ice is likely to cause a further decline of cell viability. - Store them in the freezing container (BICELL or Mr. Frosty®) and keep it in a - 80 °C deep freezer overnight. - CRITICAL: It is recommended to finish suspension within 30 min. Prolonged immersion cause decline in cell viability. - Next day transfer the vials to the liquid nitrogen tank (in the vapor phase, - 150 °C). - CRITICAL: Immersion of vials into the liquid phase of liquid nitrogen may lead to viral or cross contamination. - CRITICAL: It is recommended to abort long term storage in a - 80 °C deep freezer. An extended storage at - 80 °C causes the decline in cell recovery. Storage in a - 80 °C deep freezer within 7 days after transferring from liquid nitrogen tank is permissible. - CRITICAL: It is reported that vitrification protocols may be superior to slow freezing. We showed our slow freezing method was equally successful as vitrification method. - PAUSE POINT: The cells can be stored indefinitely in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. - Document the details of vials and storage location in the appropriate inventory. - Preparation of feeder seeded culture flasks before thawing of hES/hiPS cells - Coat the flasks with 0. 1 % gelatin (3 ml/ 25 cm 2 flask). - Incubate the flasks for 1 hour at 37 °C or overnight at room temperature. - Rinse the flasks with PBS. - Inoculate mitomycin c-treated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEF) at 5 - 7 × 10 e 3 cells/cm 2 in DMEM (high glucose) containing 10 % heat inactivated FBS. - CRITICAL: Prepare the feeder seeded culture flasks in a few days in advance of the thawing or passaging of hES/hiPS cells, and use them within 5 days. - CRITICAL: Density of feeder cells should be determined by colony morphology of hES/hiPS cells in advance. - Thawing of hES/hiPs cells - Prior to using of feeder seeded flasks, replace the medium with the human pluripotent cell medium twice. - Pre-warm 10 ml of the human pluripotent cell medium in a 15 ml tube in a 37 °C water bath. - Rapidly thaw out frozen cells by adding the pre-warmed medium directly into a vial with the transfer pipette. CRITICAL: In a case of thawing the frozen cells in a 37 °C water bath or in a 37 °C incubator, the cells may be seriously damaged. - Gently collect the cells in the 15 ml tube and wash vial with the pre-warmed medium. - Centrifuge the tube at 90 x g, 2 min, room temperature. - Aspirate the medium and finger tap the tube gently to disperse the pellet. - Resuspend the cells in 5 - 7 ml of pre-warmed culture medium and transfer the suspension into a 25 cm 2 flask. - Gently move the flask several times along horizontal and vertical directions to distribute the cells evenly. - Incubate the flasks in an incubator at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2. - Culture medium should be exchanged every other day until hES/hiPS cells are ready for passaging. - CRITICAL: Do not move the flask on the day following the passaging. - Alkaline phosphatase staining to determine the growth of hiPS/hES cells - Remove the culture medium and rinse once with PBS for 1 min at room temperature. - Fix the colonies with the fixation buffer for 1 min at room temperature. - Wash twice with DDW. - Start the color reaction by incubating in the reaction buffer blocking off the light. - Stop the reaction after 15 min by washing twice with DDW. - Count the stained colonies. ### Timing - Steps 1 – 14, Freeze stock of hES/iPS: 1 hour - Steps 15 – 18, Preparation of feeder seeded culture flasks before thawing of hES/hiPS cells: 5 - 10 days - Steps 19 – 29, Thawing of hES/hiPS: 10 – 15 minutes - Steps 30 – 35, Alkaline phosphatase staining: 20 – 30 minutes ### Anticipated Results Simple modified method of conventional slow freezing cryopreservation for hES and hiPS cells described here have equally successful recovery rate and ability to maintain undifferentiated state as those of vitrification method (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Thawing method by addition of pre-warmed medium directly into the frozen vial also leads to high cell viability after recovery from cryopreservation (Fig. 3). Additionally, shortening keeping time on ice before freezing (Suppl. Fig. 1), use of dispase (Suppl. Fig. 2), shortening cell suspension time after the dissociation process (Suppl. Fig. 3), reducing fluid volume from 500 to 200 ul (Suppl. Fig. 4), implementation of freezing process in vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (- 150 °C) within 7 days after slow freezing process in a - 80 °C deep freezer (Suppl. Fig. 5) increase viability of the cryopreserved cells by the slow freezing method. Moreover, cryopreserved cells are maintained high recovery rate and undifferentiated state within 7 days if the vials were transferred from a liquid nitrogen gas tank to a - 80 deep freezer (Suppl. Fig. 6). Our method may be available for novices, because it is simple and easy method that requires neither specific equipment nor reagents (Fig. 1). Moreover, our method allows for keeping in a - 80 °C deep freezer within one week after transferring from a liquid nitrogen tank, which make favorable to transportation as compared to vitrification method. Also, this cryopreservation is available for serum-free culture such as culture with hESF 9 medium and hESF 9 a 2 i medium 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. We believe that our method can be employed by stem cell banking and researchers and will most likely lead to the expected outcome. ### References 1. Thomson, J. A. et al.

50|$|Paximathia is {{prepared}} with whole wheat, chick pea or barley flour. Other ingredients used in its preparation may include eggs, vegetable oil, cinnamon, cloves and orange zest. In contemporary times, paximathia is typically baked overnight in bakers' ovens {{that have been}} turned off, whereby the bread is cooked from the remaining heat. This method cooks the bread to a dry state without creating brittleness that can cause undesirable crumbling. Paximathia is sometimes broken into pieces and served in salads after being dampened. Contemporary versions stored at room temperature can remain edible for up to eight weeks when <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container.|$|R
30|$|Tumours were {{embedded}} in gelatin blocks for MRI acquisition and wooden rods were placed as fiducial markers {{in all four}} corners of the gelatine blocks to aid spatial recognition and co-registration between the following imaging modalities. The samples were transported in dry ice following MRI acquisition. Samples were then re-frozen and cryosectioned to a thickness of 10  µm prior to MALDI-MSI data capture. 10  µm-thick frozen tissue sections were cut, using a Leica CM 3050 cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK). The sections were then freeze–thaw mounted on poly-l-lysine glass slides. Mounted slides were either used immediately or <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> tube at − 80  °C for subsequent use.|$|R
30|$|For {{the current}} investigation, {{the leaves of}} Ixora cuneifolia were {{collected}} from Bangladesh National Herbarium, Dhaka, Bangladesh {{during the month of}} September 2013. It was identified by the experts of the Bangladesh National Herbarium. (Accession number: 38343). The leaf part of the plant was collected and washed to separate the undesirable parts followed by drying at room temperature for two days. After drying the leaves were grinded to make a coarse powder. The powder was then sieved by using a sieving machine and the fine powder was collected and weighed using an analytical balance. The powder material was then <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container and kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cool environment {{before the start of the}} extraction process.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} with moisture {{can cause}} a container of glue which has been opened and resealed to become unusable more quickly than if never opened. To minimise this reduction in shelf life cyanoacrylate, once opened, can be <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container with <b>a</b> package of silica gel desiccant. Another technique is to insert a hypodermic needle into {{the opening of a}} tube. After using the glue, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out. The clog is removed by heating the needle (e.g. with a lighter) before use.. The polymerisation is also temperature-dependent: storage below the freezing point of water stops it, so keeping it in the freezer is also effective.|$|R
25|$|Coffee is best <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> {{container}} made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee {{usually has}} a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved {{when it is}} stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means {{that it should be}} kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{cyanoacrylate}} is an {{acrylic resin}} which rapidly polymerises {{in the presence}} of water (specifically hydroxide ions), forming long, strong chains, joining the bonded surfaces together. Because the presence of moisture causes the glue to set, exposure to moisture in the air can cause a tube or bottle of glue to become unusable over time. To prevent an opened container of glue from setting before use, it must be <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> jar or bottle with a package of silica gel. Another convenient way is attaching a hypodermic needle on the opening of glue. After applying, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out. The clog is removed by heating the needle (e.g. by a lighter) before use.|$|R

25|$|Being a {{phosphate}} mineral, turquoise {{is inherently}} fragile and sensitive to solvents; perfume and other cosmetics will attack the finish and may alter the colour of turquoise gems, as will skin oils, as will most commercial jewellery cleaning fluids. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may also discolour or dehydrate turquoise. Care {{should therefore be}} taken when wearing such jewels: cosmetics, including sunscreen and hair spray, should be applied before putting on turquoise jewellery, and {{they should not be}} worn to a beach or other sun-bathed environment. After use, turquoise should be gently cleaned with a soft cloth to avoid a buildup of residue, and should be <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> its own container to avoid scratching by harder gems. Turquoise can also be adversely affected if <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container.|$|R
30|$|Aerial {{parts were}} cut, {{air-dried}} and powdered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grinding machine and <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container until further analyzed. Powdered dried leaves (100  g) {{of the plant}} were extracted with ethanol (1.0  L) in flat bottom glass container, through occasional shaking and stirring for 7  days. For the stem we also used the same amount (100  g dissolved into 1.0  L ethanol). The whole mixture of both stem and leaf were then filtered separately by Whatman No 1 filter paper and the filtrates were dried at 40  °C <b>in</b> vacuum using <b>a</b> rotatory evaporator [21] to afford a blackish mass. Finally we got 4.80  g leaf and 2.27  g stem extract. All above extraction procedures are repeated thrice and finally selected the extract randomly for the experimental purposes. The crude extracts were then kept at 4  °C in sterile universal bottles.|$|R
30|$|We had {{a device}} {{specially}} {{designed to allow}} easy and accurate sectioning of the rat along its skin markings, so that the sectioning planes parallel to the axial planes of the FDG-PET images. The tumor-containing portion of each rat was sectioned transversely into three to five blocks, and each sectioning resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rostral and a caudal cross-sectional surfaces. In order to preserve the anatomical configuration, the blocks were sectioned at a sufficient thickness (6 – 8  mm) to prevent block deformity from the shearing force of sectioning. All blocks were <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> box to avoid moisture and kept in the freezer overnight (Fig.  1 b). All cross-sectional surfaces were imaged at a visible light wavelength and digitized using a flat panel color scanner with a resolution of 200 dots per inch (DPI). These images are the macroscopic histological images of tumor blocks.|$|R
30|$|Ceriscoides turgida {{leave and}} roots were {{collected}} from Lawasara forest, Shremangal, Sylhet, Bangladesh and identified by experts at Bangladesh National Herbarium, Dhaka, Bangladesh. A voucher specimen (DACB 43316) has been submitted there for future reference. The collected plant parts were separated from undesirable materials. They were shade dried for one week after cutting into small pieces. The plant parts were ground into coarse powder {{with the help of}} a suitable grinder. The powder was <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container and kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cool, dark and dry place until analysis commenced. About 190 [*]g of powdered leaves and 200 [*]mg roots were taken in separate clean, flat-bottomed glass container and soaked in 600 [*]mL of 95 % methanol. The container with its contents was sealed and kept for a period of 14 [*]days accompanying occasional shaking and stirring. The whole mixture then underwent a coarse filtration by apiece of clean, white cotton material. Then it was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The filtrate was kept <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open space to evaporate the solvent thus crude extract was obtained. The yield percentage of the crude extract from leaves and root was 2.04 w/w and 1.5 w/w respectively.|$|R
30|$|The sago hampas waste used in {{this study}} was {{obtained}} from a sago processing plant in Ukong, Tutong District, Brunei Darussalam. When used on a dry basis, sago hampas contains 58  % starch, 23  % cellulose, 9.2  % hemicellulose and 4  % lignin [28]. Sago hampas is the starchy lignocellulosic by-product from the pith of Metroxylon sagu (sago palm) following the starch extraction process [26]. Sago waste collected from the processing plant was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove soluble impurities, such as excess starch, and solid wastes from the industrial process including adhering dirt and debris. The sago waste was then dried to drain excess water and then further dried <b>in</b> <b>an</b> 80  °C oven for 24  h prior to storage. The dried biomass was ground using a laboratory blender to a fine powder and screened with a standard sieve size to ensure that particle sizes were not greater than 350  µm.

5000|$|Another {{variation}} is cold brew coffee, sometimes known as [...] "cold press." [...] Cold water is poured over coffee grounds {{and allowed to}} steep for eight to twenty-four hours. The coffee is then filtered, usually through a very thick filter, removing all particles. This process produces a very strong concentrate which can be <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> refrigerated, <b>airtight</b> container for up to eight weeks. The coffee can then be prepared for drinking by adding hot water to the concentrate at a water-to-concentrate ratio of approximately 3:1, but can be adjusted to the drinker's preference. The coffee prepared by this method is very low <b>in</b> acidity with <b>a</b> smooth taste, and is often preferred by those with sensitive stomachs. Others, however, feel this method strips coffee of its bold flavor and character. Thus, this method is not common, and there are few appliances designed for it.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Seeds of Nelumbo nucifera do not imbibe water, {{and thus}} have {{physical}} dormancy (PY). However, a proportion of seeds are permeable to water, and so we hypothesized that variation in moisture content is {{a reason for the}} development of both permeable and impermeable seeds. The permeable proportion of seeds present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lot collected from Suzhou, China, was separated using an imbibition test. The permeable proportion had an average moisture content of 15. 6 %, compared with 8. 5 % for impermeable seeds. Drying permeable seeds above silica gel to 10 % and 8 % f. wb., resulted in 77 and 100 % impermeable seeds, respectively, compared with no impermeable seeds at 15 % moisture content. Dried to 10 % moisture content, and incubated above water <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container, 46 % of the seeds reverse impermeability. Permeable seeds with 15 % moisture content maintained above LiCl 2 (RH= 70 %) did not develop impermeability after three months of storage. The seeds dried to 6 % moisture content and <b>stored</b> above water <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container showed no increase in moisture. Based on these results, we conclude that there is a strong relationship between moisture content and the onset of impermeability in this species...|$|R

Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for <b>a</b> year if <b>airtight</b> and <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the refrigerator for a maximum of five days <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container. Adding <b>a</b> couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen {{for up to two}} or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|R
