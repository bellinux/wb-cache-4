40|$|Understanding {{the causes}} of crime is a longstanding issue in researcher's agenda. While it is a hard task to extract {{causality}} from data, several linear models have been proposed to predict crime through the existing correlations between crime and urban metrics. However, because of non-Gaussian distributions and multicollinearity in <b>urban</b> <b>indicators,</b> {{it is common to}} find controversial conclusions about the influence of some <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> on crime. Machine learning ensemble-based algorithms can handle well such problems. Here, we use a random forest regressor to predict crime and quantify the influence of <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> on homicides. Our approach can have up to 97 % of accuracy on crime prediction and the importance of <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> is ranked and clustered in groups of equal influence, which are robust under slightly changes in the data sample analyzed. Our results determine the rank of importance of <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> to predict crime, unveiling that unemployment and illiteracy are the most important variables for describing homicides in Brazilian cities. We further believe that our approach helps in producing more robust conclusions regarding the effects of <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> on crime, having potential applications for guiding public policies for crime control...|$|R

The <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> Y(N) of a city with the population size N is analytically calculated by summing up all individual activities produced by person-to-person relationships.

These coincide with allometric scaling observed in real-world <b>urban</b> <b>indicators.</b> We also show how the scaling exponent β depends on the strength of the geographical constraint in the network formation.

40|$|In this paper, <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> {{system is}} {{investigated}} {{in the context}} of <b>urban</b> policy processes. <b>Indicators</b> are seen as a tool to enhance urban management and special attention is given to their role in providing assistance in monitoring municipal development and performance. The paper will present desirable features of useful indicators from the city perspective, as well as framework to include these <b>indicators</b> in <b>urban</b> policy and management successfully. Formulation of proper indicator system requires a good understanding of the utilization, diffusion and dissemination of information in policy processes, so the paper will consider basic constraints related to these preconditions such as existing knowledge gaps within the indicator developer community vs. their theoretical limitations, communication concerns, human and technical capacities, policy issues etc. This paper will also elaborate modest Croatian experience in developing <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> system and lessons learned will be used as guidelines in making illustrative proposal for Croatian cities. In addition, this paper will try to define particular environmental, economic and governance variables/indices that should be adopted as <b>urban</b> <b>indicators,</b> taking in account Croatian specificities.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{existing}} connection between power-law distributions and allometries. As {{it was first reported}} in [PLoS ONE 7, e 40393 (2012) ] for the relationship between homicides and population, when these <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> present asymptotic power-law distributions, they can also display specific allometries among themselves. Here, we present an extensive characterization of this connection when considering all possible pairs of relationships from twelve <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> of Brazilian cities (such as child labor, illiteracy, income, sanitation and unemployment). Our analysis reveals that all our <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> are asymptotically distributed as power laws and that the proposed connection also holds for our data when the allometric relationship displays enough correlations. We have also found that not all allometric relationships are independent and that they can be understood {{as a consequence of the}} allometric relationship between the <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> and the population size. We further show that the residuals fluctuations surrounding the allometries are characterized by an almost constant variance and log-normal distributions.

40|$|More {{than a half}} {{of world}} {{population}} is now living in cities and this number {{is expected to be}} two-thirds by 2050. Fostered by the relevancy of a scientific characterization of cities and for the availability of an unprecedented amount of data, academics have recently immersed in this topic {{and one of the most}} striking and universal finding was the discovery of robust allometric scaling laws between several <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> and the population size. Despite that, most governmental reports and several academic works still ignore these nonlineari-ties by often analyzing the raw or the per capita value of <b>urban</b> <b>indicators,</b> a practice that actually makes the urban metrics biased towards small or large cities depending on whether we have super or sublinear allometries. By following the ideas of Bettencourt et al. [PLoS ONE 5 (2010) e 13541], we account for this bias by evaluating the difference between the actual value of an <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> and the value expected by the allometry with the popula-tion size. We show that this scale-adjusted metric provides a more appropriate/informative summary of the evolution of <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> and reveals patterns that do not appear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from Brazilian cities.

40|$|Increasing {{housing density}} is an {{important}} component of global land transformation, with major impacts on patterns of biodiversity. However, while there have been many studies of the changes in biodiversity across rural–urban gradients, which are influenced in large part by housing densities, how biodiversity changes across the full range of regional variation in housing density remains poorly understood. Here, we explore these relationships for the richness and abundance of breeding birds across Britain. Total richness, and that of 27 <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> species, increased from low to moderate household densities and then declined at greater household densities. The richness of all species increased initially faster with household density than did that of the <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> species, but nonurban indicator species richness declined consistently after peaking at a very low housing density. Avian abundance showed a rather different pattern. Total abundance and that summed across all <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> species increased over a wide range of household densities, and declined only at the highest household densities. The abundance of individual <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> species generally exhibited a hump-shaped relationship with housing density. While there was marked intraspecific variation in the form of such relationships, almost invariably avian abundance declined at housing densities below that at which the UK government requires new developments to be built. Our data highlight the difficulties of maintaining biodiversity while minimising land take for new development. High-density housing developments are associated with declines in many of those species otherwise best able to exploit urban environments, and those components of native biodiversity with which human populations are often most familiar...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUse of Urban Underground Space (UUS) {{has been}} growing {{significantly}} in the world’s biggest and wealthiest cities. UUS has been long acknowledged to be important to the urban development agenda: sustainability, resilience, livability, and creating a better urban environment in particular. These issues are traditionally monitored using <b>urban</b> <b>indicators,</b> however UUS has not been properly included and considered in <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> lists (sets or systems) yet – the gap this paper is aiming to bridge. The paper reviews existing approaches to the composition of <b>urban</b> <b>indicator</b> lists, highlighting indicator types, challenges related to data collection, and agencies that {{are concerned with the}} issue. Further the paper has identified the importance of UUS inclusion in the lists that give integrated assessment and monitor urban sustainability, resilience, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as progress towards smart, livable, and compact cities. Existing global quantitative data on UUS have been examined in 8 cities; and three key indicators (descriptors) were suggested to monitor UUS use: Developed UUS volume (m 3); UUS use density (m 3 /m 2); and Developed UUS volume per person (m 3 /person). Current average UUS use densities in cities are identified as up to about 0. 05 (m 3 /m 2) (which can be interpreted as a virtual depth of UUS use of 5 cm), and the developed UUS volume per person is up to about 10 m 3 /person; while city central areas (central business districts) can have a virtual depth of developed UUS of several metres (m 3 /m 2).

40|$|Due to its complexity, the {{evolution}} of cities {{is something that is}} difficult to predict and planning new developments for cities is therefore a difficult task. This complexity can be identified on two levels: on a micro level, it emerges from the multiple relations between the many components and actors in cities, whereas on a macro level it stems from the geographical, social and economic relations between cities. However, many of these relations can be measured. The design of plans for cities can only be improved if designers are able to address measurements of some of the relationships between the components of cities during the design process. These measurements are called <b>urban</b> <b>indicators.</b> By calculating such measurements, designers can grasp the meaning of the changes being proposed, not just as simple alternative layouts, but also in terms of the changes in indicators adding a qualitative perception. This thesis presents a method and a set of tools to generate alternative solutions for an urban context. The method proposes the use of a combined set of design patterns encoding typical design moves used by urban designers. The combination of patterns generates different layouts which can be adjusted by manipulating several parameters in relation to updated <b>urban</b> <b>indicators.</b> The patterns were developed from observation of typical urban design procedures, first encoded as discursive grammars and later translated into parametric design patterns. The CItyMaker method and tools allows the designer to compose a design solution from a set of programmatic premises and fine-tune it by pulling parameters whilst checking the changes in <b>urban</b> <b>indicators.</b> These tools improve the designer’s awareness of the consequences of their design moves. </p...|$|R

To do this we used two different conceptual approaches, one based on a list of widespread species in European cities (WSEC) and another based exclusively on species widespread at city level (WCS) regardless of the birds occurring in other cities. The two indicators gave a similar general pattern, although we found a 3 % difference in the mean annual change in both cities, thus suggesting that the values provided by <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> may differ depending on the conceptual approach and, hence, by the species list used to generate them.

Since urban data {{has a strong}} spatial representation, one can use geographical data {{as the basis for}} constructing information regarding urban environments. One important source of information about the land status is imagery collected through remote sensing. Afterwards, using digital image processing techniques, thematic detail can be extracted from those images and used to build <b>urban</b> <b>indicators.</b> Most common metrics are based on area (2 D) measurements. These include indicators like impervious area per capita or surface occupied by green areas, having usually as primary source a spectral image obtained through a satellite or airborne camera. More recently, laser scanning data has become available for large-scale applications. Such sensors acquire altimetric information and are used to produce Digital Surface Models (DSM). In this context, LiDAR data available for the city is explored along with demographic information, and a framework to produce volumetric (3 D) urban indexes is proposed, and measures like Built Volume per capita, Volumetric Density and Volumetric Homogeneity are computed. * Corresponding author.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the association between health and urbanization in a megacity, Shanghai, by calculating the age-adjusted mortality ratio by ward-unit of Shanghai and by examining relationships between mortalities and <b>urban</b> <b>indicators.</b> Crude mortality rates and age-adjusted mortality ratios by ward-unit were calculated. Demo-graphic, residential environment, healthcare, and socioeconomic indicators were formulated for each of the ward-units between 1995 and 1998. Correlation and Poisson regression analyses were performed to examine the association between <b>urban</b> <b>indicators</b> and mortali-ties. The crude mortality rate by ward-unit in 1997 varied from 6. 3 to 9. 4 deaths per 1000 population.

40|$|Over centuries, {{the climate}} in Arabia {{has become a}} major factor that shaped daylife of the local {{societies}} and thus, the form of their cities. Old cities were charactrized by their compactness which stemmed from the need for protection from the harsh environment. Urban fabric has been dominated by the building masses, the limited number of enclosed public and outdoor spaces, and the inward-looking architecture. Besides its environmental utility, compactness also provided a physical support to the local community and reflected its strong social structure and complex network of kinships. Nowadays, Gulf cities that are mostly shaped by the modern movement and American life style are in complete negation with their past. An unprecedented sprawl effect is taking place all over the Gulf countries due to the heavy reliance on private transportation, high building technology, powerful air-conditioning systems and private housing. Reconsidering compactness in the present urban planning and design practices, would not only insure a cultural continuity with the rooted urban history of the region, but also meets the recommendations of the recent findings in research on sustainable urban development.
