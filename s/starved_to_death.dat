5|$|During the {{war between}} June 1941 and January 1942, the Nazis killed an {{estimated}} 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war. Many <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> while being held in open-air pens at Auschwitz and elsewhere. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people {{during the war and}} less than nine million of these were combat deaths. One in four of the population were killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was a harsh European winter {{noted for its}} effects in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships in {{economic}} terms and living conditions. There were massive disruptions of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|By 26, {{the emperor}} had {{withdrawn}} from politics altogether {{and moved to}} Capri, leaving {{the management of the}} empire to Sejanus who then began eliminating other members of the imperial family. In 28/29, Nero was charged by the Senate with homosexuality for which he was exiled to the island of Ponza. Germanicus' son Drusus was imprisoned within the dungeon under the Imperial palace on the Palatine Hill, where he <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> not long after. Nero died in exile in 33.|$|E

5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> {{by her mother}} Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the rope around her neck. Their bodies were thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|Suffering a {{wound on}} the Borodino {{battlefield}} was effectively a death sentence, as French forces did not possess enough {{food for the}} healthy, much less the sick; consequently, equal numbers of wounded soldiers <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> died of their injuries, or perished through neglect. The casualties were for a single day of battle, while the Russian figures are for the 5th and the 7th, combined. Using the same accounting method for both armies brings the actual French Army casualty count to 34,000–35,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{television}} {{portrayal of}} Sarah Boyer {{is probably the}} closest character to her portrayal in the novelisation. In the book, her companion was named Vic, not Bob, and in the 1970s series, she was named Anne Tranter. Vic's fate is not revealed in the novelization, {{but it can be}} inferred that he <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> In the 2008 television series, Bob survives his initial abandonment. In the 1970s series, Anne (Sarah in the 2008 version) leaves during Episode 11; in the 2008 version, she dies from a mutated version of the virus.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> on the road. Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle that {{at this point in the}} war he had every {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with no choice but to fight. His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2015, Cody {{was indicted}} on animal cruelty and drug charges by a Baltimore County grand jury. The {{indictment}} included 15 charges: Two counts of aggravated animal cruelty involving a dog, five counts of animal {{abuse or neglect}} involving the same dog, one count of illegal possession of an alligator, five counts of animal abuse or neglect involving the alligator, one count of possession with intent to use the drug paraphernalia, and one count of possession of marijuana. Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, denied his client's guilt and said that Cody's dog died of worms {{and that there was}} no animal cruelty. The investigating veterinarian said the dog was neglected and <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E

5|$|The British {{moved the}} capital to New Delhi in 1911. Calcutta {{continued}} to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II. Coinciding with the war, millions <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors. Demands {{for the creation of a}} Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4,000. The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shift—many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> The {{builders}} left a cavity into the wall and the poor girl with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{withdrawal}} of Tiberius from Rome's political scene, the presence of Livia seems to have checked Sejanus' overt power for a time. According to Tacitus, her death in AD 29 changed all that. Sejanus {{began a series of}} purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Among those who perished were Gaius Asinius Gallus, a prominent senator and opponent of Tiberius who was linked to Agrippina's faction. Agrippina and two of her sons, Nero and Drusus were arrested and exiled in AD 30, and later <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> in suspicious circumstances. Only Caligula, the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus, by moving to Capri with Tiberius in AD 31.|$|E

5|$|Dhaka {{suffered}} stagnation {{and decline}} began during the mid 19th-century. Its muslin industry {{was destroyed by}} high colonial taxation, restriction of trade and forced imports of British manufactured textiles. The city's weavers <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> during Bengal famines. The rise of the colonial capital Calcutta caused {{a sharp decline in}} the city's population. Dhaka became heavily impoverished. In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. During the mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. The British Indian rule was established following the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established as a base for the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden and Bahadur Shah Park. A modern civic water system was introduced in 1874. The electricity supply began in 1901.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became {{the basis of the}} Great Leap Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E
5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300inmates had <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> within a three-month period, and that eight to ten were dying every 24hours in the warmer weather.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{course of}} Richard's {{life after the}} {{deposition}} is unclear; he remained in the Tower until {{he was taken to}} Pontefract Castle shortly {{before the end of the}} year. Although King Henry might have been amenable to letting him live, this all changed when it was revealed that the earls of Huntingdon, Kent and Salisbury and Lord Despenser, and possibly also the Earl of Rutlandall now demoted from the ranks they had been given by Richardwere planning to murder the new king and restore Richard in the Epiphany Rising. Although averted, the plot highlighted the danger of allowing Richard to live. He is thought to have <b>starved</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> in captivity on or around 14 February 1400, although there is some question over the date and manner of his death. His body was taken south from Pontefract and displayed in the old St Paul's Cathedral on 17 February before burial in Kings Langley Church on 6 March.|$|E
