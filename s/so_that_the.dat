5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and the body is raised, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E

5|$|As Oregon City {{was founded}} and European {{settlers}} began {{moving to the}} area, they petitioned their governments to remove the local natives from the land, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> settlers could use it for farming and housing.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E
