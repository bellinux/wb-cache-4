40|$|BACKGROUND: Publication bias and/or true {{heterogeneity}} can skew aggregate impressions from scientific literature. To better determine aggregate {{measures for}} unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) treatment, we analyzed adverse outcome rates of <b>surgical</b> <b>clipping</b> and endo-vascular coil embolization. METHODS: Two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE for studies publishing adverse outcome rates for endovascular coiling and <b>surgical</b> <b>clipping</b> between January 1990 and July 2003. Studies {{were classified as}} single-center, multicenter, or community-based. We defined adverse outcome rates as combined all-cause early or in-hospital morbidity and mortality. We determined cumulative adverse outcome rates by plotting precision measure (sample size) against trial-specific effect (adverse outcome rate).

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a new biomedical / open surgical instrument to assist surgeon in applying surgical clips to patient’s body tissue and blood vessel during surgical processes. The new clip delivery {{system is designed}} to better the clip’s distal advance through internal clip channel, jaw guiding track, and all other transition areas to keep <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> from accidental shooting out during clip’s distal move into jaws. Currently the clip distal move in normal surgical instrument is usually driven by compression springs and some complains of clip accidental drop-off were recorded in surgical procedures. Because higher request of dimensional tolerance and better component surface quality are needed in case the compression springs are used as driven force, a little dimensional devia-tion or less qualified part surface produced from manufacturing processes will potentially cause <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> device malfunction or misfiring of the clips. It is clearly known that the jaws can seriously sever or damage patient’s blood ves-sel or body tissue {{if there is no}} clip inside the jaws due to accidental clip drop-off, when surgeons close instrument handles. The improved internal system design in this new open surgical instrument can prevent clip from accidental drop-off because of well guided and controlled clip distal move through internal clip channel and track. Besides the operational force to fully form clip is lower than existing <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> devices due to better mechanical advantage in this new instrument design. In addition to the above, manufacturing and product cost can be decreased since lower requirement of dimensional tolerance and surface quality of instrumental parts is allowed in this new surgical instrument design. This new instrumental prototype is build upon the analysis of computer aided modeling and simulation to prove its good mechanical advantage, feasible function, reliable performance. The preliminary results of instrument fir-ing force from both computer aided modeling and prototype testing are very close to each other, and preliminary prototype testing shows no accidental clip drop-off in this new biomedical / <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> instrument...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{localisation}} of the lumpectomy cavity (LC) {{volume is}} one of the most critical points in 3 D-conformal Partial breast irradiation (3 D-APBI) treatment planning because the irradiated volume is restricted to a small breast volume. Here, we studied the role of the placement of <b>surgical</b> <b>clips</b> at the 4 cardinal points of the lumpectomy cavity in target delineation. Methods Forty CT-based 3 D-APBI plans were retrieved on which a total of 4 radiation oncologists, two trainee and two experienced physicians, outlined the lumpectomy cavity. The inter-observer variability of LC contouring was assessed when the CTV was defined as the delineation that encompassed both <b>surgical</b> <b>clips</b> and remodelled breast tissue. Results The conformity index of tumour bed delineation was significantly improved by the placement of <b>surgical</b> <b>clips</b> within the LC (median at 0. 65). Furthermore, a better conformity index of LC was observed according to the experience of the physicians (median CI = 0. 55 for trainee physicians vs 0. 65 for experienced physicians).

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{introduces a}} new <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> instrument with improved mechanism {{to apply the}} metal clips to patient's vessel/tissues in the surgical operations. The improved clip delivery system has been designed and developed in the instrument to improve the clip distal move from clip channel into jaw guide track and resolve the problems of clip accidental shooting out when clip is being loaded into jaw pair by compression spring that has been normally used in some current <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> instruments. With this improvement, this new surgical open clip instrument can prevent patient's vessels and tissues from being damaging because the distal move of clips is well controlled without clip drop-off incident. Plus the operational force to form the clip is lower than regular surgical instruments due to new mechanism design. In addition to the above, the manufacturing and product cost can be decreased because the dimensional tolerance of components, such as clip channel and jaw guide track, can be wider due to this new instrument design. The prototype of this new instrument is analyzed and optimized through computer aided modeling and simulation, {{in order to prove}} its feasible function, reliable performance, and mechanical advantage. All these improved features have also been tested and verified through the prototype. With some further improvement to this new instrument design and valuable evaluations from surgeon and clinical fields in next several months, the commercial availability of this <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> instrument will be anticipate in 1 – 2 years...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Choledocholithiasis after {{cholecystectomy}} is {{rare and}} often attributed to <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> migration and subsequent nidus formation. Presentation of case: This case demonstrates choledocholithiasis following cholecystectomy with a latency period of 33 years. Discussion: The patient presented with {{pain of the}} right upper quadrant (RUQ). Subsequent abdominal-pelvic CT imaging revealed dilation of the common bile duct. Further Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography was indicative of choledocholithiasis. Additional findings included a long cystic duct remnant and surgical clips in the RUQ.

40|$|SUMMARY: Although {{not useful}} for the {{evaluation}} of coiled aneurysms, CT angiography (CTA) is far superior to MR angiography (MRA) {{for the evaluation of}} aneurysms after <b>surgical</b> <b>clipping.</b> Using the latest multidetector row scanners and optimized imaging parameters, CTA can often effectively depict and follow small aneurysm remnants; demonstrate patency, stenosis, or vasospasm in the adjacent parent vessels; and provide surveillance of the entire cerebrovasculature for de novo aneurysms after <b>surgical</b> <b>clipping.</b> Despite these advances, conventional angiography remains the gold standard for the evaluation of surgically treated aneurysms and should be liberally used to resolve any cases of diagnostic uncertainty on noninvasive imaging. Vascular imaging {{plays an important role in}} the periopera-tive and postoperative evaluation of cerebral aneurysms that are treated by <b>surgical</b> <b>clipping.</b> In the intraoperative or immediate postoperative period, imaging is required to eval-uate aneurysm residual and parent vessel compromise. 1 In the setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage, imaging surveil-lance for cerebral vasospasm is also necessary. Although the risk for recurrence of a clipped aneurysm is low, there is evi-dence that aneurysm recurrence as well as de novo aneurysm formationwith subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage can oc-cur even after successful surgical treatment. 2 - 9 These data sup-port the use of routine periodic imaging surveillance after suc-cessful <b>surgical</b> <b>clipping.</b> Although imaging after <b>surgical</b> aneurysm <b>clipping</b> has tra-ditionally been achieved with conventional catheter-based an-giography, CT angiography (CTA) may provide an acceptable alternative in many cases, particularly for long-term postop-erative follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} causes and {{treatment}} principles of the "false-negative" phenomenon of intraoperative near-infrared indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) during intracranial aneurysm surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross sectional analytical {{study was conducted}} at the Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan from January to December 2014. A sample of 25 women fulfilling our selection criteria was taken. All patients came to our department for ultrasound guided core biopsy of suspicious breast lesions and clip placement in the index lesion prior to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. All the selected patients had biopsy proven breast cancer. RESULTS: The mean age was 45 ± 11. 6 years. There were no complications seen after clip placement in terms of clip migration or hemorrhage. The cost of commercially available markers was approximately PKR 9, 000 (US$ 90) {{and that of the}} <b>surgical</b> <b>clip</b> was PKR 900 (US$ 9).
