40|$|Evidence {{gathered}} from major fraud investigations {{over the last}} decade has revealed that auditors in these cases failed to attend to fraud red flags within the <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> evidence. Research in psychology regarding inattentional blindness (IB) provides a theoretical framework for explaining why auditors may be prone to missing fraud red flags. This study examines the presence of IB during the performance of <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> and proposes two distinct interventions. Each intervention is predicted to improve auditor fraud detection. In a scenario involving fraudulent revenue transactions, findings show that a slight modification to the standard audit procedures significantly improves an auditor’s detection of red flags indicative of fraud.

40|$|Audit is an {{interdisciplinary}} activity which requires, nowadays {{more than ever}} in the past, knowledge and skills {{in the field of}} accounting and related financial knowledge, as well as from other non-financial sectors (such as the statistics or the information technology). The use of statistics in the audit may not be entirely obvious at first sight and thus the main aim of this thesis is to point out possible ways to apply statistical tools in <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> (which represents an important stage of the audit work). The most important use of statistics in the audit can be found in sampling methods. The range of a tested population may be too wide for testing the whole population that leads {{to the fact that it}} is necessary to select an audit sample appropriately. The thesis outlines what kind of method and technique of selection to choose and how to generalize the results obtained during the sample testing to the entire population. Besides the main aim in the form of the application of statistical tools in the audit, the thesis also focuses on a brief description of the audit history, polemic of current understanding of the term audit, professional organizations and regulations of the audit in the Czech Republic and description of individual stages of audit work (especially on a detailed analysis of a <b>substantive</b> <b>testing)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} body {{of prior}} {{research has shown}} that audits by the Big 5 (now Big 4) public accounting firms are quality differentiated relative to non-Big 5 audits. This result can be derived analytically by assuming that Big 5 and non-Big 5 firms face different loss functions for "audit failures" and is consistent with a variety of empirical evidence from studies of audit fees, auditor changes, and the stock price reaction to audited earnings. However, there is no existing evidence (of which we are aware) concerning the underlying production differences between Big 5 and non-Big 5 audits. As a result, existing empirical evidence cannot distinguish between the possibility that Big 5 audits are simply perceived to be different (e. g., by investors) or actually differ in how they are produced. Our research objective is to identify the production characteristics of audit engagements that may explain the differences in expected audit quality between Big 5 and non-Big 5 firms. In this archival study, we examine the total audit effort and the allocation of effort to four audit phases - planning, (control) risk assessment, <b>substantive</b> <b>testing,</b> and completion - for a cross-section sample of 113 audits of Dutch companies in 1998 / 99 by 14 public accounting firms. We find that, after controlling for client characteristics: (1) both types of auditors exert about the same amount of total audit effort; (2) Big 5 auditors allocate relatively more effort to planning and (control) risk assessment, and relatively less to <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> and completion; and (3) client size, use of the business-risk-based audit approach, and reliance on client internal controls affect audit hours differently for the two auditor types. We conclude that the Big 5 firms actually produce a higher audit quality level, and that this quality difference is related to how audit hours are deployed in a more contextual and less procedural audit approach...|$|E

Our examination is conducted in the context of substantive analytical procedures that are performed to provide evidence during the <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> phase of an audit. The first experiment provides evidence that auditors attribute more strength to a weak, aggregate-level analytical procedure that produces an expectation that is not significantly different from the unaudited numbers (i. e., a “favorable ” outcome), than to the same analytical procedure that produces an expectation that is significantly different from the unaudited numbers.

40|$|The problem {{motivating}} {{this article}} is the determination of sample size at the <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> stage of a financial audit. An error in an audit account is said to occur {{when there is a}} non-zero difference between its book value and true value. A typical financial auditing task involves several stages and usually a large number of potential items are available for testing at each stage. The sample size determination problem is to find an optimum fixed number of items which must be tested so that the quantitative risk of a wrong decision is bounded by a pre-specified quantity. Senior auditors often have strong subjective opinions regarding the state of the accounts being audited which naturally leads to the choice of Bayesian methods. Solutions are proposed under various model assumptions. A combination of analytical and simulation based techniques is proposed and some theoretical results are obtained. The methods developed, however, are quite general and can be applied to other sample size determination (SSD) problems. A number of numerical illustrations are given...|$|E

The sample is large cities using 1996 data. The theoretical model uses five constructs to explain audit fees: (1) client size, (2) complexity of client operations, (3) financial risks including demographic characteristics, (4) auditing factors, and (5) governance structure. Client size increases audit complexity. Large organizations require more audit effort because there are more transactions. Complex client operations are expected to require more audit time and greater expertise, both expected to increase {{the cost of the}} audit. Auditors are increasingly focusing on financial risk to determine the level of audit effort (e. g., internal control checks and <b>substantive</b> <b>testing)</b> and audit pricing.

The SOM is used for clustering monthly data sets. Neural network systems are based on computational intelligence. The purpose is to show how the data sets of various accounts and various years form their own groups. We found that the SOM can add value to auditors in the analytical process: it is a tool for classifying and clustering data sets that reveals if some cluster contains data that a priory should not be in it. Therefore, it can be used for signalling unexpected fluctuations in data. Furthermore, the SOM is a possible technique embedded in the continuous auditing tool. 1...|$|E

40|$|The problem {{motivating}} {{the paper}} is the determination of sample size in clinical trials under normal likelihoods and at the <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> stage of a financial audit where normality is not an appropriate assumption. A combination of analytical and simulation-based techniques within the Bayesian framework is proposed. The framework accommodates two different prior distributions: one is the general purpose fitting prior distribution that is used in Bayesian analysis and the other is the expert subjective prior distribution, the sampling prior which is believed to generate the parameter values which in turn generate the data. We obtain many theoretical results and one key result is that typical non-informative prior distributions lead to very small sample sizes. In contrast, a very informative prior distribution may either lead to a very small or a very large sample size depending on the location of the centre of the prior distribution and the hypothesized value of the parameter. The methods that are developed are quite general and can be applied to other sample size determination problems.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether {{internal}} audit’s reporting relationship with the audit committee and the client’s business risk environment impact external auditors’ reliance on the work of internal audit. Design/methodology/approach – An experiment is conducted using a 2 £ 2 between-subjects design where we manipulate the above two factors at strong and weak levels. Participants are 66 audit partners, managers and seniors, all experienced with clients having internal audit functions. Findings – The results indicate that both factors affect external auditors’ reliance on work already undertaken by internal audit and their use of internal auditors (IA) as assistants. The results also indicate that external auditors are more likely to use internal audit for control evaluation tasks than for substantive tests of balances. The study does not find any significant interaction effects between the two factors. Originality/value – No prior studies have examined the influence of reporting relationship and client business risk on external auditors’ reliance decisions in the current governance environment. Further, the paper examines the impact of these factors on reliance on work already undertaken by internal audit and on using IA as assistants, with respect to both control evaluation work and <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> of balances. ...|$|E

They are also relying on internal and operational controls as well as knowledge of the organization. This type of computer assessment decision can help relate the cost/benefit analysis of the control to the known risk, allowing practical choices. A knowledge based approach to an Information Systems Audit will enable us to develop an overall and effective IS Audit plan which will consider all the potential weaknesses and /or absence of Controls and determine whether this could lead to a significant deficiency or material weakness.
