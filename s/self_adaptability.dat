40|$|A desired {{property}} of large distributed systems is <b>self</b> <b>adaptability</b> against the faults that occur more frequently as {{the size of}} the distributed system grows. Self-stabilizing protocols provide autonomous recovery from finite number of transient faults. Fault-containing self-stabilizing protocols promise not only self-stabilization but also containment of faults (quick recovery and small effect) against small number of faults. However, existing composition techniques for self-stabilizing protocols (e. g. fair composition) cannot preserve the fault-containment property when composing fault-containing self-stabilizing protocols. In this paper, we present Recovery Waiting Fault-containing Composition (RWFC) framework that provides a composition of multiple fault-containing self-stabilizing protocols while preserving the fault-containment {{property of}} the source protocols...|$|E

There are three main methods for load flow studies namely Gauss-Seidel method, Newton-Raphson method and Fast decoupled method. Different resources are also be used in distributed generation (DG), such as wind turbines, biomass, micro turbine, photovoltaic, fuel-cells, small hydroelectric plants, etc., and it ranging from sub-kW to multi-MW sizes. DG affects the flow of voltage and power conditions on the system equipment. These may affect themselves either positively or negatively depending on the distribution system operating conditions and the DG characteristics. Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) is inspired by the social foraging behaviour of Escherichia coli. It is having a fast convergence and <b>self</b> <b>adaptability</b> of individual in that group searching activities. BFO is more preferred as compared to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) because it is derivate free technique. BFO is divided into four main steps chemotaxis, swarming, reproduction and elimination dispersal. In this paper, investigation is done on optimal location of DGs are realize using BFO algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Basing on career {{construction}} {{theory and}} self-verification theory, current research examined the mediating and moderating {{models for the}} relations among self-esteem, proactive personality, career exploration, future work <b>self</b> and career <b>adaptability.</b> A two-wave survey study was conducted among Chinese university students (N = 305). The results showed that both self-esteem and proactive personality (measured at time 1) positively predicted future work <b>self</b> and career <b>adaptability</b> (measured at time 2), with these relationships mediated by career exploration (measured at time 1). In addition, the results further revealed that {{the positive effect of}} self-esteem on career exploration was stronger among students who had a higher level of proactive personality. In support of the hypothesized moderated mediation model, for individuals with a higher level of proactive personality, the indirect effects of self-esteem on future work <b>self</b> and career <b>adaptability</b> through career exploration were stronger. These findings carry implications for research on career construction theory and career counseling practices. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} attention in the leadership and management literature to the 䤡rk side of leadership?, in addition to the more established areas of transformational and transactional leadership styles. Potential leadership derailers like ego-centredness, using intimidating tactics, manipulation, passive-aggressive or micromanaging behaviours, while they might achieve short term objectives, can, over time, lose the support of colleagues, subordinates and ultimately customers. Used frequently such behaviours can lead to serious problems in the workplace at the employee, team and organisational levels. This paper, part of a larger PhD study, analyses the role of leader self management in the reported tendency to demonstrate derailment behaviours in a sample of 301 managers. Significant correlations were found between measures of <b>self</b> management: <b>adaptability,</b> emotional control, desire to impress, negative affectivity, openness, stress tolerance, self awareness, self confidence and optimism, and the self-reported tendency to engage in derailing leadership behavioursGriffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Based on career {{construction}} {{theory and}} the model of proactive motivation, the current research examined the mediating and moderating models for the relations among future work <b>self,</b> career <b>adaptability,</b> job search self-efficacy and employment status. A survey study was conducted among Chinese university graduates (N = 270). The results showed that future work self (measured at wave 1) had positive effect on employment status (measured at wave 3), with this relationship partially mediated by career adaptability (measured at wave 1) and job search self-efficacy (measured at wave 2). In addition, the results further revealed that {{the positive effect of}} future work self on job search self-efficacy was stronger among the graduates who had a higher level of career adaptability. In support of the hypothesized moderated mediation model, for individuals with a higher level of career adaptability, the indirect effect of future work self on employment status through job search self-efficacy was stronger. These findings carry implications for research on job search behavior, career education and career counseling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A novel bio-heuristic {{algorithm}} called Refined Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (RBFA) {{is proposed}} in the paper to solve the optimal power dispatch of deregulated electric power systems. The Optimal reactive power dispatch (OPD) problem has growing effect in modern electric power systems and the problem in need of to address the secure operation and optimal operation, with optimal location of FACTS devices, control of power flow based on stability indices and reliability analysis. So, this problem is well known as a multi-disciplinary and multi objective problem where in need of exact formulation and solution of the problem. The basic BFA {{is based on a}} metaphor of social interaction of E-coli bacteria the <b>self</b> <b>adaptability</b> of individuals in the group searching activities has attracted a great deal of interests in real word problems but it gives poor performance in global points when its applied to high dimensional and multi objective problems. To avoid the local optima and in order to track the good tracking ability of global solutions, the improved version of BFA algorithm is proposed and the proposed algorithm is called Refined Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (RBFA). The RBFA is improved version of the basic BFA with search direction phenomenon, variation of step sizes in chemotaxis behavior and variation of position updating process. The optimal dispatch problem consist of reactive power dispatch, optimal location of FACTS devices wit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to show the results of IE-Martruj, a model designed for measuring emotional intelligence in directors of research centers (RCs), which was applied to forty-three directors of research centers in Mexico. The validation model and reliability tests are described in detail, as well as the mathematical formulae used. As a general conclusion of this research, we show that: The model studied is an adequate instrument for the task proposed, and that the Emotional intelligence (EI) of directors of RCs is positively associated with: motivation, self-assessment, self-regulation, empathy and social skills. Also, the following hypotheses were tested with positive results:H 1 Motivation, initiative, optimism and involvement are conditions positively correlated with the effectiveness of directors of RCs. H 2 Self knowledge, emotional awareness, precise self evaluation and self awareness are positively correlated with each other, and are essential parts of intrapersonal intelligence. H 3 Self-regulation, <b>self</b> control, <b>adaptability</b> and <b>self</b> awareness are positively correlated with each other, and are also part of intrapersonal intelligence. H 4 Empathy, comprehension of others, development of subordinates’ skills, readiness to serve, capacity to manage diversity, and political coherence exhibited by an RC director are positively correlated with each other, and are part of interpersonal intelligence. H 5 Social skills exhibited by directors, that are also part of interpersonal intelligence, allow a director to exert a greater influence on the working group, facilitating communication, conflict management, leadership, collaboration, cooperation and development of team skills...|$|R
40|$|Grid Computing is fast {{gaining ground}} both within academia and the {{commercial}} sectors. It {{has shifted from}} its traditional scientific-based applications to serviceoriented problem solving environments for commerce and business. Engineering design optimisation (EDO) is characteristically computationally and data intensive. EDO is also a multidisciplinary field which requires the collaboration of different domain experts {{to work on a}} design to yield improved versions. Grid Computing offers a suitable platform for design engineers to collaboratively work together and share knowledge and expertise in addition to the computational and data facility that can be combined to bear on complex designs. In this paper, the trend of Grid Computing evolution shows a clear emergence of application areas, starting from computational grid, data grid, visualisation grid and semantic grid to service-oriented problem solving environments (SO-PSE). This evolution is classified as first, second and third generation of Grid Computing for the purpose of understanding how researchers have tried to provide solutions to the problems and challenges in implementing Grid applications. The future of Grid Computing research areas such as autonomic computing, ubiquitous computing and economic Grid models as well as concurrent engineering design problem solving environments feature in the report. Autonomic computing enables grid services and resources to have self-management, <b>self</b> adjustable and <b>adaptability</b> to changing and dynamic situations using agent-based technology while ubiquitous computing allows computers to perceive the environment and act accordingly...|$|R

[2005]) {{was used}} to assess four {{dimensions}} of somatic symptoms: gastrointestinal problems (4 items; e.g. How often have you suffered from an upset stomach (indigestion)?), headaches (3 items; How often have you experienced headaches?), sleep disturbances (4 items; [...] "How often have you had difficulty getting to sleep at night?"), and respiratory illness (3 items; e.g. When you have a bad cold or flu, how often does it last longer than it should?). Second, the 10 -item Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al. [1983]) {{was used to}} assess perception of stress (e.g. In the last month, how often have you felt nervous and [...] "stressed"?). Third, coping was measured via the 16 -item Functional Dimensions of Coping Scale (Ferguson & Cox [1997]) which assesses four dimensions of coping; approach, avoidance, reappraisal, and emotional regulation. Fourth, the 25 -item Psychological Resilience Scale (Wagnild & Young [1993]) {{was used to assess}} resilience via the capacity to withstand stress and create meaning from challenges. Psychometrically there is evidence of a two factor structure to the scales, comprising Personal Competence (self-reliance, independence, determination, invincibility, mastery, resourcefulness and perseverance) and Acceptance of <b>Self</b> and Life (<b>adaptability,</b> balance, flexibility and a balanced perspective on life) (Portzky et al. [2010]; Wagnild & Young [1993]). For {{the purpose of this study}} we computed the two subscales of Personal Competence and Acceptance of Self and Life. Fifth, the 6 -item Brief Resilience Scale (Smith et al. [2008]) was used to measure an individual's ability to `bounce back' to stressful situations or adversity.|$|R
