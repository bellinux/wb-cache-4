5|$|The {{fall of the}} {{communist}} regime marked {{a new chapter in}} the history of Poland and in the history of <b>Solidarity.</b> Having defeated {{the communist}} government, <b>Solidarity</b> found itself in a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among <b>Solidarity</b> factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected <b>Solidarity</b> chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the <b>Solidarity</b> logo.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{communist}} authorities, <b>Solidarity</b> was also opposed {{by some of}} the Polish (émigré) radical right, believing <b>Solidarity</b> or KOR to be disguised communist groups, dominated by Jewish Trotskyite Zionists.|$|E
5|$|In the elections, <b>Solidarity</b> {{received}} only 4.9% of the votes, 0.1% {{less than the}} 5% {{required in order to}} enter parliament (<b>Solidarity</b> still had 9 senators, 2 fewer than in the previous Senate). The victorious party was the Democratic Left Alliance (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej or SLD), a post-communist left-wing party.|$|E

5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, <b>Solidarity</b> was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, <b>Solidarity</b> and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, <b>Solidarity</b> accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the <b>Solidarity</b> of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, <b>Solidarity</b> followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|Next year, in February 1991, Marian Krzaklewski {{was elected}} {{the leader of}} <b>Solidarity.</b> President Wałęsa's vision {{and that of the}} new <b>Solidarity</b> {{leadership}} were diverging. Far from supporting Wałęsa, <b>Solidarity</b> was becoming increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own political party for action in the upcoming 1991 parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens' Committee (Komitet Obywatelski) {{was formed}} within <b>Solidarity.</b> It {{comprised}} several sections, each responsible for presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wałęsa {{and the majority}} of <b>Solidarity</b> leaders supported negotiation, while a minority wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wałęsa's leadership, <b>Solidarity</b> decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained any substantial power, nor did it take any action.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish {{political}} prisoners were released—the last of those connected with <b>Solidarity,</b> and arrested {{during the previous}} years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal <b>Solidarity</b> entity since the declaration of martial law—the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarność (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność)—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council {{was admitted to the}} International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local <b>Solidarity</b> chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created. Nonetheless, <b>Solidarity</b> members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and a more radical Fighting <b>Solidarity</b> grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Solidarity</b> {{now joined}} forces with its {{erstwhile}} enemy, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), and some protests were organized by both trade unions. The following year, <b>Solidarity</b> organized many strikes over {{the state of the}} Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as policja) using batons and water cannons. Nonetheless, <b>Solidarity</b> decided to support Wałęsa in the 1995 presidential elections.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of <b>Solidarity</b> {{and the political}} liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the nomenklatura toward <b>Solidarity</b> was rapidly increasing.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} support for the <b>Solidarity</b> was unique: no other {{movement}} in the world was supported by Ronald Reagan and Santiago Carrillo, Enrico Berlinguer and the Pope, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Benn, peace campaigners and NATO spokesman, Christians and Western communists, conservatives, liberals and socialists. The international community outside the Iron Curtain condemned Jaruzelski's actions and declared support for Solidarity; dedicated organizations were formed for that purpose (like Polish <b>Solidarity</b> Campaign in Great Britain). US President Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland, which eventually would force the Polish government into liberalizing its policies. Meanwhile, the CIA together with the Catholic Church and various Western trade unions such as the AFL-CIO provided funds, equipment and advice to the <b>Solidarity</b> underground. The political alliance of Reagan and the Pope would prove important to the future of <b>Solidarity.</b> The Polish public also supported what was left of Solidarity; a major medium for demonstrating support of <b>Solidarity</b> became masses held by priests such as Jerzy Popiełuszko.|$|E
5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of <b>Solidarity</b> surpassed all predictions. <b>Solidarity</b> candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to <b>Solidarity).</b> At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of the <b>Solidarity</b> mass movement. By the end of October, <b>Solidarity</b> had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported <b>Solidarity.</b> With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E

5|$|In {{a second}} major defeat for the Polish right wing, the {{elections}} were won by an SLD candidate, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who received 51.72% of votes. A <b>Solidarity</b> call for new elections went unheeded, but the Sejm {{still managed to}} pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the SLD voting against). Meanwhile, the left-wing OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, {{twice as many as}} the contemporary <b>Solidarity</b> (with 1.3 million).|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, <b>Solidarity</b> was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, as likely {{a thing of the}} past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior <b>Solidarity</b> figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that <b>Solidarity</b> was not a united front.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the regime}} {{leadership}} intended to remold <b>Solidarity</b> into a compliant union, {{stripped of its}} intelligentsia advisers and compatible with the state socialist system. The failure to incite most ranking <b>Solidarity</b> leaders to collaborate, especially Wałęsa's refusal to extend any cooperation along this course of action, resulted in the government adopting the goal of total liquidation of the union movement.|$|E

40|$|An {{influential}} {{literature suggests}} that one important feature of the transition from modern industrial society is the erosion of existing <b>solidarities.</b> People increasingly understand the risks and uncertainties they face in life as issues of personal failure and responsibility rather than as social problems to be addressed through collective action. A corresponding welfare state literature understands contemporary processes of social policy change as highlighting individual responsibility and proactivity {{as a result of}} the constraints on government from globalisation, post-industrialism and other changes. This article uses recent attitude survey data to investigate whether risk society dissolves the <b>solidarities</b> that provided the foundation for the traditional welfare state, and how far it offers a basis for new <b>solidarities</b> that may maintain support for vulnerable groups. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for the formation of political <b>solidarities</b> across the spatial divisions being intensified by dominant responses to the European crisis. In doing so it takes inspiration from Doreen Massey’s thinking around the contested terms on which space and politics are articulated and her engagement with the 2008 crisis through projects such as the Kilburn Manifesto. We argue that her book World City powerfully articulates a way of thinking about the spatial politics of a particular conjuncture. The paper traces the ways in which various political interventions in post-crisis politics have been shaped by distinctive ‘nationed’ geographical imaginaries. In particular we explore how left-wing nationed narratives impact on the discursive horizon and unpack their implications for the articulation of <b>solidarities</b> and emancipatory politics {{in the context of the}} ‘European Crisis’. Building on this, we reflect on how trans-local <b>solidarities</b> and alliances might be articulated across socio-spatial divisions and contest the decidedly uneven, racialised, gendered and classed impacts of dominant European politics. We argue that such <b>solidarities</b> and alliances can form a crucial intervention in challenging the dominant spatial politics of crisis and articulating left political strategies on different terms...|$|R
