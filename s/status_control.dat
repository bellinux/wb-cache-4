5000|$|The first {{identifiable}} {{communications and}} information distribution organization {{was called the}} NATO Integrated Communications Systems Central Operating Authority (NICS-COA) and was established to control, operate and maintain the NATO Communication systems of that time. The main elements of these systems were the Initial Voice Switched Network (IVSN), Telegraph Automated Relay Equipment (TARE), <b>Status</b> <b>Control</b> Alerting and Reporting System (SCARS), SATCOM systems and equipment and the ACE High Tropospheric Scatter trunk communication network. By the early 1990s due mainly {{to the arrival of}} new systems and new technology it became necessary to reorganize the Communication and Information systems support for NATO. This coincided with a major restructuring of the NATO Command {{to take advantage of the}} [...] "peace dividend" [...] after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1993 the NATO Communication and Information Systems Operating and Support Agency (NACOSA) was formed by the integration of functions previously undertaken by NICS-COA and some elements of the Communications and Information Systems Division of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE CISD). Over time it became apparent that there was still a need for establishments to streamline their operations to improve management and control and also to make a manpower saving of some 25% so NACOSA also took command of 4 subordinate elements. These were the Integrated System Support Centre (ISSC), Allied Command Europe Communications Security (ACE Comsec) (which later became INFOSEC Command NACOSA), The NATO Communication and Information Systems School (NCISS) at Latina, Italy and the Regional Signal Group SHAPE. In the following years, NACOSA developed into an organization with responsibilities for the operation and support of communication and information systems on both sides of the Atlantic and for all NATO Operational deployments.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{remains one of}} the riskiest of all. This risk is mainly the result of a poorly controlled, and thus uncertain, environment. For instance, construction progress is often improperly controlled, resulting in some unnoticed errors with considerable impact on later project activities, and ultimately project success. Better progress control requires, among other things, better project three-dimensional (3 D) as-built <b>status</b> <b>control.</b> Until recently, comprehensive and accurate 3 D as-built <b>status</b> <b>control</b> remained almost impossible because the lack of adequate technology made it too time- and labour-intensive. However, the progress made {{in the last two decades}} in 3 D (even 4 D) modelling, and more recently in laser scanner (and also photogrammetry), is such that fast and accurate 3 D as-built <b>status</b> <b>control</b> is now conceivable. In this paper, a system for automated construction progress control using laser scanning and 4 D modelling is presented. Given a laser scan of a construction site and its acquisition date, the system quasi-automatically recognizes the building elements that (1) are expected to be built at that date and (2) visible in this scan. Results from multiple scans obtained on the same date but from different locations can be aggregated, and the combined recognition results are used to automatically infer site progress status, and consequently update the schedule. Experimental results demonstrate these features and the significant potential of this approach...|$|E

People with younger onset diabetes (n = 891) who rated their health relative to their peers as "worse" or "don't know" were no more likely to die than those rating their health as "the same" or "better" when physical health <b>status</b> was <b>controlled.</b> In contrast, those with older onset diabetes (n = 987) who rated their health as "worse" or "don't know" were almost twice as likely to die as those rating their health as "the same" or "better" when physical health <b>status</b> was <b>controlled.</b> CONCLUSIONS.
