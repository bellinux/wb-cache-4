40|$|Name: Jaroslav Božka The name of {{bachelor}} thesis: Temperature {{regime in}} the <b>stand</b> <b>space</b> within the adult spruce stand Transformation of forest monoculture to the forests close to nature is most discussed within professional forestry company in the last decades. When converting forest monoculture to the forests close to nature there is also necessary to obtain information about stand climate that is created in the newly planted stands because the stand climate significantly affects the production processes of forest trees. In the thesis {{an analysis of the}} temperature {{regime in the}} fir-beech stand below the canopy of adult spruce stand was made at the study site of Rájec (Drahanská vrchovina Highlands) during the growing season (May-October) of 2013. Temperature in the fir-beech stand below the canopy of adult spruce stand and in the adult spruce stand was different, which was caused by different radiation regime in stands, which significantly modified the temperature regime. In the fir-beech stand growing below the canopy of adult spruce stand a specific temperature regime was creating. The temperature regime varied depending on the amount of penetrating solar radiation and depending on the physiological processes of growth (development of stand foliage, transpiration processes). Aperture adult spruce stand was suitable protection for the development of fir-beech stand planted below the canopy of adult spruce stand because reduced temperature fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyze the notion of a hybrid space, to explore the {{necessity}} of adopting this term as a characteristic of space, and to question whether it is time to move beyond its use. The term, hybrid, originating in biology, describes the offspring of two different species. For the past two decades, Hybridity has found a wide application within social sciences, including architecture. In general, Hybridity occurs when two separate entities come together to form a third. In the context of architecture, a hybrid space is one in which the advent of technology allows us to experience multiple spaces simultaneously.  We understand Hybridity to be a conceptual construct that is useful in explaining new phenomenon. This begs the question, what is the new phenomenon. In the case of space, it is the aforementioned advent of technology. This is not, however, the first time space has been expanded by technology. Throughout history, our ability to understand <b>stand</b> <b>space</b> has been extended by the advent of new technology. Perhaps, a hybrid space is not defined by technology after all. The ultimate {{goal of this}} paper is to define the moment at which Hybridity ceases to be useful, assuming that such a moment even exists. Though it has been helpful in understand space in new ways, allowing new insights into space, for many spaces this term can reach the end of its usefulness. The moment at which this occurs is dependant on a few factors. The first is one of adoption. Once a hybrid space is commonplace, is it strictly necessary to consider it a hybrid any longer? The second factor is the polymorphism of hybrid spaces. The phrase hybrid space does not describe a single form of space. Instead, a hybrid space can be one of a plethora of spaces. Finally, the issues of category and identity may help define this moment. If Hybridity relies on categories and instances between categories, then this suggests that a change in perspective may destroy the category of the hybrid. Perspective is directly tied to the specific identity of the viewer and that vieweris experiences...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{stiffness}} or {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE) is one of {{the most}} important wood properties for solid timber applications, and as such, the efficacy of wood use, especially for structural timber is strongly related to MOE. MOE in Pinus radiata is highly variable and poorly understood. In this study, the effect of initial <b>stand</b> <b>spacing</b> and breed on outerwood MOE and the vertical distribution of MOE of Pinus radiata was assessed. Understanding positive or negative influences of growth caused by initial <b>stand</b> <b>spacing</b> and genetic material on MOE is appealing because it could enable us to better comprehend how forest growers could adapt silvicultural operations to the demands of wood processing. Physical characteristics of different breeds and propagation methods of Pinus radiata were assessed at a variety of initial stand spacings. Stem diameter, crown height, stem slenderness and branch size were all heavily influenced by <b>stand</b> <b>spacing.</b> Breed had a marginally significant influence on diameter and stem slenderness. Internode length was not affected by <b>stand</b> <b>spacing,</b> but showed sizeable differences, especially between the long internode 870 breed and the remaining growth and form (GF) breeds. Outerwood MOE was significantly (P 0. 05). MOE scaled positively with <b>stand</b> <b>spacing.</b> MOE increased by 39 % from 5. 4 GPa at 209 stems ha- 1 to 7. 5 GPa at 2551 stems ha- 1. The majority of this increase (33 %) occurred between 209 and 835 stems ha- 1. Physiologically aged cuttings of greater maturation status exhibited greater MOE, with the three-year-old cuttings being stiffer than the one-year-old cuttings, seedlings from the 870, 268 and 850 series, by 15, 17, 22 and 27 %, respectively. Stem slenderness exhibited the strongest significant (P< 0. 0001) relationship with MOE (r 2 = 0. 49), followed by green crown height (r 2 = 0. 46) and diameter (r 2 = 0. 44). Stem slenderness and green crown height had a direct influence on MOE that explained 53 % of the variance in MOE. MOE was also significantly (P< 0. 0001) influenced by spacing and breed when using the resonance technique to assess whole stem MOE. The vertical distribution of MOE showed that the lowest portion of the stem (bolt 1) was approximately 30 % less stiff than bolts 2 and 3. After the greatest MOE value had been obtained at bolt 3, MOE gently declined to the top of the measured stem. Variation of MOE within trees was significant (58 %) at the high stockings of 1457 and 2551 stems ha- 1, but somewhat lower (36 %) at the lower stockings. The 870 breed was approximately 8 % and 16 % stiffer than the 268 and 850 breeding series respectively, across all stockings, with the three-year-old cuttings being 7 % stiffer than the one-year-old cuttings. At stockings of 481 stems ha- 1 and less, the proportional height at which MOE was greatest within a tree was between 25 % and 50 % of stem height. At stockings above 481 stems ha- 1 the proportional height at which maximum MOE was obtained was between 15 % and 40 % of stem height. Bolt slenderness was found to be the most significant factor impacting on MOE of the bolt. Regression of critical buckling height against diameter at ground level yielded a scaling exponent of 0. 55, which was lower than the scaling exponent of 0. 67 predicted with constant density-specific stiffness. There was a tendency for some bolts with lower mean diameter to display significantly higher safety margins than bolts with higher mean diameter, suggesting that the largest bolts, which occur at the base of tree, are the point of most likely critical failure...|$|R

In their approach, a large regional growth and yield database, assembled for the forests of northeastern North America (Weiskittel et al. 2013), was compiled into a stand-level reference database, and the resulting stand-level model alternately utilizes imputation-based selection of nearest neighbors from the reference database and copula sampling to grow stands through time. The structure of the model was fairly simple, but was able to produce a wide range of stand trajectories and behaviors across a range of stand conditions defined within Reineke’s (1933) <b>stand</b> density <b>space</b> (McGarrigle et al. 2013).
