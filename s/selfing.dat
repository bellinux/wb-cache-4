5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective <b>selfing.</b> Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

25|$|However, outcrossing may be {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} parthenogenesis or <b>selfing</b> (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when {{there has been a}} forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.|$|E
25|$|These chimeras arise by {{spontaneous}} or {{induced mutation}} of a plastid gene, {{followed by the}} sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after <b>selfing</b> or nucleic acid thermodynamics, plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized {{at the time of}} origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their non-mendelian inheritance. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.|$|E

25|$|Heterosis, or {{hybrid vigor}} (as in the {{familiar}} F1 hybrids of maize), occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, {{but it is difficult}} to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale (as is done with maize) because wheat flowers are perfect and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing agents; these chemicals selectively interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States and South Africa. F1 hybrid wheat cultivars should not be confused with the standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then <b>selfing</b> or inbreeding the progeny many (ten or more) generations before release selections are identified to be released as a variety or cultivar.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} agricultural systems wheat populations often {{consist of}} landraces, informal farmer-maintained populations that often maintain {{high levels of}} morphological diversity. Although landraces of wheat are no longer grown in Europe and North America, {{they continue to be}} important elsewhere. The origins of formal wheat breeding lie in the nineteenth century, when single line varieties were created through selection of seed from a single plant noted to have desired properties. Modern wheat breeding developed {{in the first years of}} the twentieth century and was closely linked to the development of Mendelian genetics. The standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars is by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then <b>selfing</b> or inbreeding the progeny. Selections are identified (shown to have the genes responsible for the varietal differences) ten or more generations before release as a variety or cultivar.|$|E

50|$|When Uddalaka {{is having}} dialog {{with his son}} Shvetaketu, if he is saying “O Atman, that thou art”, what are these words {{referring}} to? Since “Atman” is addressing, “thou” must also refer to Atman. If “thou” points to the Supreme inner <b>self,</b> then the statement simply means “O Supreme inner <b>self,</b> you, the Supreme inner <b>self</b> is that, Supreme inner self”. This simply becomes a redundant statement that is trivially true. There are only two ways the triviality can go. One is Atman refers to individual <b>self</b> and that refers to Supreme inner <b>self</b> and negating their selfsameness is the purport. “O Individual <b>self,</b> you are not that Supreme inner self.” The second way is to note that in Vedic grammar, the Nominative case is representative of other cases. In Accusative case sense, {{it means that the}} very object and purpose of an Individual <b>self</b> is Supreme <b>self.</b> In Instrumental case it means that the Supreme inner <b>self</b> or the Lord is instrumental for every action of Individual <b>self.</b> In Dative case, it means the very goal of Individual <b>self</b> is to reach the Supreme inner <b>self.</b> In Ablative case, it means the very origin of Individual <b>self</b> is the Supreme <b>Self.</b> It also means that Individual <b>self</b> is eternally dependent on Supreme <b>self.</b> In Genitive case, it means that Individual <b>self</b> does not own anything as everything belongs to Supreme <b>self.</b> The individual <b>self</b> itself belongs to Supreme <b>self.</b> In Locative case it means the Individual <b>self</b> is located in Supreme <b>self</b> and thus always seeking support for the very existence. Thus in every which way, the eternal dependence is indicated.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of <b>self</b> awareness and private <b>self</b> consciousness on <b>self</b> evaluation. Sixty female undergraduate students completed the private <b>self</b> consciousness subscale developed by Fenigstein et al. i (1973) ? They were then randomly assigned to either the high (N= 30) or low (N= 30) <b>self</b> awareness treatment conditions. Those placed in the high <b>self</b> awareness condition listened to their own taperecorded voices which was intended to increase <b>self</b> awareness. The remainder listened to another's taperecorded voice which was intended to decrease <b>self</b> awareness. All subjects first completed the ideal <b>self</b> evaluation form consisting of 20 randomly arranged bipolar adjective dimensions. Then, depending on the <b>self</b> awareness condition, subjects either listened to their own taperecorded voices or another's voice while completing the real <b>self</b> evaluation form consisting of the Same 20 items. The absolute difference scores between the two <b>self</b> evaluation forms were used as an index of the intensity of <b>self</b> evaluation. <b>Self</b> awareness significantly increased the intensity of <b>self</b> evaluation. This effect was especially noted on initial,items: 1, 2, 3 and 7 i providing further evidence that the effect of listening to one's own voice diminishes quickly as originally observed by Ickes et al., (1973). Private <b>self</b> consciousness did not have a significant overall effect, but a post hoc analysis using subjects scoring in the extremes of this subscale showed that subjects scoring higher in private <b>self</b> consciousness exhibited more intense <b>self</b> evaluation. The present findings offer tentative support for the existence of two factors of awareness which affect <b>self</b> evaluation. One, <b>self</b> awareness as a state of the individual, was indicated by a temporary increase in intense <b>self</b> evaluation. The other, private <b>self</b> consciousness as a trait of the individual, was indicated by a consistent intense effect on <b>self</b> evaluation...|$|R

50|$|Macrostomum hystrix {{is capable}} of {{hypodermic}} insemination. In this process sperm is injected through the epidermis into the parenchyma of the mating partner. This is done by a needle-like stylet, which is the male copulatory organ. The stylet has a rigid and pointed distal thickening {{as well as a}} subterminal stylet opening which can puncture the epidermis of the mating partner. The sperm are highly motile, small and simple but have no flagellates. The female antrum shows a simple anatomy and is only involved in laying eggs.In isolated worms {{it has been shown that}} Macrostomum hystrix does not only use hypodermic insemination for outbreeding but also self-fertilization, also known as <b>selfing.</b> By this they inject their own sperm mainly into their head due to physical constraints. From there the sperm apparently migrate to the site of fertilization. Worms that were isolated showed significantly more sperm in their head compared to worms that had the opportunity to cross fertilize. Macrostomum hystrix prefers outbreeding if partners are available because <b>selfing</b> also has costs. The amount of offspring of worms that selfed is reduced as well as the offspring's survival. As a consequence Macrostomum hystrix shows delayed <b>selfing.</b> It only starts <b>selfing</b> in the extended absence of mating partners and after a considerable delay, so delayed <b>selfing</b> represents a conditional reproductive strategy which allows them to deal with periodic conditions of low mate abundance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>self</b> {{has come}} under {{considerable}} attack in postmodern times. Amidst many deconstructions and re-formulations of the <b>self,</b> various myths of <b>self</b> have lost their sustainability. This paper reviews {{a number of different}} theoretical perspectives on the <b>self</b> along with many postmodern challenges to the <b>self.</b> It is proposed that the <b>self</b> is a socially constructed entity which can be conceptualized from a variety of perspectives. We also propose that not all myths of <b>self</b> are equal. In particular, premodern and modern myths of <b>self</b> are inadequate for postmodern times. Building from an existential-integrative perspective, we propose Schneider’s (1990) paradoxical <b>self</b> as a promising myth of <b>self</b> for postmodern times. The <b>self</b> maintained a secure, even sacred place throughout the history of Western thought. Despite widespread disagreement about what constituted the <b>self</b> and the essential nature of the <b>self,</b> few questioned its existence. Contemporary times challenged this privileged place of the <b>self.</b> Technology and pluralism brought metaphors of multiple <b>selves.</b> Postmodern analyses quickly followed questioning whether a singular, essential <b>self</b> was a healthy construction. The influence of Eastern thought, in particularly Buddhist philosophy, introduced the ideal of no-self. Cultural analyses provided examples of cultures which did not have a conception of the <b>self.</b> In the end, the necessity of a <b>self</b> conception, so basic to Western psychology, is now in question...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Self-esteem as {{the affective}} {{component}} of self-concept {{refers to a}} person’s sense of value and worth, his sense of competence and adequacy and his sense of <b>self</b> satisfaction. It is the personal judgment of worthiness that is expressed in the attitude the individuals hold towards themselves. Some synonyms of <b>self</b> esteem include <b>self</b> respect, <b>self</b> worth, <b>self</b> regard <b>self</b> acceptance, <b>self</b> satisfaction, <b>self</b> confidence and <b>self</b> love. <b>Self</b> esteem is restricted more to the affective dimension of the <b>self</b> concept.

50|$|Many traits {{involving}} mating patterns (e.g., outcrossing or <b>selfing)</b> {{and life}} history strategies (e.g., annual or perennial) are inherently linked.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to tease apart the two potential causes of inbreeding, and attributed the observed inbreeding to one cause or the other. Therefore, just as with the mixed mating model, in the effective <b>selfing</b> model there is only one parameter to be estimated. However this parameter, termed the effective <b>selfing</b> rate, is often a more accurate measure of the proportion of self-fertilisation than the corresponding parameter in the mixed mating model.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, {{we discuss}} motivational-primacy {{research}} {{as a framework}} for contemplating when egoism can be transcended. Our research examines which of three fundamental forms of self-definition—the individual <b>self</b> (i. e., <b>self</b> as a unique and independent social agent), the relational <b>self</b> (i. e., <b>self</b> as an interconnected partner in an interpersonal relationship), and the collective <b>self</b> (i. e., <b>self</b> as an undifferentiated and interchangeable member of a group) —is experientially more essential; psychologically the home base; or, alternatively, motivationally primary. Stated metaphorically, we ask which <b>self</b> smiles brighter when enhanced and screams louder when threatened. As we discuss in this chapter, data from several studies evidence a motivational hierarchy with the individual <b>self</b> elevated above the other two <b>selves,</b> and the relational <b>self</b> elevated above the collective <b>self.</b> In the context of that hierarchy, a quieter ego can be conceptualized as a self-system in which the motivational striving of the individual <b>self</b> is deemphasized and brought into balance with the strivings of the other <b>selves.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the direct and indirect role of <b>self</b> esteem and procrastination in the relation between fear of failure and <b>self</b> worth. The participants were 279 students who study different major fields at the Faculty of Education in Pamukkale University. Age range varied from 19 to 34. In this study, Tuckman Procrastination Inventory, Rosenberg <b>Self</b> Esteem Inventory, Activate and Success Based <b>Self</b> Worth Scale, Concern over Mistakes Scale and Personal Information Sheet were used to gather data. Results showed that procrastination had partial mediating effect in relation to fear of failure; performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability. In other words, the effect of fear of failure on the performance based <b>self</b> worth and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability was decreased when procrastination was added the equation. The results also showed that <b>self</b> esteem had partial mediating role in relation to fear of failure-procrastination, fear of failure- performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability. In other words, the effect of fear of failure on the procrastination, performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability was reduced, when <b>self</b> esteem was added the equation. Finally, results showed that <b>self</b> esteem had full mediating role in the relation to procrastination; performance based <b>self</b> worth, and <b>self</b> worth vulnerability.
