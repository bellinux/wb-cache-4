40|$|Sweden has {{obligatory}} {{sickness and}} disability insurance {{which is both}} financed (from payroll taxes) and administrated by the government. In order to receive sickness benefits, insured individuals must have certificates issued by a medical doctor. Since health care is administrated at the county level, this means that monitoring is, to some extent, decentralized at a lower jurisdictional level than the funding and governance of the insurance. This paper studies one consequence of such decentralization: the effet on individual sickness absence when such certificates are not approved be the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Agency</b> (SIA) and are instead re-remitted to the doctor completion and, potential, reapproval by the SIA. We find that this re-remission increases the length of sickness absence spells {{by an average of}} 30 percent. A suggestive test of the reason for the observed effect indicates that it is due to a decrease in health caused by increased stress related to the uncertainty about entitlement and future sickness benefits. Given that added resorces improve the quality of the patients' medical certificates, directed intergovernmental grants from the state to the counties would be cost saving...|$|E

The theoretical part of the thesis {{deals with the}} history and the present system, as well as the legislative changes in individual years.

Furthermore, there is an analysis of the indicators of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance,</b> mainly temporary incapacity for work, which shows that despite the reduction of the average length of one case, the average percentage of incapacity for work is increasing.

25|$|Pupils, {{students}} {{and children in}} kindergartens were incorporated into the accident insurance scheme, which benefited 11 million children. Free medical checkups were introduced that same year, while the Farmers' <b>Sickness</b> <b>Insurance</b> Law (1972) introduced compulsory <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> for independent farmers, family workers in agriculture, and pensioners under the farmers' pension scheme, medical benefits for all covered groups, and cash benefits for family workers under compulsory coverage for pension insurance.

This law also introduced a new type of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease.

The twentieth century has witnessed an {{increased emphasis on}} the part of nations to provide protection for its workers. One form of protection that has come to be regarded as necessary and desirable is that of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance.</b> This type of insurance would provide partial wage-loss compensation for specified periods to workers who cannot perform their regular work because of non-occupational illness or injury. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to describe and evaluate from an economic viewpoint the state <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> programs that have recently been legislated in the United States. State <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> laws represent a relatively new field of legislation in the United States. In Europe, compulsory health insurance, which included not only compensation for wage-loss but medical care as well, was first legislated about half a century prior to <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> legislation in the United States.

40|$|The {{area of a}} <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance,</b> I {{have chosen}} for my diploma thesis, is not only {{important}} for me {{in terms of my}} working life, but as well as for my private life, because a temporary working incapacity and a title for <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits accompanies a life of each of us, either directly in our family circle or among friends or colleagues. The working incapacity, as a social event, is familiar to all of us. Someone meets it more often, someone less often, however it always influences our private as well as working life from a financial perspective, it has an impact on our working duties and it strikes our family groove. At the same time it has a very human dimension, since it concerns the most valuable we have ? it is our health. It deepens solidarity among people, mutual support and empathy. I have chosen the above topic also for the reason that I had already been working {{in the area of the}} <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> for five years. I am interested whether there have been met the main objectives from the new legislation especially in terms of savings in financial means, a decrease of a number of temporary incapacities and a prevention of a misusage of the temporary working incapacities. The main aim of this thesis is to analyze individual areas of an implementation of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> and on the basis of obtained results and statistical data to evaluate whether the main objectives of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> legislation from January 1 st, 2009 in the region of Jindřichův Hradec were met. Three hypotheses were presented in the thesis. The first premise said that with the effectiveness of this law financial means had spent on the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits had been saved. The second premise was a decrease of the temporary incapacities and the third proven one was the meeting of the main objectives of the legislation in the whole implementation range of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> in the region of Jindřichův Hradec. Two research methods were chosen; an analysis of documents, a technique of a secondary analysis and a content analysis. The second method was a semi-structured interview with professionals in the area of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance.</b> Defined hypotheses were confirmed by the carried out research. Financial means spent on the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits were saved very dramatically already in the first half of the effectiveness of this law and the number of temporary incapacities decreased by one third of cases in that period. The third hypothesis was also confirmed by both chosen research methods and defined objectives of the new legislation were met in the region of Jindřichův Hradec. The defined aims of the diploma thesis were achieved, hypotheses were verified, there were mentioned important remarks and changes and provisions, which would lead to another streamlining of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> system, were proposed.

40|$|Purpose: This article {{analyses}} Swedish rehabilitation professionals’ {{perspectives on}} how changed <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> regulations will affect their practice and cooperation, {{with a special}} focus on work ability assessments. Method: Two groups of representatives (n= 15) from different organizations involved in rehabilitation and return-towork met 7 times to discuss their practice from a cooperation perspective. The groups worked with a tutor according to a problem-based methodology to discuss how their practice is influenced by new structures for cooperation. The material was analysed inductively using qualitative content analysis. Results: The results show that work ability assessments are often made without considering work characteristics. Officials at the Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Agency</b> do not consider themselves competent in assessing work ability. The basis for decisions of eligibility for sickness benefits is thus weak, which is troublesome from a legal perspective. The officials do not cooperate with employers or occupational health services in work ability assessments. Conclusions: Recent policy changes calls for comprehensive cooperation between the insurance system, health care, employment services and employers. This study shows that there are flaws in this cooperation. The design {{of the system is}} in conflict with the policy ambition of increasing return-to-work, because it disregards employers as cooperation partners.
