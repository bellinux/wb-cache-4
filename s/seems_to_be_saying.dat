25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E
500|$|His message {{late in life}} is {{contrary}} to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that violence is innate in man, [...] "forged in the substance of what, since Freud, we have called the id." [...] Hughes believed that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of Goya's dog, [...] "whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "one of the most dismally unfunny episodes ever, lifted only by the brief {{appearance}} of a talking camel and Homer's clever way of getting Cooder and Spud out of his home. Whereas most of the series' politically incorrect moments are funny and well-observed, this episode <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that fairground folk and travelers really are deeply unpleasant criminals who are both irredeemable and unworthy of help. Nasty-taste-in-the-mouth time." [...] Despite the negative review from I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as [...] "brilliant", and highlighted it along with episodes [...] "The Trouble with Trillions" [...] and [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] {{and it has been}} described by the other Simpsons writers in the DVD audio commentary as [...] "criminally underrated".|$|E
6000|$|Soames smiled. 'Do {{you really}} think I shall admit that I'm not their equal'; he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> 'or that I've got to give up anything, {{especially}} life?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where have I {{heard that}} song before?" [...] he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> himself, [...] "the old {{familiar}} language {{they used to}} talk to me when I was young?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{people of}} Gibraltar was overjoyed at having an {{indigenous}} Bishop; Rome <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that the Colony <b>was</b> mature enough <b>to</b> {{have one of}} its own to govern spiritually." ...|$|R
2500|$|Now there's a {{weird thing}} going on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens. He is saying, somehow he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> {{it is wrong to}} look at history, it is wrong to {{look at the history of}} the past century. You don't have to exonerate the appalling deeds of Osama bin Laden and his associates, if it be Osama bin Laden, to say who brought this down, who contributed to this, a number of factors. We have to look at history. For someone like Hitchens to attack Chomsky, as he's done in The Nation, saying he is somehow 'soft' on fascism because [...] tries to read history is an outrage – an absolute outrage.|$|E
2500|$|He {{followed}} this {{up with the}} sequel to The Born Losers, Billy Jack, in 1971. American International Pictures initially agreed to distribute the picture but after viewing it the studio refused to release the film unless many of the political references – as well as frontal nudity – were cut. This led the Laughlins to withhold the sound reels of the movie, which in effect made it a silent film. Eventually, Laughlin made a distribution deal with Warner Bros. but he disapproved of the studio's marketing of the film, sued Warners, and re-released the picture himself. The movie's re-release was successful but controversial. Roger Ebert, in his review of the film, wrote, [...] "Billy Jack <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that a gun {{is better than a}} constitution in the enforcement of justice. Is democracy totally obsolete, then? Is our only hope that the good fascists defeat the bad fascists?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, King {{returned}} to his alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono, to teach for {{a year as a}} gesture of gratitude for the education he had received there. During this time his family rented a house on a busy road in Orrington. The road claimed the lives of a number of pets, and the neighborhood children had created a pet cemetery in a field near the Kings' home. King's daughter Naomi buried her cat [...] "Smucky" [...] there after it was hit, and shortly thereafter their son Owen had a close call running toward the road. King wrote the novel based on their experiences, but feeling he had gone too far with {{the subject matter of the}} book, he discarded the idea of having it published, particularly since both his wife Tabitha and friend Peter Straub agreed Pet Sematary was too dark and unenjoyable. However, needing a final book for his contract King reluctantly submitted it to Doubleday on the advice of his wife Tabitha. The subsequent success of the book made King note how both Americans and British readers liked it despite him considering Pet Sematary too bleak in how [...] "it just spirals down into darkness. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that nothing works and nothing is worth it, and I don’t really believe that.” ...|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{approached}} us presently with outstretched hand. His manner {{was half}} apologetic, half triumphant. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> himself that Isobel's reception of him must surely have opened our eyes.|$|R
6000|$|His {{physical}} power all dribbled and gone, {{the sick}} man replied not by voice or by gesture; but, with feeble dumb-show of his face, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Pray leave me; who was ever cured by talk?" ...|$|R
5000|$|However, Lewis {{continued}} {{to feel the}} pain of inadequacy. She recalls, [...] "On T.V., all of the commercials were white. In the magazines you saw white. All the models <b>were</b> white. Everything <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> 'white <b>is</b> right'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something," [...] the {{daughter}} suggested in general terms. [...] "What is she saying?" [...] {{she asked the}} colored girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} she's like the women we know. She doesn't say witty things, and she hasn't their {{responsive}} quickness; but her ideas are her own, {{no matter how}} old they are; and what she says she <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> for the first time, and as if it had never been thought out before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{come back}} to that," [...] said Mr. Direck. [...] "I never met any one before who'd quite got that spirit as you have it. I wouldn't alter it. It's part of you. It's part of this place. It's what Mr. Britling always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> and never quite knowing he's said it. It's just as though {{all the things that}} are going on weren't the things that ought to be going on--but {{something}} else quite different. Somehow one falls into it. It's as if your daily life didn't matter, as if politics didn't matter, as if the King and the social round and business and all those things weren't anything really, and as though you felt there was something else--out of sight--round the corner--that you ought to be getting at. Well, I admit, that's got hold of me too. And it's all mixed up with my idea of you. I don't see that there's really a contradiction in it at all. I'm in love with you, all my heart's in love with you, what's the good of being shy about it? I'd just die for your littlest wish right here now, it's just as though I'd got love in my veins instead of blood, but that's not taking me away from that other thing. It's bringing me round to that other thing. I feel as if without you I wasn't up to anything at all, but with you--We'd not go settling down in a cottage or just touring about with a Baedeker Guide or anything of that kind. Not for long anyhow. We'd naturally settle down side by side and do ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Manson also {{hears the}} Beatles whispering: [...] "Charlie, Charlie, {{send us a}} telegram." [...] (See Honey Pie, above.) At {{approximately}} 3:45 of the recording, a voice that could be that of George Harrison does, in fact, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something about a telegram.|$|R
6000|$|Milt was stooping, looking under; <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something. When he came back, {{he did not}} speak. He {{wiped his}} forehead. [...] "Come. We'll climb back up. Nothing to do, now. Guess you better not try to help, anyway. You might not sleep well." ...|$|R
5000|$|Author Jeff Wiltse {{remarks that}} [...] "Hulen <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{that a black}} swimmer who had to walk past a whites-only pool {{to get to a}} truly equal Jim Crow pool would not be {{receiving}} equal treatment under the law, as mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 蜜 means nectar - sweet liquid - {{which may}} mean the sweet bliss that you reach after untangling the mess of your mind.haramitsu <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{that if you}} free your mind from life's clutter you will reach enlightenment.|$|E
5000|$|A second, incomplete, {{block of}} four lines {{appears to be}} {{addressed}} to Lycoris. So long as she likes his verses, Gallus <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> he can ignore any 'peer reviews' they might attract from critics such as Publius Valerius Cato and Viscus: ...|$|E
5000|$|Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+, {{focusing}} on the episode's social commentary. Handlen remarked, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something, only it isn’t really, but you still kind of care a little. And also there are robots." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a credit}} <b>to</b> your mother," [...] she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "you're a nice comfort to any one's old age, you are, making a row like that. And {{look at your}} ears {{flopping}} all over your face. I don't know where you pick up such ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't understand,' said Agravaine. 'I don't want <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{anything}} that might be interpreted as in the least derogatory to your father in any way whatever, but without prejudice, surely he is just a plain, ordinary brigand? I mean it's only a question of a ransom? And I don't in the least object--' ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl went to {{the rail}} and gazed earnestly at the shore. There was an anxious {{expression}} on her face. She had the air of one who was {{waiting for someone to}} appear. Her demeanour was that of Mariana at the Moated Grange. [...] "He cometh not!" [...] she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> She glanced at her wrist-watch, then scanned the dock once more.|$|R
5000|$|Biographer Brian Hinton {{comments}} [...] "'Enlightenment' {{is actually}} {{the opposite of what}} it sounds: it is full of doubt, not affirmation. 'I'm meditating and still I'm suffering.' He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> everything is a state of mind, you can choose to live in heaven or hell." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{also saw}} {{the message of the}} film as self-contradictory, writing: [...] "I'm also {{somewhat}} disturbed by the central theme of the movie. 'Billy Jack' <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> the same thing as 'Born Losers,' that a gun is better than a constitution in the enforcement of justice." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} then arises {{of the possibility}} of reconciling externalism with holism. The one <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that meanings are determined by the external relations (with society or the world), while the other suggests that meaning is determined by the relation of words (or beliefs) to all the other words (or beliefs). Frederik Stjernfelt identifies at least three possible ways to reconcile them and then points out some objections.|$|E
6000|$|The pug-dog sat up, as a precautionary measure, as I passed; but, as I took {{no notice}} of the {{treasure}} he was guarding, he let me go by without even one remonstrant bark. [...] "He that takes my life," [...] he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> wheezily, <b>to</b> himself, [...] "takes trash: But he that takes the Daily Telegraph--!" [...] But this awful contingency I did not face.|$|R
60|$|And {{everybody}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{the same}} thing at the same time. The name of Sidney Wilton was in everybody's mouth. It was unfortunate that he {{had been a member of}} a defunct ministry, but then it had always been understood that he had always disapproved of all their measures. There was not the slightest evidence of this, but everybody chose to believe it.|$|R
6000|$|The old man muttered {{under his}} breath [...] "If only my sister were here!" [...] and looked helplessly at his son. His son looked at the five natives. The five natives looked at the Captain. The Captain looked at nobody: his eyes were cast down, and he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> softly <b>to</b> himself [...] "Contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure. I {{contemplate}} Myself!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Elaborating on {{the themes}} within the play Amitava Kumar {{writes in his}} review for The Guardian: [...] "Akhtar doesn't hold back {{when it comes to}} exposing the {{gathering}} greed of the jihadists as the pair and Bashir accumulate money, but...it seems to humanize them. Look they're not dogmatic hotheads, the play <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> They're just like us. Which, depending on your viewpoint improves your opinion of the jihadists or lowers it of the whole of humanity." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{theme of}} the novel, though not {{unrelated}} to the first, is 'the issue of resistance versus collaboration'. Beauvoir <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that to not actively resist the German occupation is in effect to accept it. This, argues David E. Cooper, is an illustration of an existentialist view {{of the nature of}} freedom, according to which an individual is just as responsible for not refusing something as for choosing it. Any distinction between choosing and not refusing is elided.|$|E
5000|$|His message {{late in life}} is {{contrary}} to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that violence is innate in man, [...] "forged in the substance of what, since Freud, we have called the id." [...] Hughes believed that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of Goya's dog, [...] "whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya." ...|$|E
6000|$|Was {{there ever}} such unconsciousness? He did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{think that he}} at all {{deserved}} a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> himself--"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{eight years}} of production, the film's initial release was stormy. Many people were upset {{by the idea that}} the villains in the story were not just the Nazis but their British collaborators. The film <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that fascism can rise {{anywhere}} under the right circumstances, and that people everywhere could fall under its spell. Research prior to the film from various Nazi-occupied territories (including the Channel Islands) suggested that this was indeed the case.|$|R
5000|$|Swift also {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} playing to stadiums, stating that [...] "the challenge with a stadium show is making those people in the very top row feel like they got an intimate, personal experience." [...] The following month {{in an interview with}} KIIS-FM, she revealed that she knew what the stage would look like, as well as knowing that [...] "all the fans <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that they really don't want any song 1989 left off the setlist".|$|R
