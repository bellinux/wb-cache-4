5000|$|United States {{participation}} in the minesweeping effort was overseen by Rear Admiral Strauss aboard the repair ship Blackhawk from which he had commanded the minelaying operation. Tugs [...] and [...] towed Admiralty wooden sailing smacks Red Rose and Red Fern out to conduct the first trial sweep in December. Sweeping was accomplished by suspending a <b>serrated</b> <b>wire</b> between two ships on a parallel course. While held underwater by planing devices called [...] "kites", the wire would foul the cables suspending the buoyant mines above their anchors. If the <b>serrated</b> <b>wire</b> parted the mine mooring cable, the mine would bob to the surface to be destroyed by gunfire. The smacks swept and destroyed six mines before winter weather halted further work at sea. The winter was spent testing an electrical protective device {{to reduce the risk}} of sweeping the antenna mines with steel-hulled ships. Patapsco and Patuxent tested the protective device by sweeping 39 mines in March. [...] Royal Navy minesweeping efforts involved 421 vessels manned by 600 officers and 15,000 men from 1 April to 30 November 1919.|$|E

The shape, length, diameter, and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used. A later version of the card clothing product developed during {{the latter half of}} the 19th century and found only on commercial carding machines, whereby a single piece of <b>serrated</b> <b>wire</b> was wrapped around a roller, became known as metallic card clothing.|$|E
