Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> brought him home to her apartment.

5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

500|$|Fiennes {{was cast}} as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his {{performances}} in [...] and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that [...] "I saw sexual evil. It {{is all about}} subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold." [...] Fiennes put on [...] to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said [...] "I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to." [...] Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the Université libre de Bruxelles describe Göth's character in the film as a classic psychopath. Fiennes looked so much like Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg (a survivor of the events) met him, she trembled with fear.|$|E
500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us {{all the time in the}} front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

500|$|Labor campaigned {{under the}} slogan [...] "It's Time", {{an echo of}} Menzies' {{successful}} 1949 slogan, [...] "It's Time for a Change". Surveys showed that even Liberal voters approved of the Labor slogan. Whitlam pledged an end to conscription {{and the release of}} individuals who had refused the draft; an income tax surcharge to pay for universal health insurance; free dental care for students; and renovation of aging urban infrastructure. The party pledged to eliminate university tuition fees and establish a schools commission to evaluate educational needs. The party benefited from the support of the proprietor of News Limited, Rupert Murdoch, who preferred Whitlam over McMahon. Labor was so dominant in the campaign that some of Whitlam's advisers urged him to stop joking about McMahon; people were feeling <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> The election saw the ALP increase its tally by 12seats, mostly in suburban Sydney and Melbourne, for a majority of nine in the House of Representatives. [...] The ALP gained little beyond the suburban belts, however, losing a seat in South Australia and two in Western Australia.|$|E
500|$|... {{published}} in 2011, expands {{on the original}} story with a short episode told from Gin's perspective. When Hotaru is a teenager, she shares some pudding with Gin before she leaves {{at the end of}} the summer. After Hotaru leaves, the yōkai attempt to cheer Gin up by bringing him a couple of persimmons, one of the most prized treats on the mountain. Impressed with the taste, Gin thinks of sharing one of these persimmons with Hotaru next year. After discussing ways to preserve the persimmon with the yōkai and a spirit named Matsumino, Gin sets off to find ice on the highest mountain peak, but is disappointed to find none during the summer. When Gin returns scratched up from his fruitless search for ice, Matsumino feels <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and offers to deliver the persimmon to Hotaru for him. However, not knowing where she lives, Matsumino gets lost and grows hungry. After he returns from his unsuccessful attempt to find Hotaru, Matsumino apologizes to Gin for eating the persimmon and Gin forgives him. The story concludes with Gin seeing Hotaru the following summer and wondering if he will be able to tell her about his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Steiger starred as {{a detective}} {{assigned}} {{to investigate the}} murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst (Roger Moore), a man whom he detests from a previous case, in Bryan Forbes's The Naked Face. Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune referred to it as a [...] "wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [...] doesn't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it", and considered Steiger to be [...] "acting in his high hysteria gear", who [...] "snarls and whines and overacts". Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini-series The Glory Boys (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and Hollywood Wives (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of The Glory Boys. Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins [...] "so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking" [...] that he felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film. Steiger also performed on Joni Mitchell's 1985 album Dog Eat Dog, where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song [...] "Tax Free".|$|E

500|$|After {{the end of}} the Lord's Test, Miller {{attended}} a concert and party, before returning to the team hotel after dawn the next morning, just before breakfast. Bradman noticed this and addressed him as [...] "Keith", rather than his nickname [...] "Nugget". Australia was due to play Surrey at The Oval on the same day. Bradman won the toss and elected to field. Instead of deploying him to his usual slips position, the Australian skipper sent Miller to field on the fine leg boundary as a punishment for his late night out. Between overs, the banished player had to walk to {{the opposite end of the}} ground to be in position for the bowler from the other end. One of the spectators felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and lent his bicycle, which the Australian used to cycle around the edge of the ground between overs. Soon after, Bradman brought his all rounder into a fielding position closer to the centre. Miller eventually scored nine in his only innings and was asked to bowl just one over in the second innings, as Australia completed victory by ten wickets. He had a quiet period on the field during July; his cricket generated fewer media stories than his celebrity appearances at social functions and classical music concerts during this time. The match against Surrey was immediately followed by a match against Gloucestershire in Bristol, where Miller scored 51, featuring in a partnership of 136 with Morris (290). Australia piled on 7/774 declared, its largest score of the season, before proceeding to victory by an innings and 363 runs. Acting captain Hassett allowed Miller to rest and he did not bowl during the match.|$|E
500|$|Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison all later {{stated that}} they regretted {{the manner in which}} Best was sacked. Lennon {{admitted}} that [...] "we were cowards when we sacked him. We made Brian do it." [...] McCartney stated: [...] "I do feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> because of what he could have been on to." [...] Harrison said: [...] "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go," [...] and [...] "Historically it may look like we did something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better." [...] Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: [...] "I never felt sorry … I was not involved." [...] In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies wrote: [...] "But for the sake of Pete's career, whatever happened to the Beatles afterward, the handling and especially the announcing of the sacking might have been done more neatly and cleanly. He could have been fixed up with a job in another group before the news was announced." [...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out. It was the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power." ...|$|E
500|$|Konami {{video game}} {{developer}} Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating [...] "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka {{did not have}} shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that {{turned him into a}} sadistic clown that you felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't 'evil for evil's sake.' There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you could feel it... but you also knew there wasn't any good in there." [...] That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him. In a review of Final Fantasy VI Advance, IGN stated [...] "it's the game's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out. The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise, Kefka's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed." [...] IGN also noted his ability to [...] "tap into primal, instinctive fears", including fears of clowns. CNet in their own review described him as [...] "the unrivaled star of the show...he's the kind of villain that you will love to hate", comparing him to Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game. Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time, and attempted to explain players' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted, the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater. GameSpy compared Kefka's final form as a representation of Lucifer, highlighted by his powerful [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] attack. Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka {{stems from the fact that}} he is one of the few villains in Final Fantasy, or any game, that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated.|$|E
