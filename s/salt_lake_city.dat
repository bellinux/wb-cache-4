5|$|From Springville {{north to}} <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City,</b> US-89 parallels—and for a {{distance}} overlaps—Interstate 15, following the old Arrowhead Trail, once {{the main highway}} from <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> to Los Angeles, {{through a number of}} downtowns. Numerous state highways connect US-89 to I-15, including SR-77 in Springville, SR-114 in Provo, SR-52 in Orem, SR-180 and SR-145 in American Fork, and SR-73 in Lehi. In Provo, US-89 meets US-189, its only branch, which heads northeast through Provo Canyon to Heber City, connecting to I-80 and bypassing <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City.</b> North of Lehi, US-89 merges with I-15 (at exit 282), which has been built on or near the old road through a gap in the Traverse Mountains (elevation 4800 feet/1500 m) into the Salt Lake Valley. The routes split in Draper, formerly with a direct interchange north of SR-71, but US-89 traffic must now exit at SR-71 (exit 291), turn east to Factory Outlet Drive, and follow this frontage road to the location of the former split. From here all the way to downtown <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City,</b> US-89 is marked along State Street, a major northsouth street that ends at the Utah State Capitol. After passing through Sandy, Midvale, Murray, Millcreek Township, and South Salt Lake, State Street enters <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> at the intersection with SR-201 (2100 South).|$|E

5|$|I-80 {{follows the}} routes {{of two major}} auto trails through the state. In western Utah, I-80 follows the {{historical}} route of the Victory Highway from Wendover at the Nevada state line to the junction of US-40 near Park City. Throughout Utah, I-80 is signed as the modern route of the Lincoln Highwayexcept through <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City,</b> where the Lincoln Highway is routed along State Route 201 and Parley's Way. The route of the Lincoln Highway across Utah was generally derived from {{the route of the}} Pony Express and the Central Overland Route. However, much of the original route of the Lincoln Highway west of <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> is inaccessible. The original route of the Lincoln Highway proceeded southwest from Tooele towards Ely, Nevada. This area is now used for military bases, such as the Dugway Proving Ground and Tooele Army Depot. The area was closed to the public when these bases were established. I-80 and US-93 are the modern signing of the Lincoln Highway between those two cities. East of <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City,</b> I-80 closely parallels the original route of the Lincoln Highway.|$|E

They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City.</b> Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>City.</b> While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
