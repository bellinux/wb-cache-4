5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> serious blemish {{on a beautiful}} poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or {{that it is a}} statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} criticized {{element of the}} film is its ending. The film has a more traditional [...] "happy ending" [...] which contradicts the tone {{of the rest of the}} picture.**Vest. pgs. 134–5* This has led to speculation that this ending is the product of John's imagination, caused by hallucinations from his forced coma after he is incarcerated. As one observer mused, [...] "The conclusion of Minority Report <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> joke Spielberg played on his detractors—an act of perfectly measured deviltry." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1933 film My Weakness had {{previously}} {{used the word}} [...] "gay" [...] as an overt descriptor of homosexuality; one of two men pining away for the same woman suddenly suggests a solution to their mutual problem: [...] "Let's be gay!" [...] However, the Studio Relations Committee censors decreed that the line was too risqué {{and had to be}} muffled. [...] The 1934 film This Side of Heaven included a scene in which a fussy, gossipy interior decorator tries to sell a floral fabric pattern to a customer, who knowingly replies, [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bit too gay." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE [preoccupied and serious] I've hardly {{spoken to}} him. He doesn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{particularly}} able person.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very natural! I {{must see}} him. From {{what you said}} already, he doesn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fool. Well, I don't think you need worry too much, Mr. Ormesby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conversationalist," [...] {{said the}} lady who was cousin to a baronet; [...] "but he did pass the {{vegetables}} before he helped himself. A little thing like that shows breeding." ...|$|R
500|$|Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe {{noted that}} the buildup to the finale added intrigue {{at the cost of}} cliche. John Levesque of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said [...] "the whole six-episode arc <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> B or B-minus effort that got bogged down in one {{character}} and gave us all-too-familiar subplots that were lacking in imagination." [...] Phil Rosenthal of the Chicago Sun-Times described the arc as a [...] "lingering exit". Associated Press Television critic Frazier Moore found the entire story arc to be [...] "a dramatic and fitting farewell for the character - and a proud performance by Smits". The Buffalo News describes the arc as [...] "a brilliant five-episode story line".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do. At this point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E
6000|$|... "Four. I can't say they're crowded; but, while we're liberal-minded on many points, the flocks won't mix. <b>Strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am. It's hard {{to behave}} like a gentleman where your {{interest}} is vitally concerned. And Lapham doesn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man who's {{in the habit of}} acting from the best in him always." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At the studio, is he? Well, I shouldn't {{wonder if}} he wasn't better off. 'E didn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man what was used to the ways of society. He's happier where he is, I expect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't," [...] he promised, [...] "but I don't {{suppose it}} would matter much to Miss Oliver if I did. She did not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young lady who would worry {{very much about}} other people's opinions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say," [...] said Rangely, as {{they drove}} away, [...] "he <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> remarkably sound chap, Miss Flint. There is {{something}} unusual about him, something clean cut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a fine idea," [...] I said, [...] "but it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> large order all the same. The moon! I'd {{much rather}} try some smaller things first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} an {{extraordinary}} power of abstracting your mind," [...] Bernard said to her, observing it. [...] "Studying philosophy at the Baden Kursaal <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> real intellectual feat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} {{ought to}} be cheerful, you ask a great deal if you are not. To the pleasure of marrying a brilliant young man, you add that of having your own way; you <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very lucky young lady!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} you mean," [...] he cried, [...] "but you mustn't put too much trust in your ingenuity. You don't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very ingenious person, Mr. Heyst. Neither am I. My talents lie another way. But Martin--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather {{think it}} would be better to let him out, our chances on the high seas being at least as good as his own. I am no friend to blockades, which <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> un-English mode of {{carrying}} on a war." ...|$|R
6000|$|Malloring flushed. [...] "Now, look here, Freeland," [...] he said, [...] "forgive my saying so, {{but this}} <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bit cynical. D'you think I enjoy {{trying to keep}} things straight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] Harding asked. [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{very curious}} boast. Improving the occasion's a riling thing, {{but there was}} never a slave in Dixie tighter bound than you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bottles," [...] {{reported}} Edgar, {{pulling up}} {{a board of}} the lid. [...] "One of the cure-everything tonics, according to the labels. It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> curious place to leave it in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{trust it}} will be the advance, as Malbone does not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man likely to retreat very easily. But, are we certain 'Squire Newcome will grant the warrant he will ask for, being in such close communion himself with these squatters?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord John {{appeared}} to feel, on this, that he mustn't too easily, in honour, abandon {{a person who}} had presented herself to him <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ally. [...] "Ah, you <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little hard on her. Your father himself--in his looser moments!--takes pleasure in what she says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;" [...] (Edmund {{tried hard}} to prevent his [...] "no" [...] from being too emphatic, and forced himself to go on thus) [...] "I do not suppose it is entirely your fault, {{but at the same}} time you do not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person likely to make friends easily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] Harding asked. [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{very curious}} boast. Improving the occasion's a riling thing, {{but there was}} never a slave in the world tighter bound than you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it doesn't {{they will}} be abominably ungrateful; but {{although}} we are not conventional, the request <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> liberty," [...] I said, noticing that her sister did not seem wholly pleased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. He <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{bit of an}} adventurer, but so are {{the rest}} of them, and he's none the worse for that. Trying {{to get ahead of}} dago {{politicians}} is a risky job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] {{agreed the}} banker. [...] "The parish, I believe, {{is in good}} running order--I do not {{think you will see}} the {{necessity}} for many--ahem--changes. But we sadly needed an executive head. And, if I may say so, Mr. Hodder, you <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man of that type, who might have made a success in a business career." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fool," [...] {{interrupted}} Kells. His {{voice was}} suave, smooth, persuasive, cool. What strength--what certainty appeared behind it! [...] "It's not my habit {{to argue with}} fools. Take the chance I offer you. Hit the trail. Life is precious, man!... You've no chance here. And what's one girl more or less to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marple and his acquaintances are not {{the people}} one would have {{expected}} Clarence to associate with," [...] he continued. [...] "Still, in my opinion, he's doing worse in making a friend of that fellow Batley. I could never understand the connection--the man <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adventurer. Has he spent much time here since I've been away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{follow my}} leader. The loungers about the Sachem weren't civil to me; said {{unpleasant}} things about my appearance and my English clothes. To {{help to make}} them abstainers <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> happy thought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try some of that," [...] he said, {{indicating}} the light flapjacks fizzling among the pork in the frying-pan. [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal more}} tempting than the stuff you have been eating." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Daddy, this <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> most immoral game," [...] {{said the}} Lady, {{who had been}} a {{sympathetic}} spectator from a corner, doubtful of the ginger-ale, horrified at the pipe, and delighted at the complete absorption of the children.|$|E
30|$|The {{translation}} ‘these two’ {{would be}} possible <b>as</b> well, but <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> maybe <b>a</b> little too emphatic.|$|R
5000|$|... ‘Feeling Fine’ {{hears the}} Scottish lad skilfully {{manoeuvre}} around the verses in a falsetto, recalling the tenderness of his ballad ‘There Goes My Heart’. Much like my impressions of Girls Aloud‘s ‘Crocodile Tears’, ‘Feeling Fine’ didn’t <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential until I {{woke up one}} morning with its chorus ringing in my head. Ta-dah! We have another slow-revealing Xenomania pop gem at hand. - Feed Limmy ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had hoped," [...] said Thuvia, [...] "that {{we might}} find an asylum with these fair-skinned people. Notwithstanding their valour upon the field of battle, they did not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ferocious or warlike people. I had been about {{to suggest that we}} seek {{entrance}} to the city, but now I scarce know if I care to venture among people whose dead vanish into thin air." ...|$|R
