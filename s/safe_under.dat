5|$|Bacteria {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} mainly consist {{of different types of}} fecal coliforms, {{with a high level of}} E. coli bacteria. This comes from pet waste, fertilizer, manure, and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek, raising the average bacteria level 34percent higher than levels declared <b>safe</b> <b>under</b> California law. This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek's mouth, violating state swimming standards 99percent of the time, especially during storm events, as beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72hours (3days) after a major storm event.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} <b>safe</b> <b>under</b> {{the protection}} of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E
5|$|One {{shrimp boat}} was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found <b>safe</b> <b>under</b> a bridge abutment.|$|E

During the night of 10–11 August, the Arab inhabitants of Simele joined the looting. The Assyrian villagers could only watch as their Arab neighbours drove their flocks before them.|$|E

2500|$|A Class 1 laser is <b>safe</b> <b>under</b> all {{conditions}} of normal use. This means the {{maximum permissible exposure}} (MPE) cannot be exceeded when viewing a laser {{with the naked eye}} or with the aid of typical magnifying optics (e.g. telescope or microscope). [...] To verify compliance, the standard specifies the aperture and distance corresponding to the naked eye, a typical telescope viewing a collimated beam, and a typical microscope viewing a divergent beam. [...] It is important to realize that certain lasers classified as Class1 may still pose a hazard when viewed with a telescope or microscope of sufficiently large aperture. [...] For example, a high-power laser with a very large collimated beam or very highly divergent beam may be classified as Class1 if the power that passes through the apertures defined in the standard is less than the AEL for Class1; however, an unsafe power level may be collected by a magnifying optic with larger aperture.|$|E
