50|$|In {{interior}} decoration, {{the tips}} of the bristles of a <b>stippling</b> <b>brush</b> are dabbed onto a freshly painted wall or surface to create a subtle design in the paint. The paint hit by the points is displaced and leaves only a thin dot of paint through which a lighter layer of colour underneath will show through.|$|E
50|$|Cream blushes {{usually come}} in a short, round container, much like a lip balm or solid perfume. These blushes are best suited for people with dry skin. Cream blush is {{typically}} blended using fingers or a <b>stippling</b> <b>brush.</b> Since {{the nature of the}} blush is a cream, it can be layered with a powder blush to improve longevity of use.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{works by}} Norman Rockwell in the {{collection}} include Russian Schoolroom and The Runaway. The museum’s collection also includes many pieces of art memorabilia and artifacts such as Norman Rockwell's first paint box, Maxfield Parrish’s <b>stippling</b> paint <b>brushes</b> and a plethora of photographic materials.|$|R
5000|$|The {{outlines}} of the design to be worked are often screen printed onto the fabric or can be transferred to plain fabric using modern transfer pens, containing water-soluble ink or air-soluble ink, using a lightbox and a permanent pen, or iron-on designs applied using transfer sheets. The old-fashioned [...] "pinprick and chalk" [...] or [...] "prick and pounce" [...] methods also work well. The prick and pounce method involves transferring the design outlines - printed on paper - by pricking the outline with a needle to produce perforations along the lines. Powdered chalk or pounce material is then forced through the holes onto the fabric using a felt pad or <b>stipple</b> <b>brush</b> in order to replicate the design on the material.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} decade, DeMartis’ style acquired a certain lightness, with numerous treatments of landscape: “The impressionistic, lighter-toned treatments of Maine countryside and seaside {{in the late}} 1960’s demonstrated the artist’s movement toward movement. Instead of the frozen moment, timeless aspect of the Tuscan landscapes of the 50’s, the artist, in the next decade, translates the traditional subject matter of sailing ships and Maine coastline into kinetic dynamic compositions, lyrical with color and light.” [...] In the 1970s DeMartis began working largely on abstract painting, where “color and texture convey meaning and mood. DeMartis in the 70’s has a freer, lighter touch. His washes of color and <b>stipple</b> <b>brush</b> strokes belted in a broad ribbon of color that ‘frames out’ each composition are {{far removed from the}} heavily tooled, often overworked abstractions of the 50’s.” [...] A reviewer described DeMartis’ oil paintings in a 1974 show in {{the following}} terms: “Smoky grays and neutrals take on the bold colors of Chagall’s or Dufy’s palette to create these frozen moments that seem to melt upon scrutiny. Each of the paintings has a painted frame, as Seurat supplied.” ...|$|R
