Many {{of its products}} are own brands, {{with the number of}} other brands usually limited to a maximum of two for a given item. This increases sales for each article, and lets Aldi shops be smaller than stores with more brand choice. This practice let Aldi avoid price tags, even before the introduction of barcode scanners. On many of its own brands, if feasible, Aldi will place multiple barcodes on products to speed the check out process.|$|E

In garrison environment, the females are lodged in separate rooms and are given separate toilet and bath facilities. In exercises and aboard ships, women are lodged with men. The women in national service are given an extra allowance of €0,40 per diem for <b>sanitary</b> <b>articles</b> and smallclothes. The females in military service are usually well motivated and some 60% of them receive either NCO or reserve officer training.

40|$|The {{consumer}} {{demands that}} to be provided with a sufficient quantity of articles of animal origin that {{meet the requirements of}} sanitary hygiene and are available at acceptable prices. Food articles of animal origin that are safe for human consumption can be obtained only from healthy animals. Veterinarians are daily concerned with the health of animals and are taking measures to prevent the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms from animals to humans. The knowledge of epizootiology, microbiology, the sources and pathways of contamination of food articles of animal origin by microbiological and chemical pollutants, the procedures in the process of producing food articles in which such pollutants can be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level, and the connection between these factors and human health, give veterinarians the key position in the securing of <b>sanitary</b> hygiene of <b>articles</b> of animal origin. The safety of articles of animal origin is a specialized field in the area of veterinary medicine that links all the activities of a veterinarian.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years there has been concern over {{exposure}} to dioxins through the use of tampons and other <b>sanitary</b> products. This <b>article</b> describes attempts to estimate dioxin exposures from tampons and infant diapers; we then compare exposure estimates to dietary dioxin exposures. We analyzed four brands of tampons and four brands of infant diapers obtained from commercial establishments in San Francisco, California, for dioxin concentrations. We estimated exposures to dioxins {{on the basis of a}} screening level analysis that assumed all dioxins present were completely absorbed. We also estimated exposures by using a more refined analysis that incorporates partition coefficients to estimate bioavailability. None of the products contained 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the most potent dioxin, although other dioxins were present at detectable concentrations in all samples. We observed minimal differences in the concentrations of dioxins between 100 % cotton and cotton/pulp products. The refined exposure analysis indicates that exposures to dioxins from tampons are approximately 13, 000 – 240, 000 times less than dietary exposures. The refined exposure analysis showed that exposure to dioxins from the diet is more than 30, 000 – 2, 200, 000 times the exposure through diapers in nursing infants. Although dioxins are found in trace amounts in both cotton and pulp sanitary products, exposure to dioxins through tampons and diapers does not significantly contribute to dioxin exposures i...|$|R

40|$|International audienceClimate {{change and}} {{increasing}} demography press local authorities {{to look after}} affordable water resources and replacement of drinking water for city necessities like street and pavement cleaning by more available raw water. Though, the substitution of drinking by non-drinking resources demands the evaluation of <b>sanitary</b> hazards. This <b>article</b> aims therefore to evaluate the contribution of cleaning water to the overall exposure of city dwellers in case of wet pavement cleaning using crossed physical, chemical and biological approaches. The result of tracer experiments with fluorescein show that liquid water content of the cleaning aerosol produced is about 0. 24 g m(- 3), rending possible a fast estimation of exposure levels. In situ analysis of the aerosol particles indicates {{a significant increase in}} particle number concentration and particle diameter, though without change in particle composition. The conventional bacterial analysis using total coliforms as tracer suggests that {{an important part of the}} contamination is issued from the pavement. The qPCR results show a more than 20 -fold increase of background genome concentration for Escherichia coli and 10 -fold increase for Enterococcus but a negligible contribution of the cleaning water. The fluorescence analysis of the cleaning aerosol confirms the above findings identifying pavement surface as the major contributor to aerosol organic load. The physical, chemical and microbiological approaches used make it possible to describe accurately the cleaning bioaerosol and to identify the existence of significantly higher levels of all parameters studied during the wet pavement cleaning. Though, the low level of contamination and the very short time of passage of pedestrian in the zone do not suggest a significant risk for the city dwellers. As the cleaning workers remain much longer in the impacted area, more attention should be paid to their chronic exposure...|$|R
40|$|The current {{need for}} {{additional}} domestic accommodation has necessitated the formation of new housing types for different categories of families in terms of affordability and market requirements. In particular, the demand for apartments can be met by the renovation of Soviet pre-cast concrete residential blocks. Firstly, {{there is a need}} to quantify the growth of the elderly population and the ever-increasing desire to preserve friendly relations between the generations based on Tajik tradition. Secondly, {{there is a need to}} design special residential units intended for the resettlement of extended families, family groups and families consisting of several generations. The renovation of the old Soviet buildings will reduce not only the physical deterioration of a building by complete or partial replacement of individual structures, but will also eliminate obsolescence as a result of internal redesign and enhancement of a building. An analysis of the space-planning and structure of a residential building will establish the degree of obsolescence, as well as address the question of reconstruction as a dwelling for extended families through the partial redevelopment of apartments. Such redevelopment would increase the area of common rooms to include insulated terraces and loggias, the removal of some partitions and the conservation of existing <b>sanitary</b> cells. This <b>article</b> deals with the reconstruction of large apartment buildings based on Soviet mass-produced residential block series TTZH 1 - 464 -AC- 3, which is dwelling for extended families consisting of several generations. The article proposes 4 different options for redevelopment. These options will increase the living space of the reconstructed residential building from 25 to 35 %, and will increase the population density in all dwellings by 50 %. The intention is to improve space-planning of mass-produced residential blocks, series TTZH 1 - 464 -AC- 3, in order to match the demographic characteristics of Tajikistan for extended families and family groups...|$|R
