40|$|International audienceSelf-trapping {{of optical}} beams in photorefractive (PR) {{materials}} at telecommunications wavelengths {{has been studied}} at steady state in insulators such as SBN [1] and in semiconductor InP:Fe [2], CdTe [3]. PR self-focusing and soliton interactions in semiconductors find interesting applications in optical communications such as optical routing and interconnections because of several advantages over insulators: their sensitivity to near-infrared wavelengths and shorter response time. Photorefractive <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> in InP:Fe is characterized {{as a function of}} beam intensity and temperature. Transient <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> is found to occur on two time scales for input intensities of tens of W/cm 2 (one on the order of tens of µs, one on the order of milliseconds). A theory developed describes the photorefractive <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> in InP:Fe and confirmed by steady state and transient regime measurements. PR associated phenomena (bending and <b>self</b> <b>focusing)</b> are taking place in InP:Fe as fast as a µs for intensities on the order of 10 W/cm 2 at 1. 06 µm. Currently we are conducting more experiments in order to estimate the <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> response time at 1. 55 µm, to clarify the temporal dynamic of the <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> and to build up a demonstrator of fast optical routing by photorefractive spatial solitons interactions...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear self-focusing in laser glass imposes {{limits on}} the energy fluence that can be safely {{transmitted}} without risking damage. For this reason, it is desirable to strictly limit the peak to average spatial variations of fluence by smoothing schemes such as Smoothing by Spectral Dispersion (SSD). While spatial variations are problematic, the same is not necessarily true of temporal variations since normal group velocity dispersion tends to smooth out temporal peaks caused by spatial self-focusing. Earlier work indicated that increased bandwidth can delay the onset of <b>self</b> <b>focusing.</b> The present work re-examines the question of <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> threshold increases due to high bandwidth by investigating another source of such increase in three dimensional beam breakup [...] the bending instability. For simplicity, the authors consider {{the behavior of a}} single space-time speckle. Normal dispersion can lead to splitting of the pulse and delay of <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> for short enough pulses as noted above. In addition to the <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> instability, the laser beam is also subject to the so-called bending (sausage like) instability which can spatially disperse the field maxima over time. Because the bending instability breaks an initial axial symmetry, a full three dimensional numerical simulation is required to study it accurately. Such calculations are possible, but costly. The authors have used a modified 2 D nonlinear Schroedinger equation with a high power nonlinearity since this mimics the 3 D behavior of the competition between <b>self</b> <b>focusing</b> and bending. This study is relevant for inertial confinement conditions...|$|E

In the effective photon hypothesis the laser photon have much better chance than ordinary photon to undergo a phase transition to a superfluid state. If a super fluid photon in the laser beam can be realized then in the effective photon hypothesis gives interesting results. The effective photon hypothesis shows that if the average energy X-ray laser beams is hν= 10 ^ 3 eV ∼ 10 ^ 4 eV, we find that mass of the quasiparticles in the X-ray laser beams is in the range 10 ^ 5 eV ∼ 10 ^ 12 eV.
