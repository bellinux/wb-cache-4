40|$|Abstract: Research {{has clearly}} shown {{that as the}} skid {{resistance}} of a road surface decreases, the road-based transport crash rate increases. In recognizing the importance of providing safe pavement surfacings for travel during wet weather, most highway controlling authorities in developed countries have skid resistance standards. However, recent {{research has demonstrated that}} there is significant variation in performance between natural aggregates where supposedly high-quality surfacing aggregates (as measured by the Polished Stone Value Test) have not performed well or predictably over an economic asset life in areas of high demand for friction. A comparison is made between the performance of six natural aggregates (greywackes, felsic volcanic rocks and basalts) used in New Zealand as road <b>surfacing</b> <b>dressing.</b> The comparison includes surface friction test results of prepared samples that have undergone accelerated polishing using a new laboratory test method. The coefficient of friction is measured at various stages of polishing by the Dynamic Friction Tester. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs show the characteristics of the microtexture of the aggregate surface before and after accelerated polishing, correlating the degree of surface polishing to the measured skid resistance performance and relating this to the aggregate mineralogy, grain size, and degree of lithification and diagenesis. Wet pavement crashes continue to be a major concern o...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{dressings}} {{are used}} as a road maintenance activity {{as well as a}} surfacing of a newly constructed road. One of the main decisions to be taken in designing a dressing is the selection of appropriate aggregate size. Improper selection of aggregate size could tarnish the performance of a <b>surface</b> <b>dressing.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} find the optimum size of aggregate for a single <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> especially in Sri Lankan Macadam roads. General size of aggregate for a particular <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> could be found using commercial traffic volume and surface hardness of the road based on TRRL method. But the aggregate sizes selected in above simple method have shown inconsistent results. Therefore tests should be carried out to find most appropriate size for the surface dressings. Three sizes of aggregate were selected using above simple check for the tests. Three different surface dressings from different aggregate sizes were done. Binder type kept constant and binder rate changed according to the chip size. The performances of these three surface dressings were evaluated by measuring aggregate removal rate and skid resistance of the seal. Digital photographs of demarcated locations in surface dressings of different chip sizes were taken at pre determined time intervals. The numbers of aggregate were counted in each photo after certain time interval and using this data, the behavior of each <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> over a period of time can be studied. The aggregate size that could keep highest area of aggregate intact in its dressing would be a more durable chip size. The next aspect of checking performance of the dressing is the skid resistance. The techniques utilized to measure this value are Locked wheel test and Sand patch method. The main- aim of skid resistance testing was to compare three sizes of aggregate and see how they respond to skidding. -It was found that 9. 5 mm nominal size performed better in durability aspect and 12. 5 mm performed better in skid resistance aspect...|$|E

The test sections were produced during year 2001. A second full scale trial test was carried through during year 2004 with the purpose to optimise the utilizing of the stone aggregate (chippings) with different types of fractions 4 - 8, 4 - 16 and 8 - 16 mm. This trial was carried through on the secondary road 723 between Heden and Färila also in the county Hälsingland. In addition to testing different types of binders, the effect of breaking additive was studied in the respects of how soon the <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> could be swept from excess of loose stones after the surface treatment was carried out and the time of the year the surface treatment was carried out. The test sections have been monitored with respect to macro texture, rut depth, longitudinal evenness and noise emission as well as by visual inspections of damages and defects. In addition to this the laboratory testing of the wear resistance and the testing of the sensibility to the effect of water have been carried out. For this purpose a modified laboratory test method (Prall method), for <b>surface</b> <b>dressing,</b> has been used. During the production phase of the <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> some advantages were noticed by the use of polymer modified bitumen emulsion {{with the addition of a}} breaking additive. In principle the method is to inject the breaking additive into the emulsion just before spreading of the bituminous emulsion on the road. The stone aggregate was fixed to the road surface after a relatively short time which made it possible to sweep the surface treatment from the excess of loose stones after a few hours after the production of the surface treatment. Modified bitumen emulsion combined with the breaking additive showed consequently positive effects for the road users through better accessibility and a less risk of loose stones damaging the vehicles...|$|E

40|$|Teaching basic {{principles}} of colonisation, contamination and infection has revolutionised approaches to wound care. Wound colonisation is classified as the existence of bacteria with no obvious host reaction (Carville 2005). The act of wound contamination is recognised as introducing micro-organisms into the wound (Ellis 2004). Wound infection is an invasion and multiplication of micro-organisms causing localised and systemic effects (Baranoski & Ayello 2004). Through clinical practice nurses inadvertently engage in wound contamination thus setting the environment for wound infection. Previously, education focused on teaching nursing students technicalities of maintaining a sterile dressing field (Ellis & Beckmann 1997, Ellis 2004). This method taught students to mimic practice rather than critically consider practice during wound care. Currently wound education considers how, when, where and what contaminated the wound field. The wound field encompasses both the wound <b>surface</b> and the <b>dressing</b> <b>surface</b> (Ellis & Beckmann 1998).
