5|$|Another {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which {{is distinct from}} C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> noted a general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E

500|$|When Gatiss {{wrote the}} first draft of the episode Matt <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> not been cast as the Doctor. Gatiss wrote this early draft for a generic Doctor, though Moffat commented it sounded like Jon Pertwee and Gatiss agreed. Once <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> been cast, Gatiss watched Party Animals, a {{television}} series <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> previously starred in, as well as anything else Smith was in that he could find. Gatiss used these to [...] "download [...] speech patterns" [...] and examine his energy and phrasing.|$|R

5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a {{collaborative}} effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> said that he purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions.|$|E
50|$|Zane <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> {{his second}} {{excellent}} {{game of the}} Series, {{but this time he}} won, beating Tom Glavine and the Braves 1-0 in almost a mirror image of Smith's start in Game 2. However, in Game 2, <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> given up the one run and lost.|$|R

5|$|After leaving Elwood's hometown, {{the pair}} {{meet up with}} Gamma's long-time partner C.T. Smith, another wanted powder hunter. <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> {{infiltrated}} the ranks of Ash Daughter, a gang which has found a Ring of the Dead. The three challenge the gang's leader, Ranewater Calder, and Gamma slays Calder using his mastery of the fictional sword art karin zanjutsu, a martial art which grants its users pyrokinesis. Elwood, Gamma, and Smith thereby gain a second Ring of the Dead, concluding the first arc and volume of the series.|$|E
5|$|Alongside The Simpsons, Smith {{appeared}} in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise, and had recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. She has {{appeared in}} several films, including City Slickers, Just Write, Toys and As Good as It Gets. In 2004, Smith performed her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gene Upshaw in 2008, Richard Berthelsen was named interim {{executive}} director, serving from August 2008 until March 2009. The NFLPA Board of Representatives elected DeMaurice Smith for a three-year term as the executive director on March 16, 2009. <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> been largely praised for his work ethic by the media, current and former players and colleagues as director and for making the union more professional despite the resentment of some players who found his leadership style to be too controlling. Smith's contract was renewed for an additional three years in March 2012. He was elected for a third term in March 2015. The major issue of Smith's tenure has been the 2011 lockout; former offensive lineman Chester Pitts praised Smith for fiercely fighting for the players' rights during negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Later in a motel, they {{interrogate}} Szalay, whose friend Gary {{had been}} abducted just before Mulder; Szalay was investigating the UFO reports in Montana {{in an attempt}} to find him. Doggett reports that fresh footprints from Nike shoes were noted in the area Hoese was found, making Doggett skeptical about Szalay's claims to alien sightings. Meanwhile, Jeremiah <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> assumed the form of a doctor and arranges for Hoese to be transferred. Having learned of Hoese's disappearance, Doggett calls Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Reyes assists in the investigation, believing that Mulder may have joined a UFO cult. In a derelict compound, Smith cures Hoese of her injuries, as observed by a man called Absalom.|$|E
5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move across the water.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> pointed out, that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting {{that they may not}} be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II {{as well as in the}} tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.|$|E

2500|$|Smith, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of John Whitmer, then began to copy and compile the revelations <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> dictated up to that point, while Cowdery returned to Fayette. Cowdery and most of the Whitmer family in Fayette became alarmed, however, when they learned that <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> added a phrase to the [...] "Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ" [...] , requiring good works as a prerequisite for baptism, and Cowdery commanded Smith to retract the added phrase [...] <b>Smith</b> <b>had</b> to travel to Fayette to convince Cowdery and the Whitmers [...] "that the sentence was reasonable, and according to Scripture" [...]|$|R
5|$|Like all milk-caps (Lactarius and Lactifluus), L.deceptivus is mycorrhizal, {{meaning the}} fungus forms a mutualistic {{association}} with certain trees and shrubs. The subterranean mycelium of the fungus forms an intimate association with tree roots, enveloping {{them in a}} sheath of tissue that allows both organisms to exchange nutrients they would otherwise be unable to obtain. The fruit bodies of the fungus grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups {{on the ground in}} conifer or hardwood forests, often under oak (Quercus) or hemlock (Tsuga). <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> noted a preference for bogs and the edges of woodland pools in hardwood forests, and in oak stands that have an understory of blueberry bushes (Vaccinium species). It is widely distributed in eastern North America, and has also been reported from southern and western Canada. It is a fairly common species, and fruits from June to October. The mushroom has also been reported from Mexico (in Puebla and in Veracruz) from oak and pine forests, at altitudes slightly over , and from Costa Rica, where it is abundant in oak forests.|$|E
5|$|Movie {{director}} Kevin <b>Smith</b> <b>has</b> {{been a fan}} of the Degrassi series {{from the}} early 1990s, when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. Actor Jason Mewes was his co-worker at the store and also became a fan. Every Sunday morning at work, Smith and Mewes watched episodes of Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High on Public Broadcasting Service. Smith enjoyed the earlier series and has acknowledged an infatuation with Stacie Mistysyn. He has also paid homage to Degrassi by referring to it in several of his films. He named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Mistysin's Degrassi character, Caitlin Ryan, wrote Shannen Doherty's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film, and had Jason Lee's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as a TV show he wants to watch, rather than going out. Smith and Mewes guest starred as themselves in the final three episodes of the fourth season. The plot for these episodes involves the pair working on Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, a fictional feature film in the View Askewniverse, using Degrassi Community School as a filming location.|$|E
5|$|The most Gold Gloves {{ever won}} by one player is 18 by pitcher Greg Maddux. He won 13 {{consecutive}} awards from 1990 to 2002, {{all in the}} National League.
