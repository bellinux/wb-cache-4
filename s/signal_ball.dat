40|$|Self-renewing {{stem cells}} are pools of {{undifferentiated}} cells, which are maintained in cellular niche environments by distinct tissue-specific signalling pathways. In Drosophila melanogaster, female germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained in a somatic niche of the gonads by BMP signalling. Here we report a novel function of the Drosophila kinase Ballchen (BALL), showing that its cell autonomous role is to maintain the self-renewing capacity of female GSCs independent of BMP <b>signalling.</b> <b>ball</b> mutant GSCs are eliminated from the niche and subsequently differentiate into mature eggs, indicating that BALL is largely dispensable for differentiation. Similar to female GSCs, BALL is required to maintain self-renewal of male GSCs, suggesting a tissue independent requirement of BALL for self-renewal of germline stem cells...|$|R
5000|$|Silk {{came to the}} American League in 1902. He {{brought a}} unique style with him, {{originating}} the loud exclamations <b>signaling</b> <b>balls,</b> strikes and outs. Previously, umpires had simply informed the catcher or nearest defensive player of their calls. He was particularly known for his booming call of [...] "ball tuh" [...] and his drawn-out strike calls, {{as well as his}} snappy calls of foul balls. A 1909 New York Times article criticized the quiet work of umpire Billy Evans, saying, [...] "Though they laugh at Silk O’Loughlin, everybody knows just what he says."

50|$|A {{standard}} system of two time intervals between plays are established (and would be timed using the play clock): For normal plays, the offensive team has 45 seconds to snap the ball after the previous play is signaled dead. After time outs and other administrative stoppages, the time limit is 30 seconds beginning after the Referee <b>signals</b> that the <b>ball</b> {{is ready to}} resume play.|$|R
50|$|In American football, an {{offensive}} team is penalized five yards for delay of game {{if it fails}} to put {{the ball in play}} by either snap or free kick before the play clock expires. This time limit varies by league, and is often 25 seconds from the time the referee <b>signals</b> the <b>ball</b> ready for play. In the National Football League, it can also be 40 seconds {{from the end of the}} previous down, depending on the circumstances at the time. Also, the defensive team can be given the same penalty if, after a play has ended, they fail to quickly yield the ball to officials, prevent a player on the offense from getting up, or kick the ball.|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} that the scorers note down the play accurately and therefore the appropriate signals will be made by the umpire when the ball is dead (see Law 2.13).

40|$|Abstract. Heavy {{mechanical}} {{devices of}} complex industrial process produce soundly mechanical vibration and acoustical signals. Some difficult-to-measure key process parameters have direct relationship with these signals. A newly ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Mutual information (MI), and Kernel partial least squares (KPLS) based modeling approach is proposed to measure these process parameters. At first, different scale intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of mechanical vibration and acoustical signals are obtained using EEMD technology. Then, FFT transforms these multi-scale IMFs into frequency domain, and MI based feature selection method selects interesting frequency spectral features. Finally, KPLS constructs the final soft sensor models using the selected features. Experimental results based on vibration and acoustical <b>signals</b> of <b>ball</b> mill demonstrate {{this approach is}} more effective than other exist multi-scale decomposition based methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Component {{decomposition}} {{and physical}} interpretation of shell vibration <b>signal</b> of <b>ball</b> mill in grinding process is very difficult. Aim to this problem, several multi-scales decomposition algorithms {{are used to}} analyze shell vibration signal in this paper. Empirical mode decomposition, ensemble empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert vibration decomposition algorithms decompose shell vibration signal {{to a series of}} multi-scale sub-signals. Correlation coefficients between these sub-signals and original vibration signal were calculated. Power density spectrums of different multi-scale sub-signals used also to analyze and explain the shell vibration signal. Results show that different decomposition algorithms have different advantages and shortcomings. The further research direction is that how to fuse these sub-signals and model load parameters inside the ball mill.

5000|$|Michigan uses a 3-lamp traffic signal, {{with a red}} ball, yellow arrow, {{and green}} arrow; during the {{permissive}} turn, the red ball flashes. At about 372 locations a flashing red <b>ball</b> <b>signal</b> on a [...] "protected" [...] left turn traffic signal indicates that left turning traffic may, after a full stop, complete their turn {{if and only if}} there is a long enough break in oncoming traffic. The flashing red usually occurs when the oncoming traffic has a green signal. This function is not enabled at intersections where it may not be safe to do so (restricted view of oncoming traffic, heavy pedestrian crossings, or double-lane left turns are good examples). Michigan usually indicates signals that are dedicated to turning traffic with a sign displaying [...] "LEFT" [...] or [...] "RIGHT". This sign is normally illuminated at night. More recent installations in Michigan, however, have used flashing yellow arrow signal heads, which typically have not included left-turn signal signage. All flashing red <b>ball</b> <b>signals</b> in Michigan will gradually be phased out in favor of the flashing yellow arrow. The flashing red ball was also used in Maryland.|$|R

40|$|Different from {{conventional}} spectral method, complexity analysis treaded with the signals’ time domain structure feature. Before, {{due to the}} no stationary and the unevenness of state space of mechanical signals, the state information {{is likely to get}} a loss. Now, the time-window complexity is proposed to overcome certain limitations of complexity itself in some extent. It will help to extract the state features of mechanical systems in different states. The concept and algorithm of time-window complexity is introduced detailed. The way of applying the time-window complexity for fault diagnosis is discussed. The mechanical <b>signals</b> of <b>ball</b> bearing with slight flaw and that of four kinds of impact-rubbing states of a typical rotor are then studied.

The ball beat the goalkeeper, hit the crossbar and bounced down before Weber headed it out for a corner. England's players claimed a goal whilst the Germans were adamant that the ball had not fully crossed the line.

5000|$|The line umpire <b>signals</b> a <b>ball</b> out {{by making}} a verbal [...] "out" [...] call ("fault" [...] for a serve) {{followed}} by {{the extension of the}} arm shoulder high in the direction the ball was out. A <b>ball</b> is <b>signalled</b> [...] "safe" [...] or [...] "good" [...] by holding both hands together knee high in front of the body. A line umpire who is unable to call a shot (usually because a player obstructs his/her view) signals this by holding his/her hands beside his/her head, the upper side pointing {{in the same direction as}} the eyes; that call is then the chair umpire's responsibility. Line umpires are also responsible for calling footfaults. When baseline umpires are being used, they watch to see if the server touches any part of the baseline before the ball is struck. Center service line umpires are responsible for calling footfaults when the server steps over the imaginary extension of the centerline.
