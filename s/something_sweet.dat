25|$|Cadbury {{has enjoyed}} a {{substantial}} fan base in India. The Dairy Milk primarily is a huge success. Initially, the company had appointed Amithabh Bhachan as the brand ambassador in 2004. However the brand soon faced a significant backlash with worms being spotted in the chocolate bars. With its new campaigns however the company did get back on its feet. Cadbury {{is known for its}} marketing campaigns in India that have known to instill a sense of playfulness and innocence with its campaigns. One campaign that promoted the product by using the country's love for cricket was very successful. The ad is noted to be the best advertisement made in India by the Times of India. Another famous campaign hosted by the company in the past was the 'Shubh Aarambh' Campaign. This campaign made use of the traditional practice of Indian households of having <b>something</b> <b>sweet</b> before every auspicious occasion. It is a traditional belief that this leads to a favourable outcome for the people. This campaign was also a huge hit and positioned Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates as part of a family name. Cadbury today holds 70% of the market share of the chocolate industry in the country.|$|E

In 1948, their version of [...] "Say <b>Something</b> <b>Sweet</b> to Your Sweetheart" [...] sold over a million copies.

500|$|Recent reviews {{have also}} applauded the episode. Shearman and Pearson rated the episode five stars out of five, {{describing}} it as [...] " [...] delightful...comic fable". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that it [...] "works {{because it takes}} this very silly idea and proceeds to take it seriously." [...] He criticized the program for its [...] "corniness" [...] and its reliance on the [...] "magical black guy" [...] stereotype, but concluded that [...] "The Unnatural" [...] was successful [...] "because it embraces {{this side of the}} show’s profile [...] could do <b>something</b> <b>sweet</b> and lovely and moving". VanDerWerff also complimented Martin's performance, calling his acting [...] "terrific". Cynthia Fuchs from PopMatters wrote that Duchovny's directing debut was excellent.|$|E
500|$|... "Everytime" [...] {{was also}} used in the 2013 American film Spring Breakers, {{directed}} by Harmony Korine. The scene begins with the characters of Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brittany (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) standing in the backyard {{of the character of}} Alien (James Franco), who sits at a white grand piano. The girls are wearing My Little Pony ski masks, sparkly pink tiger bathing suits, sweatpants with [...] "DTF" [...] on the rear and shotguns in their hands. They ask Alien to [...] "Play us <b>something</b> <b>sweet.</b> Something uplifting, Something fucking inspiring," [...] to which he responds [...] "One of the greatest singers of all time, and an angel if there ever was one on this earth", before starting to sing [...] "Everytime". As the song transitions from Alien's vocals to Spears's original version we are shown a montage of the girls and Alien robbing other spring breakers at gunpoint. Harmony Korine said about the song, ...|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and drummer}} Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson issued {{an essay in}} 1999 that {{discussed}} the album's creation and analyzed its songs. He described the project as a [...] "vicarious fantasy", a [...] "new direction of soul for 2000", and [...] "the litmus test that will reveal the most for your personality". He addressed the inspiration behind Voodoo, saying [...] "It was a love for the dead state of black music, a love to show our idols how much they taught us [...] I hope you enjoy it. Just have an open mind to new shit. Just give us that." [...] Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept, saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album's release, [...] "We knew this album would be a hard pill to swallow. People may want D to play into their R love-god fantasies—wearing Armani suits, singing <b>something</b> <b>sweet</b> in your ear—but he made {{a conscious effort to}} shake people up, to take a chance. It's not a middle-ground record—you're either going to love it or hate it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Something</b> <b>sweeter</b> than honey, <b>something</b> {{that at one}} taste wakened {{in memory}} Mutta, and Seelem, and the little Portingal's hut, and Glint's towering Ukka-tree, and all his childhood, was pushed between his teeth. Nod sneezed three times, struggled, and sat up.|$|R

60|$|Ruth sat silent, looking {{about her}} as if she saw a new heaven and earth, and had no words in which to tell the feeling that made her eyes so soft, sent the fresh color back into her cheeks, and touched her lips with <b>something</b> <b>sweeter</b> than a smile.|$|R
500|$|The {{video is}} {{structured}} as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays Madonna as a stripper. According to Mondino, the peep show {{was his idea}} since at that time, [...] "we were into a period where we were experimenting [...] some kind of freedom about the body, about sexuality and stuff". He {{wanted to have a}} [...] "naive and sweet" [...] feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna. They built the set from scratch, including the frontal part with the ticket booth. Although it looked fake, Mondino liked it saying [...] "I like the fakeness of it. I haven't seen it for a long time, but when I saw it once again, I said, 'It's so naïve'. It's kind of badly done, which I like, compared to today. We didn't have the same equipment, people are more skillful today, but there's <b>something</b> <b>sweet</b> about it." [...] Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig, and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive. But Madonna wanted Mondino's opinion on the whole ensemble, who replied that she would look better as a blonde. So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only.|$|E

"Let's Call It Quits" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as having a [...] "bluesy pay-off" [...] and [...] "slinky rock groove" [...] by Chris Ingham in the liner notes of the 2007 remaster of the album. After it became a UK hit, the band had a court case taken against them by Allen Toussaint, who felt the song was similar to his [...] "Play <b>Something</b> <b>Sweet</b> (Brickyard Blues)". The case was settled out of court with the band giving them 50% in songwriting royalties, though Lea maintained their song was one he had [...] "never heard before or since". [...] "Pack Up Your Troubles" [...] is an acoustic-based country number with a [...] "camp-fire feel". The song features Paul Prestotino on Dobro guitar. [...] "In For a Penny" [...] is the only Slade track to feature accordion and has the longest Dave Hill guitar solo used on a Slade single.|$|E
60|$|Closing {{her mind}} to the town and all it meant to her, the girl tried to follow, in imagination, the ranger {{treading}} his far, high trails.

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{memories}} of the Seminary, the echoes of the songs we had heard, gave the morning chorus of the prairie chickens a richer meaning than before.

I had gained in perception and also in the power to assimilate what I perceived.|$|R
