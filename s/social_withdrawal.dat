5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. <b>Social</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E

25|$|Current theory {{focuses on}} the role of {{dopamine}} in schizophrenia, particularly how negative symptoms such as <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and apathy may be caused by a deficiency of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex while positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations may be caused by excess dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway. Nicotine increases release of dopamine, so it is hypothesized that smoking helps correct dopamine deficiency in the prefrontal cortex and thus relieve negative symptoms.|$|E

This leads to long waiting lists for therapy...|$|R
40|$|Young {{children}} with autism often experience delays in social play skills. These delays result in poor relationships with adults and peers, decreased social interactions, and engagement, and eventually <b>social</b> isolation and <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Social</b> play skill deficits {{are essential to the}} development of self-regulation and cognitive skills. Addressing these delays is critical to improve social functioning and minimize any detrimental effects on future engagement and academic achievement. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use an alternating treatment design to determine whether PIPRT intervention or a VMO intervention would be effective to increase social play skills in two settings for four young {{children with}} autism. The PIPRT and VMO interventions were both implemented in the classroom prior to structured play centers and on during recess on the playground. Data were collected daily during structured play centers and recess. Results of this study suggest that there was a significant difference between the PIPRT and VMO interventions for all four participants, favoring the PIPRT intervention in both settings. Visual analysis of the data also indicated that the PIPRT intervention had a higher increase in social play skills for all four participants in class and at recess on the playground...|$|R
25|$|In some Western {{cultures}} shyness-inhibition {{plays an}} important role in psychological and social adjustment. It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection by peers, isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research suggests that if <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal</b> is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.|$|E
25|$|Individuals low in reward {{dependence}} {{and high in}} norepinephrine levels are then hypothesized to be typically independent, non-conformist, practical, tough-minded, cynical, unwilling to share their intimate feelings with others, socially detached, irresolute, insensitive to social cues and pressures, and content to be alone. They are also minimally motivated to please others and act for immediate gratification. So being low in reward dependence is related to <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> with aggressive anti-social behavior, detachment, and coldness in social attitudes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify, in the perceptions of psychoactive substances users, protective and risk factors for relapses. Fifty users in treatment participated in this study in a therapeutic community in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2013. This is a qualitative study with the application of a self-administered questionnaire with closed questions and analysis through descriptive statistics. One identified as risk factors: lack of family support, family conflicts, negative feelings, <b>social</b> context, <b>withdrawal</b> from support groups, dissatisfaction with the treatment and financial difficulties. One highlighted as protective factors: religiosity, support groups, being the professional support one of the last support networks. One verified ambiguity of family and friends as a risk and protective factor. It is expected that the risk and protective factors identified may contribute to the prevention of relapse policies, enabling the enhancement of treatments focused on the recognition of protective factors, development of skills and coping strategies. ...|$|R
25|$|Although {{individuals}} with FXS have difficulties in forming friendships, those with FXS and ASD characteristically also have difficulties with reciprocal conversation with their peers. <b>Social</b> <b>withdrawal</b> behaviors, including avoidance and indifference, {{appear to be}} the best predictors of ASD in FXS, with avoidance appearing to be correlated more with social anxiety while indifference was more strongly correlated to severe ASD. When both autism and FXS are present, a greater language deficit and lower IQ is observed as compared to children with only FXS.|$|E
25|$|While not as profoundly {{disabling}} as {{the physical}} symptoms of these diseases, PBA can significantly influence individuals' social functioning and {{their relationships with}} others. Such sudden, frequent, extreme, uncontrollable emotional outbursts may lead to <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and interfere with activities of daily living, social and professional pursuits, and reduce overall healthcare. For example, patients with ALS and MS are often cognitively normal. However, the appearance of uncontrollable emotions is commonly associated with many additional neurological disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, and migraines. This may lead to severe embarrassment and avoidance of social interactions for the patient, which in turn impairs their coping mechanisms and their careers.|$|E
25|$|Persons with ORS tend {{to develop}} a {{behavior}} pattern of avoidance of social activities and progressive <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> They often avoid travel, dating, relationships, break off engagements and avoid family activities. Due to shame and embarrassment, they may avoid school or work, or repeatedly change jobs and move to another town. Significant developments may occur such as loss of employment, divorce, becoming housebound, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide attempts. According to some reports, 74% of persons with ORS avoid social situations, 47% avoid work, academic or other important activities, 40% had been housebound for at least 1 week because of ORS, and 31.6% had experienced psychiatric hospitalization. With regards suicide, reports range from 43-68% with suicidal ideation, and 32% {{with a history of}} at least one suicide attempt. 5.6% successfully committed suicide.|$|E

40|$|Young {{children}} with autism often experience delays in social skills and social competence. These delays result in poor relationships and decreased social interactions and engagement, and eventually, <b>social</b> isolation and <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Social</b> skills deficits are also correlated to behavioral and emotional difficulties. Addressing these delays is critical to minimize not only delayed social development, but also detrimental effects on academic learning and performance. Ensuring young children are proficient {{in a variety of}} prosocial skills is critical for favorable long-term outcomes and school success. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use a multiple baseline design to determine whether a Social Story intervention with a modified perspective sentence would be effective to increase verbal social initiations and decrease maladaptive behaviors in two settings for four young {{children with}} autism. The Social Story intervention was implemented in the classroom prior to structured play centers. Data were collected daily during the structured play centers and recess. Results of this study indicated a statistically significant effect for one student participant in relation to increased verbal social initiations. Visual analysis of the data also indicated a positive effect for two additional student participants in regard to verbal social initiations. The data indicated an effect for only one of the student participants related to maladaptive behaviors. However, the participating classroom teacher indicated favorable results for all student participants and positive attitudes toward use of the intervention and likelihood that she would use the intervention again...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{hypothesis}} that schizophrenia is neurodevelopmental {{was investigated in}} a prospective study of young people with a postulated 10 - 15 % risk {{for the development of}} schizophrenia. AIMS: To determine premorbid variables distinguishing high-risk people who will go on to develop schizophrenia from those who will not. METHOD: A high-risk sample of 163 young adults with two relatives with schizophrenia was recruited. They and 36 controls were serially examined. Baseline measures were compared between those who did develop schizophrenia, a well control group, a well high-risk group and high-risk participants with partial or isolated psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: Of those at high risk, 20 developed schizophrenia within 2 (1 / 2) years. More experienced isolated or partial psychotic symptoms. Those who developed schizophrenia differed from those who did not on <b>social</b> anxiety, <b>withdrawal</b> and other schizotypal features. The whole high-risk sample differed from the control group on developmental and neuropsychological variables. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic component of schizophrenia affects many more individuals than will develop the illness, and partial impairment can be found in them. Highly significant predictors of the development of schizophrenia are detectable years before onset...|$|R
25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E
500|$|TBI {{may cause}} emotional, social, or {{behavioral}} problems {{and changes in}} personality. [...] These may include emotional instability, depression, anxiety, hypomania, mania, apathy, irritability, problems with social judgment, and impaired conversational skills. [...] TBI appears to predispose survivors to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder, substance abuse, dysthymia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. In patients who have depression after TBI, suicidal ideation is not uncommon; the suicide rate among these persons is increased 2- to 3-fold. Social and behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition, inability to control anger, impulsiveness, lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, asociality and <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> and changes in personality.|$|E
500|$|Late {{adolescence}} and early adulthood are peak periods for {{the onset of}} schizophrenia, critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development. In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself {{before the age of}} 19. The onset of the disease is usually later in women than in men. To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal (pre-onset) phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30months before the onset of symptoms. Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms and the non-specific symptoms of <b>social</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> irritability, dysphoria, and clumsiness before the onset of the disease. Children who go on to develop schizophrenia may [...] also demonstrate decreased intelligence, decreased motor development (reaching milestones such as walking slowly), isolated play preference, social anxiety, and poor school performance.|$|E
5000|$|Karen Horney and Erik Erikson {{were both}} psychoanalysts that were greatly {{influenced}} by Sigmund Freud’s theories. Horney believes that as a child struggles with anxiety and the security issue, various behavioral strategies may be tried and eventually a character pattern will be adopted. She postulated three such character patterns: (1) moving toward people, characterized by compliance, submissive behavior, and a need for love; (2) moving against people, characterized by arrogance, hostility, and a need for power; and (3) moving away from people, characterized by <b>social</b> avoidance, <b>withdrawal,</b> and a need for independence. Erik Erikson viewed the ego not {{as an extension of}} the id, but as autonomous both in origin and function. The environmental and societal values are central to this new view of the ego, a view that resulted in “the addition of an entire social and cultural dimension to the concept of personality growth.” [...] Erikson’s benefaction to the knowledge of disordered behavior centers around his concepts of crisis and the importance of crisis resolution during critical periods of development. He proposed eight stages of psychosocial development shown in the table below.|$|R
40|$|Rural areas {{globally}} {{are subject}} to the converging pressures of climate change, urbanisation, market forces and energy expansion. Large-scale industrial projects can add to land-use competition and resource conflicts, potentially leading to dramatic impact on rural environments and their communities. Social licence {{can be used as a}} lens for understanding how communities respond to proposed industrial developments. A disconnect between the social license concept and the aims of sustainable development manifests itself in rural areas as a tension between industry activity and community aspirations. Mismatches between land-use planning decisions and community aspirations can create conflict, and potentially, social resistance. Social resistance can reflect strong community positioning and result in <b>social</b> license <b>withdrawal.</b> The relationships between these processes remain unclear. The aim of this thesis is to use the social license lens to explore dynamics of social license for industrial developments in rural areas, with a particular focus on <b>social</b> license <b>withdrawal.</b> The case study for this exploration is a community response to unconventional gas industry developments, presenting an opportunity for research into factors leading to the granting or <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>social</b> license to operate. Three main themes woven throughout the thesis are: 1) drivers of social positioning on industrial development; 2) social dynamics and their influence upon social positioning, and 3) the role of social license in land-use planning. Empirical data was collected using a mixed method, case study approach. Qualitative data from key informant interviews and focus group observations was used to develop a referendum-style poll and two election surveys that were carried out in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. The evolution of community views is examined as isolated concerns merged into coordinated social mobilisation, to the point where, in one local government area, 85 % of voters opposed the industry, and up to 7, 000 residents were mobilising in protest events. Research focussed on the social dynamics of intergroup and intragroup processes within the social movement, view formation and motivators for community positioning. Potential positive and negative influences on rural livelihoods, environmental values and procedural justice were important drivers of perceived legitimacy of developments, with trust being key to the perceived credibility of information. The Thomson and Boutilier (2011) social license model was expanded to include processes within and beyond <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>social</b> license. It is concluded that the three main themes of the thesis are intrinsically linked with each other. Social dynamics play an important role in view formation, as existing values and identity will themselves influence social dynamics. The interaction of these factors, entwined with community engagement and decision-making processes will influence public perceptions, social license, and social resistance...|$|R
