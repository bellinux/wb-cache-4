Four distinct microstructural zones were observed for the as-welded condition in the heat-affected zone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to model carbide {{precipitation}} in steels of a quaternary system which includes two substitutional elements. The work focuses on <b>secondary</b> hardening <b>steels</b> which are used for high-strength components, where hydrogen embrittlement {{is one of the}} major factors responsible for failure. It is believed that carbide particles can act as hydrogen trapping sites, thus reducing the risk of embrittlement. The thesis begins with a review of the physical metallurgy of <b>secondary</b> hardening <b>steels</b> and the phenomena of hydrogen embrittlement and hydrogen trapping. The basic theory for the precipitation processes, including the nucleation and diffusion-controlled growth of particles, is reviewed in Chapter 2. Significant progress has recently been made in modelling the overall kinetics of transformations which occur simultaneously. The new theory, also reviewed, adopts classical nucleation and diffusion-controlled growth concepts and takes into account the capillarity effect. In the present work, a modified model has been developed for the precipitation of needle-shaped carbides, and a new model for plate-shaped carbides. The models are then verified experimentally, using five steels designed specifically for this purpose. Using the chemical compositions of the steels and thermodynamic data, the carbide precipitation, dissolution and coarsening kinetics at 600 °C were estimated. It is found that reasonable agreement can be obtained between experiment and theory for ternary steels, when multicomponent diffusion and capillarity effects are taken into account. This applies to both needle and plate-shaped particles. The same approach was then used successfully for quaternary steels. For the specific steels studied, M 2 C- and M 4 C 3 -type carbides are expected to be hydrogen trapping sites which improve the hydrogen embrittlement properties. Experimental results on the hydrogen trapping capacity of the steels confirm this expectation and the relationships between the hydrogen trapping capacity and the features of M 4 C 3 carbide particles are discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and suggestions are made for future work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Long-term forecasts of steel demand and scrap supply {{are needed to}} develop strategies for how the steel industry could respond to industrialization and urbanization {{in the developing world}} while simultaneously reducing its environmental impact, and in particular, its carbon footprint. We developed a dynamic stock model to estimate future final demand for steel and the available scrap for 10 world regions. Based on evidence from developed countries, we assumed that per capita in-use stocks will saturate eventually. We determined the response of the entire steel cycle to stock saturation, in particular the future split between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>steel</b> production. During the 21 st century, steel demand may peak in the developed world, China, the Middle East, Latin America, and India. As China completes its industrialization, global primary steel production may peak between 2020 and 2030 and decline thereafter. We developed a capacity model to show how extensive trade of finished steel could prolong the lifetime of the Chinese steelmaking assets. <b>Secondary</b> <b>steel</b> production will more than double by 2050, and it may surpass primary production between 2050 and 2060 : the late 21 st century can become the steel scrap age.
