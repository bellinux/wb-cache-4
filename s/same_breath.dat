30|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the personalized APRV (P-APRV) used to set time-controlled PEEP [109, 110] and inverse inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio are not at all the <b>same</b> mechanical <b>breath.</b> Although there are many differences between P-APRV and inverse I:E, I will focus on the large difference in the time at expiration between these two ventilation strategies. It was shown by Neumann et al. that the ARDS lung collapses very rapidly, their data showing collapse in 0.6  s after the initiation of expiration [17]. Our work using direct observation of alveoli during mechanical ventilation has also shown a very rapid alveolar collapse in the ARDS lung [40, 111 – 113]. Unlike APRV, inverse ratio ventilation does not allow direct and independent adjustments of the expiratory and inspiratory times. Thus, if the expiratory duration with inverse I:E is not less than 0.4 – 0.6  s, which is most often the case, alveoli would have sufficient time to collapse with each breath and inverse I:E would not be defined as time controlled PEEP, since the lung was allowed time to empty.|$|R

The goal {{of this study is}} to validate mathematical algorithms that automatically detect IEE in a computerized (Better Care®) system that obtains and processes data from intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators in real time. Methods The Better Care® system, integrated with ICU health information systems, synchronizes and processes data from bedside technology. Algorithms were developed to analyze airflow waveforms during expiration to determine IEE. Data from 2, 608, 800 breaths from eight patients were recorded. From these breaths 1, 024 were randomly selected. Five experts independently analyzed the selected breaths and classified them as IEE or not IEE. Better Care® evaluated the <b>same</b> 1, 024 <b>breaths</b> and assigned a score to each one. The IEE score cutoff point was determined based on the experts’ analysis.

Results Optimal sensitivity and specificity were achieved by setting the cutoff point for IEE by Better Care® at 42...|$|R
500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the <b>same</b> <b>breath</b> as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{apparent}} diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of normal abdominal parenchymal organs and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements in the <b>same</b> patients with <b>breath</b> hold (BH) and free breathing (FB) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients underwent both BH and FB DWI. Spherical region of interest (ROI) {{was placed on the}} right hepatic lobe, spleen, pancreas, and renal cortices. ADC values were calculated for each organ on each sequence using an automated software. Image noise, defined as the standard deviation (SD) of the signal intensities in the most artifact-free area of the image background was measured by placing the largest possible ROI on either the left or {{the right side of the}} body outside the object in the recorded field of view. SNR was calculated using the formula: SNR=signal intensity (SI) (organ) /standard deviation (SD) (noise). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in ADC values of the abdominal organs between BH and FB DWI sequences (p> 0. 05). There were statistically significant differences between SNR values of organs on BH and FB DWIs. SNRs were found to be better on FB DWI than BH DWI (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Free breathing DWI technique reduces image noise and increases SNR for abdominal examinations. Free breathing technique is therefore preferable to BH DWI in the evaluation of abdominal organs by DWI...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} ventilation, arterial O 2 saturation, end-tidal CO 2 (PET,CO 2), {{blood pressure}} (intra-arterial catheter or photoelectric plethysmograph), and flow velocity {{in the middle}} cerebral artery (CFV) (pulsed Doppler ultrasound) in 17 healthy awake subjects while they performed 20 s breath holds under control conditions and during ganglionic blockade (intravenous trimethaphan, 4. 4 ± 1. 1 mg min− 1 (mean ±s. d.)). Under control conditions, breath holding caused increases in PET,CO 2 (7 ± 1 mmHg) and in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (15 ± 2 mmHg). A transient hyperventilation (PET,CO 2 − 7 ± 1 mmHg vs. baseline) occurred post-apnoea. CFV increased during apnoeas (by 42 ± 3 %) and decreased below baseline (by 20 ± 2 %) during post-apnoea hyperventilation. In the post-apnoea recovery period, CFV returned to baseline in 45 ± 4 s. The post-apnoea decrease in CFV did not occur when hyperventilation was prevented. During ganglionic blockade, which abolished the increase in MAP, apnoea-induced increases in CFV were partially attenuated (by 26 ± 2 %). Increases in PET,CO 2 and decreases in oxyhaemoglobin saturation (Sa,O 2) (by 2 ± 1 %) during breath holds were identical in the intact and blocked conditions. Ganglionic blockade {{had no effect on}} the slope of the CFV response to hypocapnia but it reduced the CFV response to hypercapnia (by 17 ± 5 %). We attribute this effect to abolition of the hypercapnia-induced increase in MAP. Peak increases in CFV during 20 s Mueller manoeuvres (40 ± 3 %) were the <b>same</b> as control <b>breath</b> holds, despite a 15 mmHg initial, transient decrease in MAP. Hyperoxia also had no effect on the apnoea-induced increase in CFV (40 ± 4 %). We conclude that apnoea-induced fluctuations in CFV were caused primarily by increases and decreases in arterial partial pressure of CO 2 (Pa,CO 2) and that sympathetic nervous system activity was not required for either the initiation or the maintenance of the cerebrovascular response to hyper- and hypocapnia. Increased MAP or other unknown influences of autonomic activation on the cerebral circulation played a smaller but significant role in the apnoea-induced increase in CFV; however, negative intrathoracic pressure and the small amount of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation caused by 20 s apnoea did not affect CFV...|$|R
40|$|Organ {{motion is}} a major problem for any dynamic {{radiotherapy}} delivery technique, and is particularly so for spot scanned proton therapy. On the other hand, the use of narrow, magnetically deflected proton pencil beams is potentially an ideal delivery technique for tracking tumour motion on-line. At PSI, our new Gantry is equipped with a Beams Eye View (BEV) imaging system which will be able to acquire 2 D x-ray images in fluoroscopy mode during treatment delivery. However, besides precisely tracking motion from BEVs, it is also essential to obtain information on the 3 D motion vector throughout the whole region of interest, and any sparsely acquired surrogate motion is generally not sufficient to describe the deformable behaviour of the whole volume in three dimensions. In this study, we propose a method by which 3 D deformable motions can be estimated from surrogate motions obtained using this monoscopic imaging system. The method assumes that example motions over a number of breathing cycles can be acquired before treatment for each patient using 4 DMRI. In this study, for each of 11 different subjects, 100 continuous breathing cycles have been extracted from extended 4 DMRI studies in the liver and then subject specific motion models have been built using principle component analysis (PCA). To simulate treatment conditions, a different set of 30 continuous breathing cycles from the same subjects have then been used to generate a set of simulated 4 DCT data sets (so-called 4 DCT(MRI) data sets), from which time-resolved digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were calculated using the BEV geometry for three treatment fields respectively. From these DRRs, surrogate motions from fiducial markers or the diaphragm have been used as a predictor to estimate 3 D motions in the liver region for each subject. The prediction results have been directly compared to the 'ground truth' motions extracted from the <b>same</b> 30 <b>breath</b> cycles of the originating 4 DMRI data set. Averaged over all 11 subjects, and for three field directions, for 99 % of predicted positions, median (max) error magnitudes of better than 2. 63 (5. 67) mm can be achieved when fiducial markers was chosen as predictor. Furthermore, three single fields, 4 D dose calculations have been performed as a verification tool to evaluate the prediction performance of such a model in the context of scanned proton beam therapy. These show a high similarity between plans considering either PCA predicted motion or ground truth motion, where absolute dose differences of more than 5 % (V(dosediff = 5 %)) occur for the worst field scenarios in only 3. 61 % (median) or 15. 13 % (max) of dose calculation points in the irradiated volume. The magnitude of these dose differences were insignificantly dependent on whether surrogate motions were tracked by monoscopic or stereoscopic imaging systems, or whether fiducial markers or diaphragm were chosen as surrogate. This study has demonstrated that on-line deformable motion reconstruction from sparse surrogate motions is feasible, even when using only a monoscopic imaging system. In addition, it has also been found that diaphragm motion can be considered as a good predictor for respiratory deformable liver motion prediction, implying that fiducial markers might not be compulsory if used in conjunction with a patient specific PCA based model...|$|R

Musicologist Charlie Gillett explains, [...] "By 1965, the Beach Boys had become an American pop institution, but although they continued to cultivate a visual image in line with their name and early repertoire, there was a limit to how many different ways Wilson could celebrate the wonders of living in Southern California … Originally, many serious pop fans dismissed the group as trashy pop for kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, the Leuven Archaeological Mission {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} a hieratic inscription in a limestone quarry which mentions a building project in Amarna. The text is said to be badly damaged, but a doctoral student read the text to indicate a date from regnal year sixteen of Akhenaten and noted that it mentions Nefertiti as Akhenaten's chief wife. The full inscription was not officially published or studied at that time—but parts of it have been published and they clearly demonstrate that Nefertiti, Akhenaten's chief queen, was still alive late in Year 16 of Akhenaten's reign.

40|$|The {{accelerated}} {{work life}} – {{a study of}} how acceleration affects contemporary work life The field of accelerated life became an interest {{as a result of}} the reading of Alienation and Acceleration (2010) by sociologist Hartmut Rosa. Rosa presents a crucial new chapter in the history of critical theory, which I believe will resonate far into the future. The theory highlights the most essential paradoxical parts of contemporary work life and contemporary life in general, in a structured and refined way: It describes the relentless strive for keeping up with the norms of the high-speed society - as being part of a meaningful life (and the seemingly endless struggle to adjust with the transformation of processes within society itself) while feeling torn inside in the <b>same</b> hasty <b>breath.</b> A lifestyle that can lead to monstrous forms of alienation: from time and space, from things and action, from one self and others. The main purpose of this thesis is to broaden and clarify the mutual relationship between acceleration and modern work life, while developing a critical examination of the pathologies related to the accelerated work life. The thesis theoretical foundation is social constructionism. Critical theory and post-structuralism are used as methodical openers of issues and paradoxes related to the pathologies of accelerated work life. Therefore, this thesis develops Rosas Theory inside the field of work life related knowledge, by connecting the concept of social acceleration to different areas, which are fundamental and crucial in the importance of a meaningful work life. Firstly, the thesis creates an overview and analyzes on the relevance and influence of meaningfulness and recognition, as an ingrown part, of what workers seek in the work today. It shows how work is constituted as a medium or institution for ‘meaning production’. But also how work can be seen as recent times medicine for late-modern pathologies - as long as it is ‘designed’ in relation to certain factors: Such as meaningful answers to the question “why?”, where some of the answers holds a longterm perspective and a consistent direction in the production of meaning. And that the answers are inflicted or implemented with a certain amount of joyfulness. Secondly, the thesis analyzes the importance of the understanding of self and self-reflection, the self and external world, the self and self-evaluation. It illustrates how the historical transformation of self-consciousness, and the thereby following self-evaluation, plays an important dialectic role in the development of the late-modern societies’ hunger for recognition. Furthermore, it determines that the transformation of society along with self-consciousness and self-realization are essential for work life acceleration. In that perspective the individual must possess a reflective perception of its own identity, in the order of having the willingness to create itself through the work as an indicator of social, societal and relational progress and achievement in life. Thirdly, it looks into the transformation of temporality. That would be the change in time and space in mod-ern work life and show that temporality have translated into new kinds of structural temporal behavior: For instance, in the structural transformation of organizations, society, family and in relation to the qualitative and quantitative perceptions. This illustrates different kind of patterns in the perception of time, which can be used as methods for further theoretical and empirical research and development elsewhere. Fourthly, the thesis defines Rosas concept of social acceleration and the motors of social acceleration: Com-petition as the social motor, and the promise of eternity as the cultural motor. The thesis combines the core ideas of social acceleration with the definition of the Project Man – the characteristic of modern career life with high-speed individuals working as networker extenders - and the new-religious sides of, especially, late-modern work life. From that, it develops a method for indication of social acceleration in work life, which is brought into use in the main analyses. It then sets out to analyze, in depth, the following work related areas and concepts: Accelerated work life, borderless work life and the risks of distanciation to space, things, actions, one self and others. It defines the characteristic of the Acceleration Man, by referring to how this kind of individual store Erlebnissen (episodes of experience) and Erfahrungen (experiences which leave a mark defining of one’s identity and history) differently as memory traces. Finally, the thesis discuss in what degree the accelerated work life, from a critical perspective, is in lack of resonance. Thus, in a post-structural optic, the freedom of ‘modern man’ is shown to not be that unlimited free after all...|$|R

HistoryBibliography : leaves 148 - 159 The {{publication}} of the Doctrine of Papal Infallibility by the First Vatican Council of the Roman Catholic Church in 1870 had significant implications for democratically elected governments of predominantly Roman Catholic nations; a view held {{by the members of}} the Republican government of France in 1879 who used the event to lay the basis for a political argument which found expression in Article 7 of the “Law Relating to the Freedom of Higher Education”, introduced into the French legislature of the Third Republic on March 15, 1879. The introduction of the article, and the furor it raised in the two houses of the legislature and in the nation, provides the background for a study of the government’s objective of Republican security contained within the article, its feelings towards the Roman Catholic Church generally, and its attempts to integrate the two into an ecclesiastical policy which would neither compromise the future of the Republic nor be persecutory, in the opinion of the government, toward the Church. This paper proposes to be such a study and it analyzes Article 7 both for its political objective and its method of achieving that objective through educational legislation, and the interrelationship of both, as perceived by the spokesmen of the government. – As the latter unfolded their arguments in the Chamber of Deputies during the legislative debate on Article 7, and in their speeches and writings on matters relating to Article 7, they collectively depicted the emergence of a massive coalition of anti-Republican forces in the nation, forces which were in evidence in every level of government administration, and were represented in the Chamber by the parties of the Right – the Legitimists, the Orleanists and the Bonapartists. The leadership and direction of the coalescing forces and the focal point of organization and bond of the alliance, ran the Republican argument, was provided by the non-authorized teaching orders of the Church, especially the Jesuits. Through the {{publication of}} papal infallibility they had accomplished their aim of control of the universal Catholic Church as a first step in the plan of world domination in accordance with their doctrine of indirect power. As agents of that doctrine, the Society was seeking to control the national churches in the various Catholic countries through obtaining a pre-eminent place of authority and increasing their numbers of communities, a development which, according to the Republicans, was already well under way in France. In this process of gaining control they were placing the vast power and influence of the Church, as perceived by the Republicans, {{in the service of the}} parties of the Right both by using the hierarchy, authority and obedience of the Church to attain the organization and control of the present electorate and by using the educational system of the Church to indoctrinate the youth of France in the political thinking of the Right to ensure control of the future electorate. If the process were to continue, the Republic was certain to be threatened, if not destroyed, by the creation of a second France within its very bosom; a France which would be eternally hostile to the Republic and would only exist in a state of war with it. – To ensure the future of the Republic and the unity of the nation, the Republican government felt compelled to expel the Jesuits from the nation and secure control of the other non-authorized orders through authorization. Both could be achieved, they felt, and the integrity of Church-State relations preserved, through the implementation of Article 7 which, in their minds, was simply the reapplication of the terms of the Concordat of 1808. The Concordat had provided mutual protections and guarantees for both Church and State through the arrogation to the state of the right to regulate or authorize religious orders, an arrogation which had been set aside through the anti-Revolutionary reaction of the previous three decades. Since the Jesuits and the other orders in question fell within the category of non-authorized congregations, the reviving of the terms of the Concordat to combat their presence and activity placed the Republican government, in the opinion of its spokesmen, in a legal and justifiable position relative to the orders, a position which in their further opinion could be readily identified with the positions of all previous French governments stretching back to the monarchies of pre-Revolutionary days. Also, the reimplementation of the Concordat meant that the government, in its political quarrel with the Jesuits, was not embarking, in its own estimation, on any new, drastic policy towards the Church such as persecution or separation, but was demonstrating its good faith in reverting to a policy of compromise and moderation, a policy which had been in force since the Revolution and had only been permitted to lapse over the previous three decades. Thus, concluded the Republicans, Article 7 was intended to combat a political threat from political forces whose leadership was operating under the guise of agents of education; hence the presence of political objectives in educational legislation. – This explains the working of the title of the thesis and describes, in capsule form, the thesis itself which the author proposes. It does not attempt to objectively judge the relative strengths or weaknesses of the policy, nor whether the policy was a success or a failure in achieving its political objective. It is merely an attempt to portray the thinking of a government faced, as it believed, with the threat of political extinction in the definitive sense, and its attempt through legislation to remove that threat without prejudicing the very ideals and freedoms they believed they represented. The study of Article 7 is the portrait of a government in a dilemma; in the <b>same</b> legislative <b>breath</b> to remove the Church as a threat without interfering with the Church as a functioning institution. Article 7 was the government’s solution to that dilemma and, given the circumstances of the government which initiated its creation, and the alternative policies which they perceived were available, can be regarded as a genuine attempt to resolve the complex Church-State issue of the Third Republic in 1879 and, relatively speaking, and ecclesiastical policy of the first order...|$|R
