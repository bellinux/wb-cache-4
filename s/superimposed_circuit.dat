40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system and its fault <b>superimposed</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{the direction of the}} fault components of the voltage and the current measured at one end of transmission line is certified to be different for internal faults and external faults. As an estimate of the differences between two signals, relative entropy is an effective parameter for recognizing transient signals in HVDC transmission lines. In this paper, the relative entropy of wavelet energy is applied to distinguish internal fault from external fault. For internal faults, the directions of fault components of voltage and current are opposite at the two ends of the transmission line, indicating a huge difference of wavelet energy relative entropy; for external faults, the directions are identical, indicating a small difference. The simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC show that the proposed pilot protection system acts accurately for faults under different conditions, and its performance is not affected by fault type, fault location, fault resistance and noise...|$|E

40|$|In {{a quantum}} computer, {{creating}} superpositions of quantum bits (qubits) in different states {{can lead to}} a speed-up over classical computers [1], but quantum mechanics also allows for the superposition of quantum circuits [2]. In fact, it has recently been theoretically predicted that <b>superimposing</b> quantum <b>circuits,</b> each with a different gate order, could provide quantum computers with an even further computational advantage [3 - 5]. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this enhancement by applying two quantum gates in a superposition of both possible orders to determine whether the two gates commute or anti-commute. We are able to make this determination with only a single use (or query) of each gate, while all quantum circuits with a fixed order of gates would require at least two uses of one of the gates [3]. Remarkably, when the problem is scaled to N gates, creating a superposition of quantum circuits is likely to provide an exponential advantage over classical algorithms, and a linear advantage over quantum algorithms with fixed gate order [4]. The new resource that we exploit in our experiment can be interpreted as a "superposition of causal orders". We demonstrate such a superposition could allow some quantum algorithms to be implemented with an efficiency that is unlikely to be achieved on a quantum computer with a fixed gate order.
