50|$|Surface sizing {{solutions}} {{consists of}} mainly modified starches and sometimes other hydrocolloids, such as gelatine, or surface sizing agents such as acrylic co-polymers. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules, having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The <b>sizing</b> <b>agent</b> adheres to substrate fibers and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, {{resulting in a}} smooth finish that tends to be water-repellent.

After a 12 -week decay test, the weight losses of untreated control blocks were 70. 45 % by Trametes versicolor and 61. 84 % by Gloeophyllum trabeum. The wood decay resistance was also slightly improved by the treatment with only the rosin <b>sizing</b> <b>agent.</b> However, after being treated with the rosin <b>sizing</b> <b>agent</b> and CuSO 4, the wood had great decay resistance. The average weight losses of the samples degraded by fungi were less than 4 %. Notably, the leached wood blocks had a weight loss of less than 3 %.

40|$|Most textile mills use sizes {{based on}} {{synthetic}} agents. In practice {{these products are}} not or only partly biodegradable. Therefore they should not run into municipal treatment plants. Nevertheless the market share of these sizes has been increasing continuously {{during the last few}} years. The main reason is: synthetic sizes meet best the requirements of modern weaving technology, while starch based biogradable sizes don't do this satisfactory. Therefore the aim of the research project is to develop <b>size</b> <b>agents</b> based on modified starch which are high-efficient and well biogradable and/or to modifiy synthetic sizes to improve their biogradability and elimination rate in purification processes. These new products will be tested at sizing and desizing processes under practical conditions in weaving and finishing mills. Furthermore the disposability of the resulting effluent in municipal waste water treatment respectively its degradability in aerobic biological purification processes will be examined. The new products will also be tested for their recovery in the ultrafiltration processes as well as for biodegradability in anaerobic processes. The project is being realizes by the ITV Denkendorf together with industrial partners, such as leading manufactorers of <b>size</b> <b>agents</b> and weaving and finishing mills. The Kolb and Schuele AG, Kirchheim/Teck, performed broken end analysis on their normally sized warps. The results can b e a standard of comparison for forthcoming tests of new products. The standard warps showed good performance in weaving. Due to being oversized a compared test warp did not perform as well. Another test warp was sized with a product of a project partner and was woven and desized under practical conditions in the mill. At the beginning of the project the ITV Denkendorf did adhesive power measurements of three types of cotton fibre of Kolb and Schuele AG to find out the best suitable fibres for this testing method.
