5000|$|The Col. Pepper was {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} for the whiskey business. He was a vocal opponent of the infamous [...] "Whisky Trust" [...] of the 1890s. In 1890 he got the state of Kentucky to change its laws {{so that he could}} bottle his own whisky at his distillery. Before the changes in the law, distillers could only sell their whiskey by the barrel, and if their product was bottled it was because whoever purchased the barrel from the distillery did the bottling. He introduced the idea of a <b>strip</b> <b>stamp</b> with his signature on it to go across the cork, sealing the bottle. He then advertised that if this signature was damaged, the consumer should be wary of purchasing the bottle because someone may have tampered with the whiskey, and it may not contain real Pepper whiskey. The <b>strip</b> <b>stamp</b> became popular and the government used the idea when they passed the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897.|$|E

50|$|A coil stamp {{is a type}} of postage <b>stamp</b> sold in <b>strips</b> one <b>stamp</b> wide.

50|$|In the {{mathematics}} of paper folding, map folding and stamp folding are two problems of counting {{the number of}} ways that a piece of paper can be folded. In the stamp folding problem, the paper is a <b>strip</b> of <b>stamps</b> with creases between them, and the folds must lie on the creases. In the map folding problem, the paper is a map, divided by creases into rectangles, and the folds must again lie only along these creases.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the stamp}} folding problem, {{the paper to}} be folded is a strip of square or {{rectangular}} stamps, separated by creases, and the stamps can only be folded along those creases.In one commonly considered version of the problem, each stamp {{is considered to be}} distinguishable from each other stamp, so two foldings of a <b>strip</b> of <b>stamps</b> are considered equivalent only when they have the same vertical sequence of stamps.For example, there are six ways to fold a strip of three different stamps: ...|$|R
5000|$|In another {{variation}} of the stamp folding problem, the <b>strip</b> of <b>stamps</b> {{is considered to be}} blank, so that {{it is not possible to}} tell one of its ends from the other, and two foldings are considered distinct only when they have different shapes. Turning a folded strip upside-down or back-to-front is not considered to change its shape, so three stamps have only two foldings, an S-curve and a spiral. More generally, the numbers of foldings with this definition are ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{answers the}} problem of {{determining}} how many ways a <b>strip</b> of N <b>stamps</b> can be folded along the perforations so that the stamps are piled {{one on top of}} the other without destroying the continuity of the strip. Using combinatorial arguments, the problem is first solved by an inductive formula for N odd. Part of the computations involved are seen to yield an answer to the case when N is even. Three cases are considered: (1) both, (2) one of, (3) neither, the left end and top of the strip are labeled. If P(N) is the number of folds for a <b>strip</b> of N <b>stamps</b> of type (1), then 1 / 2 P(N) and 1 / 4 P(N) + 1 / 4 S(N) yields formulas for the number of folds for a <b>strip</b> of N <b>stamps</b> of types (2) and (3), where S(N) is the number of symmetric folds of the strip. P(N) also equals the number of ways of joining N dots on a circle by chords of alternating blue and red color without having any chords of the same color intersect. The formulas for P(N) and S(N) are too complicated to give here. However, the first few values are listed by computer as: NP(N) S(N) NP(N) S(N) 3621014060484164114631017855061214637613261448134859145747462181415578923488139220155202690187094536561616861984100...|$|R

The number of strips to be cancelled was always the number of zones travelled plus one, up {{to a maximum of}} 20 <b>strips.</b> The <b>stamped</b> ticket was valid for an hour for two to four strips, up to {{three and a half hours}} for 17 to 20 strips.|$|R
5000|$|Terminal strip construction, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses terminal strips (also called [...] "tag boards").

50|$|He then {{produced}} {{a series of}} Captain Justice stories for Calvert Publications, {{but they had to}} be largely re-drawn to satisfy 1950s censorship rules and regulations, e.g. the hero's face could not be entirely hidden, no flashes could issue from guns, no character could carry an offensive weapon in the hand, and no-one was allowed to be killed. He also wrote and illustrated eight books for Calvert about a war-time American, Kent Blake of the Secret Service. Wedd then created <b>strips</b> for <b>Stamp</b> News (on the history of the stamp) and for Dr T.S. Hepworth's Australian Children's Newspaper, drawing many full page adventure comics, an association which lasted for sixteen years. From 1958 he was a regular contributor to Chuckler's Weekly and for Telegraph Newspapers, with Captain Justice and King Comet.|$|R
50|$|The Regular Issues {{were issued}} in three basic forms, {{consisting}} of sheet-stamps, coil-stamps (long <b>strips</b> of single <b>stamps</b> rolled into a 'coil') and booklet stamps (i.e., six stamps to a leaflet). There were three printings, or series, of stamps released on succeeding dates, the average series being released {{over the course}} of approximately two years.

50|$|Tillie and Mac {{are thought}} to have been the first Tijuana bible stars, along with Maggie and Jiggs from the popular {{newspaper}} strip Bringing Up Father. Tillie was soon followed by Winnie Winkle, Dumb Dora, Dixie Dugan, Fritzi Ritz, Ella Cinders, and other familiar comic <b>strip</b> characters <b>stamped</b> in the same mold. Popeye and Blondie were the most popular cartoon characters appearing in Tijuana bibles in the 1930s, judging by the number of their appearances. The first celebrity bibles were based on real-life newspaper tabloid sex scandals such as the Peaches and Daddy Browning case which made headlines in 1926. Ten years later, an entire series of bibles by one unknown artist obscenely lampooned Mrs. Wallis Simpson and the King of England. By far the most popular celebrity character was Mae West, but virtually every major Hollywood star of the era was featured in the Tijuana bibles, obscenely and libelously.|$|R
