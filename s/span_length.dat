Opened on October 14, 1950, {{it was built in}} the same location as the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which collapsed due to a windstorm on November 7, 1940. It is the older of the twin bridges that make up the Tacoma Narrows Bridge crossing of the Tacoma Narrows, and carried both directions of traffic across the strait until 2007. At the time of its construction, the bridge was, like its predecessor, the third-longest suspension bridge in {{the world in terms of}} main <b>span</b> <b>length,</b> behind the Golden Gate Bridge and George Washington Bridge; it is now the 31st longest suspension bridge in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Mississippi River Bridge Authority, {{known since}} 1989 as the Crescent City Connection Division (CCCD), began {{construction}} of the first span in November 1954, which opened in April 1958 as the Greater New Orleans Bridge. At its opening, the bridge was the longest cantilever bridge in the world, although in terms of main <b>span</b> <b>length</b> it was third after the Forth Bridge and the Quebec Bridge. It carried two lanes of traffic in each direction, and spurred growth in the suburban area known as the West Bank (for its location on the western bank of the river; it is geographically southeast of New Orleans). Construction of the second span began in March 1981. Despite promises {{that it would be}} ready for the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, it did not open to traffic until September 1988. The second span was originally designated as the Greater New Orleans Bridge No. 2. Both bridges were designed by Modjeski & Masters, Inc.. As soon as the new span was opened, the old span was temporarily closed in phases to replace the asphalt-on-steel deck with concrete. All the exits and entrances to the bridge were replaced as well.|$|E

The assigned limitations were useful to analyse the behaviour of submerged pipes in the absence of vortex induced vibration. Therefore, the velocity of sea current and the wave orbital velocity at intermediate depth are computed to determine the in-line and cross-flow net forces acting on spanning submerged pipes. Finally, comparing the yield stresses of pipes with the bending stresses due to external forces, the critical <b>spanning</b> <b>length</b> of high density polyethylene pipes are deduced.

40|$|Traditionally, {{prestressed}} concrete girder bridges {{are limited to}} 150 ft <b>span</b> <b>lengths</b> in Texas due to restrictions on handling and transportation. An effective way of increasing <b>span</b> <b>lengths</b> of precast, {{prestressed concrete}} girder bridges is demonstrated using splicing technique. In spliced girder bridges, precast girder segments are transported in shorter segments for handling and transportation and then spliced together to form long-span continuous bridges. Different methods are explored for construction of spliced girder bridges. Two application examples are developed to demonstrate the design of continuous prestressed concrete spliced girder bridges for both shored and partially shored methods of construction. A three-span bridge having a span configuration of 190 - 240 - 190 ft is considered for both examples. Advantages and dis-advantages of each method of construction are discussed.
