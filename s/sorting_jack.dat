60|$|The {{next day}} the two men-of-war went to sea, and I make no doubt carried off the {{intended}} pirates in them. As for us seamen, we never told our own officers anything about the affair, for I was not quite satisfied with myself, after letting the scoundrels go. One scarcely {{knows what to do}} in such a case, as one does not like to be the means of getting a fellow-creature hanged, or of letting a rogue escape. A pirate, of all scoundrels, deserves no mercy, and yet Jack does not relish the idea of being a <b>sort</b> of <b>Jack</b> Ketch, neither. If the thing were to be done over again, I think I should hold on to my prisoners.|$|R
60|$|Certain small, thin, {{perforated}} discs {{of stone}} found in Scotland have been ingeniously explained as plates to be strung {{together on a}} garment of cloth, a neolithic chiton. However this may be, since Iroquois and Algonquins and Déné {{had some sort of}} woven, or plaited, or wooden, or buff corslet, in addition to their great shields, we may suppose that the Achaeans would not be less inventive. They would pass from the [Greek: linothoraex] (answering to the cotton corslet of the Iroquois) to a <b>sort</b> of <b>jack</b> or jaseran with rings, scales, or plates, and thence to bronze-plate corslets, represented only by the golden breastplates of the Mycenaean grave. Even if the Mycenaeans did not evolve the corslet, there is no reason why, in the Homeric times, it should not have been evolved.|$|R

Strange how alike all these starts are - first on shore, {{steaming}} hot days with a smell of bone-dust and tar and salt water; then the little puffing, panting steam-launch that bustles out across a port with green woody sides, little yachts sliding about, men-of-war training-ships, and then a great big black hulk of a thing with a mass of smaller vessels sticking to it like parasites; and that is one's home being coaled. Then comes the Champagne lunch where everyone says all that is polite to everyone else, and then the uncertainty when to start. So far as we know NOW, we are to start to-morrow morning at daybreak; letters that come later are to be sent to Pernambuco by first mail. [...] .

60|$|A {{thorough}} sailor {{must understand}} much of other avocations. He {{must be a}} bit of an embroiderer, to work fanciful collars of hempen lace about the shrouds; he must be something of a weaver, to weave mats of rope-yarns for lashings to the boats; he must have a touch of millinery, so as to tie graceful bows and knots, such as Matthew Walker's roses, and Turk's heads; he must {{be a bit of}} a musician, in order to sing out at the halyards; he must be a sort of jeweler, to set dead-eyes in the standing rigging; he must be a carpenter, to enable him to make a jurymast out of a yard in case of emergency; he must be a sempstress, to darn and mend the sails; a ropemaker, to twist marline and Spanish foxes; a blacksmith, to make hooks and thimbles for the blocks: in short, he must be a <b>sort</b> of <b>Jack</b> of all trades, in order to master his own. And this, perhaps, in a greater or less degree, is pretty much the case with all things else; for you know nothing till you know all; which is the reason we never know anything.|$|R

5000|$|The {{nature of}} the piece of music, along {{with the nature of}} its appearance, led to a slow {{build-up}} of interest in Electronica as an enigmatic figure.

50|$|Rangers in the MMORPG Midgard Rising are {{masters of}} Curbing beasts. Curbing {{is the term}} used to {{describe}} taming combat pets. The Ranger and pet are {{a force to be}} reconned with in the World of Midgard (WoM). The ranger has a full complement of ranged skills to choose from. They have a multitude of ranged weapons to choose from including various assortments of bows, guns, and crossbows. The ranger is not limited to ranged weapons; they are just as effective in melee combat as well with the use of varying axes, daggers, and claws. The rangers can melee with two handed weapons or are just as at ease dual wielding as well. Rangers have a large arsenal of skills at their disposal; with skills revolving around tracking, scouting, setting snares, and the use of their combat pets, the rangers are always well equipped. The rangers of WoM are able to wear cloth, leather, or mail armour.The ranger is just as at home in a full party of other players providing ranged or melee dps, or crowd control as they are running solo with their trusty pet companions. They are <b>sort</b> of a <b>Jack</b> of all trades class.|$|R
5000|$|... "Let us {{suppose a}} case, which will apply {{in a greater}} or less degree to the majority. In the earlier development, we {{will say that the}} founder of the {{business}} was able, on account of its small size, to make what sketches he needed, solicit orders, see that they were filled, perhaps take a hand at the making if occasion required, see to the shipments, and attend to the collections and the keeping of his few accounts. He finds that the business grows, and eventually places a man in charge of certain branches while he looks after others. The accounts eventually require more attention than he can give them so he engages a bookkeeper in order that he may be relieved of the work. He finds that the quantity of materials received and shipped amount to enough to warrant a receiving clerk as well as a shipping clerk, and, to handle this material from its inception to shipment he conceives the idea of placing a man in charge as stock clerk. He then adds a purchasing agent, in order that he may be relieved of the detail and that purchases may be made most economically; a man is placed in charge of the orders; foremen are placed in charge of certain men in the shops; the details connected with making plans, drawings, estimates, etc., are taken over by a practical man; his manager is given a man to look after the shops or engineering branch; while the commercial branch with its many details is placed in the hands of another. As the evolution continues, the selling branch is assumed by one man; cost details are looked after by another; a chief inspector is added in order that all work may be shipped according to specifications; the engineer, who before had been a <b>sort</b> of <b>jack</b> of all trades, is placed in charge of certain work, while an electrician is engaged to look after this particular work; and so this segregation continues as the development continues.|$|R

It didn't take long for Gloria to lash out at Chloe for dating her son Kevin again. She also offended Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) {{as she tried to}} defend her daughter. Michael and Kevin try to keep her in check. Gloria reveals that she has once again left Jeffrey, and never wants to hear his name again. It is revealed that Jeffrey spent all of Gloria's money and she is now broke. As a result of this, Gloria asks Lauren for a job at Fenmores, which is struggling. After Lauren refuses, Gloria betrays her by telling Jack that she'll help him gain control of Fenmores, with the stipulation that she gains a [...] "small role" [...] in running the company. She then tricks multiple investors into not investing in Fenmores, so that Jack will be Lauren's only option. Jack ends up acquiring 49% percent of Fenmores. Gloria then goes to Jack to cash in the job promise, but is turned away and told she cannot and will not be offered a position. Gloria and Jack later end up drinking together, eventually sleeping together. Gloria attempts to disguise this incident as sexual assault on gossip show GC Buzz, and tries using it to blackmail Jack into giving her some <b>sort</b> of compensation. <b>Jack</b> ends up giving Gloria a job as his executive assistant, which Gloria accepts reluctantly, as she had hoped for a more important job title.
