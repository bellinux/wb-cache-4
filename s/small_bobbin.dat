60|$|He worked mechanically. When a <b>small</b> <b>bobbin</b> ran out, he {{used his}} left hand for a brake, {{stopping}} the large bobbin {{and at the same}} time, with thumb and forefinger, catching the flying end of twine. Also, at the same time, with his right hand, he caught up the loose twine-end of a <b>small</b> <b>bobbin.</b> These various acts with both hands were performed simultaneously and swiftly. Then there would come a flash of his hands as he looped the weaver's knot and released the bobbin. There was nothing difficult about weaver's knots. He once boasted he could tie them in his sleep. And for that matter, he sometimes did, toiling centuries long in a single night at tying an endless succession of weaver's knots.|$|E
50|$|See drawing at right. The Marconi version {{consisted}} of an endless iron band (B) built up of 70 strands of number 40 gage silk-covered iron wire. In operation, the band passes over two grooved pulleys rotated by a wind-up clockwork motor. The iron band {{passes through the}} center of a glass tube which is close wound with a single layer along several millimeters with number 36 gage silk-covered copper wire. This coil (C) functions as the radio frequency excitation coil. Over this winding is a <b>small</b> <b>bobbin</b> wound with wire of the same gauge to a resistance of about 140 ohms. This coil (D) functions as the audio pickup coil. Around these coils two permanent horseshoe magnets are arranged to magnetize the iron band as it passes through the glass tube.|$|E
60|$|He {{took his}} place in one of many long rows of machines. Before him, above a bin filled with <b>small</b> <b>bobbins,</b> were large bobbins {{revolving}} rapidly. Upon these he wound the jute-twine of the <b>small</b> <b>bobbins.</b> The work was simple. All that was required was celerity. The <b>small</b> <b>bobbins</b> were emptied so rapidly, and {{there were so many}} large bobbins that did the emptying, that there were no idle moments.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the boys}} shirked, wasting time and {{machinery}} by not replacing the <b>small</b> <b>bobbins</b> when they ran out. And there was an overseer to prevent this. He caught Johnny's neighbour at the trick, and boxed his ears.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the first}} and second floors {{originally}} housed thirty-four Arkwright water frames which spun 4236 ends simultaneously. This meant that 4236 rovings were continuously twisted together to become threads that were collected on <b>small</b> <b>bobbins.</b> Later mule spinning machines were introduced to produce finer thread types which were in demand. The bobbins were sent to the fifth floor.On the fifth floor, reeling frames wound the spun thread into 'skeins' ready for dyeing at a factory in Milford. Doubling frames twisted two or more single spun thread together to make thicker and stronger thread. The amount of twist imparted determined the thread's properties.|$|R
40|$|Demersal fish, {{shrimp and}} {{cephalopod}} assemblages on the continental shelves and slopes off Angola, Namibia {{and the southern}} and western coasts of South Africa have been monitored in terms of fisheries-independent trawl surveys since the 1980 s. The time series have provided vital input to stock assessments and are widely used in studies of ecology and biodiversity. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the technical specifications of the vessels and trawls used, to examine effects of modifications on catching efficiency, and to assess implications of these modifications over time. We find that the demersal trawl data collected in South Africa are not comparable with those of Namibia and Angola, and that the time series of Angola and Namibia contain inherent differences in terms of catchability of bottom dwellers. The introduction of <b>smaller</b> <b>bobbins</b> gear on the RV Dr. Fridtjof Nansen in 1994 increased the catchability of bottom-dwelling species, and catch rates of monkfish and sole were higher in surveys with commercial vessels than the RV Dr. Fridtjof Nansen. We recommend that temporal trends are interpreted with caution and that time series for the three countries are viewed in isolation...|$|R
5000|$|The Firebird is {{the first}} Gibson solid-body to use neck-through construction, wherein the neck {{extended}} to {{the tail end of}} the body. The neck itself is made up of five plies of mahogany interspersed with four narrow strips of walnut for added strength. Other features were reverse headstock (with the tuners on the treble side) and [...] "banjo"-style planetary geared tuning keys. The special original Gibson Firebird humbucking pickup(s) - single, dual or triple - were smaller footprint versions of standard Gibson humbucking pickups, but were unique in that inside each of their <b>smaller</b> <b>bobbins</b> contained an AlNiCo bar magnet (standard humbucking pickups AND mini-humbucking pickups have one bar magnet that activates the 6 iron slug poles of one bobbin, and 6 iron screw poles of the other bobbin). Original Firebird pickups were also built without any specific bobbin fasteners - their bobbins (and possible [...] "reflector" [...] plate under the bobbins) were held onto the frame during both the wax potting process (to reduce/eliminate feedback and unwanted noise) and the solid metal cover that was soldered to the frame base. There are no screw poles on Firebird pickups. Some Firebirds from 1965 featured Gibson's single-coil P-90 pickup.|$|R
40|$|The opening {{width of}} fatigue crack was very <b>small,</b> and {{conventional}} <b>Bobbin</b> probe {{was very difficult}} to detect it in steam generator tubes. Different sizes of 8 fatigue cracks were inspected using bobbin probe rotating probe. The analysis results showed that, bobbin probe was not sensitive for fatigue crack even for small through wall crack mixed with denting signal. On the other hand, the rotating probe was easily to detect all cracks. Finally, the OD phase to depth curve for fatigue crack using rotating probe was established and the results agreed very well with the true crack size...|$|R
25|$|This {{primitive}} telephone {{was rapidly}} improved. The double electromagnet {{was replaced by}} a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a <b>small</b> coil or <b>bobbin</b> of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.|$|R
