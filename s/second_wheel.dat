5|$|Virginia's second Convention of 1861 was a Unionist {{response}} to the secessionist movement in Virginia. The First Wheeling Convention meeting at Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), sat on May 13–15. It called for elections to another meeting if Virginia's Ordinance of Secession were to pass referendum. After the vote was taken on May 23, the First Session of the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention met from June 11 June 25 to establish the Restored Government of Virginia, electing Arthur I. Boreman its presiding officer. The Second Session of the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention met from August 6 to August 21 {{to call for a}} new state from the territory of Virginia to be named Kanawha.|$|R
2500|$|The Clarkson wind engine {{consisted}} of a rotor or a number of rotors, one behind the other, revolving in a casing with fixed guide vanes between and of opposite pitch {{to those of the}} rotors, and having a further casing to admit a fresh supply of wind to the rotors behind. The cylindrical casings are open at each end with a larger opening facing the wind. The wind catches a number of wheels and feathered vanes fixed to a shaft revolving in bearings inside the casings. When the wind has passed between the vanes of the front wheel it is directed by the guide vanes to the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> and is again taken up by guides and passed to a third wheel and so on, the action each time increasing the effect of the wind on the shaft and improving efficiency. The Clarkson of which an illustration survives (1919) was erected by the Air Power Co. of Prestwich, Cheshire on the estate of Lord Derby. This small engine was designed to work in a [...] wind, but could start under load in a wind of only [...] The wind wheel was only [...] diameter and is designed to lift [...] of water per hour to a height of [...] in a [...] wind, or double that quantity in a [...] wind. All the Air Power wind engines were fitted with roller bearings, a starting and stopping arrangement and an automatic gear to cut off all wind above any desired velocity. They were mounted on a strong steel tower, with a ladder and circular platform.|$|E

"Then {{the left}} wing of the {{monoplane}} came up like a door that slams, some wires whistled past my head, and one whipped off my helmet, and then, with the seat slipping away from me, down we went.

25|$|Unionist {{sentiment}} {{was so high}} in {{the northwestern}} counties that civil government began to disintegrate, and the Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper called for a convention of delegates {{to meet in the}} city of Wheeling to consider secession from the commonwealth of Virginia. Delegates duly assembled, and at the First Wheeling Convention (also known as the May Convention), held May 13 to 15, the delegates voted to hold off on secession from Virginia until Virginia formally seceded from the United States. Concerned that the irregular nature of the First Wheeling Convention might not democratically represent the will of the people, elections were scheduled for June 4 to formally elect delegates to a second convention, if necessary. Virginians voted to approve secession on May 23. On June 4, elections were held and delegates to a <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention elected. These elections were irregular as well: Some were held under military pressure, some counties sent no delegates, some delegates never appeared, and voter turnout varied significantly. On June 19, the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention declared the offices of all government officials who had voted for secession vacant, and reconstituted the executive and legislative branches of the Virginia government from their own ranks. The <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention adjourned on June 25 with the intent of reconvening on August 6.|$|R

Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks.

In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the <b>second</b> <b>wheel,</b> because it is still the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|E
