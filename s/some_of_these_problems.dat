25|$|Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, 1928 was {{a colonial}} {{ordinance}} {{passed by the}} Legislative council of the Nyasaland protectorate, now Malawi, (a body mainly of senior colonial officials, with a minority of nominated members representing European residents) to regulate {{the conditions under which}} African tenants who farmed land on estates owned by European settlers within that protectorate. The legislation corrected some of the worst abuses of the system of thangata, under which tenants were required to work in lieu of paying rent. However, it failed in its intention of encouraging these tenants to increase production on the undeveloped land in those estates because of the world-wide economic downturn in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Tensions between estate owners and tenants continued in the 1940s and early 1950s over evictions and the tenants’ desire to market their produce freely. The legislation was modified in 1952 to meet <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> but only the colonial government's purchase of estate lands to resettle former tenants after 1952 and final abolition of thangata by the Africans on Private Estates Ordinance, 1962, passed shortly before independence, created an African peasantry with free access to farming land.|$|E

Roper {{also noted that the}} new features of Guitar Hero World Tour, particularly the use of [...] "slider notes" [...] that use either the World Tour touchpad or simple tapping without strumming on any other guitar controller's frets, makes many of the more difficult parts of the songs easily passed, requiring less technical skill to complete; Roper cited his ability to easily pass the first solo in what is considered to be the series' most difficult song, [...] "Through the Fire and Flames" [...] in Smash Hits while he could not pass this section on Guitar Hero III. In contrast, Abbie Heppe of G4 TV found the recreation of the note tracking to have [...] "varying degrees of success", noting that while some of the guitar solos are more manageable, there were questionable sections in other songs arising from the nature of Star Power phrases when it was changed in Guitar Hero III. Gerstmann said that the difficulty of the non-lead guitar portions of the game was not as high as that of the lead guitar, primarily due to these songs' having been selected originally for being played by guitar controllers and not by a full band. Heppe suggests that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> {{may be due to the}} farming out of the series to a different developer with no previous experience in the series. However, Bramwell was careful to note that Beenox Studios' effort on the game was strong, particularly with following the Guitar Hero: Metallica model, and their effort should not be dismissed due to how Activision chose to release the title.|$|E

One of the critical issues in order to sustain quality are how companies can improve their commitment management. The concept of commitment management is in this paper focused upon how companies and customers are creating committments and how these committments are fulfilled. The reason for addressing this issue is that we in a number of empirical case studies have found that a lot of quality and efficiency problems can be explained by problems in commitment management and deficiencies in IT-systems in order to support this process.

40|$|Abstract In random {{geometric}} graphs, vertices are randomly distributed on [0; 1] 2 and {{pairs of}} vertices are connected by edges whenever they are sufficiently close together. Layout problems seek a linear ordering of the vertices of a graph such {{that a certain}} measure is minimized. In this paper, we study several layout problems on random geometric graphs. The layout problems that we consider are: Bandwidth, Minimum Linear Arrangement, Minimum Cut, Minimum Sum Cut, Vertex Separation and Bisection. We first prove that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problem</b> remain NP-complete even for geometric graphs. Afterwards, we compute lower bounds that hold with high probability on random geometric graphs. Finally, we characterize the probabilistic behavior of the lexicographic ordering for our layout problems on the class of random geometric graphs...|$|R

2500|$|Solid-state or {{semiconductor}} dimmers {{were introduced}} to solve <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> [...] Semiconductor dimmers switch on at an adjustable time (phase angle) {{after the start of}} each alternating current half-cycle, thereby altering the voltage waveform applied to lamps and so changing its RMS effective value. Because they switch instead of absorbing part of the voltage supplied, there is very little wasted power. Dimming can be almost instantaneous and is easily controlled by remote electronics. [...] This development also made it possible to make dimmers small enough to be used in place (within the pattress) of normal domestic light switches.|$|E

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} complexity of disasters demands utilization {{of knowledge that}} exists outside domains traditionally used in disaster management. To be operationally useful, such knowledge must be extracted, combined with the information generated by the disaster itself, and transformed into actionable knowledge. The process is hampered by the existing, business-oriented approaches to KM, technical issues in access to relevant, multi-domain information/knowledge, and by the executive decision processes based predominantly on historical knowledge. Consequently, as shown by many recent incidents, the management of large scale (mega) disasters is often inefficient and exceedingly costly.
