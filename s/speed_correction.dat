Furthermore, fixed average speed checks (trajectcontrole), which were first introduced in the Netherlands, are now in operation on many motorways in the densely populated Randstad region. In case of speeding, there is a legal <b>speed</b> <b>correction</b> of 3 km/h (3% if over 100 km/h) plus a fixed 3 km/h tolerance margin for posted speed limits up to 120 km/h (i.e. you will be fined from 4 km/h over). For example, when caught at 108 km/h on a national road, one will be fined for exceeding the speed limit by 3.24 km/h. When driving at 107 km/h, no speeding ticket will be issued.|$|E

The draft ISO/CD 11819 - 2 on the Close-Proximity method to measure tyre/road noise stipulates that <b>speed</b> <b>correction</b> {{is needed to}} convert the tyre/road noise level at the sampling speeds to that at the reference speeds.

40|$|A recent {{enhancement}} to estimating {{motor vehicle}} exhaust emissions {{has been the}} development of the Unified Cycle (UC). The UC is currently being used to adjust the LA 4 as part of the calculation for base emission rates in California’s Emission Factor (EMFAC) model. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) believes that the UC will ultimately replace the LA 4 driving cycle as the base driving cycle for inventory purposes. One limitation, however, is that the UC is based on driving characteristics that occurred during the 1992 calendar year. Therefore, as driving behavior changes, the base UC emission rates will need to be corrected to reflect that change. Within the EMFAC model, <b>speed</b> <b>correction</b> factors are applied to account for these changes. As part of an on-going effort to improve the characterization of driving patterns, the Mobile Source Division of the CARB is evaluating new <b>speed</b> <b>correction</b> cycles to replace the existing cycles used in EMFAC. Several Cycles have been developed to speed correct the UC such that we can account for these changes in driving behavior. Similar to the current <b>speed</b> <b>correction</b> cycles, the new Unified Correction Cycles (UCC’s) are differentiated by mean speed for...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{underway}} profilers, sampling the water-column to obtain sound <b>speed</b> <b>corrections</b> {{is no longer a}} detriment to hydrographic survey efficiency. Instead, the challenge has become deciding how many casts are necessary to maintain a desired level of multibeam sounding accuracy, while not needlessly overworking the profiler. Ray tracing uncertainty analysis can determine in hindsight whether a particular sampling interval is adequate or not. Based on this methodology, an algorithm was developed to generate recommended sampling intervals based on successively acquired sound speed profiles, allowing the MVP to run in a “cruise-control” mode where the sampling interval is altered in response to changing oceanographic conditions. In collaboration with Rolls Royce, the algorithm was implemented in Python and loosely couples with the MVP controller software such that the recommended sampling interval can be adjusted without operator intervention.

We have applied this technology {{to the problem of}} locating and determining the orientation of the docking port of a target vehicle with respect to an approaching spacecraft. The system described in this presentation utilizes a multi-processor based computer to digitize and process television imagery and extract parameters such as range to the target vehicle, approach, velocity, and pitch and yaw angles. The processor is based on the Inmos T- 800 Transputer and is configured as a loosely coupled array. Each processor operates asynchronously and has its own local memory. This allows additional processors to be easily added if additional processing power is required for more complex tasks. Total system throughput is approximately 100 MIPS (scalar) and 60 MFLOPS and can be expanded as desired. The algorithm implemented on the system uses a unique adaptive thresholding technique to locate the target vehicle and determine the approximate position of the docking port.

40|$|We have {{combined}} {{differential absorption lidar}} (DIAL) measurements of mercury concentrations downwind of a chloralkali plant (Rosignano Solvay) with measurements of wind profiles made with a Doppler Lidar based on modern fibreoptic technology. Since the flux of pollutant {{is equal to the}} cross-wind integral of the product of concentration and wind speed, this should permit us to make a more precise estimate of the fugitive emission of mercury from the plant than could be obtained by using anemometer measurements of the wind. The flux was estimated to be 54 g Hgh(- 1) using an anemometer on the plant building; 49 g Hgh(- 1) using an anemometer on a nearby 10 m mast; and 48 g Hgh(- 1) using wind <b>speed</b> <b>corrections</b> estimated from the Doppler Lidar measurements. Because of difficulties with the range resolution of the Doppler Lidar, the precision of this estimate was not as good as it should have been, though the difference from the rooftop anemometer remains statistically significant. Corrections of this magnitude are irrelevant to the Rosignano plant, where the emission rate varies strongly with the meteorological conditions. Where a precise estimate of a steady flux is required, however, reliable measurements of the wind profile {{in the wake of the}} source are essential. Doppler Lidar provides a possible method for acquiring such measurements. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A common fan {{model to}} use in {{automotive}} underhood simulations is the Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) model and within the industry, for this specific application, this model is well known to under-predict performance. In a former paper, referenced 2009 - 01 - 0178, a simple 'speed correction' of the MRF model was proposed by the authors. The correction was shown to apply across different operating speeds for a specific fan. In this paper the generality and limitation of this correction across fans of different type, design and dimensions are investigated. Investigated in this paper is as well {{the sensitivity of the}} MRF model to specific methodology of use. In this paper it is shown that the <b>speed</b> <b>correction</b> of 14 % proposed in the former paper applies widely, hence, although the MRF model is erroneous the error is consistent. A 680 mm fan of the similar design to the default (750 mm) choice was simulated and tested, in addition a different 750 mm fan with a more mixed flow design was simulated and tested, and the correction of 14 % was shown to apply for these two fans as well. Furthermore is it also shown that the consistency of the MRF model applies with a consistent methodology of use; in its design, the MRF model needs a dedicated rotational volume around the rotating part, this needs to be chosen consistently by the end-user of the CFD software to achieve a consistent behavior of the MRF model. In this paper we show the sensitivity to the results done by the specific choice of rotational domain.

Wider compensated fields of view than are now seen with conventional AO systems, even those equipped with single laser beacons, will be achieved with less field dependence of the delivered point-spread function. Correction to the diffraction limit over 1 arcmin fields with multi-conjugate AO and partial correction over 5 arcmin with ground-layer AO are anticipated. In this paper, we report preliminary closed-loop results from an adaptive optics system deploying multiple laser guide stars, operating at the 6. 5 m MMT in Arizona, correcting {{the effect of the}} focus term from ground-layer turbulence.
