25|$|To the Greeks, it was {{important}} to root the Olympic Games in mythology. During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.

25|$|The much-anticipated {{second season}} of Serial was {{released}} in December 2015. The subject of Season 2 was met with widespread skepticism. Vastly different from the popular murder-mystery story that Season 1 investigated, Season 2's focus on the <b>story</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who disappeared from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 before being captured by the Taliban and subsequently released in 2014, was contentious {{due in part to}} the controversial views of the soldier's departure from his post and also because of the high-profile court martial proceeding for his alleged desertion.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the {{partitioned}} data {{is to be}} preferred a priori, what prevents one from partitioning the data into arbitrary sub-categories (say based on eye color or post-treatment pain) artificially constructed to yield wrong choices of treatments? Pearl shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. Worse yet, given the same table, one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the aggregated data, depending on the <b>story</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> data, with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl considers {{this to be the}} real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.|$|E
25|$|Palast {{has also}} taken {{issue with the}} {{official}} <b>story</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> grounding of the Exxon Valdez, claiming the sobriety of the Valdezs captain {{was not an issue}} in the accident. According to Palast, the main cause of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 was not human error, but an Exxon decision not to use the ship's radar in order to save money. The Raytheon Raycas radar system would not have detected Bligh Reef itself - as radar, unlike sonar, is incapable of detecting submerged objects. The radar system would have detected the radar reflector, placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping vessels on course via radar.|$|E
