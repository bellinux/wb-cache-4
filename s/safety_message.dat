The paper concludes with a brief list of techniques for writing persuasive <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> This research was conducted because limited research is available on VMS <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> or models for their generation. The literature review indicated that although controversy exists {{regarding the use of}} VMS for <b>safety</b> <b>messages,</b> more drivers would rather have the messages than blank signs; however, certain messages are seen as more useful than others. Further, VMS <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> should not be expected to change the behaviour of all drivers but rather help a small share. The key benefit of this paper is that it proposes a comprehensive framework for generating VMS <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> and describes strategies for writing them.

40|$|Congestion control {{algorithm}} in Vehicular Networks (VANETs) {{has been extensively}} studied. However, most of congestion {{control algorithm}}s are not directly applicable to uni-priority of event-driven <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> The event-driven <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> have stringent requirement on delay and reliability. The unipriority of event-driven <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> are caused by the traffic of the same priority, typically the warning <b>messages</b> of <b>safety</b> applications from different transmitters. The uni-priority messages should be schedule before the node starts the transmitting process. In dense network, {{a large number of}} vehicles broadcast a beacon messages at a high number of frequency. Then the Control Channel (CCH) easily congested. It’s very important to keep the CCH channel free from congestion to ensure timely and reliable delivery of event-driven <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> [9, 20]. Hence, this study takes a closer look at existing congestion control algorithms to solve congestion problems because it affects the performance of <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> The study further exposes the weaknesses and advantages of some of these congestion control algorithms which can assist researchers to tackle the inherent problems of congestions in VANETs. This paper also concludes with a planned future research for disseminating uni-priority of event-driven <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> while solving congestion problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Vehicle safety {{communication}} applications require <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> to {{be received by}} all the targeted vehicles within their lifetime. We propose a piggybacked cooperative repetition approach for reliably broadcasting <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> in VANETs. Repetitions by neighbors that receive the original transmission can effectively cover the areas that are missed in the original transmissions. Moreover, the repetitions are piggybacked by the newly generated messages so that no extra messages are injected into the network. Our experiments show a significant perfor-mance improvement, achieving over 90 % reception rate of <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> at distances up to 200 meters to the sender...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a dedicated {{short range communication}} (DSRC) network based on the IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF) protocol for broadcasting vehicle-to-vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> Reliable delivery of broadcast <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> to all nearby vehicles is an important issue, and is challenging due to the unreliable wireless links, lack of acknowledgments, fast changing network topology and the prevalence of hidden stations. This {{is especially important for}} so-called event messages that have a more stringent requirement for fast and guaranteed delivery than routine <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> In this paper, we propose two mechanisms, which can be implemented on top of standard DCF or EDCA, that use “blind ” retransmissions with no feedback. We then develop a comprehensive analytical model to predict the behavior of the DCF protocol in unsaturated broadcast networks for both types of <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> with and without retransmissions. In particular, we derive explicit expressions for the mean of the total packet delay and the packet delivery ratio (PDR). The model accuracy is validated using ns- 2 simulations. We show that both the retransmission schemes improve the PDR of event messages, with acceptable degradation to that of routine <b>safety</b> <b>messages...</b>|$|R

40|$|Many {{vehicular}} safety applications {{depend on}} the rapid and reliable dissemination of <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> to vehicles at risk. In order to allow sufficient reaction time for emergency events in adverse driving and road conditions, disseminating <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> over multi-hop vehicles is often needed. However, owing to the capacity limitation of the shared control channel, disseminating <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> in highly mobile and dynamic vehicular network conditions is challenging. In this article, a Zero-Coordination Opportunistic Routing (ZCOR) algorithm is proposed to deliver mission-critical life <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> over limited target geocast regions. ZCOR is scalable and robust over dynamic VANET conditions with low rebroadcast overhead. In addition, ZCOR exploits neighbor knowledge for coordinationfree opportunistic packet relay using the novel concept of Circle of Trust (CoT), which defines the range of reliable local neighbor knowledge collection. The performance of ZCOR is evaluated through extensive and realistic simulations capturing time-correlated vehicular channel characteristics...|$|R
30|$|To {{deal with}} the {{interference}} from the periodic <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> and the hidden-node problem, we propose to allocate separate multi-hop time slots to the warning messages. Here, a warning-message sender first suspends the ongoing single-hop transmissions by transmitting a black burst energy signal. After that, the warning message sender reserves the multi-hop time slot by transmitting a long-range CLEAR packet to inform all potential hidden nodes of an incoming transmission. The warning message can then be sent without being interfered by the single-hop <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> If there is no warning message, we allow the time slot {{to be used by}} the <b>safety</b> <b>messages,</b> thus fully utilizing the network resources.|$|R

40|$|After 14 {{years of}} rising death rates due to unintentional {{injuries}} in the U. S., {{it is time to}} ask how <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> can be redesigned to have a greater impact on risky behavior. To this end, many researchers have called for a new, narrative approach to prevention messages [...] based on persuasive stories about people who have suffered injuries and illnesses in the past. Still, there is scant evidence that story-based communications are more effective than equivalent non-narrative messages at changing actual (rather than self-reported) safety and health behavior. Our research examined the impact of injury stories on actual safety behavior in a controlled experimental setting at a US university. Teams of participants assembled a product (a child's swing) using written instructions. The instructions contained <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> targeting assembly mistakes that have been linked to serious injuries in children who play on swings. Participant teams were randomly assigned to three conditions: assembly instructions containing story-based <b>safety</b> <b>messages,</b> instructions with concrete (but non-anecdotal) <b>safety</b> <b>messages,</b> and instructions with traditional abstract <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> After adjustment for covariates, story-based messages resulted in a 19 percent improvement in safety behavior, compared with non-narrative communications. Importantly, injury stories did not create undue fear of the message object, demonstrating that brief anecdotes about accident victims can convince people to take reasonable precautions without creating unwarranted alarm about risks.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} design of layer- 2 {{protocols}} for a vehicle to send <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> to other vehicles. The target is to send vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> with high reliability and low delay. The communication is one-to-many, local, and geo-significant. The vehicular communication network is ad-hoc, highly mobile, and {{with large numbers of}} contending nodes. We design several random access protocols for medium access control. The protocols fit in the DSRC multi-channel architecture. Analytical bounds on performance of the addressed protocols are derived. Simulations are conducted to assess the reception reliability and channel usage of the protocols. The sensitivity of the protocol performance is evaluated under various offered traffic and vehicular traffic flows.

30|$|The WAVE {{standard}} {{proposes that}} the control channel (CCH) should be regularly monitored by all vehicles and optimised for a low latency channel usage scheme. Therefore, CCH will mainly {{be used for}} 1 -hop broadcast high priority <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> and the cooperative <b>safety</b> <b>messages.</b> In our vehicular environment system model, we consider two types of <b>safety</b> <b>messages,</b> namely the ACN and the Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) in the CCH. The ACN is used to warn drivers of crash occurrence and avoid chain collision. There {{are a number of}} event-driven critical collision risk notification services defined in WAVE basic applications standard [18] such as pre-crash sensing, cooperative forward collision, intersection collision and hazardous location warning. Meanwhile, CAM is used to periodically communicate routine vehicular status such as GPS coordinates, speed, direction and vehicle class. It is expected that the two types of <b>safety</b> <b>messages</b> share the same CCH [4, 19, 20]. It is also reasonable to assume that the ACN in CCH suffers no interference from background unicast traffic that is usually transmitted in service channels (SCHs). Therefore, interference is only due to the CAM messages.|$|R
