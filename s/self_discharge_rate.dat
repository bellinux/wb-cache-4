Unlike rechargeable alkaline batteries, NiMH batteries can endure anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand (or more) deep discharge cycles, resulting in a long useful life; their limitation is now more usually by age rather than cycles. Capacity of NiMH batteries is close to that of alkaline batteries. Unlike all alkaline batteries (rechargeable or otherwise), internal resistance is low.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the state of charge(SOC) and life cycle {{evaluation}} algorithm for lead-acid battery, which is essential factor of the electric vehicle(EV) and the stabilization of renewable energy in the smart grid. In order to perform the effective operation of the lead-acid battery, SOC and life cycle evaluation algorithm is required. Specific gravity with the change of electrolyte temperature inside battery case should be obtained to evaluate the SOC of lead-acid battery, however it is difficult to measure the electrolyte temperature of sealed type lead-acid battery. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes the equation of thermal transmission to compensate internal temperature of the lead-acid battery. Also, it is difficult to exactly evaluate the life cycle of battery, depending on the operation conditions of lead-acid battery such as charging and <b>discharging</b> state, <b>self</b> <b>discharging</b> <b>rate</b> and environmental issue.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a larger {{research}} project where two metal hydride forming AB 5 type alloys have been investigated. A slightly non-stoichiometric alloy with mischmetal on A-site and nickel, cobalt, manganese and aluminium on B-site, La 0. 60 Ce 0. 29 Pr 0. 04 Nd 0. 07 Ni 3. 37 Co 0. 79 Mn 0. 25 Al 0. 74, has been characterized. The composition of this material, which will be referred to as Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15, is close to the normal battery composition. The other alloy characterized is LaNi 5 based, where nickel is partly substituted with tin, LaNi 4. 76 Sn 0. 24. This material will later be referred to as La(NiSn) 5. These materials were produced by melt spinning to vary the cooling rate during solidification. The main purpose of the study has been to characterize the electrochemical properties related to battery performance. The production as well as the metallurgical and structural characterization of the materials were performed in another part of the project. For Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 the unit cell volume was dependent on the cooling rate before heat treatment, while the unit cell volume was almost independent of the cooling rate for La(NiSn) 5. For both alloy compositions, the electrochemical properties seemed to change with varying cooling rate. The desorption equilibrium potential, the discharge capacity when discharging at a low current and the deterioration rate were found to be reduced with decreasing unit cell volume and increased with increasing unit cell volume, before heat treatment of Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15. The <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> was observed to be inversely proportional to the unit cell volume for this material. For not heat treated La(NiSn) 5, produced at different cooling rates, the desorption equilibrium potential decreased when the <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> and the discharge capacity increased after cycling for 300 cycles. The deterioration rate decreased when the desorption equilibrium potential was reduced for La(NiSn) 5. The electrochemical parameters both before and after heat treatment of La(NiSn) 5, did not seem to be related to the structural parameters, because the unit cell volume was almost independent of the cooling rate. After heat treatment of both melt spun Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 and La(NiSn) 5, the unit cell volume and the electrochemical properties seemed to be almost independent of the cooling rate, within the experimental error. La(NiSn) 5 showed an effect of storage of the materials. For Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 this effect was weaker. The unit cell volume and the electrochemical parameters after aging were less affected when the cooling rate was varied. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Battery {{management}} during prelaunch activities {{has always}} required special attention and careful planning. The transition from nickel-cadium to nickel-hydrogen batteries, with their high <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> and lower charge efficiency, {{as well as}} longer prelaunch scenarios, has made this aspect of spacecraft battery management even more challenging. The AXAF-I Program requires high {{battery state of charge}} at launch. The use of active cooling, to ensure efficient charging, was considered and proved to be difficult and expensive. Alternative approaches were evaluated. Optimized charging, in the absence of cooling, appeared promising and was investigated. Initial testing was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the 'Adiabatic Charging' approach. Feasibility was demonstrated and additional testing performed to provide a quantitative, parametric data base. The assumption that the battery is in an adiabatic environment during prelaunch charging is a conservative approximation because the battery will transfer some heat to its surroundings by convective air cooling. The amount is small compared to the heat dissipated during battery overcharge. Because the battery has a large thermal mass, substantial overcharge can occur before the cells get too hot to charge efficiently. The testing presented here simulates a true adiabatic environment. Accordingly the data base may be slightly conservative. The adiabatic charge methodology used in this investigation begins with stabilizing the cell at a given starting temperature. The cell is then fully insulated on all sides. Battery temperature is carefully monitored and the charge terminated when the cell temperature reaches 85 F. Charging has been evaluated with starting temperatures from 55 to 75 F...|$|E

The scientific objectives are to determine if ice is present below the Martian surface, measure the local atmospheric pressure, characterize the thermal properties of the martian subsurface soil, and to estimate the vertical temperature gradient of the Martian soil. The battery requirements are 2 - 4 cell batteries, with voltage of 6 - 14 volts, capacity of 550 mAh at 80 C, and 2 Ah at 25 C, shelf life of 2. 5 years, an operating temperature of 60 C and below, {{and the ability to}} withstand shock impact of 80, 000 g's. The technical challenges and the approach is reviewed. The Li-SOCL 2 system is reviewed, and graphs showing the current and voltage is displayed, along with the voltage over discharge time. The problems encountered during the testing were: (1) impact sensitivity, (2) cracking of the seals, and (3) delay in voltage. A new design resulted in no problems in the impact testing phase. The corrective actions for the seal problems involved: (1) pre weld fill tube, (2) an improved heat sink during case to cover weld and (3) change the seal dimensions to reduce stress. To correct the voltage delay problem the solutions involved: (1) drying the electrodes to reduce contamination by water, (2) assemblage of the cells within a week of electrode manufacture, (3) ensure electrolyte purity, and (4) provide second depassivation pulse after landing.
