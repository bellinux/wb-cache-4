Authority {{to occupy a}} block is granted by some sort of central controller, usually a dispatcher, who has the sole authority to grant such access. Before the widespread adoption of radio communications on trains, authority to occupy a block, along with other instructions, were communicated to trains much as timetable train orders were with station agents and trackside telephones. Some railroads, notably the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), had a system of <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> signals activated by wayside operators in stations or interlocking towers {{eliminating the need for}} some trains to stop. [...] This <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> system is still on use on the Long Island Rail Road, which had been a subsidiary of the PRR.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that active compression-decompression would improve resuscitation success in human subjects after cardiac arrest. Background. Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a new method that improves cardiopulmonary hemodynamic function in animal models and humans after cardiac arrest. Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients were assigned to receive <b>standard</b> <b>manual</b> or active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary study end points were spontaneous return of circulation, 24 -h survival and survival to hospital discharge. Results. Fifty-three consecutive patients after cardiac arrest undergoing 64 resuscitation attempts were studied (30 women, 23 men; mean [± SD] age 71 ± 13 years, range 38 to 96). Spontaneous return of circulation was observed in 24 (47 %) of 53 patients and was increased in patients receiving active compression-decompression compared with those receiving <b>standard</b> <b>manual</b> cardiopulmonary resuscitation (15 [60 %] of 25 vs. 9 [32 %] of 28, respectively, p = 0. 042); 24 -h survival was increased (12 [48 %] of 25 vs. 6 [21 %] of 28, respectively, p = 0. 041); and there was a trend toward improved survival to hospital discharge (6 [24 %]of 25 vs. 3 [11 %]of 28, respectively, p = 0. 198) when active compression-decompression was compared with <b>standard</b> <b>manual</b> cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Conclusions. Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation improves return of spontaneous circulation and 24 -h survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation appears to be a beneficial adjunct to <b>standard</b> <b>manual</b> cardiopulmonary resuscitation...|$|R
