40|$|Introduction. Investigating {{the ways}} in which barrier methods such as condoms may affect penile sensory {{thresholds}} has potential relevance to the development of interventions in men who experience negative effects of condoms on sexual response and sensation. A quantitative, psychophysiological investigation examining the degree to which sensations are altered by condoms has, to date, not been conducted. Aim. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine penile vibrotactile <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds</b> in both flaccid and erect penises with and without a condom, while comparing men who do and those who do not report condom-associated erection problems (CAEP). Methods. Penile vibrotactile <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds</b> were assessed among a total of 141 young, heterosexual men using biothesiometry. An incremental two-step staircase method was used and repeated three times for each of four conditions. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for all vibratory assessments. Penile vibratory thresholds were compared using a mixed-model Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Main Outcome Measures. Penile vibrotactile <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds</b> with and without a condom, erectile function measured by International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire (IIEF), and self-reported degree of erection. Results: Significant main effects of condoms (yes/no) and erection (yes/no) were found. No main or interaction effects of CAEP were found. Condoms were associated with higher penile vibrotactile <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds</b> (F(1, 124) = 17. 11, p<. 001). Penile vibrotactile thresholds were higher with an erect than with a flaccid penis (F(1, 124) = 4. 21, p=. 042). Conclusion: The current study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring penile vibratory thresholds with and without a condom in both erect and flaccid experimental conditions. As might be expected, condoms increased penile vibrotactile <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Interestingly, erections were associated with the highest thresholds. Thus, this study was the first to document that erect penises are less sensitive to vibrotactile stimulation than flaccid penises. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|HIV- 1 coreceptor usage must be {{accurately}} determined {{before starting}} CCR 5 antagonist-based treatment as {{the presence of}} undetected minor CXCR 4 -using variants can cause subsequent virological failure. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing of HIV- 1 V 3 env allows to detect low levels of CXCR 4 -using variants that current genotypic approaches miss. However, the computation of the mass of sequence data and the need to identify true minor variants while excluding artifactual sequences generated during amplification and ultra-deep pyrosequencing is rate-limiting. Arbitrary fixed cut-offs below which minor variants are discarded are currently used but the errors generated during ultra-deep pyrosequencing are sequence-dependant rather than random. We have developed an automated processing of HIV- 1 V 3 env ultra-deep pyrosequencing data that uses biological filters to discard artifactual or non-functional V 3 sequences followed by statistical filters to determine position-specific <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds,</b> rather than arbitrary fixed cut-offs.

5000|$|The {{auditory}} <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{have been}} measured behaviorally for one individual young female Indian elephant. The conditioning test for sensitivity requires the elephant {{to respond to}} a stimulus by pressing a button with its trunk, which results in a sugar water reward if the elephant correctly identified the appropriate stimulus occurrence. To determine auditory <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds,</b> a certain frequency of sound is presented at various intensities to see at which intensity the stimulus ceases to evoke a response. The auditory sensitivity curve of this particular elephant began at 16 Hz with a threshold of 65 dB. A shallow slope decreased to the best response at 1 kHz with a threshold of 8 dB, followed by a steep threshold increase above 4 kHz. According to the 60 dB cut-off, the upper limit was 10.5 kHz with absolutely no detectable response at 14 kHz. [...] The upper limit for humans is considered to be 18 kHz. The upper and lower limits of elephant hearing are the lowest measured for any animals aside from the pigeon. By contrast, the average best frequency for animal hearing is 9.8 kHz, the average upper limit is 55 kHz.|$|R

50|$|The moth's body axis {{allows it}} to be more {{sensitive}} to sounds coming from particular directions. Their ears, {{on either side of the}} metathorax, have two sensory cells within the membranes. Though the tuning curves of these cells are identical, the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>thresholds</b> differ, allowing for sound localization and a wider range of sensitivity to sound. The movement of the wings during flight also plays a role, since sound thresholds change with wing position. The neural mechanisms for triggering the acoustic startle response are partially understood. However, there is little known about the motor control of flight that ultrasound initiates.|$|R

Von Frey hair {{is a test}} method wherein a hair-shaped filament is pushed against the target tooth until it bends {{and the intensity of}} the mechanical stimulation applied to the target tooth is varied based on the pre-set filament thickness. With regard to clinical application, we selected von Frey hair because it can be used for simple and quantitative measurement.

50|$|The pressure-cycled {{ventilation}} includes {{pressure control}} ventilation and pressure support ventilation. Both methods offer a set inspiratory pressure. The tidal volume {{varies depending on}} the resistance and elastance of the respiratory system. Pressure-cycled ventilation can help alleviate symptoms in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome by limiting the distending pressure of the lungs. The pressure control ventilation is specifically a pressure-cycled form of assist-control ventilators. Assist-control ventilators describe a mode of ventilation that maintains a minimum respiratory rate {{regardless of whether or}} not the patient initiates a spontaneous breath. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>threshold</b> delivers full pressures support for a fixed inspiratory time. There is maintenance of a minimum respiratory rate. In the pressure support ventilation, the minimum rate is not set. Instead, all breaths are triggered by the patient. The way that the pressure support ventilation works is by assisting the patient with a constant pressure until the patient’s inspiratory flow fallows below a threshold. The longer, deeper inspiratory flows by the patient will result in a larger tidal volume. This method of mechanical ventilation will help patients assume more work of breathing.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{mechanical}} ventilators is {{to deliver a}} constant volume, constant pressure, {{or a combination of}} both with each breath. Any given volume will correspond to a specific pressure on the pressure-volume curve and vice versa in any case. Settings on each mechanical ventilator may include respiratory rate, tidal volume, trigger sensitivity, flow rate, waveform, and inspiratory/expiratory ratio. The volume-cycled ventilation includes the volume-control function and delivers a set tidal volume. The pressure is not a fixed number but it varies with resistance and capacitance of the respiratory system. The volume-cycled ventilation is the simplest and most efficient of providing ventilation to a patient’s airway compared to other methods of mechanical ventilation. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the set <b>sensitivity</b> <b>threshold</b> will be accounted for and fixed to the delivery of the corresponding tidal volume. If the patient does not breathe enough, then the volume-cycled ventilation will initiate a breath for the patient to bring up the breathing rate to the minimum respiratory rate. The synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a similar method of mechanical ventilation that also delivers breaths at a fixed rate and volume that corresponds to the patient’s breathing. Unlike the Volume-Cycled Ventilation, patient efforts above the fixed rate are unassisted in the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV).|$|E
