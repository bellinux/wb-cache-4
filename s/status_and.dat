Does a person who has personal knowledge of prejudice, for example, those of minority status have less prejudice towards others? There has been considerable research on the prejudice that the majority might feel towards minorities but there is limited research on minorities? prejudice towards others. The current study focuses on the relationship between a person of self-perceived minority <b>statuses</b> <b>and</b> her or his feelings of prejudice towards others (e. g. minorities and mainstream). Previous research had found a positive correlation between fundamentalism and prejudice. This study investigated that relationship and a positive correlation was found. Another aspect that has been studied in previous research, dealing with prejudice and self reports, is social desirability. This study investigated the relationship between social desirability <b>and</b> multiple minority <b>statuses</b> <b>and</b> no statistical significance was found. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to investigate the relationship between multiple minority <b>statuses</b> <b>and</b> prejudice.

5|$|A low {{pressure}} persisted {{toward the end}} of April between Diego Garcia and the equator. It developed a spiral area of convection on April24, which preceded the development of a tropical disturbance the next day. By that time, the system was already at tropical storm <b>status</b> <b>and</b> was given the name Karla. Moving southwest, the storm strengthened and organized. A ridge to the south steered Karla to the east on April27, although an approaching trough turned it to the southeast on the following day. Enhanced atmospheric instability helped the storm strengthen to tropical cyclone status on April29. On the next day, Karla attained peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) after developing a well-defined eye. Increased wind shear and progressively cooler waters weakened the cyclone as it turned more to the south. By May3, the storm weakened to tropical depression <b>status</b> <b>and</b> dissipated the next day within the westerlies.|$|E
