Taylor's neighbor Faith MacLean likely saw the murderer leaving Taylor's bungalow, and said the person she made eye contact with (and who <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her)</b> {{may have been a}} woman dressed as a man, in clothes which were [...] "like my idea of a motion picture burglar".|$|E
2500|$|A Mandarin {{announces the}} law of the land (Aria – Popolo di Pechino! – [...] "People of Peking!"). The Prince of Persia has failed to answer the three riddles, and he is to be {{beheaded}} at the next moonrising. As the crowd surges towards the gates of the palace, the imperial guards brutally repulse them, causing a blind old man to be knocked to the ground. The old man's slave-girl, Liù, cries out for help. A young man hears her cry and recognizes that the old man is his long-lost father, Timur, the deposed king of Tartary. The young Prince of Tartary is overjoyed at seeing Timur alive, but still urges Timur to not speak his name because he is afraid that the Chinese rulers, who have conquered Tartary, may kill or harm them. Timur then tells his son that, of all his servants, only Liù has remained faithful to him. When the Prince asks her why, she tells him that once, long ago in the palace, the Prince had <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> (Trio with chorus – The crowd, Liù, Prince of Tartary, Timur: Indietro, cani! – [...] "Back, dogs!").|$|E
