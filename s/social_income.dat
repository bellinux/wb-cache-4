5000|$|Two {{conditions}} are indispensable {{if we are}} to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total <b>social</b> <b>income</b> grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security and stability.|$|E
50|$|People often seek a {{comparison}} between the price of an item in the past, {{and the price of}} an item today. Over short periods of time, like months, inflation may measure the role an object and its cost played in an economy: the price of fuel may rise or fall over a month. The price of money itself changes over time, as does the availability of goods and services as they move into or out of production. What people choose to consume changes over time. Finally, concepts such as cash money economies may not exist in past periods, nor ideas like wage labour or capital investment. Comparing what someone paid for a good, how much they had to work for that money, what the money was worth, how scarce a particular good was, what role it played in someone's standard of living, what its proportion was as part of <b>social</b> <b>income,</b> and what proportion it was as part of possible social production is a difficult task. This task is made more difficult by conflicting theoretical concepts of worth.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers and the income security of the working poor. The specific {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the poverty reduction effect of <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers among the working poor from 1998 to 2005, during the pre NBLSA period (from 1998 to 2001) and the post NBLSA period (from 2002 to 2005). Particularly, this study compared the effect sizes of <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers and private income transfers on poverty reduction. While the main target population of this study was the working poor, this study also examined poverty reduction of the non-working poor as well. ^ To achieve the study aim, this study used the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS), a nine-year panel dataset that includes 5, 000 households with 13, 300 individual cases. This study consists of cross-sectional macro-level analysis and longitudinal micro-level analysis. First, by employing a macro-level approach, this study examined the overall poverty reduction effectiveness of the current <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers among the working poor. Second, by employing a micro-level approach, this study also examined the impact of <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers and poverty reduction dynamics of individual households. ^ The results of the macro-level analysis supported most of the hypotheses. First of all, both <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers and private income transfers have reduced the poverty rate and the aggregate poverty gap among the working poor as well as among the non-working poor over the nine-year period. The micro-level analysis identified elements affecting the poverty gap and the propensity to escape from poverty of individual households. ^ The empirical evidence indicates that the NBLSA has significantly improved the poverty reduction effect of <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers especially for the working poor. As such, it seems that the NBLSA has succeeded in accomplishing its intended goal, which was to expand the coverage of social welfare to the working poor. Another implication of the present study involves the family type and the effect of income transfers. As shown in micro-level analysis, while <b>social</b> <b>income</b> transfers more effectively reduce the poverty gap among no children families, they are relatively less effective among two-parent with children families. ...|$|E

(2010) An Opportunity for Renewal: The Participatory Process and <b>Social</b> and <b>Income</b> Diversity in Brownfield Developments Urban and Regional Planning, {{advanced}} level, master thesis for master exam in Urban and Regional Planning, 30 ECTS credits. Supervisor: Dr. Thomas Borén Language: English   Participatory {{planning and}} the redevelopment of brownfield locations have both figured prominently in urban and regional planning strategies in recent decades. Despite their growing importance, these trends have rarely been analysed in concert however. Further, {{the issues of}} <b>social</b> and <b>income</b> diversity within this context have received less attention. In recognizing this void, this paper explores the use of participatory planning in brownfield developments, {{with an emphasis on}} <b>social</b> and <b>income</b> diversity. Through a review of the participatory planning theories of communicative action and the just city, strategies for promoting participatory planning and <b>social</b> and <b>income</b> diversity, are identified. A case study of Norra Djurgårdsstaden, a brownfield development in Stockholm, Sweden is employed to analyse these strategies. In undertaking the case study, data was collected through interviews and planning documents. This study found that the inherently high cost of redeveloping brownfield locations inhibits <b>social</b> and <b>income</b> diversity and requires an overt response to mitigate it. Participatory planning offers the possibility of engaging stakeholders who may otherwise be ignored, providing the opportunity to create a more inclusive development. It is also clear that an inclusionary goal must be part of a wider strategy, or is otherwise likely to be ignored...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade the {{developing}} countries have tried much harder to achieve macroeconomic stability than they have to eliminate inefficiencies from microeconomic distortions. The author has pursued a relatively new line of inquiry in examining measurement of the <b>social</b> <b>income</b> losses induced by {{the reduction of the}} investment efficiency caused by trade distortions. Empirical findings of the study suggest a strong negative effect of trade distortions on the social efficiency of investment. The <b>social</b> <b>income</b> losses caused by the reduced investment efficiency are considerable. Countries that have a moderate investment ratio (about 20 percent of GDP) can experience <b>social</b> <b>income</b> losses in excess of 18 percent in 30 years, if tariffs are about 50 percent. This study confirms earlier findings about the relatively modest efficiency losses caused by the independent effects of specific distortions. The author alsofound a significant synergistic effect when trade and wage distortions coexist and lead to larger efficiency losses. The key issue is the combination of price distortions favoring capital-intensive activity with wage distortions that cause unemployment and underemployment. This pattern is pervasive in developing countries.

Our results are also consistent with the statements made by Schultz and Ruttan that ignoring price supports will result in all over (or under) valuation of research benefits. Finally, we indicate that the predictions of the "no gains from research" literature may not be substantiated by empirical evidence and that the ideal normative model should include endogenous farm income levels as well.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} social {{transfers}} on individual participation and working hours are theoretically shown to differ for unitary and bargaining intrahousehold allocation models. This result {{is attributed to}} both the non-transferability of in-kind social transfers and differences in control of these transfers among household members. Using elasticities of social transfers on work effort (estimated through sample selection corrected participation probits and working hour OLS), new tests on intrahousehold allocation are developed for Chile. These tests strongly reject the unitary model and exogenous bargaining, accepting endogenous bargaining only among non-poor households. Poor households may use <b>social</b> <b>incomes</b> as investments for the future rather than for short-term strategic power relations...|$|R

40|$|Casualisation {{has both}} {{negative}} and positive sides, for both workers and employers. This article considers how the positive sides could be developed while allowing casual work to continue to grow. In reviewing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of casual labour for employers, the paper depicts casualisation (and the related process of 'informalisation’) as usually involving seven forms of economic insecurity for the worker. The modern casualisation that is taking place as part of globalisation involves a steady restructuring of <b>social</b> <b>income</b> and labour recommodiﬁcation, in which many workers are ﬁnding that an increasing share of their remuneration is coming from money wages, which are a relatively insecure part of their <b>social</b> <b>income.</b> As a result, there is a need to ﬁnd new ways of providing income security that could allow workers to accept the more casual work arrangements without excessive anxiety and alienation. The article is, essentially, an argument for a re-assertion of a common sense of social solidarity, in which casual work can be a normal part of a ﬂexible labour and work system...|$|E
