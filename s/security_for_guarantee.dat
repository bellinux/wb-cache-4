40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of various big data applications and resource demand from Internet data centers (IDCs), the energy cost has been skyrocketing, and it attracts {{a great deal of}} attention and brings many energy optimization management issues. However, the <b>security</b> problem <b>for</b> a wide range of applications, which has been overlooked, is another critical concern and even ranked as the greatest challenge in IDC. In this paper, we propose an energy cost minimization (ECM) algorithm with job <b>security</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>for</b> IDC in deregulated electricity markets. Randomly arriving jobs are routed to a FIFO queue, and a heuristic algorithm is devised to select <b>security</b> levels <b>for</b> <b>guaranteeing</b> job risk probability constraint. Then, the energy optimization problem is formulated by taking the temporal diversity of electricity price into account. Finally, an online energy cost minimization algorithm is designed to solve the problem by Lyapunov optimization framework which offers provable energy cost optimization and delay guarantee. This algorithm can aggressively and adaptively seize the timing of low electricity price to process workloads and defer delay-tolerant workloads execution when the price is high. Based on the real-life electricity price, simulation results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The IEC 61850 {{standard}} {{not only}} defines a new structure for substation automation, but also can provide more enhanced communication functionalities. The standard defines {{several kinds of}} messages for data exchange between nodes in the substation. Among them, two messages, sample values and GOOSE, play critical roles for substation protection. Because of their importance in the secure substation operation, any compromising of these messages should be prohibited. Along with the requirement of secure transmission, these messages have very stringent performance requirement. So any security algorithm {{that can be applied}} for secure exchange of these messages should not violate the performance criteria. In this paper we consider the <b>security</b> protocol <b>for</b> <b>guaranteeing</b> the message authentication and integrity. And we evaluate the security protocol and examine whether the protocol can meet this criteria by experiment...|$|R

40|$|Providing <b>security</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>for</b> {{wireless}} communication {{is critically important}} for today's applications. While previous {{work in this area}} has concentrated on radio frequency (RF) channels, providing <b>security</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>for</b> RF channels is inherently difficult because they are prone to rapid variations due small scale fading. Wireless optical communication, on the other hand, is inherently more secure than RF communication due to the intrinsic aspects of the signal propagation in the optical and near-optical frequency range. In this paper, secure communication over wireless optical links is examined by studying the secrecy capacity of a direct detection system. For the degraded Poisson wiretap channel, a closed-form expression of the secrecy capacity is given. A complete characterization of the general rate-equivocation region is also presented. For achievability, an optimal code is explicitly constructed by using the structured code designed by Wyner for the Poisson channel. The converse is proved in two different ways: the first method relies only on simple properties of the conditional expectation and basic information theoretical inequalities, whereas the second method hinges on the recent link established between minimum mean square estimation and mutual information in Poisson channels.
