40|$|This study explores {{practical}} school {{leadership and}} management, as enacted by women. The study, conducted in an interpretive paradigm, attempts {{to gain an}} understanding of women’s subjective experiences of school leadership and management. Two women principals from Ondangwa West Educational Region were interviewed. The two were selected through consultations with one of the <b>senior</b> <b>inspectors</b> in the region. Both had been principals for more than ten years and were seen by those who are concerned with their school to be successful. The study found that these women prefer a participative style of leadership and management, characterised by consultations with others, teamwork, collaborative decision-making and the use of power to empower others. They also strive for good human relationships because they believe that it fosters mutual respect, trust, openness and a good working atmosphere. All these human centred approaches are directed towards creating a school atmosphere that is conducive to teaching and learning and therefore result in effective schooling and quality educational outcomes. They do not experience gender discrimination in their work places. They have the full support of their supervisors. Though both are married with children, these dual roles do not prevent them from being successful in their professional work. In fact they have reached a stage where they feel confident as leaders and feel that they are acting as role models for fellow women principals and those aspiring to this position. The study concludes that the styles of leadership and management displayed by women are similar to those that are universally accepted as characteristics needed for effective school management and leadership. Though these leadership styles are traditionally associated with women, these characteristics are not gender specific. Therefore it will be {{in the best interest of}} schools, if school principals, both men and women, could borrow from these qualities in order to change schools from authoritarian to more democratic institutions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} decades, the patient {{perspective}} {{on health care}} quality has been unconditionally integrated into quality management. For several years now, patient rating sites have been rapidly gaining attention. These offer a new approach toward hearing the patient's perspective {{on the quality of}} health care. Objective: The aim of our study was to explore whether and how patient reviews of hospitals, as reported on rating sites, have the potential to contribute to health care inspector's daily supervision of hospital care. Methods: Given the unexplored nature of the topic, an interview study among hospital inspectors was designed in the Netherlands. We performed 2 rounds of interviews with 10 <b>senior</b> <b>inspectors,</b> addressing their use and their judgment on the relevance of review data from a rating site. Results: All 10 Dutch senior hospital inspectors participated in this research. The inspectors initially showed some reluctance to use the major patient rating site in their daily supervision. This was mainly because of objections such as worries about how representative they are, subjectivity, and doubts about the relevance of patient reviews for supervision. However, confrontation with, and assessment of, negative reviews by the inspectors resulted in 23 % of the reviews being deemed relevant for risk identification. Most inspectors were cautiously positive about the contribution of the reviews to their risk identification. Conclusions: Patient rating sites may be of value to the risk-based supervision of hospital care carried out by the Health Care Inspectorate. Health care inspectors do have several objections against the use of patient rating sites for daily supervision. However, when they are presented with texts of negative reviews from a hospital under their supervision, it appears that most inspectors consider it as an additional source of information to detect poor quality of care. Still, it should always be accompanied and verified by other quality and safety indicators. More research on the value and usability of patient rating sites in daily hospital supervision and other health settings is neede...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{builds on}} {{previous}} {{studies on the}} linguistic situation, attitudes and domains of language use in the Maghreb countries undertaken by Marley (2000, 2004, 2005, 2008) in Morocco, Benrabah (2007 a, 2007 b), in Algeria, and by Jabeur (1999) Daoud (2001, 2011 a, 2011 b) and Bahloul (2001) in Tunisia. It explores the shifts in the domains of language use, the differences in linguistic attitudes between generations in Tunisia and {{the role played by}} globalisation in this process. In order to investigate the ways in which domains of use and attitudes to English and French are shifting, a questionnaire was administered to a group of 100 teachers aged 40 to 60 and a group of 200 students aged 17 to 19. SPSS data analyses showed some statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups. With respect to domains of use, the younger group uses significantly more English as a lingua franca, in chatting online, reading for pleasure, watching TV programmes and listening to songs. Teachers, by contrast, use significantly more French in activities such as reading and watching TV programmes. French remains the preferred foreign language of the older generation, but they believe it is threatened by English in Tunisia, whereas the younger generation preferred English. One main reason for these differences could be what the older generation consider to be the negative impact of globalisation on French and its positive impact on English. Interesting qualitative data were also extracted from the responses to a vox pop questionnaire submitted to 100 lay people in the street and from essays written by two groups of 25 students. These confirmed that the majority of Tunisians consider English to be the most useful foreign language in Tunisia and that it should be given more importance in academic settings due to its world status as an international lingua franca. This thesis also investigates language policy in Tunisia by analysing all relevant extracts from the speeches of Ben Ali, Tunisia’s ex-president, and interviews conducted with the three <b>senior</b> <b>inspectors</b> of the three main languages. Policy has promoted English over French in two ways: first, Arabic rather than French is now the vehicle for the teaching of the human and natural sciences in the Basic Education and, second, new measures in favour of English have simultaneously been taken in and outside academia. To conclude, the findings of this study contribute to knowledge in three ways: Firstly, by identifying differences in domains of language use and attitudes between generations in contemporary Tunisia, secondly, by scrutinizing the way students, teachers and lay people feel about French and English, the two main rival foreign languages in the country and, thirdly, by exploring the political discourse which influences the language situation both directly, through language policy, and indirectly, through hearts and minds...|$|E

40|$|Context: Responsive {{regulation}} is a dominant analytic framework in regulation. The Dutch Healthcare Inspectorate has explicitly embraced this theory {{for its own}} regulation and enforcement strategies, also because it would make their enforcement more transparent and proportional to healthcare providers. Quite literally aspects of the theory, as for instance an enforcement pyramid, {{can be found in}} policy documents. But how does the theory of responsive regulation fit into the reality of and the evidence on making enforcement decisions? The focus of this research is on the translation of responsive regulation into an enforcement guideline and on the actual decision-making process. Methods: The study focussed on the decisions inspectors of the Dutch Healthcare Inspectorate make concerning enforcement. We investigated how these decisions are made, which (type of) arguments play a central role and how inspectors {{may or may not be}} helped by their current guideline for enforcement. First, documents were analysed and interviews conducted with persons who had commissioned, written or helped setting up the guideline. This was done in order to get to a reconstruction of policy theories. Next, to gather evidence on the decision making process we conducted interviews with the principal actors in this process, (<b>senior)</b> <b>inspectors</b> and legal advisors. Also, an internal schooling day on enforcement decisions at the Inspectorate was observed. Finally, a group discussion was organised to see whether the findings could be validated and generalised and to arrive at the formulation of key points and suggestions. Finally, policy objectives and evidence were compared and recommendations were made. Results: The study shows how the regulatory theory of responsive regulation has been translated in practice and brings to the fore several practical and juridical impediments that hinder truly responsive regulation. In practice for instance, the proportionate 'weight' of an enforcement measure that forms the core of the regulatory pyramid, is much harder to determine and much more subject to sector specific variation than the theory states. Also, the supposed effectiveness of the measures plays a great role in practice but finds hardly any mention in the guideline. The study thus provides further insights into the decision-making process and the legal, practical and ethical dilemmas that individual inspectors may encounter during their enforcement work. Discussion: Since there is growing criticism on the lack of empirical tests to prove the validity of the assertions made in Responsive Regulation (Six, 2013) this study is a welcome addition to the body of evidence on regulatory theories. It shows which aspects of the decision making process are and which aren't suited for further protocolisation. Since enforcement measures may have great impact on care providers, this knowledge may help to further increase uniformity in practice and transparency about the decision-making towards care providers. The study demonstrates the need for a further elaboration of concepts such as the 'weight' of regulatory measures and the supposed effectiveness of measures. It stresses the need for further evidence on regulatory decisions, their outcomes and effects on care providers and provides suggestions as to which aspects of the regulatory decision-making process would be helped by standardisation in the form of a guideline...|$|E
40|$|We publish here Henry Philip's {{updating}} of {{his earlier}} history of Scottish school examinations, taking the account {{to the end of}} the twentieth century. His first volume, published in 1992 by the Scottish Examination Board as The Higher Tradition, took the story from the founding of the modern system in 1888 to the late 1980 s; it is now an indispensable guide to the subject, and hence also to the whole development of Scottish secondary schools in the period. This latest volume takes the story to the threshold of the significant reforms to it that were put in place in 1999 - 2000. The details of the recent changes charted here by Mr Philip are of importance in themselves, affecting as they have done the lives of almost everyone who has attended school in Scotland in the past twenty years. In that sense, this more recent volume deals with matters of far greater social significance than most of the first volume, which covered periods when the examination system affected the schooling of only a minority of students. The final stages of that earlier account did track the rapid expansion of examinations that took place in the three decades from the early 1960 s, but the culmination of this aim of assessing everyone in the hope of providing opportunity for everyone was not reached until the late 1990 s. Mr Philip's story thus contributes to our understanding of a fundamental shift in our view of what schooling is about. Running through that enormous change, however, even from the earliest days when the old Leaving Certificate catered for no more than about 4 per cent of the school population, was a sense of continuity, of old educational values, which were deemed to be typical of Scottish culture itself, being gradually extended to ever-widening social groups and hence being constantly democratised. That sense of permanence through change was brought into dispute in the period covered by Mr Philip here, and is increasingly a matter of controversy with the impending new reform of the curriculum and examination system that has been in the making since around 2002, with the support of most shades of political and educational opinion. In that sense, Mr Philips work here, finishing (by coincidence) at the moment when the Scottish Parliament took responsibility for Scottish education, is also an account of the end of a system that now seems quite firmly in the past, although laying the basis for what is now being debated. The process of change described by Mr Philip is also of great interest to any student of Scottish policy making, whether or not they are concerned with the specifics of educational policy. This is the most detailed study we yet have of any area of policy making in the final decade of the old Scottish Office, and his account of the development of the examination system will remain definitive at least until all the relevant official archives are released, which will not be until 2030 or even possibly 2050. Mr Philip has been given access to many revealing internal papers, and is able to investigate in detail the exchanges among ministers, officials and <b>senior</b> <b>inspectors</b> of education. He is thus able (in Chapter 5) to explain more cogently than any previous writer on this subject what happened between the proposals to reform the examination system that were made in 1992 by the official committee chaired by Professor John Howie and the policy pronouncements by the Scottish Office in its Higher Still proposals of 1994 onwards. The picture that emerges is of a Scottish Office that still contained a great deal of creative energy, and of ministers who did not demur at making radical changes even when their political and constitutional position seemed increasingly precarious. This was not a governing system in terminal decline despite the assumptions of much public political debate in the 1990 s and all those involved appear, in Mr Philip's account, to be seeking to lead a consensus that would command popular support. But it also remained a process that was largely invisible to public scrutiny, unlike the more recent debates in and around the Scottish parliament (not the least of which was about the near-collapse of the new examinations system in 2000). Mr Philip's careful exploration of the old policy-making system thus provides opportunities for comparison with the new governing structures that have been developed since 1999.
