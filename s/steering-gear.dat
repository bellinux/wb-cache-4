60|$|Kit nodded, swayed his {{strength}} and weight tentatively on the <b>steering-gear,</b> and headed the boat for the plunge.|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't {{break the}} <b>steering-gear,</b> did you?" [...] asked Dave, anxiously, as he allowed the {{flashlight}} to play {{over and around}} the touring-car.|$|E
6000|$|... "My <b>steering-gear</b> jammed {{just after}} I went down, and I {{had to go}} round in circles till I got it {{straightened}} out. But wasn't he a mug!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And my blasted <b>steering-gear</b> {{went and}} chose then to go wrong," [...] the other {{commander}} mourned. [...] "I thought his last little egg {{was going to}} get me!" ...|$|E
60|$|He and Jukes {{looked at}} each other, and the same thought came into their heads. The Captain! Everything must have been swept away. <b>Steering-gear</b> gone--ship like a log. All over directly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you feel}} {{strong enough to}} prevent the rudder taking charge if she gets {{sternway}} on her? It wouldn't do to get something smashed about the <b>steering-gear</b> now. We've enough difficulties to cope with as it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Of course, I'll do what I can, Mr. Turtle,' and Jimmy {{bristled}} {{around like}} a red and green auto that's gone wrong in its <b>steering-gear.</b> 'Suppose you show me the tooth and perhaps I can pull the thing out for you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “The Merrimac’s <b>steering-gear</b> broke {{as she got}} to Estrella Point. Only {{three of}} the torpedoes on her side {{exploded}} when I touched the button. A huge submarine mine caught her full amidships, hurling the water high in the air, and tearing a great rent in her side.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>steering-gear</b> {{leaped into}} an abrupt short clatter, stopped {{smouldering}} like an ember; and the still man, with a motionless gaze, burst out, {{as if all}} the passion in him had gone into his lips: [...] "By Heavens, sir! I can steer for ever if nobody talks to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|With a wild leap, {{like the}} leap {{of a man}} {{suddenly}} shot, the captain left her side and rushed on to the bridge. At the same instant the engine-bell rang and the steering-chains began to rattle furiously on the rollers at her feet as the steam <b>steering-gear</b> did its work. Then came another yell-- ...|$|E
60|$|Rea soon {{manifested}} {{himself as}} a man of few words and much action. With the planks Jones had on board he heightened the stern and bow of the boat to keep out the beating waves in the rapids; he fashioned a <b>steering-gear</b> and a less awkward set of oars, and shifted the cargo so as to make more room in the craft.|$|E
60|$|I have a plan, {{but it is}} {{not worth}} while putting into {{execution}} unless its need becomes imperative. In the darkness of night it would be an easy trick to disconnect the <b>steering-gear</b> from the short tiller on the rudder-head, and then, by re-rigging the preventer tackles, steer {{from both sides of the}} poop well enough for'ard to be out of the range of the ventilator.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{the wheel}} relieved. Hackett {{began to sing}} {{out that he was}} done. He's lying in there {{alongside}} the <b>steering-gear</b> with a face like death. At first I couldn't get anybody to crawl out and relieve the poor devil. That boss'n's worse than no good, I always said. Thought I would have had to go myself and haul out one of them by the neck." ...|$|E
6000|$|After noon, {{when they}} had left the Park and entered Gardiner, Milt announced, [...] "I've got to stick around a while. The key in my <b>steering-gear</b> seems to be worn. May {{have to put in}} a new one. Get the stuff at a garage here. If you wouldn't mind waiting, be awful glad to tag, and try to give a few helping hands till the oil cleans itself out." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{rubbed the}} glasses and looked again. There were two towropes; Terrier plunged across the rollers on Arcturus' {{starboard}} bow, the Spanish tug to port. It {{looked as if}} the wreck's <b>steering-gear</b> did not work. Spray blew about the boats and the crested seas broke in foaming turmoil against the towed vessel's side until she drew in behind the Isleta. A few minutes afterwards she swung round the mole and Barbara thought the picture moving.|$|E
6000|$|... "The North Dakota did {{not take}} part in the {{movement}} of the morning of May 1. This was due to a slight accident of the preceding night that temporarily disabled her <b>steering-gear.</b> The morning of May 1 broke clear and calm. There was a slight breeze from the south-west that quickly died away. The North Dakota lay twelve miles off the island. At the signal the squadrons charged in upon the island, from all sides, at full speed. Our wireless receiver continued to tick off warnings from the island. The ten-mile limit was passed, and nothing happened. I watched through my glasses. At five miles nothing happened; at four miles nothing happened; at three miles, the New York, in the lead on our side of the island, opened fire. She fired only one shot. Then she blew up. The rest of the vessels never fired a shot. They began to blow up, everywhere, before our eyes. Several swerved about and started back, but they failed to escape. The destroyer, Dart XXX, nearly made the ten-mile limit when she blew up. She was the last survivor. No harm came to the North Dakota, and that night, the <b>steering-gear</b> being repaired, I gave orders to sail for San Francisco." ...|$|E
60|$|If the <b>steering-gear</b> did {{not give}} way, if the immense volumes of water did not burst the deck in or smash one of the hatches, if the engines {{did not give}} up, if way could be kept on the ship against this terrific wind, {{and she did not}} bury herself in one of these awful seas, of whose white crests alone, topping high above her bows, he could now and then get a sickening glimpse--then there was a chance of her coming out of it. Something within him seemed to turn over, {{bringing}} uppermost the feeling that the Nan-Shan was lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, I {{have really}} not {{had time to}} enquire. Till we left Barbados I was {{constantly}} employed, and {{on my way out}} I have kept close to the Spartane {{in order to be able}} to assist at once if anything went wrong with the <b>steering-gear.</b> I should wish to say, sir, that I feel under the deepest obligations to Captain Talbot for the great assistance that he and his crew have rendered me in getting up the jury-mast, and fitting up the temporary rudder. Had it not been for that I might have been detained for some time at Barbados." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{situation}} is hopelessly grotesque. We {{in the high}} place command the food of the Elsinore, but the mutineers have captured her <b>steering-gear.</b> That is to say, they have captured it without coming into possession of it. They cannot steer, neither can we. The poop, which is the high place, is ours. The wheel is on the poop, yet we cannot touch the wheel. From that slitted opening in the ventilator-shaft {{they are able to}} shoot down any man who approaches the wheel. And with that steel wall of the chart-house as a shield they laugh at us as from a conning tower.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was indeed}} the case. The {{electric}} pinnace went off as he spoke, her steam-engines, <b>steering-gear,</b> {{and all the other}} apparatus being regulated by electric wires, which were [...] "paid out" [...] from the ship as the boat proceeded on her mission of supposed extreme danger. Right under the withering fire of the imaginary enemy's batteries she went, and having scorned the rain of small shot that swept over her like hail, and escaped the plunging heavy shot that fell on every side, she dropped a mine over her stern, exploded it by means of a slow fuse, turned round and steamed back in triumph, amid the cheers of the spectators.|$|E
60|$|They {{found her}} {{there in the}} morning. She lay on her side motionless, half buried in the sand, upturned towards the blue Highland sky, serene now after {{the passing of the}} storm. Quiet and still she lay. The sea-birds seemed to pause in their flight to look down on her. The little group of Scotch people that had {{gathered}} stood and gazed at her with reverential awe. They made no attempt to put her together. It would have been useless. Her gasoline tubes were twisted and bent, her tank burst, her sprockets broken from their sides, and her <b>steering-gear</b> an utter wreck. The motor would never run again.|$|E
60|$|I {{finished}} {{tying the}} tie in silence. My emotions were too deep for speech. I knew, of course, {{that this man}} had {{for the time being}} lost his grip, but I had never suspected that he had gone absolutely to pieces like this. Remembering some of the swift ones he had pulled in the past, I shrank with horror from the spectacle of his present ineptitude. Or is it ineptness? I mean this frightful disposition of his to stick straws in his hair and talk like a perfect ass. It was the old, old story, I supposed. A man's brain whizzes along for years exceeding the speed limit, and something suddenly goes wrong with the <b>steering-gear</b> and it skids and comes a smeller in the ditch.|$|E
60|$|A moment later, the motor, with Hannah at the wheel, was thundering {{down the}} road to the Glen. The power was on to the full, and the demented girl clung tight to the <b>steering-gear</b> as the machine rocked and thundered down the descent. The storm was raging again, and the thunder mingled with the roar of the machine as it coursed madly towards the sea. The great eye of the motor blazed in front. The lurid light of it flashed a second on the trees and the burn as it passed, and flashed {{blinding}} on the eyes of Oyster as he stood erect on the cliff-side below, musket in hand, and faced the blazing apparition that charged upon him with the old Highland blood surging in his veins.|$|E
6000|$|They found {{ample time}} to practise, for they were sixteen days at sea, and it was foul weather till within a hundred miles of New York. The Dimbula picked up her pilot and came in covered with salt and red rust. Her funnel was dirty gray from top to bottom; two boats had been carried away; three copper {{ventilators}} looked like hats after a fight with the police; the bridge had a dimple {{in the middle of}} it; the house that covered the steam <b>steering-gear</b> was split as with hatchets; there was a bill for small repairs in the engine-room almost as long as the screw-shaft; the forward cargo-hatch fell into bucket-staves when they raised the iron cross-bars; and the steam-capstan had been badly wrenched on its bed. Altogether, as the skipper said, it was [...] "a pretty general average." ...|$|E
60|$|Big as {{the boat}} was, it had been buried from sight in the flying smother between crests. The next moment, {{in the thick of}} the Mane, the boat leaped up a crest and into view. To Kit's amazement he saw the whole long bottom clearly outlined. The boat, for the {{fraction}} of an instant, was in the air, the men sitting idly in their places, all save one in the stern, who stood at the steering-sweep. Then came the downward plunge into the trough and a second disappearance. Three times the boat leaped and buried itself, then those on the bank saw its nose take the whirlpool as it slipped off the Mane. The steersman, vainly opposing with his full weight on the <b>steering-gear,</b> surrendered to the whirlpool and helped the boat to take the circle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho! Ho!" [...] yelled the Mormon, again setting {{into motion}} the fiendish echoes. He was naked to the waist; {{he had lost}} flesh; he was haggard, worn, dirty, wet. While he pulled on a shirt Nas Ta Bega made the rope fast to a snag of a log of {{driftwood}} embedded in the sand, and the boat swung to shore. It was perhaps thirty feet long by half as many wide, crudely built of rough-hewn boards. The <b>steering-gear</b> was a long pole with a plank nailed to the end. The craft was empty save for another pole and plank, Joe's coat, and a broken-handled shovel. There were water and sand on the flooring. Joe stepped ashore and he was gripped first by Shefford {{and then by the}} Indian. He was an unkempt and gaunt giant, yet how steadfast and reliable, how grimly strong to inspire hope! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Senior Service {{does not}} gush. There are certain {{formulae}} appropriate to every occasion. One of our destroyers, who {{was knocked out}} {{early in the day}} and lay helpless, was sighted by several of her companions. One of them reported her to the authorities, but, being busy at the time, said he did not think himself justified in hampering himself with a disabled ship {{in the middle of an}} action. It was not as if she was sinking either. She was only holed foreward and aft, with a bad hit in the engine-room, and her <b>steering-gear</b> knocked out. In this posture she cheered the passing ships, and set about repairing her hurts with good heart and a smiling countenance. She managed to get under some sort of way at midnight, and next day was taken in tow by a friend. She says officially, [...] "his assistance was invaluable, as I had no oil left and met heavy weather." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>steering-gear</b> leaked steam, {{and in the}} {{confined}} space {{the glass of the}} binnacle made a shiny oval of light in a thin white fog. The wind howled, hummed, whistled, with sudden booming gusts that rattled the doors and shutters in the vicious patter of sprays. Two coils of lead-line and a small canvas bag hung on a long lanyard, swung wide off, and came back clinging to the bulkheads. The gratings underfoot were nearly afloat; with every sweeping blow of a sea, water squirted violently through the cracks all round the door, and the man at the helm had flung down his cap, his coat, and stood propped against the gear-casing in a striped cotton shirt open on his breast. The little brass wheel in his hands had the appearance of a bright and fragile toy. The cords of his neck stood hard and lean, a dark patch lay in the hollow of his throat, and his face was still and sunken as in death.|$|E
6000|$|We got {{round the}} corner with one wheel three feet high upon the bank. I thought we were surely over, but after {{staggering}} {{for a moment she}} righted and darted onwards. That was the third corner and the last one. There was only the park gate now. It was facing us, but, as luck would have it, not facing us directly. It was about twenty yards to the left up the main road into which we ran. Perhaps I could have done it, but I expect that the <b>steering-gear</b> had been jarred when we ran on the bank. The wheel did not turn easily. We shot out of the lane. I saw the open gate on the left. I whirled round my wheel with all the strength of my wrists. Perkins and I threw our bodies across, and then the next instant, going at fifty miles an hour, my right front wheel struck full on the right-hand pillar of my own gate. I heard the crash. I was conscious of flying through the air, and then--and then--! ...|$|E
6000|$|She was a big, high-class cargo-steamer of a {{type that}} is to be met on the sea no more, black hull, with low, white super structures, powerfully rigged with three masts and a lot of yards on the fore; two hands at her {{enormous}} wheel--steam <b>steering-gear</b> was not a matter of course in these days--and with them on the bridge three others, bulky in thick blue jackets, ruddy-faced, muffled up, with peaked caps--I suppose all her officers. There are ships I have met more than once and known well by sight whose names I have forgotten; but the name of that ship seen once so many years ago in the clear flush of a cold pale sunrise I have not forgotten. How could I--the first English ship on whose side I ever laid my hand! The name--I read it letter by letter on the bow--was [...] "James Westoll." [...] Not very romantic you will say. The name of a very considerable, well-known and universally respected North-country shipowner, I believe. James Westoll! What better name could an honourable hard-working ship have? To me the very grouping of the letters is alive with the romantic feeling of her reality as I saw her floating motionless, and borrowing an ideal grace from the austere purity of the light.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it made us}} turn {{cold and}} creepy just to think of it, and we said we wouldn't budge. So Tom was for {{slipping}} back there by himself {{to see if he}} couldn't get at the <b>steering-gear</b> and land the ship. We begged and begged him not to, but it warn't no use; so he got down on his hands and knees, and begun to crawl an inch at a time, we a-holding our breath and watching. After he got {{to the middle of the}} boat he crept slower than ever, and it did seem like years to me. But at last we see him get to the professor's head, and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in his face and listen. Then we see him begin to inch along again toward the professor's feet where the steering-buttons was. Well, he got there all safe, and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons, but he knocked down something that made a noise, and we see him slump down flat an' soft in the bottom, and lay still. The professor stirred, and says, [...] "What's that?" [...] But everybody kept dead still and quiet, and he begun to mutter and mumble and nestle, like a person that's going to wake up, and I thought I was going to die, I was so worried and scared.|$|E
60|$|Jim paced athwart, and his {{footsteps}} {{in the vast}} silence were loud to his own ears, as if echoed by the watchful stars: his eyes, roaming about {{the line of the}} horizon, seemed to gaze hungrily into the unattainable, and did not see the shadow of the coming event. The only shadow on the sea was the shadow of the black smoke pouring heavily from the funnel its immense streamer, whose end was constantly dissolving in the air. Two Malays, silent and almost motionless, steered, one {{on each side of the}} wheel, whose brass rim shone fragmentarily in the oval of light thrown out by the binnacle. Now and then a hand, with black fingers alternately letting go and catching hold of revolving spokes, appeared in the illumined part; the links of wheel-chains ground heavily in the grooves of the barrel. Jim would glance at the compass, would glance around the unattainable horizon, would stretch himself till his joints cracked, with a leisurely twist of the body, in the very excess of well-being; and, as if made audacious by the invincible aspect of the peace, he felt he cared for nothing that could happen to him to the end of his days. From time to time he glanced idly at a chart pegged out with four drawing-pins on a low three-legged table abaft the <b>steering-gear</b> case. The sheet of paper portraying the depths of the sea presented a shiny surface under the light of a bull's-eye lamp lashed to a stanchion, a surface as level and smooth as the glimmering surface of the waters. Parallel rulers with a pair of dividers reposed on it; the ship's position at last noon was marked with a small black cross, and the straight pencil-line drawn firmly as far as Perim figured the course of the ship--the path of souls towards the holy place, the promise of salvation, the reward of eternal life--while the pencil with its sharp end touching the Somali coast lay round and still like a naked ship's spar floating in the pool of a sheltered dock. 'How steady she goes,' thought Jim with wonder, with something like gratitude for this high peace of sea and sky. At such times his thoughts would be full of valorous deeds: he loved these dreams and the success of his imaginary achievements. They were the best parts of life, its secret truth, its hidden reality. They had a gorgeous virility, the charm of vagueness, they passed before him with an heroic tread; they carried his soul away with them and made it drunk with the divine philtre of an unbounded confidence in itself. There was nothing he could not face. He was so pleased with the idea that he smiled, keeping perfunctorily his eyes ahead; and when he happened to glance back he saw the white streak of the wake drawn as straight by the ship's keel upon the sea as the black line drawn by the pencil upon the chart.|$|E
5000|$|Their worm and nut {{design of}} {{steering}} gear was fitted to pre-war vehicles {{such as the}} Ford Eight and the Ford Prefect, the Bedford CA, plus heavy trucks and off-road vehicles - both pre and post-war. In its day, Burman-Douglas <b>steering-gear</b> was regarded as...... a [...] "quality" [...] feature of a car chassis specification, but the worm and nut design was eventually surpassed by the cheaper rack and pinion design which dominates today.|$|E
50|$|Lake Champlains {{hull and}} 250-horsepower engines were {{constructed}} by the London and Glasgow Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Company at Govan. Owned by the Canada Shipping Company of Montreal and Liverpool, she was registered in Montreal, the first Clyde-built steamer under the Dominion flag. Measuring 321 ft. with a 35 ft. beam and 26 ft. deep hold, she was rated at 2207 tons gross. She had three decks, the upper deck being a spar deck and the others designed for carrying passengers. Barque-rigged, and equipped with steam <b>steering-gear,</b> steam windlass for raising anchors and four steam winches, she was a state-of-the-art ship.|$|E
5000|$|Electric power {{assisted}} steering (EPS/EPAS) or motor-driven power steering (MDPS) uses an electric motor to assist the driver of a vehicle. Sensors detect the position and torque of the steering column, and a computer module applies assistive torque via the motor, which connects to either the steering gear or steering column. This allows varying amounts of assistance to be applied depending on driving conditions. Engineers can therefore tailor <b>steering-gear</b> response to variable-rate and variable-damping suspension systems, optimizing ride, handling, and steering for each vehicle. On Fiat group cars the amount of assistance can be regulated using a button named [...] "CITY" [...] that switches between two different assist curves, while most other EPS systems have variable assist. These give more assistance as the vehicle slows down, and less at faster speeds.|$|E
50|$|For {{uncontrolled}} sailing craft {{some form}} of steering control is required, since with a fixed rudder position the model will turn into the wind.Three kinds of <b>steering-gear</b> are used, the weighted swinging rudder, the main-sheet balance gear, and the steering vane, the object of each being to keep the model on a true course, either before or against the wind. Models are often sailed without dynamic control of the rudder, but although a perfectly built boat will sail readily against the wind without steering gear, {{it is almost impossible}} to keep it on its course before the wind without some contrivance to check for divergence. The setting of the steering gear and sheet positions must be adapted to the wind conditions and this is a subtle art to master. These controls are the traditional methods, for more than 100 years before the advent of radio control and they continue to be used worldwide.|$|E
