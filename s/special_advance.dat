60|$|It is {{too much}} the custom, perhaps, to regard as a <b>special</b> <b>advance,</b> that unavoidable, and merely {{participative}} progress, which any one class makes in sharing the general movement of the race. Thus, because the sailor, who to-day steers the Hibernia or Unicorn steam-ship across the Atlantic, is a somewhat different man from the exaggerated sailors of Smollett, {{and the men who}} fought with Nelson at Copenhagen, and survived to riot themselves away at North Corner in Plymouth;--because the modern tar is not quite so gross as heretofore, and has shaken off some of his shaggy jackets, and docked his Lord Rodney queue:--therefore, in the estimation of some observers, he has begun to see the evils of his condition, and has voluntarily improved. But upon a closer scrutiny, it will be seen that he has but drifted along with that great tide, which, perhaps, has two flows for one ebb; he has made no individual advance of his own.|$|E
