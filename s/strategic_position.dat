40|$|Managing supply chains {{effectively}} {{has become}} a critical element in enhancing company profitability and {{has been identified as}} the new frontier of competitive advantage. An important element of effective supply chain management is the <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> of the company. The <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> process is concerned with the choice of production-centred activities a company carries out internally and those provided externally. <b>Strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> within manufacturing supply chains however is a relatively recent research topic with apparently few articles currently available that explicitly address associated issues directly. Moreover there is no previous research working <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> of manufacturing operations in global context.

The findings of this study support the major hypotheses, suggesting that: (1) market concentration and foreign firms' heterogeneous resources affect foreign firms' strategic positioning; (2) institutional distance between host and home countries exerts confounding moderating effects on the relationship between firm resources and <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> in the host market.

5|$|An {{airport at}} Lakselv was first {{proposed}} out of military considerations. Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, {{there was a}} fear that Norway could be occupied by foreign powers {{to take advantage of}} the country's <b>strategic</b> <b>position.</b> The military therefore wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility. Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, and the following year, a triangular runway was built at Banak.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a <b>strategic</b> <b>position,</b> as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E

Due to its <b>strategic</b> <b>position</b> along the river, which formed the border between the Confederate state of Virginia and the Union state of Maryland, it had great military value and was a likely route for an attacking army, as would be proved three years after {{the outbreak}} of war during the Battle of Fort Stevens.|$|E

40|$|This book {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to the traditional process of segmentation, targeting and positioning, highlighting some important implications for management and marketing practitioners as well as academics. <b>Strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> is the assertion of an organization's personality on decisions of how and where to compete. Operational positioning is an exercise in communication that concentrates on perception and image. The book suggests that the principal drivers of <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> play a fundamental role in the determination of strategy at all levels and play a pivotal role in differentiating competitors and generating competitive advantage. In particular, <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> requires awareness and sometimes adjustment and changes in an organization's culture rather than just the cosmetic approach sometimes sought through promotion, advertising and communications plans...|$|R
5|$|Rhodesia's <b>strategic</b> <b>position</b> {{underwent}} {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid {{increase}} of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its <b>strategic</b> <b>position</b> and {{the discovery of the}} vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.|$|E
5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's <b>strategic</b> <b>position</b> in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Jesuit mission in Bohol, Father Juan de Torres, SJ, moved to the community along the Loboc River in late 1596 to establish a second mission station.

It was dedicated under the patronage of Saint Michael the Archangel. Loboc officially became a Catholic parish in 1602. Due to pirate attacks on Baclayon and the <b>strategic</b> <b>position</b> of Loboc, the Jesuits chose Loboc to become the center of their mission. The Jesuit superior of Bohol later resided in Loboc until the Jesuits' expulsion in 1768. A boarding school for boys, the Seminario de los Indios, was established at Loboc in 1605.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine empirically the {{relationship}} between positioning strategies and bases of segmentation in international markets. Design/methodology/approach – A principal component analysis was conducted to determine the major macro- as well as micro-bases of segmentation that are linked with <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> decision options. Further, a regression analysis was used to examine the effect of each of the segmentation bases on the different <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> options used by segmentation managers. Findings – This study suggests the combined use of both macro- and micro-bases of segmentation in order to leverage similar <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> across global markets. However, micro-bases of segmentation are suggested for firms seeking differential positioning strategies. Research limitations/implications – The conceptual and empirical findings of this study pave the way for embarking on promising and relevant future research that is needed to substantiate and enrich the academic understanding and managerial practice of linking global segmentation with <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning</b> decisions. Future research should focus on the use of hybrid segmentation strategies; its logical design; implementation issues; and its evaluation mechanism. Practical implications – This study provides specific empirical evidence of the relationship between strategic use of segmentation bases and <b>strategic</b> <b>positioning.</b> An effective use of the proposed framework will have various strategic marketing implications for firms; including cost efficiencies, opportunities to transfer products globally, expansion opportunities of current operation, and development of more effective brand management decisions. Originality/value – The proposed global <b>strategic</b> segmentation and <b>positioning</b> matrix is a new tool that guides managers to position their brands effectively in world markets...|$|R
