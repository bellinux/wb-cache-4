500|$|Citizens and dignitaries are {{assembled}} for {{the unveiling}} of a new monument to [...] "Peace and Prosperity". After droning speeches the veil is lifted to reveal the Little Tramp asleep {{in the lap of}} one of the sculpted figures. After several minutes of slapstick he manages to escape the assembly's wrath to perambulate the city. He rebukes two newsboys who taunt him for his shabbiness, and while coyly admiring a nude statue has a near-fatal encounter with a <b>sidewalk</b> <b>elevator.</b>|$|E
500|$|Two years later, in 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration {{found that}} a {{proposed}} entrance at {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 72nd Street was unfeasible, as was the proposed single <b>sidewalk</b> <b>elevator</b> at the southeast corner. The northeast-corner entrance, within the 305 East 72nd Street apartment building, would have encroached into a portion of CVS Pharmacy's ground-floor retail space as well as the apartment building's basement, which contained its laundry room and several of its utility intake pipes. Building the northeast-corner entrance would have forced the owners of 305 East 72nd Street to move their laundry room and utilities into the retail space occupied by CVS, so plans for the northeast-corner entrance were canceled. The site for the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>elevator</b> on the southeast corner turned out to be located close to a high-pressure steam main that was [...] in diameter. After a 2007 steam main explosion in Midtown, utility provider Consolidated Edison changed its guidelines for clearance around high-pressure mains, which meant that the elevator was now too close to the main. Thus, the plan was revised to place the elevator inside a building. Of the three alternatives presented for combining the two entrances, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be five elevators inside a building at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 72nd Street. This required the demolition of 300 East 72nd Street so that a new building for the five elevators could be built.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sidewalk</b> <b>elevator</b> is {{a special}} type of freight elevator. Sidewalk {{elevators}} are used to move materials between a basement and a ground-level area, often the sidewalk just outside the building. They are controlled via an exterior switch and emerge from a metal trap door at ground level. <b>Sidewalk</b> <b>elevator</b> cars feature a uniquely shaped top that allows this door to open and close automatically.|$|E
2500|$|The {{airport is}} {{accessible}} from a pedestrian tunnel {{at the foot}} of Eireann Quay, which is free to use. The tunnel connects the airport terminal to the Toronto mainland at Eireann Quay. The project consists of a new pavilion on the mainland end of the tunnel, a [...] pedestrian tunnel and a tunnel for sewage and water mains. The pedestrian tunnel has moving <b>sidewalks.</b> <b>Elevators</b> were also built at both ends. On the island side, an escalator serves patrons. A consortium known as Forum Infrastructure Partners, composed of firms Arup, PCL and Technicore, designed, built, financed and maintains the tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|A 2011 multi-generational {{volunteer}} dog foster {{program at}} Atlantic Shores http://www.atlanticshoresliving.com in Virginia Beach, Virginia, {{one of the}} first programs of its type in the nation, brings together qualified retirement community residents and elementary school students. The foster puppies will live with selected senior citizens in the Atlantic Shores retirement community, where the dogs will have early exposure to <b>elevators,</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> ramps, wheelchairs, and sliding doors [...] - [...] elements that mirror the conditions in the second phase, when dogs receive 18 month formal training. At the retirement community, the puppies will be integrated into normal everyday resident activities and will be featured in special events focused on the puppies. Beginning at age eleven weeks, the puppies will also go out to local elementary schools, where classes will instruct students about the guide dog service and proper interaction with guide dogs. Students will also create their own reporting segments and follow the progress of the guide dogs via in class broadcasts on the schools' television feeds.|$|R
5000|$|Baiting is {{like the}} {{real-world}} Trojan horse that uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim. In this attack, attackers leave malware-infected floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or USB flash drives in locations people will find them (bathrooms, <b>elevators,</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> parking lots, etc.), give them legitimate and curiosity-piquing labels, and waits for victims.For example, an attacker may create a disk featuring a corporate logo, available from the target's website, and label it [...] "Executive Salary Summary Q2 2012". The attacker then leaves the disk {{on the floor of}} an elevator or somewhere {{in the lobby of the}} target company. An unknowing employee may find it and insert the disk into a computer to satisfy his or her curiosity, or a good Samaritan may find it and return it to the company. In any case, just inserting the disk into a computer installs malware, giving attackers access to the victim's PC and, perhaps, the target company's internal computer network.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore certain of the {{dynamics}} associated with the physical transformation of cities, using Montreal between 1846 and 1918 as a case study. Beyond the typical description or classification of urban forms, this study deals with the essential problem of how changes in form occurred as the city underwent a rapid growth and industrialization. Drawing insights from three different bodies of research [...] -neoclassical theories of land rent, Marxian theories of capital accumulation, and space syntax theories of urban form [...] -a theoretical and methodological approach is formulated which considers {{the city as a}} dynamic system, and acknowledges circulation as the driving force behind urban morphological change. It is argued that the built form of Montreal was continuously shaped and reshaped by the evolving strategies of a local "growth machine" which sought to reduce the turnover time of capital by "redimensioning" the urban "vascular system": that is, the streets, <b>sidewalks,</b> tracks, bridges, <b>elevators,</b> and canals, within which circulation takes place. This claim is interrogated and developed in each chapter through a series of empirical analyses utilizing evidence from several high-quality sources (e. g. atlases, municipal tax rolls, city surveyor reports, building inspector reports, photographs, and newspapers) to investigate the critical processes of building and rebuilding associated with phenomena such as destructive fires, the modernization of the port, street widenings, and the reconfiguration of the street grid. Each investigation explores the relationship between circulation and urban morphology. The series of investigations revealed certain regularities with respect to the spatial and temporal properties of morphological change. Consistent with expectations based on existing theories and research, the findings confirm the importance of centrality and accessibility to urban form, for the distribution of rents, and for patterns of lan...|$|R
