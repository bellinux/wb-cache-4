40|$|Plant {{shutdowns}} shape {{industry and}} aggregate productivity paths {{and play a}} major role in the dynamics of employment and industrial restructuring. Plant closures in the U.

This paper examines the effects of firm structure on manufacturing plant closures. Using U. S. data, we find that plants belonging to multi-plant firms are less likely to exit. Similarly, plants owned by U. S. multinationals are less likely to close. However, the superior survival chances are due to the characteristics of the plants themselves rather than the nature of the firms. Controlling for plant and industry attributes that reduce the probability of death, we find that plants owned by multi-unit firms and U. S. multinationals are much more likely to close. A recent change in ownership also increases the chances that a plant will be closed.

The paper offers critical perspective on the possible adoption of the European Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards (EPSAS) inspired by the International Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards (IPSAS). More specifically, the paper deals with the theoretical concepts of harmonization, standardization, and unification, as defined by the international accounting literature, with a view to identify the possible consequences of the public accounting unification process that is going to be promoted by the EU. In the European Union perspective, accounting unification is a desirable outcome, a pre-condition for attaining, measuring, controlling, and demonstrating budgetary equilibrium, according to a strictly rational logic consistent with a functionalist perspective of public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting.</b> Such an approach, it is argued in the paper, leads to a misunderstanding of public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting,</b> which is considered as a neutral technology whereas it is actually a tool of commensuration with a strong influence on the economic and political life of social communities, since it generates interpretative categories and contributes to change social relationships and values prioritization...|$|R

The quantitative signi…cance of these shocks to the U. S. business cycle, however, has not been studied much so far. To evaluate {{the importance of these}} shocks, we estimate the stickyprice dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that incorporates the credit market imperfection associated with FIs.

Many less {{developed}} countries (LDCs) have introduced IPSAS during the recent past. However, little research has been conducted to study the New Public Financial Management and accrual accounting and their impact on LDCs. Methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach, the methods of this paper consist of interviews, a documentary review and participatory observation in the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) and Auditor General&# 039;s Department of Sri Lanka, and present a critical interpretation supported by the perspective of globalisation. Findings: The findings of the research indicate that the public sector reforms and the transition from cash accounting to accrual accounting in the public sector have been strongly affected by the global pressures imposed by international agencies such as International Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards Board (IPSASB) and the World Bank (WB). Empirical evidence shows the dysfunctional impact of globalisation in the public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> standards as there are major structural issues yet to resolve. There are increasing doubts over whether the change to accrual accounting is worth the costs and the additional risks involved.
