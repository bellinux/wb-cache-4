40|$|Abstract — Distribution of {{remotely}} <b>subscribed</b> multicast <b>content</b> in a Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) domain {{is performed}} {{by means of}} bi-directional IP-in-IP tunnels established between the mobility anchor and the visited access gateways where the mobile terminals consuming such traffic are attached to. Each access gateway <b>subscribing</b> to <b>content</b> on behalf of an attached mobile terminal requires a separate copy of the remote multicast flow being distributed over the PMIPv 6 domain. In many cases, these individual copies traverse the same routers in the path from the mobility anchor towards the access gateways, incurring in an inefficient distribution, which {{is equivalent to the}} unicast delivery of the remote multicast content within the domain. This paper explores the potential gain obtained by using explicit multicast instead of the standard IP-in-IP tunneling, showing relevant capacity savings with lower overhead respect to the standard distribution case. This transport service based on explicit multicast emerges then as an attractive transport alternative for PMIPv 6 domain operators serving visiting mobile multicast consumers.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} SDN-based partial data {{offloading}} and load balancing algorithms to alleviate spectrum shortage concerns and {{to address the}} network congestion issues. The proposed algorithms exploit an SDN controller’s global view of the network to achieve the aforementioned objectives, while taking network conditions and the end user QoS requirements into consideration. With an overall view of the network, the SDN controller has visibility over the offloaded data and can deliver <b>subscribed</b> <b>content</b> from vendors even after offloading, which {{is important for the}} operators [4]. Moreover, SDN provides an open and easily reconfigurable interface, which will enable the operators to efficiently modify and update/upgrade network policies. Our contributions also include quantifying the delay incurred due to the SDN-based data processing and forwarding and analyzing the performance improvements of the proposed algorithms under realistic network model. Results show that SDN-based data offloading algorithm decreases threshold miss probability and saves significant amount of cellular resources simultaeously. It is also shown that SDN-based load balancing achieves better resource allocation with higher network throughput and smaller number of handovers, as compared to the baseline algorithms.|$|E

Personalized recommendation by predicting user-browsing behavior using association-mining technology has gained much attention in web personalization research area. However, the resulting association patterns did not perform well in prediction of future browsing patterns due to the low matching rate of the resulting rules and users ’ browsing behavior. In this paper, we extend the traditional association rule problem by allowing a weight to be associated with each item in a transaction to reflect the interest/intensity of each item within the transaction. In turn, this provides us with an opportunity to associate a weight parameter with each item in a resulting association rule.

40|$|Abstract — Podcasting {{has become}} popular for {{dissemination}} of streaming contents over the Internet. It {{is based on}} software clients that query servers for updates of <b>subscribed</b> <b>content</b> feeds. Podcasting {{may be used for}} any media content, but it is most commonly associated with audio streams. It provides a simple, no-frills broadcasting system for delay tolerant contents. A main limitation with this system is the inflexible separation of downloading to a docked media player and expending of the data when on the move. We herein present how podcast could be supported by our previously proposed delay-tolerant broadcasting system {{in order to reduce the}} expected times between updates and to provide a new ad hoc podcasting mode among mobile nodes. Our system substitutes the client-server paradigm inherent in present podcasting by a peer-to-peer paradigm where mobile nodes provide each other with contents. We present the protocol for this, and an evaluation of solicitation and caching strategies that greatly affect the application-level throughput. Our design is aiming at simplicity in order to enable implementation in mobile phones with media players and other devices that communicate over short ranges by means of Bluetooth or wireless LAN.

40|$|The {{provision}} {{of high quality}} online learning environments is a major strategic objective in higher education institutions. Within {{a relatively short period}} of time institutions have been required to deal with issues of policy development, selection of technical solutions, change management, reskilling and training of academic staff, development of new structures, curricula and online course content, and access management. Much of this work has occurred within existing organisational structures while we simultaneously found a home for these new roles and responsibilities. Flexible Learning departments and libraries are now both heavily involved in the development and {{provision of}} access to online content. An issue facing our institutions is to bring together the locally developed online content provided by the flexible learning department via the learning management system (eg BlackBoard, WebCT) together with the externally sourced (purchased or <b>subscribed)</b> <b>content</b> provided by the university library (in print or via the Library Catalogue and Library Web site). Universities spend millions of dollars per annum on print and digital library content. Digital library collections need not be stand alone services used as information gateways designed to facilitate resource discovery (to unknown information items) supporting research and student assignment work. Library content can also be more fully integrated into the online learning environment to provide seamless access to specific items of information at the point of need, to enrich and improve the student learning experience. Collaboration between flexible learning and library organisations is imperative if this is to be achieved and if our institutions and students are to receive the maximum benefit and value for money from our library collections. The issues of organisational structure and staffing profiles, digital libraries content, copyright and license management, effective linking strategies, and technological integration are explored in relation to integrating library content into the online learning environment. New structures and staffing profiles The digital environment has brought about a convergence of information professions and roles. The traditional organisational structures of Information Technology, Flexible Learning and Library departments commonly [formerly] found in educational institutions are being continually challenged. The roles once played solely by information technologists, educational designers, web designers, librarians and teachers are merging and cutting in new ways.

High quality work produced within budget and timelines requires structures and staff to work more cooperatively and flexibly than they once did...|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} for programmable overlay multimedia networks We present an evolutionary {{framework for}} provisioning enhanced network-based multimedia distribution services to a diverse set of receivers. The framework addresses {{various degrees of}} heterogeneity among “distribution paths ” from content sources to receivers, where a distribution path carries information from a content-aware multicast distribution tree from a source {{to one or more}} receivers. The heterogeneity is characterized by a spectrum of tradeoffs among receiver/client processing capabilities, network conditions, and media representations of desired content. Our goal is to provide individual receivers with the best feasible quality and representation of <b>subscribed</b> multimedia <b>content</b> by efficiently generating distribution paths suiting groups of receivers as they join a multicast. Toward this end, the framework utilizes several evolutionary measures.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} dynamic content dis-tribution in publish-subscribe mobile social networks. Mobile users <b>subscribe</b> to the <b>content</b> provider. Then, when new content is created, the provider transmits it to subscribers (i. e., mobile users) through the base station. The mobile users who have the social relationship (i. e., mobile users in the same community) can transfer the fresh content when they move and meet each other. From the content provider’s perspective, the content transmission policy by the base station can be optimized so {{that the number of}} mobile users having the fresh data is maximized subject to the constraint on the maximum waiting time of the new content. An optimization formulation is presented for the content provider to obtain this optimal content transmission policy. Performance evaluation results show that with the optimal content transmission policy, the average number of mobile users having fresh content is larger than that if the new content is transmitted immediately...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, RSS (Really Simple Syndication) was {{launched}} into cyber space and rapidly gained fame by existing as the underlying technology that fueled millions of web logs (blogs). Soon RSS feeds appeared for news, multimedia podcasting, {{and many other}} types {{of information on the}} Internet. RSS introduced a new way to syndicate information that allowed anyone interested to <b>subscribe</b> to published <b>content</b> and pull the information to an aggregator, (RSS reader application), at their discretion. RSS made it simple for people to keep up with online content without having to continuously check websites for new content. This new technology quickly had its shortcomings though. Aggregators were set to periodically check a feed for new content and if the new content did exist then the whole feed may be downloaded again and content filtering was either completely absent or filtering was performed once the file was already downloaded. Users who may have only occasionally checked a site for new content were now equipped with the ability to <b>subscribe</b> to <b>content</b> all over the web and have an aggregator poll the sites periodically for new content. However this presented a serious scalability problem in terms of bandwidth utilization. The same users that were checking a site once a day for new content were now checking the sites with the aggregator on a specific interval such as every hour. Bandwidth utilization increased dramatically where RSS was involved. The aim of this thesis is to design a better RSS aggregator that effectively and efficiently polls, downloads and filters RSS content while using a minimal amount of bandwidth and resources. To meet these needs, an RSS aggregator named FeedWorks has been developed that allows for users to create subscriptions to content and set a interval to poll that subscription for newly published material. The aggregator uses specific HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) header information to check for new content before it downloads a file and if new content is found, downloads the file but filters it based on user-created filter criteria before it writes the information to disk. Filtering and searching algorithms have been researched to tune the performance and limit the strain on the processor. Caching mechanisms have also been used to enhance the performance of the application. The aggregator contains content management functionality to allow users to create subscriptions and subscription groups and to apply filters to a specific subscription or groups of subscriptions. This thesis compares the aggregator with other currently available products and services. It provides detailed information regarding the end user 2 ̆ 7 s interface and the content management functionality it provides. Descriptive information is also presented that explains the content filtering and feed polling functionality and their respective algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Twitter is {{now well}} {{established}} as the world’s {{second most important}} social media platform, after Facebook. Its 140 -character updates are designed for brief messaging, and its network structures are kept relatively flat and simple: messages from users are either public and visible to all (even to unregistered visitors using the Twitter website), or private and visible only to approved ‘followers’ of the sender; {{there are no more}} complex definitions of degrees of connection (family, friends, friends of friends) as they are available in other social networks. Over time, Twitter users have developed simple, but effective mechanisms for working around these limitations: ‘#hashtags’, which enable the manual or automatic collation of all tweets containing the same #hashtag, as well allowing users to <b>subscribe</b> to <b>content</b> feeds that contain only those tweets which feature specific #hashtags; and ‘@replies’, which allow senders to direct public messages even to users whom they do not already follow. This paper documents a methodology for extracting public Twitter activity data around specific #hashtags, and for processing these data in order to analyse and visualize the @reply networks existing between participating users – both overall, as a static network, and over time, to highlight the dynamic structure of @reply conversations. Such visualizations enable us to highlight the shifting roles played by individual participants, as well as the response of the overall #hashtag community to new stimuli – such as the entry of new participants or the availability of new information. Over longer timeframes, it is also possible to identify different phases in the overall discussion, or the formation of distinct clusters of preferentially interacting participants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. P 2 P {{systems are}} mainly used as {{distributed}} file systems; until recently no P 2 P version of newsgroups protocol existed. A DHT-based Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) system by Aekaterinidis and Triantafillou {{is the first}} such a solution: a user interested in a particular topic subscribes it so that later he receives messages on new events on this topic once they occur. Pub-Sub systems as proposed cause severe privacy problems- a user who posts a new message on some subject has to fetch the list of all nodes who <b>subscribed</b> to this <b>content.</b> This in turn means that an adversary has a straightforward and legal tool to get information who is interested in a particular topic. In this paper we show how to enhance the system {{in order to protect}} user privacy.
