40|$|In this {{experimental}} work {{the possibility of}} integrating piezoelectric textile fibres in knitted structures for a (fingertip) pressure sensing glove was investigated. The piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) yarn used generates a voltage when mechanically deformed. However while this yarn is highly sensitive to strain, {{it is not so}} sensitive to compression. The knitted structures used as the basis of this work are all of a basic nature e. g. <b>single</b> <b>tricot</b> and 1 x 1 rib. Applications could include healthcare, gaming, security and intelligent control. First, the piezoelectric yarn was incorporated directly into the knitted structures. This was unsuccessful due to instability of the fabric construction, enabling the piezoelectric yarn to relax. To introduce strain to the PVDF yarn in response to compression, a structure using thermoplastic blocks was developed. The blocks were glued to the supporting fabric while the PVDF yarn was placed in-between the two layers in course direction. The piezoelectric PVDF yarn is coated onto a supporting fabric using a conductive silicone which acts as the outer electrode. I...|$|E
