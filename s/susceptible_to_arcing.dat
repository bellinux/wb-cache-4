50|$|Undesired or {{unintended}} electric arcing {{can have}} detrimental effects {{on electric power}} transmission, distribution systems and electronic equipment. Devices which may cause arcing include switches, circuit breakers, relay contacts, fuses and poor cable terminations. When an inductive circuit is switched off, the current cannot instantaneously jump to zero: a transient arc will be formed across the separating contacts. Switching devices <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>arcing</b> are normally designed to contain and extinguish an arc, and snubber circuits can supply a path for transient currents, preventing arcing. If a circuit has enough current and voltage to sustain an arc formed outside of a switching device, the arc can cause damage to equipment such as melting of conductors, destruction of insulation, and fire. An arc flash describes an explosive electrical event that presents a hazard to people and equipment.|$|E

The phenomenon of surface arcing {{is caused by a}} high voltage gradient between the two termination surfaces or between one of the termination surfaces and the counter internal electrode structure within the ceramic body. It occurs most frequently at application voltages that meet or exceed 300 V, in high humidity environments, and in chip sizes with minimal bandwidth separation (creepage distance). This phenomenon can either damage surrounding components or lead to a breakdown of the dielectric material, ultimately resulting in a short-circuit condition (catastrophic failure mode). “ArcShield ” Technology (Patent Pending) features KEMET’s highly reliable base metal dielectric system combined wit...|$|R

Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States.

Methods: In vitro susceptibility was tested using the Etest strip minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, and PCR was used to characterize the carbapenemase enzymes produced by CRE strains. Results: All 29 ESBL isolates were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 0. 125  μg/ml), whereas all but one were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 0. 38  μg/ml). Twenty-seven (45 %) CRE isolates were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml), whereas only six (10 %) isolates were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml). Very few NDM- 1 isolates were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam, whereas the majority of OXA- 48 isolates were susceptible.
