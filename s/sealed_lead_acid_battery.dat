40|$|Poster Session: {{abstract}} no. 718 Due to its mature technological status, <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> {{have not}} been {{the focal point of}} batteries in the last decade. With the limitation on other new battery types – such as low power density for lithium ion battery, high self discharge and short life cycles for high current discharge for nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery – researchers has revisited the possibilities to enhance <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> technology. <b>Lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> are durable with low maintenance, inexpensive and simple to manufacture; recyclable and lowest self discharge among other rechargeable systems. With the above advantages, <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> are both cost effective and energy efficient; it is expected that <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> would attract interests from battery manufacturers should the lower energy density and cycle life be improved.

40|$|Condition Based Maintenance of <b>Lead</b> <b>Acid</b> <b>Batteries</b> and Environmental Responsibility By Asgeir Kristoffersen May 2010 The {{increase}} {{in demand for}} electrical energy is putting pressure on outdated utility infrastructures and services {{at the same time}} that advances in business operations are requiring stable and sufficient sources of power for sensitive operations. A key component of the electrical grid is energy storage and <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> remain the most cost effective solution. The efficient and prudent use of lead is at best difficult at a time that <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> are being called upon to provide backup power for critical power applications. This study seeks to use <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> efficiently thereby reducing the amount of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> in our environment. The research consisted of a case study of US electrical power substations, an integral part of the power grid. The case analysis compared traditional maintenance practices of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> versus the use of battery condition monitoring. There is a strong business case to be made for investing in condition monitoring to manage the battery assets within power substations. This will ensure that the batteries will function when required. The case study demonstrated that once condition monitoring was installed the number of preventative maintenance visits to a remote site was reduced by 85 % with a commensurate reduction in the number of medium duty trucks on the nation’s roads. The avoided CO 2 emissions presented a compelling argument for condition monitoring. Condition monitoring and the resultant condition based maintenance will drive infrastructure reliability higher and result in the more efficient use of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> with the added benefit of CO 2 reductions. There are hundreds of other applications for this technology and with strong management buy-in it is possible to overcome the resistance to change from traditional maintenance practices...|$|R
