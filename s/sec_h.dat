40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} various etching protocols on the surface roughness of composites with different filler compositions. Methods: From a micro-hybrid composite containing barium-glass (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray) and a nano-hybrid composite containing zirconia/silica nanoclusters (Filtek Supreme XT, 3 M ESPE), specimens of 3 mm thick with a diameter of 7 mm were prepared (n= 24). The top surface was polished with 4000 -grit abrasive paper and subjected to one of eight surface treatment techniques (n= 3) : negative control, phosphoric acid for 20 <b>sec</b> (<b>H</b> 3 PO 4), 3 % hydrofluoric acid for 20 sec (3 %HF- 20 sec), for 120 sec (3 %HF- 120 sec), 9. 6 % hydrofluoric acid for 20 sec (9. 6 %HF- 20 sec), for 120 sec (9. 6 %HF- 120 <b>sec),</b> <b>H</b> 3 PO 4 followed by 9. 6 %HF- 120 <b>sec</b> (<b>H</b> 3 PO 4 -HF), and 9. 6 %HF- 120 sec followed by H 3 PO 4 (HF-H 3 PO 4). Roughness (Sa) was measured using a 3 D-noncontact optical interferometer (WYKO, Veeco) and SEM evaluation was performed. ANOVA and posthoc Tukey HSD multiple comparisons {{were used to determine}} statistical differences in roughness between groups (p< 0. 05). Results: The micro-hybrid barium-containing composite demonstrated a significant rougher surface than the nano-hybrid zirconium-containing composite (p< 0. 05). For the micro-hybrid composite, 3 %HF- 20 sec, 3 %HF- 120 sec and 9. 6 %HF- 20 sec resulted in a significant increase in roughness (p< 0. 001). For the nano-composite, only 3 %HF- 20 sec and 9. 6 %HF- 20 sec showed an increase in roughness (p< 0. 02). For both composites, 9. 6 %HF- 120 sec, PA-HF and HF-PA resulted in a large increase in roughness compared to control (p< 0. 001). From SEM images, {{it was found that the}} micro-hybrid composite was much more affected by etching than the nano-hybrid composite. Conclusions: The surface roughness after etching is largely affected by the composition of the filler particles in the composite. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} self-consistent, linear {{response}} of a galactic disc to non-axisymmetric perturbations in the vertical direction as {{due to a}} tidal encounter, and show that the density distribution near the disc mid-plane has a strong impact on the radius beyond which distortions like warps develop. The self-gravity of the disc resists distortion in the inner parts. Applying this approach to a galactic disc with an exponential vertical profile, Saha & Jog showed that warps develop beyond 4 - 6 disc scalelengths, which could hence be only seen in HI. The real galactic discs, however, have less steep vertical density distributions that lie between a sech and an exponential profile. Here we calculate the disc response for such a general <b>sec</b> <b>h</b> 2 /n density distribution, and show that the warps develop from a smaller radius of 2 - 4 disc scalelengths. This naturally explains why most galaxies show stellar warps that start within the optical radius. Thus, a qualitatively different picture of ubiquitous optical warps emerges for the observed less steep density profiles. The surprisingly strong dependence on the density profile {{is due to the}} fact that the disc self-gravity depends crucially on its mass distribution close to the mid-plane.
