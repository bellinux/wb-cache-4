40|$|Stroke is a {{major cause}} of death and {{disability}} worldwide. In the last 20 years there has been a tremendous growth in stroke research in an attempt to find ways to prevent and treat patients with this devastating disease. Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of i <b>schemic</b> <b>stroke</b> have helped bring in new and innovative therapies in the prevention and treatment of ischemic strokes. Thrombosis in the cerebral blood vessels is a complication of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis involving the bifurcation of the carotid arteries has been recognized as an important cause of stroke for over 50 years. ], " Symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery involve primarily the carotid bulb and are characterized by increased cellular proliferation, lipid accumulation, calcification, ulceration, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. 3 The risk of an ischemic stroke following carotid artery stenosis is not uniform. Factors increasing the risk of stroke include plaque morphology (ulcerated versus smooth morphology) and the degree of stenosis. The NASCET trial showed that patients with an ulcerated plaque and greater than 70 % stenosis had an approximately twofold increase in stroke risk compared with patients with smooth stenosis. 4 Similarly patients with greater degree of stenosis appear to be at greater- risk of ischemic stroke; patients with a 75 % stenosis have a two-year risk of ipsilateral stroke (after hemispheric TIA) of 37. 4 %, whereas patients with a 95...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{long-term}} self-renewal ability and functional multi-lineage differentiation capacity, {{stem cells are}} highly attractive c andidates for many applications. Both embryon ic and adult stem cells have been explored as ther apeutic strategies {{in the context of}} tissue regene ration. Over the years, it has become clear that a dult stem cells also possess a wide rang e of immune and inflammation modulating properties. Many research groups have studied the immunologi cal behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in v itro and their role as an adoptive immune reg ulatory cell population in several immune-related disorders. Nowadays, other adult adheren t stem cell populations have been characterized an d are being considered to exhibit more potenc y compared to MSCs. Recently, human multipote nt adult progenitor cells (hMAPCs) have thoroughly been studied and {{have been shown to be}} clear ly distinct from hMSCs. In contrast to hMSCs, hMAP Cs can be expanded for a significantly longer time ¨and – besides mesenchymal cell types & ndash; also differentiate into functional end othelium in vitro and in vivo. Clinical-grade prod uction of MAPCs has been achieved and, curren tly, this proprietary large-scale expanded stem ce ll product (MultiStem®) is being evaluated as¨ an allogeneic ‘off-the-shelf’ stem cel l product in the clinic in the fields of regenerat ive medicine for cardiovascular (acute myocardial¨ infarction; AMI) and neurological diseases (i <b>schemic</b> <b>stroke)</b> and as immunotherapy in immun e-associated disorders [graft-versus-host disease¨ (GvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplantation (HSCT), solid organ transplantation¨ and autoimmunity). Even though administ ration of clinical-grade hMAPCs appears to be ¨safe and well-tolerated, and leads to benefi cial (preliminary) clinical results, data regardin g their immunological behavior in vitro are s carce. A better understanding of the exact immune¨ regulatory mechanism would be very valuable t o optimize future clinical studies on the immunotherapeutic function of hMAPCs and of adult stem cel ls in general. In the presented manuscript, in con tinuation of a former project in this specific res earch line, we addressed the issue by investi gating the reciprocal interaction between (clinica l-grade) hMAPCs and immune cells of a functional h uman immune system in vitro. Given the fact t hat cytotoxic immune effector cells play a cr ucial role in immune homeostasis and in the p athogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, ¨we analyzed the influence of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs on the phenotype and functionality of nat ural killer (NK) cells and CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells¨ (CTLs). The first specific objective of this ¨research was to explore the immunogenic and immun e modulatory properties of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs, with regard to functional cytotoxic responses of ¨NK cells and T cells. More specific, it was quest ioned whether these stem cells of alloge neic origin could act as stimulators, as fore ign target cells or as modulators of NK cells and CTLs. We showed that hMAPCs are not able to induce an antigen-specific ‒ a nd only a minimal anti-CD 3 -redirected ‒ CTL response in vitro. Furthermore, allogene ic hMAPCs were insensitive to antigen-sp ecific CTL-mediated lysis and to killing by r esting KIR-mismatched NK cells, despite expression ¨of some ligands (PVR and ULBP- 2 / 5 / 6) of activatin g NK cell receptors (respectively DNAM- 1 and NKG 2 D). On the other hand, IL- 2 -preactiv ated NK cells efficiently lysed allogeneic hMAPCs. ¨However, increased MHC class I expression af ter IFN-γ-pretreatment of hMAPCs did not res ult in higher MHC-I-dependent allorecognition by C TLs and reduced hMAPC susceptibility to preac tivated NK cell-mediated killing, by shifting the¨ balance towards MHC-I-associated inhibitory N K cell signalling. These results indicate low ¨immunogenicity of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs in vitr o, and suggest that survival of hMAPCs in viv o will primarily be dictated by the inflammat ory status and the cytokine balance in the local microenvironment. Secondly, we proved that hMA PCs exert strong immune suppressive effects, as th ey are able to suppress alloreactive CTL prol iferation and IL- 2 -induced expansion of allogeneic ¨NK cells. The suppressive effect on NK cell proliferation is dose- and IDO-dependent, and is m ore pronounced for hMAPCs than for hMSCs ¨from the same donor. In addition, we observed a reduced cytotoxic function of restin g NK cells and activated CTLs (in an ant igen-specific and anti-CD 3 -redirected cytotoxicity ¨system) in the presence of allogeneic third-party ¨hMAPCs during the lytic effector phase. hMAP Cs also directly and dose-dependently impaired ind uction of CTL cytotoxicity during their priming phase (alloantigen-induced or polyclonal a ctivation) by interfering with their perforin expression. On the other hand, in contrast t o their inhibitory effect on NK cell prolifer ation, hMAPCs had no influence on the intrins ic cytotoxic properties of NK cells during th e IL- 2 -mediated activation phase. Because of compe tition between hMAPCs and K 562 cells as targe t cells for IL- 2 -activated NK cell-mediated k illing, we could not conclude if hMAPCs influ ence the killer function of IL- 2 -activated NK cells during their effector phase. Taken together, our observations imply that (clinical-grade) hMA PCs impair both proliferative and cytotoxic NK and T cell responses, resulting in a lower immun e response in vitro. The second specific goa l of this thesis was to further elaborate the immune modulatory mechanism of (clinical-gra de) hMAPCs and to identify responsible immune ¨regulatory factors and pathways. We demonstrated¨ that the mode of action is multifactorial and ¨depends on the studied immune effector response. ¨ In case of proliferation suppression, we coul d ascribe a partial role to IDO for hMAPC-med iated impairment of NK cell proliferation, in line ¨with previously obtained results for T cell¨ expansion inhibition. In contrast, we could n ot identify a single responsible soluble factor (IDO, PGE 2, IL- 10 and TGF-β) in NK ce ll cytotoxicity suppression. Transwell experiments showed contact-dependency of hMAPCs to¨ exert their suppressive function on T cell cytotox icity. Until now, as is the case for NK cells, we did not detect a single responsible ¨contact-dependent mechanism in hMAPC-mediated T c ell cytotoxicity suppression. Though, we desc ribed for the first time hMAPC expressio n of galectin- 1 and ligands of the immun e inhibitory PD- 1 pathway (PD-L 1 / 2) and¨ of the Fas-mediated apoptosis pathway (FasL). Functional blocking studies however did not confirm the latter two pathways as suppressiv e candidates in CTL function inhibition by hMAPCs. With regard to the suppressed T cell phenoty pe, we observed that the presence of hMAPCs does n ot result in T cell apoptosis or anergy and t hat T cells retain their memory response duri ng a secondary immune reaction after removal¨ of hMAPCs. However, hMAPCs largely disturb th e activation marker expression of T cells. In ¨hMAPC-modulated T cells, CD 69 expression was ¨clearly and persistently increased, in both CD 8 -¨ and CD 8 + T cell populations. Moreover, HLA-DR ¨and CD 25 (IL- 2 Rα) upregulation were signifi cantly decreased in the presence of hMAPCs. hMAPCs ¨downregulated CD 25 expression to a lower ext ent on CD 8 T cells and shifted those cells p ossibly towards a regulatory phenotype. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that (cl inical-grade) hMAPCs are low immunogenic ¨and have potent immunosuppressive effects in ¨vitro on NK cells and CTLs. In addition, we have¨ contributed to a better understanding of the¨ complex immunomodulatory mechanism. Based on these findings, we can state that the rationa le for therapeutic use of hMAPCs or its clinical-g rade counterpart MultiStem as an off-the-shel f adoptive cell population in the context of¨ immune-related disorders is legitimate. These data may represent an extensive co ntribution to the current knowledge and, in combination with the results of future phase II/III ¨trials using MultiStem, will lead to an intriguing continuation of stem cell-based resear ch for immunotherapy. nrpages: 136 status: publishe...|$|E
