5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park <b>Service</b> <b>management</b> of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E

40|$|About the book: This is {{the first}} {{introductory}} text on public <b>services</b> <b>management</b> which provides a comprehensive overview of the subject from a truly management perspective. Taking the context of public <b>services</b> <b>management</b> as its starting point, the first section explains why changes in public services have come about and the impact these changes have on public <b>services</b> <b>management.</b> Political, social and economic factors are considered and the distinctiveness of public <b>services</b> <b>management</b> is discussed. An examination of management functions {{as they relate to}} public services follows in section two, while section three critically assesses public <b>services</b> <b>management</b> and its future. The text is generously supported by Financial Times case material, personal profiles and vignettes, including those from the private and voluntary sectors, to provide a real-life context.
