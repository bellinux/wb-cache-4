5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's {{assistant director of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting <b>students</b> <b>like</b> John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E

Jigsaw <b>students</b> <b>liked</b> school more, (Caucasians generally, Mexican-Americans slightly, but not African-Americans.) Trad <b>students</b> <b>liked</b> school less (Caucasians generally, not Mexican-Americans, and African-Americans significantly.) The authors contribute this {{to the fact that}} Mexican-American jigsaws may have felt forced to participate in peer teaching. Two other questions produced significant results. Competitiveness among jigsaws decreased and increased among trads. Jigsaws felt they could learn more from other students while trads did not. <b>Students</b> reported increase <b>liking</b> of their group members, but they also increased their <b>liking</b> of other <b>students</b> in the class.|$|R

As the criteria and their weightings are different, the QS World university rankings and the QS Asian University rankings released in the same academic year are different. QS published global universities ranking by different major in different countries, which has special reference value for international <b>students,</b> <b>like</b> Statistics & Operational Research program in China.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 1920, {{the first}} day of the blizzard, the school {{dismissed}} its students early to enable them to go home before the storm arrived. Many of the <b>students,</b> <b>like</b> the Miner children, were used to driving to and from school with a horse and buggy, but the school teacher had a rule that no child was permitted to drive home in bad weather without permission from a parent. William Miner, who was worried about the blizzard conditions, rode the two miles to the school on a saddle horse to escort his children home.|$|E

25|$|After the Bologna process {{implementation}} {{in the late}} 2000s, although most state-run higher education student costs are supported with public money, the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend the a public college or university and the attraction of new types of mature students (enrolled as part-time or evening class <b>students)</b> <b>like</b> employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).|$|E
25|$|As Lola Mora {{had been}} until she {{fell out of}} favor with local high society, monumental sculptors became in very high demand after 1900, {{particularly}} by municipal governments and wealthy families, who competed {{with each other in}} boasting the most evocative mausolea for their dearly departed. Though most preferred French and Italian sculptors, work by locals Erminio Blotta, Ángel María de Rosa, and Rogelio Yrurtia resulted in a proliferation of soulful monuments and memorials made them immortal. Not as realist as the work of some of his belle-époque predecessors in sculpture, Yrurtia's subtle impressionism inspired Argentine <b>students</b> <b>like</b> Antonio Pujía, whose internationally prized female torsos always surprise admirers with their whimsical and surreal touches, while Pablo Curatella Manes' sculptures drew from cubism.|$|E

25|$|In 1906, {{after the}} {{abolition}} of the imperial examinations, the Qing government established many new schools and encouraged students to study abroad. Many young people attended the new schools or went abroad to study in places like Japan. A new class of intellectuals emerged from those students, who contributed immensely to the Xinhai Revolution. Besides Sun Yat-sen, key figures in the revolution, such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin and Wang Jingwei, were all Chinese students in Japan. Some were young <b>students</b> <b>like</b> Zou Rong, known for writing the book Revolutionary Army, in which he talked about the extermination of the Manchus for the 260 years of oppression, sorrow, cruelty and tyranny and turning the sons and grandsons of Yellow Emperor into George Washingtons.|$|E

In 1904 he was briefly editor-in-chief of an ephemeral Carlist daily El Correo de Guipúzcoa, though it is not clear whether he lived in San Sebastián at that time. In Madrid he gained recognition in 1905 becoming secretary of Sección de Ciencias Historicas of Ateneo de Madrid, though principally as a young and successful lawyer, involved in cases gaining wider publicity.|$|E
25|$|The Calgary Board of Education (CBE), in Calgary, Alberta, has various elementary, {{middle and}} high schools {{offering}} the GATE Program, standing for Gifted and Talented Education, for Grades 4-12, or Divisions 2-4. The program for students, who, through an IQ test, ranked in the Very Superior Range; falling into Gifted or Genius. For each of the three divisions, there are 2 schools offering GATE, one for the North Side of the city (CBE Areas I, II and III) and one for the South Side (CBE Areas IV and V). For Division 2, or Grades 4-6, it is available at Hillhurst Elementary School for the North and Nellie McClung Elementary School for the South. For Division 3, or Grades 7-9, it is available at Queen Elizabeth High School for the North and John Ware Junior High School for the South. For Division 3, or Grades 10-12, Queen Elizabeth High School, which is a joint Junior High-Senior High offers it for the North and Henry Wise Wood Senior High School offers it for the south. GATE classes go more in depth and learns some curriculum for the following grade level, with tougher assignments and a faster learning pace. They benefit from being around <b>students</b> <b>like</b> them. These students attend the school alongside regular students and those in other programs (e.g. IB, AP.) In the 2014-15 school year, students from Grades 4-7 in the south will be attending Louis Riel Junior High School, already home to a science program, and students in the regular program there will be moved to Nellie McClung and John Ware. Students at John Ware will be phased out: eighth grade GATE will end in June 2015, and ninth grade GATE will end in 2016, while GATE will be expanding to Grade 9 at Louis Riel by September 2016. Prior to John Ware, the GATE program was housed at Elboya. A large number of teachers from Nellie McClung and John Ware will be moving to the new location, which was picked to deal with student population issues and to concentrate resources.|$|E

[...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E

At his inauguration he accepted the charter and seal presented to John Leverett the Younger in 1707, but dropped a number of other customs, including the singing of Gloria Patri and the Latin Oration. This was a sign of things to come. While, unlike some other universities, Harvard did not require Greek or Latin for entrance, they were worth double credits towards admission, and <b>students</b> <b>like</b> Conant who had studied Latin were awarded an A.B. degree while those who had not, received an S.B.

500|$|Coeducation at Syracuse traced {{its roots}} {{to the early}} days of Genesee College where {{educators}} and <b>students</b> <b>like</b> Frances Willard and Belva Lockwood were heavily influenced by the Women's movement in nearby Seneca Falls, NY. However, the progressive [...] "co-ed" [...] policies practiced at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse. Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. Erastus Otis Haven, Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the University of Michigan and Northwestern University, maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at Syracuse where she joined the other newly admitted female students in founding the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. The inclusion of women in {{the early days of}} the university led to the proliferation of various women's clubs and societies. In fact, it was a Syracuse professor who coined the term [...] "sorority" [...] specifically for Gamma Phi Beta.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning.

In the season two opening episode [...] "Bart Gets an F", Bart fails four consecutive history exams and the school psychiatrist recommends that Bart repeat the fourth grade. Several critics thought that the episode [...] "Bart Gets an F" [...] {{was a response to}} these controversies. However, Brooks denied that it was a response and added, [...] "we're mindful of it. I do think it's important for us that Bart does badly in school. There are <b>students</b> <b>like</b> that. Besides, I'm very wary of television where everybody {{is supposed to be a}} role model.
