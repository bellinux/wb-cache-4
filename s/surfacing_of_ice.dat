40|$|Heterogeneous nitrates {{photolysis}} is {{the trigger}} for many chemical processes {{occurring in the}} polar boundary layer and is widely believed to occur in a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> The dipole forbidden character of the electronic transition relevant to boundary layer atmospheric chemistry and the small photolysis/photoproducts quantum yields in ice (and in water) may confer a significant enhancement and interfacial specificity to this important photochemical reaction at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> Using amorphous solid water films at cryogenic temperatures as models for the disordered interstitial air/ice interface within the snowpack suppresses the diffusive uptake kinetics thereby prolonging the residence time of nitrate anions at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> This approach allows their slow heterogeneous photolysis kinetics to be studied providing the first direct evidence that nitrates adsorbed onto the first molecular layer at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> are photolyzed more effectively than those dissolved within the bulk. Vibrational spectroscopy allows the ~ 3 -fold enhancement in photolysis rates to be correlated with the nitrates’ distorted intramolecular geometry thereby hinting at {{the role played by}} the greater chemical heterogeneity in their solvation environment at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> than in the bulk. A simple 1 D kinetic model suggests 1 -that a 3 (6) -fold enhancement in photolysis rate for nitrates adsorbed onto the ice surface could increase the photochemical NO[subscript 2] emissions from a 5 (8) nm thick photochemically active interfacial layer by 30 %(60) %, and 2 -that 25 %(40 %) of the NO[subscript 2] photochemical emissions to the snowpack interstitial air are released from the top-most molecularly thin surface layer on ice. These findings may provide a new paradigm for heterogeneous (photo) chemistry at temperatures below those required for a QLL to form at the ice surface...|$|R

We recently revealed the icestructuring properties of zirconium acetate, which {{are similar to those}} of ice-structuring proteins. Because zirconium acetate is a salt and therefore different from proteins having icestructuring properties, its ice-structuring mechanism remains unelucidated. Here we investigate this ice-structuring mechanism through the role of the concentration of zirconium acetate and the ice crystal growth velocity. We then explore other compounds presenting similar functional groups (acetate, hydroxyl, or carboxylic groups). On the basis of these results, we propose that zirconium acetate adopts a hydroxy-bridged polymer structure that can bind to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> crystals through hydrogen bonding, thereby slowing down the ice crystal growth...|$|R

40|$|Water is an {{extraordinary}} substance. It owes its characteristic anomalous properties to a network of strong hydrogen bonds present between water molecules. In ice, water molecules hold regular positions in the crystal. Nevertheless, the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> can be dynamic and exciting, especially at the surface. At temperatures well below bulk melting, the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> is covered by a liquid premelted layer. This water layer governs many geophysical processes and {{plays a role in}} the low friction <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> This thesis describes several properties <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> and ice-related systems at the molecular level. For this purpose we have employed a variety of spectroscopic techniques and made use of stretching vibrations as sensitive probes of the molecular structure. The position, amplitude, and width of the stretching bands are utilized to describe the molecular properties and structure. The vibrational dynamics of water molecules in ice and hydrated salts are studied in Chapters 4 and 5.

The spherical Ca-P particles thus produced contained various amounts of the amorphous phase which were controlled by the stand-off distance between the spray nozzle and the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> blocks or water. The smooth surface morphology without cracks of spherical Ca-P particles indicated that there were very low thermal stresses in these particles. Plasma-sprayed Ca-P particles were highly bioactive due to their amorphous component and hence quickly induced the formation of bone-like apatite on their surfaces after they were immersed in an acellular simulated body fluid at 36. 5 °C. Bone-like apatite nucleated on dissolved surface (due to the amorphous phase) of individual Ca-P particles and grew to coalesce between neighboring Ca-P particles thus forming an integrated apatite plate. Bioactive and biodegradable composite scaffolds were produced by incorporating plasma-sprayed Ca-P particles into a degradable polymer. In vitro experiments showed that plasma-sprayed Ca-P particles enhanced the formation of bone-like apatite on the pore <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Ca-P/PLLA composite scaffolds. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Ice cauldrons are {{depressions}} {{which form}} at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> sheets when an underlying subglacial lake empties, in particular when subglacial volcanic eruptions occur. Notable {{examples of such}} cauldrons occur on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the Vatnajökull <b>ice</b> cap in Iceland. More generally, cauldrons will form when a subglacial lake empties during a jökulhlaup.

By using first-principles calculations, we show that the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> crystalline <b>ice</b> exhibits a remarkable variance in vacancy formation energies, akin to an amorphous material. We find vacancy formation energies as low as â�¼ 0. 1 - 0. 2 eV, {{which leads to a}} higher than expected vacancy concentration. Because a vacancy's reactivity correlates with its formation energy, ice particles may be more reactive than previously thought. We also show that vacancies significantly reduce the formation energy of neighbouring vacancies, thus facilitating pitting and contributing to pre-melting and quasi-liquid layer formation. These surface properties arise from proton disorder and the relaxation of geometric constraints, which suggests that other frustrated materials may possess unusual surface characteristics.

40|$|Using density {{functional}} theory {{we investigate}} whether intrinsic defects in ice surface segregate. We predict that hydronium, hydroxide, and the Bjerrum L- and D-defects are all more stable at the surface. However, the energetic cost {{to create a}} D-defect at the surface and migrate it into the bulk crystal is smaller than its bulk formation energy. Absolute and relative segregation energies {{are sensitive to the}} <b>surface</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>ice,</b> especially the spatial distribution of protons associated with dangling hydrogen bonds. It is found that the basal plane <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> hexagonal <b>ice</b> increases the bulk concentration of Bjerrum defects, strongly favoring D-defects over L- defects. Dangling protons associated with undercoordinated water molecules are preferentially injected into the crystal bulk as Bjerrum D-defects, leading to a surface dipole that attracts hydronium ions. Aside from the disparity in segregation energies for the Bjerrum defects, we find the interactions between defect species to be very finely balanced; surface segregation energies for hydronium and hydroxide species and trapping energies of these ionic species with Bjerrum defects are equal within the accuracy of our calculations. The mobility of the ionic hydronium and hydroxide species is greatly reduced at the surface in comparison to the bulk due to surface sites with high trapping affinities. We suggest that, in pure <b>ice</b> samples, the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> will have an acidic character due to the presence of hydronium ions.
