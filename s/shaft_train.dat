Thermoplastic matrices and PRD 49 -III fiber provided impact resistance at low weight which was superior to composites having the same fiber in a thermoset resin matrix. A design, fabrication, and test program showed that shaft impact resistance could be improved over the previously developed graphite composite design at a cost in <b>shaft</b> <b>train</b> rate savings. The <b>shaft</b> <b>train</b> weight savings of the most impact tolerant construction was 4. 0 % over the current aluminum <b>shaft</b> <b>train.</b> Alternating plies of graphite and glass appear to provide substantially greater tube impact durability than that provided by hybridization of the two fibers into one tape wound to a ply design equivalent in strength and stiffness {{to that of the}} alternating ply design. Recommendations were made to continue research work to exploit the potential for more impact-durable structures through the use of KEVLAR 49 fiber, woven structures, thermoplastic matrices and THORNEL 50 -S/KEVLAR 49 blends with thermoset matrices...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 61 Consideration of {{torsional}} vibration in pump/driver shaft trains has become of increasing importance {{with the development}} of electronically controlled variable speed electric motors. Such motors not only provide a static driving toque, but develop superimposed continuous torque pulsations. The frequency of these torque pulsations varies with speed, such that typically resonance situations with a torsional natural mode at distinct speed cannot be avoided. Whether such resonance situations can be sustained during extended time periods without endangering the shafts by fatigue depends primarily on the total amount of damping available in the <b>shaft</b> <b>train.</b> Besides material and structural damping, which are internal damping sources, pump impellers are expected to provide external damping by convective energy dissipation into the pumped fluid. From literature, predictions of impeller damping on a theoretical basis are known, but almost no information about an experimental identification of torsional damping coefficients is available. The authors describe the development of a test rig for the identification of torsional damping and added mass moment of inertia of pump impellers. To find a suitable method to excite the test <b>shaft</b> <b>train</b> within a sufficiently large frequency band was the main difficulty to solve when developing the test rig. Test results are shown and compared with theoretical predictions.

40|$|LectureThis paper {{deals with}} the damping ratio D of the 1 st {{torsional}} mode of synchronous motor driven compressor trains. The damping ratio is a crucial parameter for the torsional start-up analysis and for the lifetime calculation of the shafts. At the start-up, a synchronous motor runs in an asynchronous mode and generates oscillating torques with two times the slip frequency. The frequency of the pulsating torques decreases with the rotor speed and the resonance with the 1 st torsional mode of the <b>shaft</b> <b>train</b> cannot be avoided. In resonance the shafts and couplings are highly loaded and the shaft stresses exceed the fatigue limit. Therefore, {{the number of the}} admissible starts is normally limited. The magnitude of the torques at resonance (and by consequence the shaft stresses) is strongly dependent on the damping ratio of the train?s fundamental mode. For the analyses, the assumed damping is normally based on the compressor manufacturer?s experience, which is built up from several measurements formerly done at similar trains. The data are in agreement with the commonly used standard value for geared trains, which ranges from D= 2 % to D= 5 %. In the first section of the paper, two measurements are presented, which were recently performed at two air compressor trains. The trains were of the same arrangement, but with different sizes of the components. The torques were measured during the start-up with strain gauges at the low speed couplings. The fundamental mode?s damping was determined by curve-fitting with a linear one-mass model. For both trains, the identified damping was considerably higher than expected. Further on, non-linear effects were observed at resonance. In a second section the paper deals with coupled torsional and lateral (T&L) analyses. The torsional and lateral degrees of freedom of the <b>shaft</b> <b>train</b> model were coupled via the gear. The damping in resonance was determined with an eigenvalue analysis of the coupled system. Herewith, it was attempted to explain at least the linear portion of the identified damping and, respectively, the contribution of the gear?s fluid film bearings to the effectively measured damping. The calculations confirmed the higher damping ratio for the two measured trains. The investigations were extended to several compressor trains of different sizes. It was observed that the damping varies depending on the actual inertia and stiffness proportions of the train components. The deviation from the usually employed standard damping can be either higher or lower values.

It was designed for an air separation plant in Germany to produce nitrogen and oxygen for an adjacent steel works. The compressor was driven via a standard gear-tooth coupling with a 1500 mm (59 inch) spacer shaft by an induction motor with speed of 1490 rpm and power of 4000 Kw (5400 hp).

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the design and}} production of highly efficient and reliable wind turbine drive trains, the project deals with the mathematical modelling and experimental study of drive train system dynamics. A typical drive train is considered as the subsystem of a wind turbine that transfers mechanical power from the rotor hub to the generator, and thereby {{plays an important role}} in the system dynamics and efficiency of wind turbine operation. The dynamics of wind turbines is complex and a critical area of study for the wind industry. The multidisciplinary nature of wind turbine design adds to the complexity of this task, as the subsystems of a wind turbine need to be tuned with respect to a common objective to achieve a cost effective and optimum structural performance. The current work contributes to enhanced knowledge in this field with focus on interaction between functional components and system dynamic response, faults modelling and detectability of defects in bearings in wind turbine drive trains. The overall performance of a drive train can be evaluated from different perspectives. In this thesis, the dynamics behaviour of the high speed <b>shaft</b> drive <b>train</b> is evaluated by proposed objective functions referring to displacements, loads, and frequency responses. To have a better insight into wind turbine dynamics, the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of high speed <b>shaft</b> drive <b>train</b> dynamics with respect to input structural parameters is considered. The multiplicative dimension reduction method is employed to provide the mapping between the objective functions' sensitivity indices and design variables. The results of such analysis can narrow down the number of input variables for design problem and improve the computational efficiency. The proposed GSA methodology is applied for the system modelled analysis of high speed shaft subsystem of a drive train. Moreover, by introducing defects in functional components and investigating sensitivity indices, detectability of faults by GSA is proved. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of detecting damage in the functional components such as bearings in early stage before a complete failure. The application of this methodology within the detection, prediction, and prevention framework has a potential to reduce the maintenance cost for critical components. The results can also provide a better understanding and useful hints in wind turbine drive train system dynamics with respect to different structural parameters, ultimately designing more efficient drive trains...|$|R

40|$|The {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} (S-CO₂) cycle is a promising advanced power conversion cycle which couples nicely to many Generation IV nuclear reactors. This work investigates the power conversion system design and proposes several "Third Generation" plant layouts for power ratings ranging between 20 and 1200 MWe for the recompression cycle. A 20 MWe simple cycle layout was also developed. The cycle designs are characterized by a dispersed component layout in which a single <b>shaft</b> turbomachinery <b>train</b> is coupled to parallel arrays of multiple printed circuit heat exchanger modules. This configuration has arrangement benefits in terms of modularity, inspectability, repairability and replaceability. Compared to the prior second generation dispersed layouts, its lower ductwork pressure drop confers approximately 2 % higher thermal efficiency. Two alternative S-CO₂ cycle designs for medium power applications were developed using an in-house optimization computer code and Solid Edge software. The first design is a recompression cycle derived from the 300 MWe design developed at MIT for Generation IV reactors. The design employs one turbine, two compressors (main and recompression) working in parallel and two recuperators (high and low temperature) and maximizes cycle efficiency while striving for a small plant footprint. The second design is a simple S-CO₂ power cycle, which has only one turbine, one compressor, and one recuperator. The main focus of the simple S-CO₂ design is cycle compactness and simplicity while achieving still attractive efficiency. Extensive sensitivity studies were performed for both the medium power recompression and simple S-CO₂ cycles to reveal areas for performance improvement, or performance degradation. Cycle efficiency is most sensitive to turbine inlet temperature. (cont.) Peak cycle pressure {{is also an important}} parameter affecting cycle efficiency, although to a smaller extent than turbine inlet temperature. Higher pressure gives higher efficiency, but this gradually saturates around 28 MPa. Other sensitivity studies included turbomachinery performance, cooling water temperature, and heat exchanger fouling and plugging The reference parameters chosen are a 650 °C turbine inlet temperature and 20 MPa peak cycle pressure (compressor outlet) because they reach a high thermodynamic efficiency (~/~ 47 - 48 %) while staying within materials limitations. In order to couple the cycle to many of the Generation IV nuclear reactors a second reference case was chosen with a turbine inlet temperature of 550 °C and a peak cycle pressure of 20 MPa. by Jonathan Paul Gibbs.

The current speed-time profile is out of date, based on another ship class, and does not depict the profile in one-knot increments. Additional profile data, such as how the engineering plant is operated and a mission profile, do not exist.

The vibrations were observed on the high speed part of the shaft line and both compressor and gearbox exhibited vibratory levels higher than 50 microns peak to peak on the second harmonic (H 2) of the rotational speed. The centrifugal compressor is driven via a variable speed electrical motor through a gearbox. The main characteristics of the shaft line are the following: 9 MW electrical motor running from 1250 to 1875 rpm to cover the whole operating speed range of the compressor; Gearbox with a speed ratio of 7. 035; Centrifugal compressor (back to back arrangement) from 72 to 167 bara (first stage) and from 165 to 307 bara (second stage); Low speed and high speed flexible couplings of membrane type technology. All individual components of the train were successfully tested prior to be integrated to constitute the complete shaft line package. The aerodynamics performances of the compressor were as expected, and the gear box and the compressor did not exhibit any abnormal vibratory behavior. During the ASME PTC 10 Type 1 string test of the complete package, super-synchronous vibrations were detected on the compressor and the pinion of the gearbox while the compressor was running at around 94 % speed. Extensive theoretical and experimental investigations were conducted to identify {{the root cause of}} the 2 X vibration component with the full involvement of the different components suppliers: Potential excitation coming from the electrical drive system; Potential excitation coming from the gearbox; Aerodynamic excitation coming from the compressor; Torsional resonance and/or interaction with lateral behavior; Contact, alignment, lubrication influence, type of bearings; Lateral critical speed combination (<b>train</b> <b>shaft</b> line analysis); Type of coupling, non linearity and lack of flexibility.
