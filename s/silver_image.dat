5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white <b>silver</b> <b>image</b> couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E

2500|$|Talbot's later {{photographic}} {{work was}} concentrated on photomechanical reproduction methods. In addition {{to making the}} mass reproduction of photographic images more practical and much less expensive, rendering a photograph into ink on paper, known to be permanent {{on a scale of}} hundreds if not thousands of years, was clearly one sure way to avoid the problems with fading that had soon become apparent in early types of <b>silver</b> <b>image</b> paper prints. Talbot created the photoglyphic (or [...] "photoglyptic") engraving process, later perfected by others as the photogravure process.|$|E

50|$|By 1935, Godowsky and Mannes and the Kodak {{research}} {{staff had}} developed a marketable subtractive color film for home movies. Kodachrome film was coated with three layers of ordinary black-and-white silver halide gelatin emulsion, but each layer was made sensitive to only one-third of the spectrum of colors—in essence, to red, green or blue. Special processing chemistry and procedures caused complementary cyan, magenta or yellow dye images to be generated in these layers as the black-and-white <b>silver</b> <b>images</b> were developed. After they had served their purpose, the <b>silver</b> <b>images</b> were chemically removed, so that the completed chromogenic film consisted solely of the three layers of dye images suspended in gelatin.|$|R

60|$|The people flocked out quickly, {{and soon}} {{only a few}} devout penitents remained.

60|$|Now {{whatever}} {{may have}} been the exact ceremonial use to which the ancients put this pinnacle, without doubt {{it had something to do}} with sun-worship. This, indeed, was proved by the fact that, at any rate at this season of the year, the first rays of the risen orb struck full upon its point. Thus it came about that, as she stood there waiting, Benita of a sudden found herself suffused in light so vivid and intense that, clothed as she was in a dress which had once been white, it must have caused her to shine like a <b>silver</b> <b>image.</b> For several minutes, indeed, this golden spear of fire blinded her so that she could see nothing, but stood quite still, afraid to move, and waiting until, as the sun grew higher, its level rays passed over her. This they did presently, and plunging into the valley, began to drive away the fog. Now she looked down, along the line of the river.|$|E

60|$|Many curious {{stories were}} related about {{him at this}} period. It was said that a stout Burgo-master, {{who had come to}} deliver a florid oratorical address on behalf of the {{citizens}} of the town, had caught sight of him kneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been brought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new gods. On another occasion he had been missed for several hours, and after a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one of the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a Greek gem carved with the figure of Adonis. He had been seen, so the tale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue that had been discovered in the bed of the river {{on the occasion of the}} building of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name of the Bithynian slave of Hadrian. He had passed a whole night in noting the effect of the moonlight on a <b>silver</b> <b>image</b> of Endymion.|$|E
60|$|Philip, {{a little}} more alive to the probabilities, {{nevertheless}} was disposed to regard them as 'fun and pastime.' He had had many a frolic with his baby-sisters, {{and this would be}} only a prolonged one; besides, it was 'Berry's' one hope, and to rescue any creature from a convent was a good work, in his Protestant eyes, which had not become a whit less prejudiced at Paris. So he was quite prepared to take his full share of his niece, or more, if she should object to her father's looks, and he only suggested halting at an old woman's stall to buy some sweetmeats by way of propitiation--a proceeding which much amazed the gazing population of Lucon. Two reports were going about, one that the King had vowed a <b>silver</b> <b>image</b> of himself to St. Ursula, if her Prioress would obtain his recovery by their prayers; the other {{that he was going to}} translate her to the royal Abbey of Fontevrault to take charge of his daughter, Madame Elisabeth. Any way, high honour by a royal messenger must be intended to the Prioress, Mere Monique, and the Luconnais were proud of her sanctity.|$|E

50|$|In {{color film}} {{processes}} such as Cinecolor and Prizma, two black-and-white negatives photographed through red and blue-green filters, or by an equivalent bipack method, were photographically printed onto {{opposite sides of the}} duplitized film. Because its emulsion was sensitive only to blue light, a temporary yellow dye incorporated into the film prevented each printing light from also exposing the emulsion on the other side. The exposed film was developed like ordinary black-and-white film, producing a series of black-and-white <b>silver</b> <b>images</b> on each side. These were then chemically converted into single-color images of a color roughly complementary to that being used for the images {{on the other side and}} to the color of the camera filter used when filming them. The resulting superimposed pairs of transparent single-color images, projected onto a screen or viewed directly, could reproduce a limited but useful and sometimes very pleasing range of color. It was mainly in the specifics of the chemistry, apparatus and procedures used to convert the <b>silver</b> <b>images</b> into color-toned ones that the several commercial processes based on the use of duplitized film differed significantly.|$|R

5000|$|Color {{developer}} bath: 6:00 @ 96-103 °F (35.6-39.4 °C). This step {{is carried}} out to completion. The developer contains CD-3 developing agent, and acts upon the chemically exposed silver halide that was not developed in the first developer to form a positive <b>silver</b> <b>image.</b> The metallic negative <b>silver</b> <b>image</b> formed in the first developer has no part in the reaction of this step. As the color development progresses, a metallic positive <b>silver</b> <b>image</b> is formed and the color developing agent is oxidized. Oxidized color developer molecules react with the color couplers and color dyes are formed {{in each of the}} three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different color couplers, which react with the same oxidized developer molecules but form different color dyes. Variation in color developer pH causes color shifts on the green-magenta axis with Kodak E100G & E100GX and Fujichrome films and on the yellow-blue axis with older Ektachrome films.|$|E
