Ibuyambo <b>Secondary</b> <b>Cooperative</b> Ltd consisted of seven primary cooperatives from which data was collected from 18 respondents through questionnaires. To complement that, interviews were conducted with six key informants from government departments and other development stakeholders in the same area. The study was conducted in August 2013. The study covered a literature review on poverty as one variable, with focus on its definition; theoretical perspectives of poverty; poverty in development thought; global statistics on poverty; historical background of poverty in South Africa; structural adjustment programmes as a major cause of poverty; and causes of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. A literature review of income generation as another variable was also undertaken, with emphasis on definitions; the experience of income generation projects/activities (IGPs/IGAs); key factors for the successful implementation and management of projects; income generation projects and sustainable livelihoods; income generation and poverty alleviation programmes in South Africa; as well as a case study of projects under IRDP in India.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM The problem studied {{was whether}} there exist {{significant}} differences between the perceived knowledge obtained by former <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> work experience students as compared to the instructional goals and objectives of these programs as identified by the Oregon State Department of Education. THE PROCEDURE The problem as it is identified above was divided into three phases. The first phase was identification and classification of the instructional goals and objectives that the Oregon State Department of Education had established for <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> work experience programs. The second phase {{of this study was to}} verify that the eight Oregon secondary schools that participated in this study were in agreement with the instructional goals and objectives for cooperative work experience programs as had previously been identified. The third phase of this study was an investigation of the perceived opinions held by former students of Oregon <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> work experience programs about the actual effects the identified instructional goals and objectives have had. A mail survey questionnaire was used to gather the data. The sample for the study consisted of 80 males and 126 females who were seniors enrolled during the 1970 - 71 school year in a cooperative work experience program in the eight Oregon high schools agreeing to participate in this study. The F statistic was used to analyze contrast among the mean scores for each criterion variable statement with the. 05 level of significance being used to determine differences existing between the two groups of male and female. Demographic data was compiled into tables for interpretation of the personal characteristics of the response population. SELECTED FINDINGS The analysis of variance test indicated that the two groups were alike in their responses to the criterion variable statements contained in the questionnaire. Significant differences at the. 05 level did not occur in any of the criterion variable statements employed to test the null-hypothesis. Other selected findings of importance were: - <b>Secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> work experience programs, as they have been offered in Oregon, were accomplishing a majority of the instructional goals and objectives which had been identified. A majority of former students surveyed believed they learned and benefited from the programs. - Former students of these programs were more successful in obtaining and maintaining employment in comparison to the total state population of youths under 25 years old. -A majority of females surveyed got their first job in the exact same area as their training. -Two years after leaving high school a majority of the females surveyed were still employed in areas related to their cooperative work experience training. The testing of the mean scores indicated that the two groups surveyed were similar in their responses. The hypothesis were retained in all of the criterion variable statements. The general acceptance of the hypothesis by the surveyed population may be interpreted as representing the entire population of all former senior students enrolled in Oregon secondary work experience programs during the 1970 - 71 school year. SELECTED RECOMMENDATIONS The author would recommend that a validation study be repeated at a future date. Other areas needing research are methods of improving coordination between student interests and/or vocational training and the actual placement in related work stations. Further research is needed in how the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> work experience programs can be made more effective and efficient in placing students on jobs after leaving high school that are directly related to their training experience. The evidence presented in this study has implications that need to be investigated by all personnel concerned with Oregon <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> work experience programs. These are implications that should be of interest to administrators of secondary vocational programs...|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} the same overlay cognitive radio scenario as in[10, 11], but including a <b>cooperative</b> <b>secondary</b> network with multiple relays, while the methods in[10, 11] consider a non-cooperative secondary network. We investigate {{the performance of}} both the primary and the secondary networks in terms of throughput. In our proposed scheme, we {{consider the}} use of the SDF and IDF protocols, where the secondary destination combines the messages received from the secondary transmitter and from the relay by means of maximal ratio combining (MRC). In this work, our aim is to show that, while considering a cognitive radio protocol as that in[10], the proposed <b>cooperative</b> <b>secondary</b> network exploiting primary retransmissions is able to transmit at non-negligible rates while causing practically no harm to the primary communications, without requiring global CSI. Moreover, the proposed <b>cooperative</b> <b>secondary</b> network is shown, through numerical and analytical results, to perform considerably better in terms of achievable rate as well as in terms of protecting the primary communications than the non-cooperative secondary network proposed in[10].|$|R
30|$|Motivated by {{the great}} {{benefits}} acquired through cognitive radio and cooperative techniques, several works analyzed the performance of cooperative cognitive networks under spectrum sharing constraints, as for instance [18 – 29]. Nevertheless, a common characteristic of these works is that all proposed schemes operate under HD mode with exception of [29]. For instance, [18] assumes an underlaid <b>cooperative</b> <b>secondary</b> network in a multi-node primary network. The authors consider that the secondary user adjusts its transmit power according to maximal interference link; however, neglecting the direct link between secondary source and destination. In [19], the authors assume that the dual-hop <b>cooperative</b> <b>secondary</b> network suffers with the primary interference and draw a discussion on how it impacts on the secondary performance.|$|R
30|$|Further, in [20], the outage {{probability}} of a dual-hop cognitive relay network under general fading setting is analyzed. Thus, assuming two different strategies to determine the transmit power of the secondary network, the authors show that the diversity order {{is dominated by the}} minimum fading severity between the two hops of the secondary network. A similar setting was investigated in [21], where the authors account for the direct link at the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> network and show that the diversity order is solely dependent on the fading severity parameters of the secondary network. In [22], the authors ignore the direct link but include the interference of the primary network in their analysis of {{outage probability}} showing the impact on performance because of the interference from the primary network. The authors in [23] exploit the primary network retransmissions in order to increase performance of the underlaid network. The results show that cooperation at the underlaid layer considerably increases performance without harming the performance of the primary network.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} two networks, a primary network and a <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> communication network. In the secondary network, a source is assisted by cognitive relay nodes which {{allow it to}} coexist with the primary network. The secondary users must work under the noise floor of the primary network to achieve low interference for the primary network. Simultaneously, the secondary users {{should be able to}} complete their duty. Therefore, the cooperative system utilizes the incremental and selective decode-and-forward (ISDF) relaying protocols. In ISDF protocol, the relay sends signal in necessary situations. Thus, the ISDF cooperative scheme is considered for the secondary network {{in order to reduce the}} interference to the primary users. Under some constraints on the transmitting power from the source and relay nodes in the secondary network, they can operate below the noise level of the primary network. Under these constraints, we minimize the symbol error rate of the secondary network. It is seen that in the ISDF protocol the interference produced with the relay to the primary users is very low...|$|E
30|$|In [24], the {{performance}} of a multi-relay secondary network is evaluated revealing that the diversity gain is defined by the number of available relays. Correspondingly, in [25], outage probability and ergodic capacity are evaluated constrained by the interference of the primary network. The authors show that the interference can be combated with the inclusion of more relays at the secondary network. In [26], the authors evaluate the outage probability and power allocation for a cognitive network with multiple primary transmitters and primary receivers; the secondary network is composed of a cooperative network with multiple relays, and the direct link at the secondary network is also considered. The number of primary users has a very severe impact on {{the performance}} of the proposed scheme. In [27], the outage probability is evaluated for a cognitive scenario where a relay helps the transmissions of the primary users as well as the secondary users. The results show that the outage probability decreases in comparison to schemes without cooperation in both networks. In [28], the authors evaluate two spectrally efficient schemes for a <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> network with multiple (L) destinations, in which the best destination is selected. Such schemes consider incremental DF relaying protocol. The proposed schemes achieve full-diversity order, being equal to L+ 1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As {{enterprise}} systems, Grids, {{and other}} distributed applications scale up and become increasingly complex, their authorization infrastructures—based predominantly on the request-response paradigm—are facing challenges of fragility and poor scalability. We propose an approach where each application server recycles previously received authorizations and shares them with other application servers to mask authorization server failures and network delays. This paper presents {{the design of}} our <b>cooperative</b> <b>secondary</b> authorization recycling system and its evaluation using simulation and prototype implementation. The results demonstrate that our approach improves the availability and performance of authorization infrastructures. Specifically, by sharing authorizations, the cache hit rate—an indirect metric of availability—can reach 70 %, even when only 10 % of authorizations are cached. Depending on the deployment scenario, the average time for authorizing an application request can be reduced by up to a factor of two compared with systems that do not employ cooperation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a secrecy sum-rate {{maximization}} based matching algorithm between primary transmitters and <b>secondary</b> <b>cooperative</b> jammers {{in the presence}} of an eavesdropper. More explicitly, we consider an untrusted relay scenario, where the relay is a potential eavesdropper. We first show the achievable secrecy regions employing a friendly jammer in a cooperative scenario with employing an untrusted relay. Then, we provide results for the secrecy regions for two scenarios, where in the first case we consider no direct transmission between the source and the destination, while in the second case we include a source to destination direct link in our communication system. Furthermore, a friendly jammer helps to send a noise signal during {{the first phase of the}} cooperative transmission, for securing the information transmitted from the source. In our matching algorithm, the selected cooperative jammer or the secondary user, is rewarded with the spectrum allocation for a fraction of time slot from the source which is the primary user. The Conventional Distributed Algorithm (CDA) and the Pragmatic Distributed Algorithm (PDA), which were originally designed for maximising the user’s sum rate, are modified and adapted for maximizing the secrecy sum-rate for the primary user. Instead of assuming perfect modulation and/or perfect channel coding, we have also investigated our proposed schemes when practical channel coding and modulation schemes are invoked...|$|E
