40|$|The time {{sequence}} {{of changes in}} total and differential {{white blood cell counts}} in dogs subjected to hemorrhagic shock are described and are correlated with alterations in the ultrastructure of intravascular neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the lungs of the same dogs. Total circulating white blood cells fall to 20 % of control values and neutrophils fall to 10 % of control values in hemorrhagic shock; these values do not return to control levels after reinfusion of shed blood. Intravascular neutrophils in the lung are increased in number after hemorrhagic shock and exhibit alterations in ultrastructure which include loss of density in the cell <b>sap,</b> <b>loss</b> of density in granules and unusual apposition between the plasma membranes of netrophils and adjacent endothelial cells. The results are interpreted as suggesting that circulating neutrophils become “sticky” in hemorrhagic shock; that the lung exerts a sieving effect on these cells; that obstruction of alveolar capillaries by these cells may account for certain abnormalities in the alveolar microcirculation in shock; and that these results may explain the observation that the isolated lung is protected from the deleterious effects of hemorrhagic shock...|$|R

Methods A total of 35 eyes with permanent temporal VF defects and 35 controls underwent SAP and FD-OCT (3 D OCT- 1000; Topcon Corp.) examinations. Macular thickness measurements were averaged for the central area and for each quadrant and half of that area, whereas RNFL thickness was determined for six sectors around the optic disc. VF loss was estimated in six sectors of the VF and in the central 16 test points in the VF. The correlation between VF loss and OCT measurements was tested with Spearman`s correlation coefficients and with linear regression analysis. Results Macular and RNFL thickness parameters correlated strongly with <b>SAP</b> VF <b>loss.</b> Correlations were generally stronger between VF loss and quadrantic or hemianopic macular thickness than with sectoral RNFL thickness.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} longitudinal frequency doubling technology (FDT) to predict the development of glaucomatous visual field loss on standard automated perimetry (SAP) in glaucoma suspects. Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Participants: the study included 587 eyes of 367 patients with suspected glaucoma at baseline selected from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS) and the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study (ADAGES). These eyes {{had an average of}} 6. 7 +/- 1. 9 FDT tests during a mean follow-up time of 73. 1 +/- 28. 0 months. Methods: Glaucoma suspects had intraocular pressure (IOP) > 21 mmHg or an optic disc appearance suspicious of glaucoma. All patients had normal or nonrepeatable abnormal SAP at baseline. Humphrey Matrix FDT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, CA) testing was performed within 6 months of SAP testing. the study end point was the development of 3 consecutive abnormal SAP test results. Joint longitudinal survival models were used to {{evaluate the}} ability of rates of FDT pattern standard deviation (PSD) change to predict the development of visual field <b>loss</b> on <b>SAP,</b> adjusting for confounding variables (baseline age, mean IOP, corneal thickness, and follow-up measurements of SAP PSD). Main Outcome Measures: the R- 2 index was used to evaluate and compare the predictive abilities of the model containing longitudinal FDT PSD data with the model containing only baseline data. Results: Sixty-three of 587 eyes (11 %) developed <b>SAP</b> visual field <b>loss</b> during follow-up. the mean rate of FDT PSD change in eyes that developed <b>SAP</b> visual field <b>loss</b> was 0. 07 dB/year versus 0. 02 dB/year in those that did not (P < 0. 001). Baseline FDT PSD and slopes of FDT PSD change were significantly predictive of progression, with hazard ratios of 1. 11 per 0. 1 dB higher (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 04 - 1. 18; P 0. 002) and 4. 40 per 0. 1 dB/year faster (95 % CI, 1. 08 - 17. 96; P 0. 04), respectively. the longitudinal model performed significantly better than the baseline model with an R- 2 of 82 % (95 % CI, 74 e 89) versus 11 % (95 % CI, 2 - 24), respectively. Conclusions: Rates of FDT PSD change were highly predictive of the development of <b>SAP</b> visual field <b>loss</b> in glaucoma suspects. This finding suggests that longitudinal FDT evaluation may be useful for risk stratification of patients with suspected glaucoma. (C) 2014 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

40|$|Vrsta štitastog moljca Aleurocanthus spiniferus Quaintance, 1903 (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) podrijetlom je iz jugoistočne Azije, otkuda se proširila u tropska i suptropska područja Azije, u Afriku te u područje Pacifika. Polifagan je štetnik kojemu su najvažniji domaćini biljke iz rodova Citrus, Pyres i Vitis. Štete na biljkama čine ličinke i odrasli razvojni stadiji štetnika sisanjem biljnih sokova na naličju listova te izlučivanjem obilne medne rose, na koju se sekundarno naseljavaju gljivice čađavice. Ta je karantenska vrsta u Europi prvi put nađena 2008. godine u nasadima agruma na jugu Italije, u provinciji Lecce (Porcelli, 2008). Nakon prvog nalaza u Italiji, vrsta je prebačena s EPPO A 1 na EPPO A 2 listu, a u Hrvatsko je sukladno EU direktivi 2000 / 29 /EC, taj štetnik svrstan na Popis II Dio A Odjeljak I Pravilnika o mjerama za sprječavanje unošenja i širenja organizama štetnih za bilje, biljne proizvode i druge nadzirane predmete i mjerama suzbijanja tih organizama (NN 74 / 06). U Hrvatskoj, vrsta A. spiniferus nađena je prvi put 30. svibnja 2012. na ukrasnim sadnicama naranče (Citrus aurantium L.) iz vlastitog uzgoja, u jednom vrtnom centre u Splitu (42 ° 302 ̆ 7292 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 N, 16 ° 262 ̆ 740 "E; UTM 33 T XJ 1919). Orange spiny whitefly, Aleurocanthus spiniferus Quaintance, 1903 {{originated}} in south-east Asia and has spread widely in tropical and subtropical Asia, and into Africa and the Pacific. Citrus spp. {{are the main}} hosts of economic importance, but A. spiniferus has been recorded from woody hosts of 13 plant families. This species is listed as a quarantine threat to Europe and {{is included in the}} EU Annex IUA 1 and in the EPPO A 2 list. In Europe, it was reported {{for the first time in}} Italy, in 2008. In May 2012, A. spiniferus was first found in Croatia, on ornamental potted orange seedlings (Citrus x aurantium L) from domestic production in one nursery garden in Split. Infested orange plants have locally numerous small, brownish to black scales with a short fringe of white wax on the underside of leaves. The identification of the whitefly species was carried out by the Institute 2 ̆ 7 s Laboratory for Zoology and the result was confirmed in Plant Protection Service, Wageningen, The Netherlands. The origin of the infestation of this alien species is still unknown, but it is assumed that the infection originated from imported plant material from Italy. A. spiniferus causes general weakening of seriously infested plants due to <b>sap</b> <b>loss</b> and the growth of sooty mould. Dense colonies of whitefly immature stages develop on leaf undersides, whereas the adults fly actively when disturbed. Leaves and citrus fruits have spots of sticky, transparent honeydew, which become covered in black sooty mould fungus. A heavy infestation gives trees an almost completely black appearance. The potential host range of A. spiniferus in the EPPO region would be essentially citrus, with some possibility of establishment on other woody plantation crops growing in the southern part of the region in climatic conditions suitable for the pest. It presents a potential permanent risk to citrus in Croatia, especially to production of mandarin in Neretva river valley. For now, A. spiniferus has status of eradicated species in Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Patients with X-linked {{lymphoproliferative}} syndrome (XLP) experience excessive T {{cell proliferation}} after primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, due to mutations in the signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (SAP) molecule. We examined {{the impact of}} dysfunctional proliferative control {{on the extent of}} CD 8 + T cell differentiation in XLP patients who recovered from primary EBV infection. Although these young patients have normal numbers of lytic and latent EBV-epitope-specific CD 8 + T cells, they were extremely differentiated as defined by loss of CCR 7 and CD 27, low telomerase activity and very short telomeres. This was not a direct effect arising from the <b>loss</b> of <b>SAP,</b> but was due to excessive T cell stimulation due to this defect. Thus, transduction of XLP CD 8 + T cells with the catalytic component of telomerase (hTERT), but not <b>SAP,</b> prevented telomere <b>loss</b> and considerably extended proliferative lifespan in vitro. These results indicate that excessive proliferation in CD 8 + T cells in XLP patients may lead to end-stage differentiation and loss of functional EBV-specific CD 8 + T cells through replicative senescence. This may contribute to the defective immunity found in XLP patients who survive acute EBV infection who develop EBV-related B cell lymphomas before the fourth decade of life...|$|R
40|$|Most {{previous}} {{investigations of}} the weaver ant genus (Oecophylla) have been conducted in the relatively non-seasonal environment of the wet tropics (e. g. Greenslade, 1971 a,b, 1972; Ledoux, 1950, 1954; Majer, 1976,a,b,c; Vanderplank, 1960; Way, 1954 a,b). The present study documented substantial seasonal variation in colony structure and functioning of green tree ant (0. smaragdina) populations in the seasonally dry tropical climate which characterizes most of northern Australia. The distribution of 0. smaragdina within Australia was successfully defined {{by a combination of}} mean annual rainfall and average minimum temperature, with a curvilinear demarcation between sites with and without ants. Development and survival of ant brood was markedly reduced by low temperatures, especially the larval stage, which had a threshold temperature (when development theoretically stops) of about 17 °C. In contrast, the thresholds for eggs and pupae were about 10 °C and 7 °C, respectively. At higher temperatures, the 2 physical variables probably indirectly limit ant distribution by controlling plant density; ants only inhabited sites with woodland or forest vegetation. Colony extents (the numbers of trees occupied by colonies) were much larger in native vegetation than in a nearby mango plantation. This difference was probably due to the greater tree density in the native forest site. No canopy interconnections were available in the mango orchard to promote movements of ants between trees. Inter-tree migration is essential for weaver ant colonies, to disseminate brood from the nest containing the colony's single egg-producing queen and possibly also to maintain a uniform colony recognition scent. Levels of reproduction in green tree ant colonies were highest during the wet season and early dry season. Sexual forms were present in nests from November until March, and worker brood were most abundant from January until May. Larval and pupal brood levels rose with increasing precipitation up to monthly rainfall figures around 300 mm. Proportions of worker pupae were reduced during periods of higher rainfall, probably due to the production of sexuals at this time. Colony extents, measured as the number of trees occupied, were smallest in native forest {{at the end of the}} dry season in November, and rose while colonies were reproducing. Most colonies reached peak extents in May, when the proportion of flowering trees was highest (and 2 months after the greatest levels of leaf flushing). After May, brood production generally decreased markedly, and colony extents in native vegetation slowly fell, with ants gradually evacuating from peripheral trees into smaller core areas of high tree density. Cycles of colony extent in the mango plantation lagged behind those in native vegetation by 2 to 4 months; maximum extents coincided with mango tree flowering from July, to September. Tended homopteran levels in mango tree leaf samples were high during the flowering and fruiting period, suggesting that colony expansion may be facilitated by the increased availability of honeydew. As colonies expanded, individual nests became smaller and the number of nests (per tree and per colony) increased. Ant distributions were thus dispersed more evenly throughout colonies during this period. This decentralization may improve foraging efficiencies, or may allow increased patrolling of territories when intrusions by other ant colonies (both intra and inter-specific) are most likely. Highest levels of prey intake and ant movement from nests did coincide with periods of greatest reproduction and dispersion; however, the causal relations between these factors are unknown. An electronic light beam counter was developed to monitor ant activity (measured as the number of ants leaving and returning from a nest, and standardized between different nests by dividing by the total population of each nest) in native forest over a two year period. Net daily activity was greatest during the wet season months from December to March, and lowest in the dry winter period. The magnitude of these seasonal differences was remarkably high; the largest mean activity of 8. 83 ants/nest individual/day (in December) was over 10 times the smallest level of 0. 501 (in August). Seasonal patterns of activity correlated well with patterns of total prey weight collected by ants. Liquid food intake, measured as the average weight difference of leaving and returning ants, showed a similar, but very erratic pattern; factors such as varying forager sizes, honeydew intake inside the nest, and differing physiological conditions of inhabited trees prevented successful quantification of this food source. A consistent circadian pattern of ant activity was observed in autumn and winter (March, May, August) : activity peaked around dusk, and dropped to a minimum in the early morning before dawn. This circadian pattern was less distinct or completely absent during the spring and summer months (October, December, January). Activity was generally correlated with temperature; the fitted parabolic relationship suggested that activity was markedly reduced by low temperatures, but was less affected by higher temperatures. Circadian patterns of activity did not correlate to patterns of food intake. Most prey was collected during the daylight hours, suggesting that 0. smaragdina is primarily a visual predator. Honeydew intake also appeared to be greatest after dawn. Nocturnally active ants may be involved in other tasks, such as brood and young adult transport, colony scent dispersal, and territorial patrolling/guarding. Mango trees with green tree ant populations had more tended homopterans and fewer numbers of most other arthropod groups than adjacent trees without ants. The proportions of leaves with chlorotic scars from homopterans (primarily Phenacaspis dilata) were greater in ant-occupied trees. The fractions of leaves with holes from chewing arthropods, and the average area of leaf missing were greater in ant-free trees. Crop yields during the study were relatively low. However, ants appeared to augment fruit loss in trees with largest crops during the late stages of fruit development, probably by encouraging homopteran populations and so increasing <b>sap</b> <b>loss.</b> Green tree ants also appeared to reduce frugivory by fruit bats, the major predator of mango fruit...|$|R
