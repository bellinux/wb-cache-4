The Supreme Court continued along this path in the <b>Slaughter-House</b> Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870.|$|E
5|$|On-farm {{factories}} in the Deloraine area made cheese, mostly cheddar, during the early 20th century. Cheese {{was made in the}} Meander area from at least 1908 when a factory opened on the Cheshunt estate. The last of the area's factories closed prior to World War II. Meander had a resident blacksmith from c.1876, though blacksmithing had been done on private properties before this. Blacksmithing as a separate industry continued into the early 20th century. Prompted by new legislation in the 1980s, that enforced hygiene standards in animal slaughtering, a <b>slaughter-house</b> was opened in Meander. It was registered in 1986. Before this butchering was a more informal or back-yard industry.|$|E

25|$|Following the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment's {{due process}} clause {{prompted}} substantive due process interpretations to be urged on the Supreme Court as a limitation on state legislation.

25|$|The <b>Slaughter-House</b> Cases, , was {{the first}} United States Supreme Court {{interpretation}} of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment which had recently been enacted. It was a pivotal case in early civil rights law and held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the privileges or immunities of citizenship of the United States, not privileges and immunities of citizenship of a state. However, federal rights of citizenship were then few, such {{as the right to}} travel between states and to use navigable rivers; the amendment did not protect the far broader range of rights covered by state citizenship. In effect, the amendment was interpreted to convey limited protection pertinent to a small minority of rights.|$|E
25|$|United States v. Wheeler did {{not have}} a direct major impact on American {{constitutional}} law. The case was only one of a long line of decisions which extended {{as far back as the}} circuit court ruling in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed.

Harris (1883). All the decisions rejected federal protection of important constitutional rights. Still, although Wheeler stood firmly in the middle of an established stream of constitutional law, the Supreme Court itself began rejecting the rationales contained in Wheeler a few years later.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{decision}} also has attracted defenders by libertarians: the Cato Institute and the scholars Richard Epstein and Randy Barnett, {{who argue that}} Lochner was correct in its protection of economic liberty. Randy Barnett has argued that Lochners presumption in favor of liberty of contract was basically right; {{the decision}} was wrong only in that it perpetuated the misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that {{was established in the}} <b>Slaughter-House</b> Cases. According to Barnett, liberty of contract is properly found in the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. David Bernstein, in Rehabilitating Lochner: Defending Individual Rights Against Progressive Reform, argues that the decision in Lochner was well grounded in Supreme Court precedent and that the decision's emphasis on limits to the states' police powers informed the Court's early civil liberties and civil rights cases.|$|E

25|$|In the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore, the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} the Bill of Rights {{did not apply to}} state governments; such protections were instead {{provided}} by the constitutions of each state. After the Civil War, Congress and the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which included the Due Process Clause and the Privileges or Immunities Clause. While the Fifth Amendment had included a due process clause, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment crucially differed from the Fifth Amendment in that it explicitly applied to the states. The Privileges or Immunities Clause also explicitly applied to the states, unlike the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the Constitution. In the <b>Slaughter-House</b> Cases (1873), the Supreme Court ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was not designed to protected individuals from the actions of state governments. In Twining v. New Jersey (1908), the Supreme Court acknowledged that the Due Process Clause might incorporate some of the Bill of Rights, but continued to reject any incorporation under the Privileges or Immunities Clause.|$|E

500|$|Butchers' Union Co. {{was a case}} {{involving}} interpretation of the Louisiana Constitution and certain ordinances {{of the city of}} New Orleans.

500|$|The Privileges or Immunities Clause, {{which protects}} the {{privileges}} and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which protects the {{privileges and immunities}} of state citizenship from interference by other states. In the <b>Slaughter-House</b> Cases (1873), the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—"national citizenship" [...] and [...] "state citizenship"—and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship. The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that [...] "owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws." [...] The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, {{the protection of the}} federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration.

Largely {{as a result of the}} narrowness of the <b>Slaughter-House</b> opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century.|$|E
500|$|After the Klan's decline, a {{faction of}} {{southern}} conservatives called [...] "Redeemers" [...] formed armed groups, {{such as the}} Red Shirts and the White League who openly used violence and intimidation {{in an attempt to}} take control of state governments. The Panic of 1873 and the ensuing depression contributed to public fatigue, and the North grew less concerned with Reconstruction. Supreme Court rulings in the <b>Slaughter-House</b> Cases and United States v. Cruikshank restricted federal enforcement of civil rights. Grant began to limit the use of troops to avoid the impression that he was acting as a military dictator. In 1874, Grant ended the Brooks–Baxter War bringing Reconstruction in Arkansas to a peaceful conclusion; that same year, he sent troops and warships under Major General William H. Emory to New Orleans {{in the wake of the}} Colfax Massacre and disputes over the election of Governor William Pitt Kellogg.

40|$|Meat is {{staple food}} since {{thousands}} of years ago. Ancient civilisations had introduced systems for slaught-ering and inspection of meat and organs of animals intended for human consumption. The experience gained over centuries was subsequently incorporated into religious rules, which either prohibited consumption of certain types of meat or required specific treatment of meat. Parts of historic experience, incorporated in religious rules and supported by scientific knowledge, were later included in legal regulations covering protec-tion of health of meat consumers. Nowadays such protection includes inspection of meat and organs at slaughterhouse stipulated by legal regulations. The re-sults of the inspection of slaughter animals and meat at slaughterhouse {{are considered to be}} an indicator of health of food animals on farm level and at <b>slaughter-houses.</b> Animal health is the parameter which is most important for the classification of meat and organs of food animals with regard to their capability to serve for human consumption. Fries (1994) emphasises the importance of inspection results arising from the in-spection of slaughter animals and meat at <b>slaughter-houses</b> for animal health control system. It has to be noted, however, that this system does not cover the cases of death of animals during the period of fattening. Many authors have studied animal health on the basis of findings from slaughterhouses within the frame-work of veterinary inspection of slaughter animals and meat. Kofer et al.
