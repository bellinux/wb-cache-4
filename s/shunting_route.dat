40|$|NoThis work {{explored}} {{the role of}} skin appendages (<b>shunt</b> <b>route)</b> in passive and iontophoretic drug and liposome penetration. The technique used an epidermis and stratum corneum sandwich from the same skin donor with the additional stratum corneum forming {{the top layer of}} the sandwich. Penetration was monitored during occluded passive and iontophoretic (0. 5 mA cm- 2) delivery of mannitol and estradiol solutions, and ultradeformable liposomes containing estradiol. The <b>shunt</b> <b>route</b> had a significant role during passive penetration of mannitol (hydrophilic compound), but was negligible during penetration of estradiol (lipophilic drug) and liposomes. In iontophoresis, the <b>shunt</b> <b>route</b> significantly contributed to the overall flux of all preparations, being highest for mannitol. However, shunts were not the only pathway for iontophoretic drug delivery and evidence was observed for the creation of new aqueous pathways via disorganization of the intercellular lipid domain of stratum corneum. The skin sandwich technique should prove valuable for general studies on routes of skin penetration...|$|R

Visually, it resembles the British Rail Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC), though most of the simulations do not cover areas operated by IECC-based signal boxes.

50|$|Train {{motion is}} {{simulated}} according to train type and loading, and is controlled via {{the use of}} timetables. With a keyboard and mouse, the player sets routes and operates level crossings as necessary as well as simulations/timetable specific tasks such as operating ground frames. Solid State Interlockings (SSIs), the main electronic technology in use at present on British railways, along with approach locking, swinging overlaps, <b>shunt</b> <b>routes,</b> warner routes and call-on routes are all available. The simulations may be played in real time or sped up. The aim of play is to achieve a good score by overcoming problems and ensuring on-time train running. Points are accumulated for good operation and deducted for errors or late running.|$|R

40|$|The {{shunting}} {{schedule of}} electric multiple units depot (SSED) {{is one of}} the essential plans for high-speed train maintenance activities. This paper presents a 0 - 1 programming model {{to address the problem of}} determining an optimal SSED through automatic computing. The objective of the model is to minimize the number of shunting movements and the constraints include track occupation conflicts, <b>shunting</b> <b>routes</b> conflicts, time durations of maintenance processes, and shunting running time. An enhanced particle swarm optimization (EPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, an empirical study from Shanghai South EMU Depot is carried out to illustrate the model and EPSO algorithm. The optimization results indicate that the proposed method is valid for the SSED problem and that the EPSO algorithm outperforms the traditional PSO algorithm on the aspect of optimality...|$|R
50|$|The {{revision}} of a shunt means to replace or make adjustments to {{all or part}} of the shunt, this also means that the location of the shunt may be changed therefore changing the category or type of shunt a patient has. For some patients with shunts, a revision or multiple revisions to the shunt may be required. This can be something minor, such as adjusting the setting on a valve to change the flow level through the valve to replacing a substantial length of the shunt, or even replacing the entire shunt or relocating the <b>shunt</b> <b>route</b> to a different part of the body. For example, it may be required for a patient with a lumbar-peritoneal shunt, if multiple revisions are required or overdrainage is occurring, to have it replaced with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VP shunt).|$|R
50|$|Mixed trains {{were more}} {{prolific}} in the South Island {{as it had}} the majority of New Zealand's rural branch lines, but as private car ownership increased, passenger figures decreased and many rural trains ceased to cater for passengers in the 1930s, although some mixed services lasted into the 1960s in isolated regions with poor roads. In the North Island, the last mixed trains operated into the 1970s, such as the service provided on the North Auckland Line that ran until 1976. Mixed trains in a sense returned to the South Island {{for a few years}} in the 1990s, when a few wagons of express containerised freight were attached to the TranzCoastal express that operates between Christchurch and Picton. However, this was much unlike the mixed trains of previous decades that performed lots of <b>shunting</b> en <b>route</b> and operated slowly; the TranzCoastal did not perform shunting as it was expected to maintain its passenger timetable and convey its time-sensitive freight swiftly between Picton's port and Christchurch.|$|R
40|$|Al-BSF {{solar cells}} with a laser doped {{selective}} emitter and plated Ni-Cu contacts are an attractive approach for industrial fabrication. Yet the contact adhesion of the plated Ni-Cu contacts due to diffusion barriers in the contact area and electrical stability against tempering induced non-ohmic Ni shunts {{are two main}} challenges for this cell concept. This work presents failure mechanisms of laser doped solar cells. Microscopic characterization analyzes process induced defects separately, which result in poor contact adhesion and non-ohmic <b>shunting.</b> A process <b>route</b> is presented, which yields in solar cells with pseudo fill factors above 80 % and a sufficient contact adhesion of 1 N/mm...|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} made up {{the largest}} tank locomotive class on the Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est and maintained the suburban service for Eastern Paris until the electrification of the Paris - Strasbourg line in 1962, being allocated to Noisy, Paris-La Villette and Vaires sheds. After that date they replaced the 2-6-2T locos of class 1-131 TB on the Vincennes line. They maintained that service until the eve of integration of the line with RER line A on 14 December 1969. Many of these locomotives were transferred to provincial sheds for varied work and yard <b>shunting</b> on minor <b>routes</b> where their small axle loading of 16 t was an advantage.|$|R
40|$|The γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) <b>shunt,</b> an {{alternative}} <b>route</b> for {{the conversion of}} α-ketoglutarate to succinate, involves the glutamate decarboxylase Gad 1 p, the GABA transaminase Uga 1 p and the succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase Uga 2 p. This pathway has been extensively described in plants and animals, but its function in yeast remains unclear. We show that the flux through Gad 1 p is insignificant during fermentation in rich sugar-containing medium, excluding a role for this pathway in redox homeostasis under anaerobic conditions or sugar stress. However, we found that up to 4 g of exogenous GABA/liter was efficiently consumed by yeast. We studied the fate of this consumed GABA. Most was converted into succinate, with a reaction yield of 0. 7 mol/mol. We also showed that {{a large proportion of}} GABA was stored within cells, indicating a possible role for this molecule in stress tolerance mechanisms or nitrogen storage. Furthermore, based on enzymatic and metabolic evidence, we identified {{an alternative}} route for GABA catabolism, involving the reduction of succinate-semialdehyde into γ-hydroxybutyric acid and the polymerization of γ-hydroxybutyric acid to form poly-(3 -hydroxybutyric acid-co- 4 -hydroxybutyric acid). This study provides the first demonstration of a native route for the formation of this polymer in yeast. Our findings shed new light on the GABA pathway and open up new opportunities for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: Although {{the results}} of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study clearly {{demonstrated}} the benefit of surgical over medical management of severe carotid artery stenosis, the results for women in particular were less certain. This was to some extent because of the higher perioperative complication rate observed in the 281 women (3. 6 % vs 1. 7 % in men). The objective {{of this study was to}} review a large experience with carotid endarterectomy in female patients and to determine whether the perioperative results differed from those of male patients. Methods: A review was conducted of a prospectively compiled database on all carotid endarterectomies performed between 1982 and 1997. Operations performed in 991 female patients were compared with those performed in 1485 male patients. Results: Female patients had a significantly lower incidence of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and contralateral carotid artery occlusion than did male patients. Female patients had a significantly higher incidence of hypertension. There were no significant differences in the age, smoking history, anesthetic <b>route,</b> <b>shunt</b> use, or clamp tolerance between the two groups. Of 991 female patients, 659 (66. 5 %) had preoperative symptoms, whereas 332 (33. 5 %) cases were performed for asymptomatic stenosis. Among 1485 male patients, 1041 (70. 1 %) had symptoms, and 444 (29. 9 %) were symptom free before surgery. There were no significant differences noted in the perioperative stroke rates between men and women overall (2. 3 % vs 2. 4 %, P =. 92), or when divided into symptomatic (2. 5 % vs 3. 0 %, P =. 52) and asymptomatic (2. 0 % vs 1. 2 %, P =. 55) cases. Conclusions: Carotid endarterectomy can be performed with equally low perioperative stroke rates in men and women in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. In this series, symptom-free female patients had the lowest overall stroke rate. The concerns of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study regarding the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in female patients should therefore not prevent clinicians from recommending and performing carotid endarterectomy in appropriately selected symptom-free female patients.
