5|$|The aphelion, or {{farthest}} {{point from}} the <b>Sun,</b> <b>would</b> {{be in the}} general direction of the constellation of Taurus, whereas the perihelion, the nearest point to the <b>Sun,</b> <b>would</b> be {{in the general direction}} of the southerly areas of Serpens (Caput), Ophiuchus, and Libra.|$|E
5|$|From Epsilon Eridani, the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> {{appear as}} a 2.4-magnitude star in Serpens.|$|E
5|$|It can be {{seen with}} the unaided eye as a third-magnitude star. As seen from Tau Ceti, the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> be a third-magnitude star in the {{northern}} hemisphere constellation Boötes..|$|E
50|$|July 23, 2015: News gets leaked {{that the}} <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> reveal a new black {{alternative}} jersey for road matches only. Further information also {{reveals that the}} <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> have a flexible, updated silhouette of a different alternative jersey as well.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> {{get three}} {{straight}} games where they won by 14 or more points from November 12-16. It {{would be the}} first time the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> win three straight games by such a wide margin of victory since the 2009-10 Phoenix Suns season.|$|R
50|$|The Suns’ {{best overall}} record in {{franchise}} history {{and a return to}} the Carolina League Championship Series came in 1986. However, the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> lose the league championship to the Winston-Salem Spirits. The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> also make the playoffs in 1987, only to be eliminated in the first round by the eventual league champion Salem Buccaneers.|$|R
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars with a planet, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} several {{observations}} in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel. From Epsilon Eridani, the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in Serpens.|$|E
50|$|February 22, 2016: The Phoenix <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> officially waive DeJuan Blair {{from their}} roster.|$|R
25|$|The newly named Gold Coast <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> only taste victory {{one more}} time after the Rise Up! function. The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> finish the 2010 VFL season {{with a record of}} 5-12-1 which would place them 10th on the ladder, two spots outside of the finals. Rookie listed player Sam Iles was honoured with the club's best and fairest award for 2010.|$|R
50|$|March 3, 2015: The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> sign center Earl Barron to {{a second}} 10-day contract.|$|R
5|$|If the Sun–Neptune {{distance}} is scaled to 100 metres, then the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> be about 3cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds {{the diameter of}} a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3mm, and Earth's diameter along {{with that of the}} other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3mm) at this scale.|$|E
5|$|SIM Lite {{would have}} {{operated}} in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, drifting away from Earth {{at the rate}} of 0.1 AU per year ultimately reaching a distance of 82million km from Earth. This would have taken approximately years. The <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> have continuously shone on the spacecraft, allowing it to avoid the occultations of target stars and eclipses of the Sun that would occur in an Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the <b>Sun,</b> <b>would</b> be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
50|$|March 13, 2015: The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> sign center Earl Barron for {{the rest}} of the season.|$|R
50|$|April 1, 2015: The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> sign guard Bakersfield Jam {{affiliate}} guard Jerel McNeal to a 10-day contract.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> {{allow the}} Cleveland Cavaliers only 6 {{points in the}} entire third quarter on January 26, 2014. This ties a record that the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> hold a team down a career-low in points during a non-overtime period (with the first two times {{occurring}} in February 28, 1999 against the Golden State Warriors and February 21, 2002 against the Memphis Grizzlies, both of which would occur in the fourth quarter).|$|R
5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{is that this is}} due to a change of ideology. The advent of the 5th dynasty marks the growing importance of the cult of the sun as hinted by the Westcar Papyrus. This is also directly evidenced by the large sun temples built at Abusir throughout the dynasty, a tradition initiated by Userkaf. Finally, the Abusir Papyri demonstrate the strong connection between the cult of the sun and the mortuary cult of the pharaohs of this dynasty: offerings for a deceased ruler were first consecrated in a sun temple before being dispatched to his mortuary temple. Thus, Userkaf located his mortuary temple to the south of the main pyramid so that the <b>sun</b> <b>would</b> shine directly into it all year round.|$|E
5|$|The {{practicality}} of {{this approach}} is questionable with modern material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> have an overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E
5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
5000|$|Phoenix Suns (1976 NBA Finals) - Despite {{entering}} the playoffs {{with only a}} 42-40 record, the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> upset the defending champion Golden State Warriors to enter the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. Despite giving the Celtics a triple-overtime thriller in Game 5, the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> lose to the eventual champion Celtics 4 games to 2.

50|$|April 11, 2016: It was {{announced}} that the Phoenix <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> take full control over their D-League affiliate team, the Bakersfield Jam, and move them into the Prescott Valley Event Center in Prescott Valley, Arizona as the Northern Arizona Suns, starting right after this current season ended. The Phoenix <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> now be one of 19 NBA teams (as of this season) to have complete control over a single D-League affiliate team.|$|R
5|$|It is {{not known}} when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used {{for a variety of}} {{purposes}} by the Aztecs, whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image {{at the center of the}} myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the <b>sun</b> <b>would</b> keep moving.|$|E
5|$|People {{in eastern}} and {{southern}} Serbia believed that ale, in their voracity, attacked the Sun and the Moon. They gradually ate {{more and more of}} those celestial bodies, thereby causing an eclipse. During an eclipse, the Sun turned red because it was covered with its own blood {{as a result of the}} ale’s bites; when it shone brightly again, that meant it had defeated the ale. The spots on the Moon were seen as scars from the ale’s bites. While ale devoured the Sun or the Moon, many elderly people became depressed and even wept in fear. If ale succeeded in devouring the Sun, the world would end. To prevent that, men shot their guns toward the eclipse or rang bells, and women cast spells incessantly. There was a notion in the Homolje region that, if ale succeeded in devouring the Moon, the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> die from sorrow, and darkness would overwhelm the world.|$|E
5|$|From September 1610, Galileo {{observed}} that Venus exhibited {{a full set}} of phases {{similar to that of the}} Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.|$|E

50|$|February 21, 2014: The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> {{get their}} 33rd {{victory against the}} San Antonio Spurs in a blowout 106-85 game. This ties the Suns' win total from the lockout {{shortened}} 2011-12 NBA season, which was also the last season the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> have Steve Nash playing for the team. They'd also get their first official sold-out game at home since around 2012 in the process, as well as beat the San Antonio Spurs by over 20 points {{for the first time}} since 1999.|$|R
5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the <b>Sun</b> <b>would</b> be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E

50|$|In the playoffs, the Warriors {{returned}} to the Western Conference Finals by beating the Detroit Pistons in 6 games. In the Western Finals, the Warriors faced the Phoenix Suns. The Warriors had a 2 games to 1 lead. Game 4 went in overtime and the Warriors were unable to grab a 3-1 series lead. The <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> rally {{to win the game}} 133-129. The Warriors would bounce back to take Game 5, but the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> win Games 6 & 7 to stun the defending Champions.|$|R
50|$|Their 42nd victory {{they got}} against the Atlanta Hawks {{a day later}} also {{guaranteed}} that the <b>Suns</b> <b>would</b> have their first winning season since the 2009-10 NBA season.|$|R
