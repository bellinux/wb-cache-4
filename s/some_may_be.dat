5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed. They are {{primarily}} distinguished by {{the height of}} mature plants {{and the depth of}} the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides. In that context, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> referred to by the hybrid name P. ×hybrida.|$|E

5|$|On 11 July 2012, {{the show}} {{producer}} Christer Björkman advised the public {{not to buy}} tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait for tickets to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|The TWHNC {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of classes in both in-hand and performance, including divisions for youth, amateurs, and professionals. Horses may be shod with keg shoes or performance stacks; flat-shod classes are particularly popular among amateur owners who train their own horses. Leadline classes, for children under six, are a crowd favorite. All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> registered with the Spotted Saddle Horse and Racking Horse associations as well. Double registration does not affect a horse's ability to enter the Celebration.|$|E

5|$|The first upper molar (M1) was {{described}} as square by De Bruijn and as rounded by Prieto and Böhme. There are five main transverse crests, which are mostly isolated, but <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> connected on {{the borders of the}} teeth. The middle crest, the centroloph, reaches to the labial (outer) margin in the single known M1 of S.bolligeri, but does not in any of the five M1 of S.alpinus. The front crest, the anteroloph, is less distinct in S.bolligeri than most S.alpinus, but one M1 of S.alpinus {{is similar to that of}} S.bolligeri. M1 has three roots in S.alpinus, but the number of roots in S.bolligeri is not known.|$|E
5|$|The storm's {{flooding}} causes major {{damage to}} the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline, and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> debarked, isolating most affected communities. Massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas. Total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected, possibly for up to several months.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{primarily}} fruit eaters, but also consume insects during the breeding season. Mosquitoes and midges {{are the most}} common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season. Rowan berries are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} about possible successor shows, in May 2017 HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth writer {{yet to be}} announced – to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All of the writers are to be working individually with George R. R. Martin. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion are prequels, and <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> set outside Westeros. He also ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff {{said that they would}} not be involved with any of the projects, and want to enjoy the successor series as fans. Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts. In September 2017, it was announced that Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman would be developing a fifth prequel series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that all the {{specimens}} belong to the same species, A. lithographica. Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as Archaeornis siemensii, the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva, the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica, and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis.|$|E
5|$|When {{grown in}} {{favorable}} conditions of high water availability and humidity, the fruit body can proliferate by growing additional (secondary) fruit bodies on {{all parts of}} its upper and lower surfaces. These secondary growths typically number between four and seven; <b>some</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> aborted as the nutrients from the pine cone substrate are depleted, resulting in stems lacking caps. In one instance, a complete secondary proliferation was noted (i.e., growing from a primary proliferation) that developed completely so as to produce viable spores. Humidity is a limiting factor for optimum fruit body development. Removal of incompletely mature laboratory-grown specimens from a relative humidity (R.H.) of over 98% to one of 65–75% causes the fruit bodies to brown and stop growing. When transferred to an even lower R.H. of about 50%, the stems quickly begin to collapse. Light also affects fruit body development: both continuous illumination and complete darkness inhibit growth.|$|E
