25|$|Alternative {{splicing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important components that show functional complexity of genome. Modified splicing has significant effect on the phenotype that is relevance to disease or drug metabolism. A change in splicing can be caused by modifying any of the components of the splicing machinery such as splice sites or splice enhancers or silencers. Modification in the alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> can lead to a different protein form which will show a different function. Humans use an estimated 100,000 different proteins or more, so some genes must be capable of coding for a lot more than just one protein. Alternative splicing occurs more frequently than was previously thought and can be hard to control; genes may produce tens of thousands of different transcripts, necessitating a new gene model for each alternative splice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Alternative {{splicing}} increases protein diversity by generating multiple transcript isoforms from {{a single}} gene through different combinations of exons or through different selections of <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> It {{has been reported that}} RNA secondary structures are involved in alternative splicing. Here we perform a genomic study of RNA secondary structures around <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> in humans (Homo sapiens), mice (Mus musculus), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) to further investigate this phenomenon. Results We observe that GC content around <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> is closely associated with the <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> usage in multiple species. RNA secondary structure is the possible explanation, because the structural stability difference among alternative <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> constitutive <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> and skipped <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> {{can be explained by the}} GC content difference. Alternative <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> tend to be GC-enriched and exhibit more stable RNA secondary structures in all of the considered species. In humans and mice, <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> of first exons and long exons tend to be GC-enriched and hence form more stable structures, indicating the special role of RNA secondary structures in promoter proximal splicing events and the splicing of long exons. In addition, GC-enriched exon-intron junctions tend to be overrepresented in tissue-specific alternative <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> indicating the functional consequence of the GC effect. Compared with regions far from <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and decoy <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> real <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> are GC-enriched. We also found that the GC-content effect is much stronger than the nucleotide-order effect to form stable secondary structures. Conclusion All of these results indicate that GC content is related to <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> usage and it may mediate the splicing process through RNA secondary structures. </p...|$|R

50|$|Point {{mutations}} {{that occur}} in non-coding sequences are most often without consequences, although there are exceptions. If the mutated base pair is in the promoter sequence of a gene, then {{the expression of the}} gene may change.

50|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at Brown University discovered that 10% of zebrafish genes {{do not need}} to rely on the U2AF2 protein to initiate RNA splicing. These genes have the DNA base pairs AC and TG as repeated sequences at the ends of each intron. On the 3'ss (3' <b>splicing</b> <b>site),</b> the base pairs adenine and cytosine alternate and repeat, and on the 5'ss (5' <b>splicing</b> <b>site),</b> their complements thymine and guanine alternate and repeat as well. They found that there was less reliance on U2AF2 protein than in humans, in which the protein is required for the splicing process to occur. The pattern of repeating base pairs around introns that alters RNA secondary structure was found in other teleosts, but not in tetrapods. This indicates that an evolutionary change in tetrapods may have led to humans relying on the U2AF2 protein for RNA splicing while these genes in zebrafish undergo splicing regardless of the presence of the protein.|$|E
40|$|Pre-mRNA {{splicing}} {{is carried}} out by the spliceosome, which identifies exons and removes intervening introns. In vertebrates, most <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> are initially recognized by the spliceosome across the exon, because most exons are small and surrounded by large introns. This gene architecture predicts that efficient exon recognition depends largely on the strength of the flanking 3 0 and 5 0 <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> However, it is unknown if the 3 0 or the 5 0 <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> dominates the exon recognition process. Here, we test the 3 0 and 5 0 <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> contributions towards efficient exon recognition by systematically replacing the <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> of an internal exon with sequences of different <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> strengths. We show that the presence of an optimal <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> does not guarantee exon inclusion and that the best predictor for exon recognition is the sum of both <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> scores. Using a genomewide approach, we demonstrate that the combined 3 0 and 5 0 <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> strengths of internal exons provide a much more significant separator between constitutive and alternative exons than either the 3 0 or the 5 0 <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> strength alone...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Algorithmic {{approaches}} to <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> prediction have relied {{mainly on the}} consensus patterns found at the boundaries between protein coding and non-coding regions. However exonic splicing enhancers {{have been shown to}} enhance the utilization of nearby <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> Results We have developed a new computational technique to identify significantly conserved motifs involved in <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> regulation. First, 84 putative exonic splicing enhancer hexamers are identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Then a Gibbs sampling program called ELPH was used to locate conserved motifs represented by these hexamers in exonic regions near <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> in confirmed genes. Oligomers containing 35 of these motifs have been shown experimentally to induce significant inclusion of A. thaliana exons.

40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} {{plays an}} important role in regulating gene expression. Currently, most efficient methods use expressed sequence tags or microar- 10 ray analysis for large-scale detection of alternative splicing. However, it is difficult to detect all alternative splice events with them because of their inherent limitations. Previous computational methods for alternative splicing prediction could only predict 15 particular kinds of alternative splice events. Thus, it would be highly desirable to predict alternative 5 0 / 3 0 <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> with various <b>splicing</b> levels using genomic sequences alone. Here, we introduce the competition mechanism of <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> selection 20 into alternative <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> prediction. This approach allows us to predict not only rarely used but also frequently used alternative <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> On a dataset extracted from the AltSplice database, our method correctly classified 70 % of the <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> into 25 alternative and constitutive, as well as 80 % of the locations of real competitors for alternative <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> It outperforms a method which only considers features extracted from the <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> themselves.

SMN1 and SMN2 are nearly identical except for a single nucleotide change in SMN2 resulting in an alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> where intron 6 meets exon 8. This single base pair change leads to only 10-20% of SMN2 transcripts resulting in fully functional SMN protein and 80-90% of transcripts leading to a truncated protein that is rapidly degraded. Most SMA patients have 2 or more copies of the SMN2 gene with more copies resulting a decrease in disease severity (Prior et al., 2009). Most SMA patients have either point mutations or a deletion in exon 7 often leading to a protein product similar to the truncated and degraded version of the SMN2 protein. In SMA patients this small amount of functional SMN2 protein product allows for the some neurons to survive.|$|E
50|$|A {{splice site}} {{mutation}} is a genetic mutation that inserts, deletes or changes {{a number of}} nucleotides in the specific site at which splicing takes place during the processing of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA. Splice site consensus sequences that drive exon recognition are located at the very termini of introns. The deletion of the <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> results {{in one or more}} introns remaining in mature mRNA and may lead to the production of abnormal proteins. When a splice site mutation occurs, the mRNA transcript possesses information from these introns that normally should not be included. Introns are supposed to be removed, while the exons are expressed. The mutation must occur at the specific site at which intron splicing occurs: within non-coding sites in a gene, directly next to the location of the exon. The mutation can be an insertion, deletion, frame shift, etc. The splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences, known as splice-donor and splice-acceptor sequences, which surround each exon. Mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA, or to entire exons being spliced out of the mRNA. These changes could result in production of a nonfunctional protein. An intron is separated from its exon by means of the splice site. Acceptor-site and donor-site relating to the splice sites signal to the splicesome where the actual cut should be made. These donor sites, or recognition sites, are essential in the processing of mRNA. The average vertebrate gene consists of multiple small exons (average size, 137 nucleotides) separated by introns that are considerably larger.|$|E

Mol. Biol. 187, 379 - 307). We have analysed the excision pathways of this intron. Two major intron species of 626 and 337 nucleotides, generated {{by the use of}} 2 consensus 3 ' splicing sites and a minor intron species of 520 nucleotides, generated by the use of another weaker 3 ' <b>splicing</b> <b>site,</b> are identified, the 3 species sharing a common 5 ' <b>splicing</b> <b>site.</b> They are detected predominantly in the lariat form. For the 2 major species we analyzed, the branched nucleotides are localized at consensus branching sequences, 26 or 25 nucleotides upstream from the 3 ' terminal AG. Our results confirm that the first reactions of cleavage at the 5 ' end of introns and branching occur in vivo as described in in vitro systems. The second predominant form of intron 2 is the linear segment, whereas the nicked lariat form which is very minor, might not be a genuine product of in vivo splicing. All intron 2 molecules show practically intact 5 ' and 3 ' terminal sequences, indicating that they are well protected against nuclease attack throughout their life. Therefore, these results indicate that the primary reaction following the excision of the lariat intron is debranching. In addition, the existence of a potential 5 ' <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> contiguous to the major internal 3 ' <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> raised the possibility of an elimination of the major 626 nucleotide intron in 2 cycles of excision.

40|$|AbstractAlternatively spliced exons {{generally}} contain weak splicing sites, and exonic and/or intronic regulatory elements recognised by trans-acting auxiliary splicing factors. The EDA exon of the fibronectin gene is {{a typical}} example of an exon bearing a purine-rich exon splicing enhancer (ESE) element recognised {{by members of the}} SR phosphoprotein family. The regulatory region that governs splicing in the human EDA exon also contains an exon splicing silencer (ESS) element. We have cloned the mouse EDA genomic region, and we show that the ESE and the ESS elements, although they have base differences, can be replaced by the human elements without significant change in the exon inclusion/exclusion ratio. This fact suggests a common splicing regulatory mechanism across species. We demonstrate in vivo the functional activity of the mouse ESE element in splicing. We also show that the trans-acting factors recognising this element cooperate with the 5 ′ <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> of the EDA exon to facilitate proper exon recognition. Indeed, a strong 5 ′ <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> overrides the ESE function in exon recognition. However, the presence of a strong 3 ′ <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> is not sufficient to compensate for the absence of the splicing enhancer.
