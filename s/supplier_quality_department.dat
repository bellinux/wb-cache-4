40|$|Within the <b>Supplier</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>department</b> at Abbott Vascular in Temecula, {{there are}} more {{potential}} projects than resources. In order to manage the work load, projects need to be prioritized and periodically reevaluated for significance. There are project management tools available for use, such as project charter templates, however {{there is not a}} formal process to prioritize projects, nor is there a line of sight between projects and strategic initiatives. Through an assessment survey, evaluation of the process flow, and research of portfolio management techniques a Project Portfolio Tool was created for the Temecula Supplier Quality Group. Overall the Portfolio meets the set objectives, it is easy to use, prioritizes the projects using a ranking system, and includes checkpoints to periodically review the projects within the portfolio against company strategic initiatives. Based on the favorable feedback the tool has been provided to the Divisional Supplier Quality group for consideration for a new Supplier Relationship project, which requires a tool to rank proposals. To effectively use this Portfolio, recommendations were made to change the scoring categories and to consider aligning the weight allocations based on category importance. Finally, while the Portfolio provides an overall project score, there is inherent variability in the data. As such it is considered a guide that is part of an overall system, with Management review and reoccurring checkpoints as opposed to the sole deciding factor. Biotechnolog...|$|E

Poor <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> results in not only monetary losses but also negatively impacts the business potential and future growth of buyer organizations. In this thesis, we propose a multi-tier <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation framework based on total cost of ownership and data envelopment analysis for quality management in global supply chains. The proposed approach comprises of three main steps. Firstly, we group the upstream suppliers based on common attributes using hierarchical cluster analysis. Then, we calculate the total cost of ownership for the grouped suppliers and their sub-suppliers using various qualitative and quantitative factors that are vital for quality management in global supply chains. In the third and the last step, we apply data envelopment analysis to compute the efficiencies of various suppliers to identify the best one (s) and recommend for selection.

Unfortunately, implementing the concept is not very simple and over the years, companies have crumbled due to failure to master the best practices in <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> management. Practices such as measuring the performance of suppliers, engaging <b>suppliers</b> in <b>quality</b> management systems, <b>supplier</b> audits, supplier development, integration and competitive supplier selection are a great opportunity to improve organizational performance in terms of customer service delivery levels and operational costs reduction. However, it is worth noting that there are numerous challenges encountered in having such practices accepted by all the stakeholders. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> management on organizational performance, covering all the supermarkets in Kakamega town.

40|$|An Integrated Model for <b>Supplier</b> <b>Quality</b> Evaluation Aqeel Asaad Al Salem <b>Supplier</b> <b>quality</b> {{evaluation}} is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem that involves multiple, heterogeneous criteria of different weights. The literature addresses quality, delivery, technology, value and service as {{the five most}} common criteria used for <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation. In this thesis, we have considered the most important criteria for evaluating the <b>quality</b> of <b>suppliers</b> based on {{a review of the}} literature and observation in practice. They include both qualitative and quantitative criteria to reflect the real attributes of the supplier in question, and are applied in a <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation performed for a large data set. We propose a three-stage model for performing <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation. In the first stage, we identify the evaluation criteria and assign a weight to each criterion. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique is used in this stage. In the second stage, we address the large size of suppliers’ datasets and present a cluster-analysis-based approach to obtain manageable supplier datasets for evaluation purposes. In the third stage, we apply the VIKOR method to evaluate <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> in the clusters obtained from the previous stage. A numerical application is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach. The strength of the proposed model lies in the integrated application of the three techniques, in which each technique is best suited for its respective problem. The model’s other chief advantage is its ability to deal efficiently with the challenge of evaluating large numbers of suppliers and the data pertaining to their attributes...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to determine the best practices for <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> management (SQM) in the construction industry that ensure that the supplied materials and equipment for construction projects are within the quality requirements. The research is based on three main objectives. The first objective is to describe and assess the process of assuring <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> inside and outside the construction industry. The second objective is to develop a framework for the <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> process based on the collection of SQM practices from multiple data sources. The third objective is to assess the SQM practices within the developed framework of <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> process, and to discuss the development of strategic leadership for SQM. The contribution of this research can be used by stakeholders in the construction industry to improve SQM within their organizations. Researchers can also benefit from this research to better understand SQM practices within the construction industry. The findings of {{the research}} show that SQM practices outside the construction industry appear to be similar to the existing practices within the construction industry. However, construction organizations with highly effective SQM systems implement the SQM practices more consistently, as compared to the other organizations. Also, construction organizations with highly effective SQM systems focus on quality when selecting their suppliers, and hold joint quality planning with their suppliers because these practices have high impact on quality and are easy to implement.

40|$|Services {{have been}} {{traditionally}} separated from goods {{in terms of}} intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability and perishability. Even though the line between goods and services is blurred, as many services include a physical component and vice versa, services pose some differences to the purchasing process compared to tangible goods. With services, {{the importance of the}} specification phase is highlighted {{due to the fact that}} services are difficult to define unambiguously. This has also implications on the performance evaluation of the service supplier: the difficulty of defining a service makes it challenging to measure service quality. The objective of this research was to develop an approach for <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> measurement in industrial services from the viewpoint of the buyer. However, the intention was that the measurement system would ultimately be used jointly by the buyer and the supplier. The research in this thesis was conducted as a case study utilizing a mixed-method research approach. The empirical part of the research consists of two parts: the definition and measurement of <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> in industrial services. In defining <b>supplier</b> service <b>quality,</b> literature review as well as interviews with the case company and the service supplier representatives were used. As a result, a framework for <b>supplier</b> service <b>quality</b> was developed. The framework offers a comprehensive view on <b>supplier</b> service <b>quality,</b> combining the viewpoints of service profit chain, relationship quality, and process and outcome quality of the service. Based on the framework, <b>supplier</b> service <b>quality</b> consists of four dimensions: supplier capability, supplier-customer relationship, and process and outcome quality. The measurement of <b>supplier</b> service <b>quality</b> was constructed as a survey based on the developed framework, and it was used to measure the quality of cleaning service. This thesis describes the undergone process from the development of the measurement items to the actual data gathering and analyzing the results. Statistical analysis was used to examine the survey data. This thesis also developed a model of <b>supplier</b> service <b>quality,</b> aiming to examine the links between the four service quality dimensions. The results provide support for the use of process and outcome quality as dimensions of service quality. Even though the model could not be examined in full, the results suggest that process quality has an effect on outcome quality.

It has {{emerged as one of}} the leading business practices in the past few years. Development of <b>supplier’s</b> <b>quality</b> is an important part of these programs. <b>Supplier</b> <b>Quality</b> Development Programs (SQDPs) are strategic quality development activities for increasing quality, reliability and efficiency of suppliers. Evaluation and selection of appropriate SQDPs to improve quality of supply chain is target of most companies, but results of these evaluations cannot be validated without ensuring credibility of a set of criteria. These criteria are factors that ensure success of SQD activities and used for ranking these efforts. In this thesis, we propose a multi-criteria framework for <b>Supplier</b> <b>Quality</b> Development integrating DMAIC principles. In the Define phase, we identify criteria for SQD using systematic review of literature and industrial practices. In the Measure phase, we conduct a survey study with supply chain quality experts to measure the importance of SQD criteria. In the Analyze phase, we classify the SQD criteria into three groups using Kano’s model by analyzing them from the perspective of fulfilling basic needs, performance needs, and delighters/exciters. To examine the relationship between various SQD criteria, we apply Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique. In the improve phase, we apply the selected criteria to evaluate various <b>Supplier</b> <b>Quality</b> Development Programs using Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) technique called TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and select the best one. In the control phase, we suggest audits for ensuring the criteria used for evaluation are up-to-date with the latest practices. The strength of the proposed work is a comprehensive investigation of SQD criteria using knowledge from quality experts, literature review and industrial practice and suggestion of a practical multi-criteria analysis framework for evaluation and selection of appropriate SQDPs. ...|$|R
