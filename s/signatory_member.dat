40|$|Truths are {{illusions about}} which one has {{forgotten}} {{that this is}} what they are. - NietzscheOn March 5 th 1970, a long process of international negotiation and power brokering culminated into the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty. As a result the 121 signatory states were legally subject to the norms, values, principles, and behavioural prescriptions of the nuclear proliferation regime. Twenty-nine years after the treaty's entrenchment, however, the nuclear proliferation regime and its enforcement agencies still face many of the same challenges that have plagued its implementation since its conception. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the causal relationship between the perception of the political legitimacy among the <b>signatory</b> <b>members</b> of the NPT, the likelihood of adherence to these behavioural prescriptions and to provide a framework to understand what would make for a legitimate treaty in the eyes of its members. This analysis will reveal that <b>signatory</b> <b>members</b> of the NPT who perceive the treaty as illegitimate are more likely to either defect or disobey the obligations of the treaty than those <b>signatory</b> <b>members</b> who perceive the NPT to be legitimate.

5000|$|This {{intended}} deadline was missed, however, {{and after}} {{the signing of the}} Revised Treaty of Basseterre Establishing the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Economic Union on June 18, 2010, the newest target date of January 21, 2011 was met when five of the six independent <b>signatory</b> <b>Member</b> States ratified the Treaty.

30|$|Member {{states have}} also {{demonstrated}} incoherence in {{their support for}} the Mobility Partnerships. As an example, even though Georgia’s Mobility Partnership is the one that received the most signatures from member states (16), it did not translate into a strong commitment from them, and very few projects emerged if we compare to Moldova (26 projects in Georgia and over 85 in Moldova). Consequently, 3 -day study visits of detention centres in a member state for a handful of civil servants from the partner country could symbolize the engagement of a <b>signatory</b> <b>member</b> state into this instrument of cooperation. This example illustrates in our opinion the gap between the rhetoric surrounding this framework of cooperation, its stated objective of coherence and comprehensive action, and its actual implementation.|$|E
