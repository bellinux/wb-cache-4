Thereafter, when again confronted with the initial situation, old ants could act appropriately to solve the problem.

40|$|The {{structure}} of chocolate is drastically transformed during oral processing from a composite solid to an oil/water fluid emulsion. Using two commercial dark chocolates varying in cocoa solids content, this study develops {{a method to}} identify the factors that govern lubrication in molten chocolate and saliva 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to lubrication following oral processing. In addition to chocolate and its individual components, simulated boluses (molten chocolate and phosphate buffered saline), in vitro boluses (molten chocolate and whole human saliva) and ex vivo boluses (chocolate expectorated after chewing till the point of swallow) were tested. The results reveal that the lubrication of molten chocolate is strongly influenced {{by the presence of}} <b>solid</b> <b>sugar</b> particles and cocoa solids. The entrainment of particles into the contact zone between the interacting surfaces reduces friction such that the maximum friction coefficient measured for chocolate boluses is much lower than those for single-phase Newtonian fluids. The addition of whole human saliva or a substitute aqueous phase (PBS) to molten chocolate dissolves sugar and decreases the viscosity of molten chocolate so that thinner films are achieved. However, saliva is more lubricating than PBS, which results in lower friction coefficients for chocolate-saliva mixtures when compared to chocolate-PBS mixtures. A comparison of ex vivo and in vitro boluses also suggests that the quantity of saliva added and uniformity of mixing during oral processing affect bolus structure, which leads to differences in measured friction. It is hypothesized that inhomogeneous mixing in the mouth introduces large air bubbles and regions of non-emulsified fat into the ex vivo boluses, which enhance wetting and lubrication...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSugars {{are known}} to {{stabilize}} proteins. This study addresses questions {{of the nature of}} sugar and proteins incorporated in <b>solid</b> <b>sugar</b> films. Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy was used to examine trehalose and sucrose films and glycerol/water solvent. Proteins and indole-containing compounds that are imbedded in the sugar films were studied by IR and optical (absorption, fluorescence, and phosphorescence) spectroscopy. Water is able to move in the sugar films in the temperature range of 20 – 300 K as suggested by IR absorption bands of HOH bending and OH stretching modes that shift continuously with temperature. In glycerol/water these bands reflect the glass transition at ∼ 160 K. The fluorescence of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide and tryptophan of melittin, Ca-free parvalbumin, and staphylococcal nuclease in dry trehalose/sucrose films remains broad and red-shifted over a temperature excursion of 20 – 300 K. In contrast, the fluorescence of these compounds in glycerol/water solvent shift to the blue as temperature decreases. The fluorescence of the buried tryptophan in Ca-bound parvalbumin in either sugar film or glycerol/water remains blue-shifted and has vibronic resolution over the entire temperature range. The red shift for fluorescence of indole groups exposed to solvent in the sugars is consistent with the motion of water molecules around the excited-state molecule that occurs even at low temperature, although the possibility of static complex formation between the excited-state molecule and water or other factors is discussed. The phosphorescence yield for protein and model indole compounds is sensitive to the matrix glass transition. Phosphorescence emission spectra are resolved and shift little in different solvents or temperature, as predicted by the small dipole moment of the excited triplet state molecule. The conclusion is that the sugar film maintains the environment present at the glass formation temperature for surface Trp and amide groups over a wide temperature excursion. In glycerol/water these groups reflect local changes in the environment as temperature changes...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradable microneedles (MNs) are {{currently}} being developed to painlessly facilitate the effective permeation of therapeutic substances across the skin barrier. As sugar glasses are utilised in nature to protect proteins and other delicate structures upon dehydration, such materials may be an appropriate substrate for the preparation of biodegradable MNs. The aim of this work was to investigate {{for the first time}} the feasibility of preparing biodegradable MNs from sugar glasses and to test their potential utility for drug delivery applications. <b>Solid</b> <b>sugar</b> products were fabricated from 32 different solutions containing a range of individual sugars and binary sugar combinations, utilising a low temperature dehydration methodology. Subsequently, a novel vacuum-forming micromoulding methodology was developed and optimised to produce sugar glass microneedle (SGMN) arrays from silicon master structures. The sugar materials and MN structures were characterised using a variety of microscopic, thermal and x-ray diffraction analyses. The ability of SGMNs to puncture human skin was assessed in an in vitro skin model, whilst SGMN facilitated drug delivery was investigated using modified static Franz-type diffusion cells. A range of model substances including methylene blue (MB) dye, ibuprofen sodium (IBU), sulforhodamine B (SRB), FITC-BSA and β-galactosidase (β-gal) were incorporated within SGMN arrays. Furthermore, novel SGMN adhesive patches containing SRB within the backing only were fabricated using silicone and acrylate adhesives. Long-term stability of SGMN arrays was assessed under a range of differing storage conditions. Initial characterisation studies suggested that non-crystalline sugar material was formed from anhydrous trehalose and sucrose (75 : 25 %w/w) sugar solutions. This finding was critical to future SGMN fabrication and incorporation of model substances within the material. Process optimisation led to fabrication of SGMNs with strong morphological fidelity to master structures, which reliably penetrated human skin to facilitate diffusion of MB dye. Furthermore, SGMNs were shown to dissolve rapidly and completely in human skin and deliver MB, IBU, SRB and FITC-BSA to the deeper skin layers. Diffusion study data suggested that SGMN arrays incorporating a range of model substances facilitated permeation across skin in a bolus delivery manner. Additionally, it was found that SGMN adhesive patches were able to control permeation of SRB, a model hydrophilic compound. Sugar glasses containing β-gal were shown to stabilise enzyme functionality at approximately 40 % of initial activity over a 3 month period when stored under desiccation. Elevated humidity and temperature storage was detrimental to SGMN morphology, with 10 % relative humidity at 20 °C being optimal for MN preservation. Overall, this study suggests the utility of SGMNs for the stable incorporation and effective intra- or trans-dermal delivery of a range of model substances, including hydrophilic and macromolecular molecules. Furthermore, it was shown that a novel SGMN adhesive patch may provide the capability to control drug release across skin. Sugar glasses demonstrated a stabilising effect upon a functional protein cargo, although it appeared that storage conditions had a strong influence upon physical SGMN stability.
