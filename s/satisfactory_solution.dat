25|$|In 1968 Dijkstra {{published}} his seminal paper 'Cooperating sequential processes', a 70-page essay that originated {{the field of}} concurrent programming. He discussed in it the notion of mutual exclusion (mutex) and the criteria a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution</b> should satisfy. He also redressed the historical perspective left out of his 1965 paper by including the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem, for two processes, due to Theodorus Dekker. Dijkstra subsequently generalized Dekker's solution to n processes. Further, he proposed the first synchronisation mechanism for concurrent processes, the semaphore with its two operations, P and V. He also identified the 'deadlock problem' (called there 'the problem of the deadly embrace') and proposed an elegant 'Banker's algorithm' that prevents deadlock. The deadlock detection and prevention became perennial research problems {{in the field of}} concurrent programming.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} assessment of flood risks caused by the River Don and its tributaries, the River Dearne Improvement Scheme was implemented between 1963 and 1973. It was recognised that simple enlargement of the river channel would not provide a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution,</b> as it would just move the problem to the River Don, and therefore a series of washlands were created, which could be progressively flooded if required, without affecting centres of population. Near the mouth of the river, Dearne Mouth washland, which is now known as the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve, was created in 1963, and a manually operated sluice allowed the flow of the river to be diverted through the floodbank and into the washland when there were high levels at the junction with the River Don. The sluice was rebuilt in 1973. Additional washlands were created at Harlington and North Ings, and the river was straightened and realigned.|$|E
25|$|If he chose, Louis XIV could {{attempt to}} assert his will on Spain {{by force of}} arms, but the Nine Years' War had been an immense drain on France's resources. Moreover, Leopold I's war with the Ottoman Turks in the Balkans was nearing a {{successful}} conclusion, and the Emperor would soon {{be in a position}} to transfer his energies west and bolster his claim to the full Spanish inheritance. To seek a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution</b> and gain support, Louis XIV turned to his long-standing rival William of Orange, who was both Dutch Stadtholder and King of England (as William III). England and the Dutch Republic had their own commercial, strategic and political interests within the Spanish empire, and they were eager to return to peaceful commerce. However, the Maritime Powers were in a weakened state and both had reduced their forces at the conclusion of the Nine Years' War. Louis XIV and William III, therefore, sought to solve the problem of the Spanish inheritance through negotiation, based on the principle of partition (at first without prior reference to the Spanish or Austrian courts), to take effect after the death of Charles II.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{important}} to design {{in a short period}} of time efficiently as studies of concurrent engineering have been developed. Obtaining design solutions that satisfy an evaluation of form such as originality and structure such as strength (<b>satisfactory</b> design <b>solutions</b> of form and structure) are necessary. However, conventional structural optimization methods are difficult to obtain <b>satisfactory</b> design <b>solutions</b> of form and structure. This paper described a design method that supports for obtaining <b>satisfactory</b> design <b>solutions</b> of form and structure. Obtaining diverse design solutions by searching globally from the solution space was expected to support for obtaining <b>satisfactory</b> design <b>solutions</b> of form and structure, therefore, an emergent form-generation system that can obtain diverse forms self-organizationally was proposed. The present study applied the emergent form-generation system to the chair design and verified the effectiveness of referring to the diverse forms obtained by the proposed system for obtaining the <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solutions</b> of form and structure. Firstly, the subjects were asked to draft design ideas of chairs without referring to anything. Secondly, they were asked to draft design ideas of chairs with referring to the diverse forms obtained by the emergent form-generation system. Thirdly, influence of referring to the diverse forms on the design ideas was analyzed by the cognitive experiment on diversity of design ideas. As a result, effectiveness of the emergent form-generation system for obtaining the <b>satisfactory</b> design <b>solutions</b> of form and structure was indicated...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{of foreigners}} {{arriving}} in Russia are seeking jobs. In many cases {{they have no}} preliminary contracts or other agreements with a local employer. A typical problem is the illegal status of many foreigners (i.e., they are not registered and have no identity papers), what deprives them of any social assistance (as of 2004) and often leads to their exploitation by the employer. Despite that, foreigner workers still benefit, what with seeming reluctance of regional authorities {{to solve the problem}} forms a sort of modus vivendi. As Gil-Robles noted, it's easy to imagine that illegal status of many foreigners creates grounds for corruption. [...] Illegal immigrants, even if they have spent several years in Russia may be arrested at any moment and placed in detention centres for illegal immigrants for further expulsion. As of 2004, living conditions in detention centers are very bad, and expulsion process lacks of funding, what may extend detention of immigrants for months or even years.
