5|$|The Tasmania Coroner, Mr Sorell, {{investigated}} {{the deaths of}} the 21 people whose bodies had been recovered. He determined that the causes of their deaths were multiple fractures and injuries but he was unable to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> or in what manner they met their deaths.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> long Gilligan maintained his connection with the British Fascists after the tour, nor if he did so at all. By 1926, the organisation had split and faded from view.|$|E
5|$|Blount continued, wondering: My Lord, {{it is most}} {{strange that}} this chance should fall upon you.

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{there were}} a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops – 35,000 helots and 34,500 troops {{from the rest of}} Greece; roughly one per hoplite. The number of 34,500 has been {{suggested}} to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, whose presence in the battle Herodotus later notes. Herodotus tells us that {{there were a}}lso 1,800 Thespians (but does not <b>say</b> <b>how</b> they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.|$|E
5|$|During December 2011, GM {{conducted}} four crash {{tests of}} Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage. On December 22, 2011, the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt {{to the same}} test {{that led to the}} original fire, with no signs of the damage that {{is believed to have been}} the cause. The NHTSA said “the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion” though its investigation remained open. General Motors declined to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> much the modifications would cost.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E

5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to <b>say,</b> <b>how</b> to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, {{although he did not}} <b>say</b> <b>how</b> he distinguished them: one composed of T. horridus, T. prorsus, and T. brevicornus; the other of T. elatus and T. calicornis. Two species (T. serratus and T. flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of T. obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and T. elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Within {{days of the}} {{declaration}} of war, plans were announced for rationing meat and petrol throughout the country. Petrol ration books covered two months, but did not <b>say</b> <b>how</b> much each coupon would be worth. Coal and coke rationing {{were added to the}} list {{before the end of the}} month.|$|E
25|$|A {{short while}} later (the Qissa does not <b>say</b> <b>how</b> long), these Zoroastrians would request and receive {{permission}} from the king to establish a Fire Temple there.

25|$|The War Office {{contacted}} Matthews in February 1924 {{to request}} a demonstration of his ray. Matthews did not reply to them but spoke to journalists and demonstrated the ray to a Star reporter by igniting gunpowder from a distance. He still refused to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> the ray actually worked, just insisted that it did. When the British government still refused to rush to buy his ideas, {{he announced that he}} had an offer from France.|$|E

25|$|Over 4000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{recorded}} from Slovakia. Of these, nearly 1500 are lichen-forming species. Some of these fungi are undoubtedly endemic, but not enough is known to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> many. Of the lichen-forming species, about 40% have been classified as threatened in some way. About 7% are apparently extinct, 9% endangered, 17% vulnerable, and 7% rare. The conservation status of non-lichen-forming fungi in Slovakia is not well documented, {{but there is a}} red list for its larger fungi.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other {{difficulties}} in researching {{the effects of}} cannabis. Many people who smoke cannabis also smoke tobacco. This causes confounding factors, where questions arise {{as to whether the}} tobacco, the cannabis, or both that have caused a cancer. Another difficulty researchers have is in recruiting people who smoke cannabis into studies. Because cannabis is an illegal drug in many countries, people may be reluctant to take part in research, and if they do agree to take part, they may not <b>say</b> <b>how</b> much cannabis they actually smoke.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Gage {{used every}} {{opportunity}} to defame Rogers, portraying him as an opportunist who had gotten rich on the war only to gamble away his money as a profligate. It is difficult to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> many of these allegations were true and how much Gage believed them to be true. Gage apparently saw Rogers as of questionable loyalty—certainly he was not loyal to Gage—and therefore he needed watching. Rogers' dealings with the American Indians troubled Gage, as he and many other British officers in America had come to regard the Indians as treacherous vermin.|$|E
