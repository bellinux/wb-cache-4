40|$|Milk production, plasma bovine {{somatotropin}} (bST) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were measured in dairy cows following a single subcutaneous injection of a slowly released preparation of either recombinant enterokinase linker bST (somidobove: 640 mg) or recombinant methionyl bST (sometribove: 500 mg). There was a 3 - 7 -fold increase in plasma bST concentrations {{during the first}} three postinjection hours in cows treated with both <b>sometribove</b> (from 3. 4 +/- 0. 8 to 11. 2 +/- 3. 0 ng ml(- 1)) or somidobove (from 2. 3 +/- 0. 3 to 17. 5 +/- 2. 6 ng ml(- 1)). In the next 8 days the bST concentration in the bST-treated cows varied, but was still significantly increased above the controls. In the following days, the concentrations of bST did not differ from the controls. Plasma concentrations of IGF-I increased nearly 2 -fold as early as 24 h following recombinant bST administration and then continued to rise so that by 48 h postinjection they were nearly four times higher (control 16. 2, bST-treated 61. 7 ng ml(- 1)). From 48 h after <b>sometribove</b> injection, IGF-I concentrations remained at a plateau (varying between 60. 4 and 85. 7 ng ml-l) till day 11. Then it decreased slowly, but still remained higher on day 14 than those in placebo-treated cows (44. 4 +/- 17. 8 ng ml(- 1) in bST-treated animals; 12. 2 +/- 7. 5 ng ml(- 1) in the controls). Although IGF-I level was increasing in all bST-treated animals, the absolute IGF-I increase was not related to the increase in milk production. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{petition}} {{is based}} on scientific evidence of increased risks of cancer, particularly breast, colon, and prostate, from the consumption of milk from cows injected with Posilac®, the genetically modified recombinant bovine growth hormone (also known as rBGH, <b>sometribove,</b> recombinant bovine somatotropin, or rbST). Posilac @ is the trademark for Monsanto’s rBGH product, registered with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office, and is approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This petition is also based on abnormalities {{in the composition of}} rBGH milk, resulting from the recognized veterinary toxicity of rBGH, particularly increased levels of IGF- 1. The undersigned submit this petition under section 512 (e) (1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U. S. C. 360 b(e) (1) (A)), to request the Secretary to immediately suspend approval of Posilac ® based on imminent hazard; and under section 21 U. S. C...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of bovine somatotropin administration on serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, NEFA, IGF-I, and progesterone (P 4) in ovariectomized non-lactating dairy cows receiving exogenous P 4, as a model to estimate treatment effects on hepatic P 4 degradation. Ten non-lactating, non-pregnant, and ovariectomized Gir×Holstein cows {{were assigned to the}} experiment (d − 14 to 27). On d 0, cows were ranked by BW and BCS, and {{randomly assigned to one of}} two treatments: (1) bovine somatotropin (BST; n= 5) or (2) saline control (control; n= 5). Cows assigned to the BST treatment were administered s. c. injections containing 500 mg of <b>sometribove</b> zinc on d 0, 9, and 18 of the experiment, whereas control cows concurrently received a 10 -mL s. c. injection of 0. 9 % saline. On d − 2, cows were inserted with an intravaginal releasing device containing 1. 9 g of P 4, which remained in the cows until the end the experiment (d 27). Cow BW and BCS were assessed on d − 14, 0, and 27. Blood samples were collected daily from d 0 to d 27, at 0 (immediately before), 1, and 2 h relative to concentrate feeding for determination of serum glucose, insulin, NEFA, P 4, and IGF-I concentrations. Concentrations of glucose, NEFA, and insulin obtained prior to feeding (0 h) were used to determine pre-prandial revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (RQUICKI). No treatment effects were detected for BW (P= 0. 72) and BCS change (P= 0. 79) during the experiment. Beginning on d 2 of the experiment, BST cows had greater (P≤ 0. 01) serum IGF-I concentrations compared with control cohorts (treatment×day interaction; P< 0. 01). Cows receiving BST had greater (P≤ 0. 05) insulin concentrations compared with control cohorts from d 8 to d 11, d 16 and 17, as well as from d 19 to d 21 of the experiment (treatment×day interaction; P< 0. 01). Cows receiving BST had greater (P≤ 0. 01) mean glucose and NEFA concentrations, as well as reduced (P< 0. 01) mean RQUICKI during the experiment compared with control cohorts. No treatment effects, however, were detected (P= 0. 73) for serum P 4 concentrations. In conclusion, results from this experiment indicate that hepatic P 4 catabolism is not directly regulated by circulating IGF-I, whereas BST administration decreases insulin sensitivity in non-lactating dairy cows in adequate nutritional status...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} administration of somatotropin (ST) and/or eCG on insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) in serum and follicular fluid (FFL) of cattle actively immunized against growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF). Cyclic beef cattle, previously immunized against GRF-(1 - 29) -Gly-Gly-Cys-NH 2 conjugated to human serum albumin (synthesized and provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, NJ; GRFi, n = 31) or to human serum albumin alone (HSAi, n = 26), received (i. m.) : 1) 25 mg recombinantly derived methionyl somatotropin (rbST, n = 14; <b>sometribove</b> provided by Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO); 2) 1100 IU eCG (n = 10); 3) rbST and eCG (rbST-eCG, n = 15); or 4) vehicle (VEH, n = 17) at 0 and 24 h after receiving prostaglandin F 2 (PGF 2). Serum samples were collected at 0 and 40 h after PGF 2, and the ovary bearing the largest follicle (DOM) was removed 44. 0 0. 5 h after PGF 2; FFL was harvested from DOM and the subordinate follicle (SUB). Before treatment (0 h), GRFi cows had lower serum ST (0. 6 ± 0. 2 vs. 2. 2 ± 0. 2 ng/ml;p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and IGF-I (26 ± 4 vs. 72 ± 4 ng/ml;p 3 ̆c 0. 01), but greater IGFBP- 2 (594 48 vs. 384 52 ng/ml; p 3 ̆c 0. 01) than HSAi cows. Serum and FFL concentrations of IGF-I or IGFBP- 2 were not different between rbST- and rbST-eCG-treated cows or between VEH- and eCG-treated cows at Hour 40 after the initial treatment injection; therefore, data were combined and designated as rbST and VEH, respectively. Serum IGF-I was increased {{to a greater extent}} (percentage increase above 0 h) by rbST treatment in GRFi (362 ± 24) than in HSAi (176 ± 16) cows (immunization by treatment, p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Across GRFi and HSAi, rbST lowered serum IGFBP- 2 (342 ± 31 vs. 541 ± 27 ng/ml, rbST vs. VEH; p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Diameters of DOM or SUB were not affected by immunization or treatment. Concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 (determined by ligand blot analysis) in FFL from both DOM and SUB were lower (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in GRFi than in HSAi cows. In contrast, IGFBP- 2 in FFL was elevated in SUB, but not DOM, in GRFi compared to HSAi cows. Ligand blot analyses indicated that IGFBP- 4 and IGFBP- 5 were markedly higher in FFL from SUB in GRFi than in HSAi cows, but not different for DOM. Administration of rbST increased IGF-I and decreased IGFBP- 2 in DOM and SUB. In conclusion, GRFi decreased serum and FFL concentrations of IGF-I, while it increased concentrations of IGFBP- 2 in serum and in FFL from SUB, but not DOM. Treatment with rbST increased serum and FFL IGF-I, but decreased both serum and FFL IGFBP- 2 (in both DOM and SUB). The specific roles that IGF-I and IGFBP play in folliculogenesis are yet to be determined; of particular interest is the divergent effect of GRFi on IGFBP in dominant vs. subordinate follicles...|$|E
