40|$|Measurement of the {{adhesive}} force {{is of great}} interest in {{a large number of}} applications, such as powder coating and processing of cohesive powders. Established measurement methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the centrifugal method are costly and time consuming. For engineering applications {{there is a need to}} develop a quick test method. The drop test method has been designed and developed for this purpose. In this test method particles that are adhered to a substrate are mounted on and are subjected to a tensile force by impacting the stub against a <b>stopper</b> <b>ring</b> by dropping it from a set height. From the balance of the detachment force and {{adhesive force}} for a critical particles size, above which particles are detached and below which they remain on the substrate, the interfacial specific energy is calculated. A model of adhesion is required to estimate the adhesive force between the particles and the surface, and in this work we use the JKR theory. The detachment force is estimated by Newton’s second law of motion, using an estimated particle mass, based on its size and density and calculated particle acceleration. A number of materials such as silanised glass beads, Avicel, α-lactose monohydrate and starch have been tested and the adhesive force and energy between the particle and the substrate surface have been quantified. Consistent values of the interface energy with a narrow error band are obtained, independent of the impact velocity. As the latter is varied, different particle sizes detach; nevertheless similar values of the interface energy are obtained, an indication that the technique is robust, as it is in fact based on microscopic observations of many particles. The trends of the results obtained with the drop test method are similar to those shown in studies by other researchers using established methods like the AFM and the centrifuge method...|$|E
40|$|Additives are {{costly and}} can have {{negative}} environmental effects. Thus, searching for other alternatives to improve recycling plastics without using additives is necessary. This study aims {{to improve the}} hoop tensile strength, elongation at break, and shrinkage of the <b>ring</b> <b>stopper</b> made from an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene blend comprising 40 % recyclates through the optimization of processing parameters using the Taguchi method. By adopting the L 9 Taguchi orthogonal array, four controllable factors each at three levels are tested to determine the optimal combination of factors and levels in the injection moulding process. Considering the multiple quality characteristics involved in this study, we investigate the effects of processing parameters on hoop tensile strength, elongation at break, and shrinkage of the <b>ring</b> <b>stopper</b> both separately and simultaneously because changing a parameter can result in the improvement or deterioration of each quality response and of the overall product performance. The results revealed that the performance of an injection-moulded <b>ring</b> <b>stopper</b> under the optimal process conditions is equivalent or slightly better {{than that of the}} part produced from virgin resin. The performance of recycled plastics can be effectively enhanced to levels comparable with virgin resins using the Taguchi optimization approach...|$|R
40|$|Shear {{stresses}} are {{a common}} reason for failure in many industrial applications. Localized shear deformations in certain materials {{can lead to the}} formation of adiabatic shear bands. Titanium alloys in particular have proven to be good candidates for the formation of the adiabatic shear bands. For this reason, this study focuses on the shear behavior of Ti 15 - 3 - 3 - 3 alloy, and especially the shear localizations during deformation at various strain rates. Shear strains are localized into a narrow region in the hat-shaped specimens due to the geometry of the specimen. Therefore, in this study, the mechanical behavior of Ti- 15 - 3 - 3 - 3 alloy was studied using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (at high strain rates) and servo-hydraulic materials testing machine (at lower strain rates) using the hat-shape specimens. <b>Stopper</b> <b>rings</b> were used to limit the amount of deformation and consequently the amount of applied strain to a predetermined value. The microstructures of the adiabatic shear bands were studied using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The widths of the shear bands were measured from the micrographs of the samples with different amounts of deformation. In some samples, also individual slip bands appeared clearly outside the primary shear zone. These individual slip bands were neglected in the calculations of stress vs. strain curves, and therefore the deformation was assumed to be limited to the primary shear band area only. Finally it was concluded that the shear band width is independent of the amount of strain in the high strain rate tests. This constant value was used in the calculations of shear strain and strain rate. The shear stress and shear strain for each test were calculated and the obtained stress-strain curves were analyzed. Different mechanical behavior was observed in the high strain rate test results compared to the results obtained at low strain rates. At high strain rates the effect of strain hardening is significantly weaker than the thermal softening in the primary shear band, leading to a strongly localized deformation and constant shear band width...|$|R

The first {{touch of the}} hawser against the fluke threw her down; she was up on her feet again quick as lightning, but she was up on the wrong side. I heard a horrid, {{scraping}} sound, and then that anchor, tipping over, rose up like something alive; its great, rough iron arm caught Maggie round the waist, seemed to clasp her close with a dreadful hug, and flung itself with her over and down in a terrific clang of iron, followed by heavy ringing blows that shook the ship from stem to stern--because the <b>ring</b> <b>stopper</b> held!" ...|$|R
40|$|In 2003, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) has {{upgraded}} its {{storage ring}} to a 3 rd generation storage ring (SPEAR 3). SPEAR 3 is deigned {{to operate at}} 500 mA stored beam current and 3 GeV energy. The 234 -meter circumference SPEAR 3 ring utilizes 60 -cm-thick concrete lateral walls, 30 -cm-thick concrete roof, as well as 60 -cm or 90 -cm-thick concrete ratchet walls. A total of 3. 5 x 10 {sup 15 } e{sup -}/y will be injected into the ring with an injection power of 4 W and an injection efficiency of 75 %. Normal beam losses occur due to both injection and stored beam operations in the total of 20 low loss as well as 3 high loss limiting apertures. During the 6 -minutes injection period, an instantaneous power loss of 0. 05 W occurs at each low loss aperture. When averaged over the operational year, the loss of both the injection and stored beams is equivalent to an average loss of 2 mW at each low loss aperture. On the other hand, the average losses in the high loss apertures are 16 mW for the injection septum, 47 mW for the beam abort dump, and 13 mW for the <b>ring</b> <b>stoppers.</b> The shielding requirements for losses in the new ring {{were based on a}} generic approach that used both FLUKA Monte Carlo particle generation and transport code and empirical computer codes and formulae...|$|R
