25|$|The crest is also {{designed}} {{to stress the}} pursuit of knowledge. It consists of a red torch held erect by a forearm between two branches of gold laurel. Having been originally worn on the helmet of a fully armed person, the crest is always placed {{on the top of}} the helm. The method of joining the crest to the helm was usually concealed by decoration and, in the University’s arms, this is effected by the use of a wreath and a crown. The wreath is <b>silver,</b> <b>red</b> and black, these colours being taken from the shield. It is surmounted by a mural crown (resembling a wall), which is reserved in modern grants for persons and organisations connected with public corporations. The cloth mantling which hangs down from the top of the helm is the survival of the cloak which was originally worn to protect the armour, coloured in the two principal colours of the shield, blue and gold.|$|E

2500|$|During the mid-1930s, {{the art of}} {{streamlining}} became popular, {{especially with}} locomotives, as it conveyed a sense of speed. While other railroads were introducing streamlined trains, like the Union Pacific's M-10000 or the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad with the Zephyr, the PRR had the GG1. [...] The GG1 has [...] "shown up {{over the years in}} more advertisements and movie clips than any other locomotive." [...] It was also featured in art calendars provided by PRR, which were used to [...] "promote its reputation in the public eye." [...] It has appeared in the films Broadway Limited in 1941, The Clock in 1945, Blast of Silence in 1961, the 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate, and Avalon in 1990 in the PRR paint scheme. Two GG1s appear in the 1973 film The Seven-Upsa black Penn Central locomotive and a <b>silver,</b> <b>red</b> and blue Amtrak locomotive. A Penn Central GG1 also appears in another 1973 film The Last Detail. [...] PRR GG1 4821 appears briefly in the 1952 film The Greatest Show on Earth, pulling the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus Train into Philadelphia's Greenwich Yard, with the movie's director Cecil B. DeMille narrating the scene of their arrival. Near the end of the 1951 film Bright Victory GG1 #4849 is shown pulling into the station.|$|E
