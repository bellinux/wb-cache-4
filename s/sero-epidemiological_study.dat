A longitudinal <b>sero-epidemiological</b> <b>study</b> was conducted in this vast region from September 1983 to April 1985. The general findings do not appear to support the existence of active foci of transmission, but analysis of the data for certain oases and localities leads to a quite different assessment of the epidemiological situation. At Ouargla, for example, the serological results obtained by indirect immunofluorescence show prevalence of under 5 % in the four successive surveys, whereas in Heïha oasis over 50 % of subjects over 30 years of age were found to be seropositive. The results of the longitudinal seroepidemiological surveys conducted in a number of localities and oases in the Saharan region reflect the diversity of epidemiological settings and provide evidence that there is low-level malaria transmission in some oases such as Heïha, Yakou, Ihérir and probably in In-Salah. These surveys confirm that malaria transmission has been halted in the former foci such as Ouargla and Timimoune.

40|$|Parachlamydia acanthamoebae is an obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium naturally infecting free-living amoebae. The role of this bacterium as {{an agent}} of pneumonia is suggested by <b>sero-epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> and molecular surveys. Furthermore, P. acanthamoebae may escape macrophages microbicidal effectors. Recently, we demonstrated that intratracheal inoculation of P. acanthamoebae induced pneumonia in 100 % of infected mice. However, the intratracheal route of infection is not the natural way of infection and we therefore developed an intranasal murine model. Mice inoculated with P. acanthamoebae by intranasal inoculation lost 18 % of their weight up to 8 days post-inoculation. All mice presented histological signs of pneumonia at day 2, 4, 7, and 10 post-inoculation, whereas no control mice harboured signs of pneumonia. A 5 -fold increase in bacterial load was observed from day 0 to day 4 post-inoculation. Lungs of inoculated mice were positive by Parachlamydia-specific immunohistochemistry 4 days post-inoculation, and P. acanthamoebae were localized within macrophages. Thus, we demonstrated that P. acanthamoebae induce a severe pneumonia in mice.

Moreover, we have evaluated the role of infection with C. pneumoniae in relation to the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. One hundred and eighty coronary artery specimens were collected at autopsy from 60 consecutive subjects (three arterial segments from each subject).

In this study, we present a long-term pattern of serological changes in DOBV antibody prevalence in a population of A. flavicollis in the Province of Trento (northern Italy). From 2000 to 2012 the mean hantavirus seroprevalence was 2. 7 % (s. e. = 0. 3 %), ranging from 0 % (in 2000, 2002 and 2003) to 12. 5 % (in 2012), a statistically significant increase (t-value= 5. 93, p< 0. 001).

Using an indirect haemagglutination test antibodies to gonococcal pili were found in sera of 92 % of the female and 70 % of the male patients, in 30 % of the male and 10 % of the female controls, and in 41 % of the women and 33 % of the men in Uvkusigsat. The study indicates that genital chlamydial and gonococcal infections are serious public health problems in Greenland and that such infections are acquired early in both sexes and often occur concomitantly...|$|E
40|$|Theileria equi {{merozoite}} surface antigens {{have been}} an important candidate for development of diagnostics. We developed ELISA based on EMA- 1 recombinant antigen, so as to widen our diagnostic confidence in detection of antibodies against T. equi in serosurveillance studies. The 547 bp EMA- 1 gene fragment encoding high hydrophilic antigenic region was expressed with glutathione-S-transferase tag in prokaryotic system and purified protein (43 kDa) was used for development of ELISA (EMA- 1 t/ELISA). The EMA- 1 t/ELISA clearly differentiated T. equi-infected from Babesia caballi-infected horse sera or normal horse sera. The {{results of the study}} were validated with previously developed EMA- 2 ELISA on serum samples of known T. equi infection status and a very high correlation (0. 93) was recorded between the relative percent positivity (RPP) values. Further diagnostic sensitivity of EMA- 1 t/ELISA was 0. 92 while specificity was 1. 0, indicating its suitability for <b>sero-epidemiological</b> <b>studies.</b> This assay was applied on serum samples (n ＝ 240) collected from field horses in northern part of India. High sero-prevalence of T. equi antibodies were diagnosed in serum samples collected from Haryana state (74 %) and Uttarakhand state (36. 31 %). Results of this study suggested that the 43 kDa EMA- 1 expressed protein could be a reliable immunodiagnostic antigen in ELISA for T. equi sero-prevalence studies...|$|R
40|$|Pseudovirion-based {{neutralization}} assay {{is considered the}} gold standard method for evaluating the immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. In this study, we developed a multicolor {{neutralization assay}} to simultaneously detect the neutralizing antibodies against different HPV types. FluoroSpot was used to interpret the fluorescent protein expression instead of flow cytometry. The results of FluoroSpot and flow cytometry showed good consistency, with R 2 > 0. 98 for the log-transformed IC 50 values. Regardless of the reporter color, the single-, dual-, and triple-color neutralization assays reported identical results for the same samples. In low-titer samples from naturally HPV-infected individuals, there was strong agreement between the single- and triple-color assays, with kappa scores of 0. 92, 0. 89, and 0. 96 for HPV 16, HPV 18, and HPV 58, respectively. Good reproducibility was observed for the triple-color assay, with coefficients of variation of 2. 0 %– 41. 5 % within the assays and 8. 3 %– 36. 2 % between the assays. Three triple-color systems, HPV 16 - 18 - 58, HPV 6 - 33 - 45, and HPV 11 - 31 - 52, were developed that could evaluate the immunogenicity of a nonavalent vaccine in three rounds of the assay. With the advantages of an easy-to-use procedure and less sample consumption, the multiple-color assay is more suitable than classical assays for large <b>sero-epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> and clinical trials and is more amenable to automation...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Sero-epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> {{have shown}} a strong and {{consistent}} association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) infection. With regard to the humoral immune response, different studies demonstrated an enhanced reactivity against EBV in patients with MS but a comprehensive analysis of the fine specificity of these antibodies was hitherto not performed. Objective and Methods: To examine the IgG-antibody response in 29 MS-patients and 22 healthy controls we conducted a high density screen using peptide-microarrays with 1465 peptides representing 8 different EBV-proteins (EBNA 1, EBNA 3, EBNA 4, EBNA 6, VP 26, LMP 1, BLRF 2, BZLF 1). The influence of immunmodulatory treatment on antibody reactivities was studied by a subgroup analysis. The value of anti-EBV antibody pattern as diagnostic biomarker for MS was analysed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: At a significance threshold of p≤ 10 - 3 elevated humoral immune responses against 39 peptides were found in patients with MS. 13 of these peptides were located within the glycin-alanin repeat of the EBNA 1 protein. Other reactivities were directed against EBNA 3, EBNA 4, EBNA 6, VP 26 and LMP 1. These findings were independent of treatment mode. Combined ROC-curve analysis of the 3 most significant peptides revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0, 9 which indicates a potential value of altered EBV-antibody patterns as diagnostic biomarkers for MS. Conclusion: Antibodies against EBV in MS patients primarily target, but are not confined to, the glycine–alanine repeat of EBNA 1...|$|R
