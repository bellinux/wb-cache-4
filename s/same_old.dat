25|$|In 2000 Daniher took Melbourne to the Grand Final, but the Demons were convincingly {{beaten by}} Essendon. The members had {{expected}} {{a new era}} of success, but in 2001 it was <b>same</b> <b>old</b> story: Melbourne finished 11th. In 2002, although Melbourne again made the finals, Gutnick was voted out by the members.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite this}} {{apparent}} diversity, {{some of the}} <b>same</b> <b>old</b> problems which had dogged international rugby were still manifest in the Hong Kong Sevens in the 1980s – for example, in {{a photograph of the}} Hong Kong vs. Bahrain game at the tournament in 1984, the teams do not appear to include anyone who is ethnically Arab or Chinese; instead both teams are quite clearly of northern European ethnic origin.|$|E
25|$|The United States Grand Prix {{had a new}} destination, {{this time}} in the hot desert city of Phoenix, Arizona. It was a new place, but the <b>same</b> <b>old</b> dirty and dusty street circuits, and while {{considerably}} wider, faster and less bumpy than both Detroit and Dallas, the mostly right angled turns gave the drivers few reference points for when to use their brakes. The dreadfully hot 100+ degree dry desert summer heat of Phoenix also made conditions trying; the track broke up during the race. Senna made the most of his skill and scored another pole, Prost again playing second fiddle by over a second. Prost though believed that his race set up was superior to his team mate's and was confident of winning his first Grand Prix of the year.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Scared to Death", at the end, when Castle and Beckett are {{toasting}} their success, {{she tells}} Castle {{that she knows}} this trick with ice cubes. This is probably referring back to the trick {{she was talking about}} near the beginning of episode [...] "Poof! You're Dead". Plus, Castle's Bucket List indicates that his #1 is [...] "Be with Kate". He says he put that on about 3 years ago. This also might link to that <b>same</b> <b>older</b> episode because during that episode, he officially breaks up with Gina.|$|R
25|$|Mantle {{spoke with}} great remorse of his {{drinking}} in a 1994 Sports Illustrated cover story. He {{said that he}} was telling the <b>same</b> <b>old</b> stories, and realizing how many of them involved himself and others being drunk – including at least one drunk-driving accident – he decided they were not funny anymore. He admitted he had often been cruel and hurtful to family, friends, and fans because of his alcoholism, and sought to make amends. Mantle became a Christian because of his former teammate Bobby Richardson, an ordained Baptist minister who shared his faith with him. After the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, Mantle joined with fellow Oklahoman and Yankee Bobby Murcer {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} five monologues collectively titled Tutta casa, letto e chiesa (All House, Bed and Church) also first {{appeared}} in 1977, and were performed by Rame. The first, Il risveglio (Waking Up), featured a working-class mother talking to her baby (a doll). Una donna tutta sola (A Woman Alone) was about a housewife locked indoors by her husband who {{had to deal with}} a crying baby while fighting off the advances of his crippled, wheelchair-bound, pornographic-film-obsessed brother, a man with a telescope, an obscene telephone caller and a former teacher who has fallen in love with her. La mamma fricchettona (Freak Mother) featured a mother taking shelter in a church confessional after leaving her family to pursue drugs and free love. The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Story features a little girl with a doll who swears. The final monologue, Medea, based on an Italian version rather than the more famous Euripides version, had been performed in 35 countries by 1990.|$|E
25|$|After {{a season}} spent {{employed}} by the VFL as the umpires' coach, Worrall was recruited by Essendon. Here, he took a talented but previously under-performing team to a premiership in his first season. The next year, 1912, an injury-ravaged Essendon team somehow managed to upset hot favourites South Melbourne in the Grand Final. Over five completed seasons, Worrall had now coached five premiership teams. But the team declined rapidly thereafter and went into recess in 1916–1917, due to World War I. Performances failed to improve when the <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> returned to competition, winning only fifteen out of 46 games between 1918 and 1920, prompting Worrall's retirement. The team finished last in 1918, and Worrall became {{the first man to}} coach both a premiership and a wooden-spoon team. In 1922, he reappeared briefly as an assistant to Vic Belcher at his old team Fitzroy, which {{went on to win the}} premiership from Collingwood.|$|E

25|$|Stowe MS 944 is a bound volume {{now in the}} British Library, {{the full}} scanned images of which are at British Library Online. It begins {{with a history of}} Hyde Abbey, Winchester, written in 1771, {{followed}} by a wide collection of much older original source documents. A selection of medieval drawings, is followed by a Liber vitae, written in 1031 consisting of lists of names of brethren and benefactors of the New Minster, also at Winchester, and substantially annotated. Other historiographical texts follow, including the will of King Ælfred. The two documents being considered here, originally composed entirely separately, were then written into the <b>same</b> <b>Old</b> English manuscript, under a combined heading of 'On the Resting-Places of the Saints'. However, it is the second document ('Secgan') which provided the list of saints. The first, ('Þá hálgan') includes mention of many saints, particularly those relating to Kent, but written as part of a narrative of the Kentish Royal Legend.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to point out that kanto had now moved from the stage to the recording studio. While the subjects dealt with in the lyrics were stili the <b>same</b> <b>old</b> quarreis between men and women, mixed in with satirical takes on fashion and current events, the songs were being written with the 78 rpm phonograph in mind. So much so that every record label hired their own kanto composers—and rather famous ones at that. With Columbia at the fore, record labels commissioned kanto from Kaptanzade Ali Rıza Bey, Refik Fersan, Dramalı Hasan, Sadettin Kaynak, Cümbüş Mehmet and Mildan Niyazi Bey. The makams were the same but the instrumentation had changed. Kanto were now accompanied by cümbüş (a fretlees banjo like instrument) the ud (a fretless) lute, and calpara (castenets). Foxtrot, Charleston and rumba rhythms dominated. The tunes were being written and sung more tor listening than tor dancing. Female soloists include Makbule Enver, Mahmure, and Neriman; Beşiktaşlı Kemal Senman was the most sought after male singer for duets.|$|E

500|$|... "The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Story" [...] is {{the second}} episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama {{television}} series Fringe. The episode was written by executive producer Jeff Pinkner and co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci. [...] When developing the series, they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural. [...] "The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Story" [...] was the first regular episode of Fringe, and journalists viewed it {{as an example of}} what they could expect from the series. It was directed by Paul A. Edwards.|$|E
500|$|A UGO Networks {{columnist}} {{was concerned}} that the expensive pilot {{would be hard to}} translate into weekly episodes, but [...] "after sitting down to watch Fringes second episode, [...] "The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Story", my concerns have vanished. Fringes second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of Fringes eleven-herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X-Files is even better defined in the first weekly-episode. I'd struggled to find the word to describe it, and the winner is 'condensed'. [...] "The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Story" [...] has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more combustible space." [...] Another UGO writer, Alex Zalben, later compared [...] "The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Story" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Død Kalm". Zalben concluded that [...] "Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation." ...|$|E

In its opening weekend the film grossed $11.3 million, finishing fourth {{at the box office}} behind The Angry Birds Movie ($39 million), Captain America: Civil War ($33.1 million) and Neighbors 2 ($21.8 million).

500|$|The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Blood Rush with a New Touch is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Cute Is What We Aim For. Following the band's {{formation}} in early 2005, they posted demos on Myspace and PureVolume. These demos soon garnered attention from record labels.

In February 2006, the band began recording The <b>Same</b> <b>Old</b> Blood Rush with a New Touch with producer Matt Squire at Salad Days Studios in Beltsville, Maryland. During the album sessions, several of the demos the band had previously posted had been re-recorded.
