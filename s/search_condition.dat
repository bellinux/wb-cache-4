In other words, the subsets [...] "could, in a number of important ways, be accessed by the visual system as though they were the only items present". Furthermore, the subsetted objects' particular positions within the display made no difference to subjects' ability to search across them — even when they were distally located. Watson and Humphreys (1997) reported similar findings. These results are consistent with the predictions of visual indexing theory: FINSTs provide a possible mechanism by which the subsets were prioritised.|$|E

5000|$|An OPath {{query string}} allows {{to express the}} {{parameters}} that will be queried for to be specified using Item properties, embedded Items as well as Relationships. It can specify a single <b>search</b> <b>condition,</b> such as [...] "title = Something'", or a compound condition such as [...] "title = 'Title 1' || title = 'Title 2' && author = 'Someone'". These boolean and relational operations can be specified using C# like &&, ||, =, != operators {{as well as their}} English-like equivalent like EQUAL, NOT EQUAL. SQL like operators such as LIKE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY are also supported, as are wildcard conditions. So, [...] "title LIKE 'any*'" [...] is a valid query string. These operators can be used to execute complex searches such as [...] using (ItemContext ic = ItemContext.Open (...) [...] ) { //Searching begins by creating a ItemSearcher object. The searcher is created from a //relationship instance because the contacts being searched for are in relation. The //first parameter defines the scope of the search. An ItemContext as the scope means //the entire store is to be searched. Scope can be limited to a set of Items which may //be in a holding relationship with the contacts. In that case, the set is passed as //the scope of the search. ItemSearcher searcher = OutContactRelationship.GetTargetSearcher(ic, typeof(Contact)); ContactCollection contacts = searcher.FindAll("OutContactRelationship.Contact.Name LIKE 'A*'"); }The above code snippet creates an ItemSearcher object that searches on the OutContactRelationship instance that relates pictures and contacts, in effect searching all pictures related with a contact. It then runs the query Name LIKE 'A*'" [...] on all contacts reachable through OutContactRelationship, returning the list of [...] "contacts whose names start with A and whose pictures I have". Similarly, more relationships could be taken into account to further narrow down the results. Further, a natural language query processor, which parses query in natural language and creates a well-formed OPath query string to search via proper relationships, can allow users to make searches such as [...] "find the name of the wine I had with person X last month", provided financial management applications are using WinFS to store bills.|$|E
30|$|There {{were two}} visual search conditions: the easy <b>search</b> <b>condition</b> and the {{difficult}} <b>search</b> <b>condition.</b> In the easy <b>search</b> <b>condition</b> {{participants were asked}} to search for the target letter of a red T among distracter letters of green Ls. As the target was defined by a unique feature it would require little search and “pop-out” of the search display (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). In the difficult <b>search</b> <b>condition</b> participants were still asked to search for the letter T; however, in this condition all the stimuli were white. Given that the target had no defining feature and {{the fact that there was}} a great deal of similarity between the target and the distracters, these sets of stimuli would result in inefficient search (e.g., Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Wolfe, Cave, & Franzel, 1989).|$|E
40|$|By two {{different}} cue paradigms to cue target’s location or locations of all stimuli, {{this study is}} to discuss the search efficiency in different search modes. The research includes three experiments. The main results are as follows: The first experiment explores whether cueing target’s location has impact on vis-ual search performance under different search modes (parallel search and serial search). The results are: cueing target’s location has no facilitation effect in parallel <b>search</b> <b>condition</b> while has facilitation effect in serial <b>search</b> <b>condition,</b> the effect reflects the diffidence in slope of reaction time. In the second experiment, we want to explore whether cueing all stimuli’s loca-tions has impact on visual search performance under different search modes. The re-sults show that: cueing all stimuli’s locations has no facilitation effect in parallel <b>search</b> <b>condition</b> but has facilitation effect in serial <b>search</b> <b>condition,</b> the effect reflects the diffidence in intercept of reaction time. The third experiment is to explore the time course of facilitation effect in serial search. The result shows that only a 50 ms which cueing all stimuli’s locations has fa-cilitation effect, with the longer cueing time, the more facilitation effect. 本研究采用两种不同的线索范式，提示目标位置或所有刺激的位置，探讨线索位置对平行搜索和序列搜索绩效的影响。本研究包括三个实验，主要结果如下： 实验一探讨经典线索范式（线索只提示目标的位置）下的视觉搜索绩效。结果发现：线索对平行搜索条件下的目标识别没有影响；但对序列搜索条件下的目标识别有明显的促进作用，即有线索下的目标识别快于无线索下的目标识别，主要表现在有线索下的反应时斜率小于无线索下的反应时斜率。 实验二探讨同时线索范式（线索提示所有刺激的位置）下的视觉搜索绩效。结果表明：线索对平行搜索条件下的目标识别没有影响；但对序列搜索条件下的目标识别有显著的促进作用，即有线索下的目标识别快于无线索下的目标识别，主要表现在有线索下的反应时截距小于无线索下的反应时截距。 实验三探讨序列搜索条件下，同时线索范式下的空间注意线索效应的时程特点。研究发现：呈现 50 ms的线索就能促进对目标的识别，随着线索呈现时间的延长，促进作用越明显...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the gains and losses in visual search performance across the lifespan in a representative sample of 298 individuals ranging from 6 to 89 years of age. Adopting a lifespan developmental perspective, two general resource theories were considered: cognitive speed and inhibitory control. Participants searched computer displays to indicate the presence or absence of a single target among 2, 8, or 14 stimuli. Distractors differed either by a single feature (color) or the combination of two features (color, shape) in feature and conjunction <b>search</b> <b>conditions,</b> respectively. For target-present trials, target eccentricity was also systematically varied. In line with previous findings, search performance was substantially slower early and late in life, compared to early adulthood. Furthermore, the age gradients were more pronounced in conjunction than in feature <b>search</b> <b>conditions.</b> More interestingly, developmental and aging trends were distinctly asymmetrical in terms of sensitivity to different experimental manipulations: children's search performance was particularly affected by the mere presence of distractors; whereas in late life, search performance was particularly impaired on target-absent trials, and with increasing numbers of distractors. In contrast, all age groups were uniformly affected by manipulations of target eccentricity, and consistently produced search slopes of less than 10 ms/item during feature <b>search</b> <b>conditions.</b> We interpret the observed asymmetries between child development and aging with respect to lifespan theories of cognitive and attentional development...|$|R

40|$|This is the author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] (2004) proposed that stimulus-driven capture occurs primarily for salient stimuli that fall within the observer's attentional window, such as when performing a parallel search. This proposal, supported by some studies, can explain many seemingly discrepant results in the literature. The present study tested this proposal using a modified pre-cuing paradigm. Search mode was manipulated via target-distractor similarity in color space. In the parallel <b>search</b> <b>condition,</b> the orange target “popped out” from a set of distantly colored distractors (blue and green). In the serial <b>search</b> <b>condition,</b> the orange target was more difficult to find amongst a set of similarly colored distractors (yellow and red). In Experiments 1 and 2, cue validity effects for irrelevant color singleton cues were greater under parallel search than serial search, at least partially replicating previous studies favoring the attentional window account (e. g., Belopolsky et al., 2007). We found the opposite pattern, however, for capture by abrupt onsets (Experiments 3 and 4). Here, capture effects were actually greater under serial search. In sum, parallel search appears to facilitate capture by color singletons, yet inhibit capture by abrupt onsets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Keyword {{matching}} or ID matching is {{the most}} common searching method in a large database of protein-protein interactions. They are purely syntactic methods, and retrieve the records in the database that contain a keyword or ID specified in a query. Such syntactic search methods often retrieve too few search results or no results despite many potential matches present in the database. Results We have developed a new method for representing protein-protein interactions and the Gene Ontology (GO) using modified Gödel numbers. This representation is hidden from users but enables a search engine using the representation to efficiently search protein-protein interactions in a biologically meaningful way. Given a query protein with optional search conditions expressed in one or more GO terms, the search engine finds all the interaction partners of the query protein by unique prime factorization of the modified Gödel numbers representing the query protein and the search conditions. Conclusion Representing the biological relations of proteins and their GO annotations by modified Gödel numbers makes a search engine efficiently find all protein-protein interactions by prime factorization of the numbers. Keyword matching or ID matching search methods often miss the interactions involving a protein that has no explicit annotations matching the <b>search</b> <b>condition,</b> but our search engine retrieves such interactions as well if they satisfy the <b>search</b> <b>condition</b> with a more specific term in the ontology. </p...|$|E

We designed the current study to clarify the relationship between childhood fitness and top-down control in terms of functional connectivity among brain regions, by evaluating phase-locking values (PLVs), which is a measure of frequency-specific phase synchrony between electroencephalographic signals during a visual search task. Lower-fit and higher-fit children performed a visual search task that included feature search and conjunction search conditions. The conjunction <b>search</b> <b>condition</b> required greater top-down control to reduce interference from task-irrelevant distractors that shared a basic feature with the target. Results indicated that higher-fit children exhibited higher response accuracy relative to lower-fit children across search conditions. The results of PLVs showed that higher-fit children had greater functional connectivity for the conjunction relative to the feature <b>search</b> <b>condition,</b> whereas lower-fit children showed no difference in functional connectivity between search conditions. Furthermore, PLVs showed different time courses between groups; that is, higher-fit children sustained upregulation of top-down control throughout the task period, whereas lower-fit children transiently upregulated top-down control after stimulus onset and could not sustain the upregulation. These findings suggest that higher levels of childhood aerobic fitness is related to brain functional connectivity involved in the sustained upregulation of top-down control...|$|E
