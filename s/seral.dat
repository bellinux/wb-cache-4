5|$|The clay-rich Willamette Valley {{soils are}} {{hard in the}} dry season, and the gopher's protuberant incisors are well adapted to these conditions. Adequate soil {{drainage}} and suitable plant food are essential components of the gopher's ideal habitat. Not typically found in wetland areas (where its tunnels would flood), the species is found in <b>seral</b> communities of grasses and shrubs. They are also established in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley, including fields of alfalfa, wheat and oats. The species has also been found in areas of ecological disturbance with similar terrain features.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, ecology transitioned {{from a more}} {{descriptive}} form of natural history to a more analytical form of scientific natural history. Frederic Clements published the first American ecology book in 1905, presenting the idea of plant communities as a superorganism. This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of <b>seral</b> development that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by Henry Gleason, who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates {{to the development of}} community associations.|$|E
25|$|The low {{mountains}} of the ecoregion {{are covered by}} highly productive, rain-drenched evergreen forests that are home to the three tallest conifer species in the world: Coast redwood, Coast Douglas-fir, and Sitka spruce. Historically, Sitka spruce forests dominated the fog-shrouded coast, while a mosaic of western redcedar, western hemlock, and <b>seral</b> Douglas-fir blanketed the inland areas. Today, Douglas-fir plantations are prevalent on the intensively logged and managed landscape. Lithology influences land management strategies; slopes underlain by sedimentary rock {{are more susceptible to}} failure following clearcutting and road building than those underlain by volcanic rock.|$|E
25|$|After {{they were}} {{released}} on Kapiti Island, they were also moved to Red Mercury Island, Hen Island, Tiritiri Matangi Island, and Long Island in the Queen Charlotte Sound. In 2000, about 20 little spotted kiwis were released into Karori Wildlife Sanctuary. This {{was the first time}} since about 1900 that little spotted kiwis could be found on the mainland of New Zealand. Studies on Kapiti Island show that they prefer flax, <b>seral,</b> and older forest habitats. Lower numbers are found in rough grassland and scrub, indicating that either they prefer other habitats or they simply need a larger territory to support themselves in these areas.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{succession}} {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} successive occupation of a site by different plant communities. In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the <b>seral</b> stages and finally by a climax community typical of the climatic zone. Robert Scott Troup suggested that succession began in the newly accreted land created by fresh deposits of eroded soil. The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is Sonneratia, followed by Avicennia and Nypa. As the ground is elevated {{as a result of}} soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is Excoecaria. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, Heritiera fomes begins to appear.|$|E
25|$|Mild to {{moderate}} fires burn {{in the forest}} understory, removing small trees and herbaceous groundcover. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns {{of the trees and}} kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates complex early <b>seral</b> forest habitat, or snag forest with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil. Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as climate and topography {{play an important role in}} determining fire severity and fire extent. Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.|$|E
25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980). <b>Seral</b> species {{giving way to}} white spruce include paper birch, aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the ecology}} of the {{watershed}} has been affected by wildfires and forestry, and is considered to be in a <b>seral</b> phase. [...] The river travels through several different vegetation zones. [...] In its upper reaches, the Adams flows through the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone. [...] These forests are similar to the coastal forests of British Columbia and contain old-growth trees up to 1000 years in age. [...] Old-growth stands along the river also contain rare species of lichen, likely isolated by the last Ice Age. [...] The floodplain of the Upper Adams contains wetland species of deciduous trees such as black cottonwood as well as a dense layer of shrubs including black twinberry, red-osier dogwood, and thimbleberry. [...] The lower river is dominated by the drier Interior Douglas Fir vegetation zone. [...] Other conifer species present are Ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, and alpine fir. The area around the river mouth has been altered by human activities such as farming and livestock grazing.|$|E
2500|$|Sub-Boreal (Hemiboreal) Spruce and Pine-Spruce Zones: [...] The central {{interior}} of the province, consisting of the rolling lake-studded terrain of the Cariboo — the Fraser and Nechako Plateaus — is characterised by severe, snowy winters and warm, short summers. [...] This is a transitional zone between southern and northern biomes. <b>Seral</b> species include Lodgepole Pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and trembling aspen; mature species include White and Engelmann Spruce, and Subalpine Fir. The moderately dense forests are interrupted in places by ponds and muskeg. The generally flat plateaus make this an active area for logging.|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{situation}} {{is found in}} the lower Gangetic Plain, which includes the lower Brahmaputra River. The lower plains contain more open forests, which tend to be dominated by Bombax ceiba in association with Albizzia procera, Duabanga grandiflora, and Sterculia vilosa. There are early <b>seral</b> forest communities that would eventually become dominated by the climax species sal (Shorea robusta), if forest succession was allowed to proceed. In most places forests fail to reach climax conditions due to human causes. The forests of the lower Gangetic Plain, despite thousands of years of human settlement, remained largely intact until the early 20th century. Today only about 3% of the ecoregion is under natural forest and only one large block, south of Varanasi, remains. There are over forty protected areas in the ecoregion, but over half of these are less than [...] The fauna of the lower Gangetic Plain is similar to the upper plains, {{with the addition of a}} number of other species such as the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) and the large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha).|$|E
2500|$|The Subalpine-Alpine Zone {{ecoregion}} includes high elevation, glaciated mountains with arêtes, cirques, and tarns. High gradient streams have {{boulder and}} cobble substrates. Elevation varies from 6,500to9,900feet (1,981to3,018m). The region begins where the forest cover becomes broken by alpine meadows and continues through alpine meadowland {{to include the}} exposed rock, permanent snowfields, and glacial ice of the highest mountain peaks. Very open forests of subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and whitebark pine tolerate the cold soils, deep snowpack, and extremely short growing season near timberline. Dry south-facing slopes support mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue. At the treeline, krummholz is found. Wet meadows support heather and Parry’s rush. Historically, green fescue and sedges covered high alpine meadows and ridges, particularly in the Wallowas; but, following intense sheep grazing {{in the early twentieth}} century, many alpine plant associations reverted to <b>seral</b> or exotic species on rocky subsoil. The region covers [...] Oregon, {{in the heart of the}} Eagle Cap and Strawberry Mountain Wildernesses, and [...] in Idaho, in the Payette National Forest.|$|E

50|$|Complex early <b>seral</b> {{forests are}} {{structurally}} more complex, contain more large trees and snags, {{and have more}} diverse understories, more functional ecosystem processes, and more diverse gene pools than areas of timber harvest.

50|$|A <b>seral</b> {{community}} (or sere) is {{an intermediate}} stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community.

50|$|Complex early <b>seral</b> forests, or snag forests, are {{ecosystems}} that occupy potentially forested sites after a stand-replacement disturbance {{and before}} re-establishment of a closed forest canopy. They are generated by natural disturbances such as wildfire or insect outbreaks that reset ecological succession processes and follow a pathway that {{is influenced by}} biological legacies (e.g., large live trees and snags, downed logs, seed banks, resprout tissue, fungi, and other live and dead biomass) that were not removed during the initial disturbance. Complex early <b>seral</b> forests develop with rich biodiversity because the remaining biomass provides resources to many life forms and because of habitat heterogeneity provided by the disturbances that generated them. In this and other ways, complex early <b>seral</b> forests differ from simplified early successional forests created by logging. Complex early <b>seral</b> forest habitat is threatened from fire suppression, thinning, and post-fire or post-insect outbreak logging.|$|E

5000|$|Bird {{and small}} mammal {{communities}} that utilize complex early <b>seral</b> forests forage on the abundant insects and increased abundance of {{seeds in the}} post-fire flora. These species, in turn, support an increase in raptors. Bird species such as the Black-backed Woodpecker, Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina), and Mountain Quail (Oreortyx pictus) achieve highest abundances in complex early <b>seral</b> forests. Bats (Myotis, Idionycteris, Lasionycteris, and Eptesicus) also use complex early <b>seral</b> forests because of greater insect prey as well as suitable roosts. Stand-replacing fires stimulate an increased flow of aquatic prey to terrestrial habitats, driving increases in riparian consumers. The trees killed by fire are beneficial to the ecological integrity of stream communities because they are a main source of large woody debris inputs. There is also reproduction by some forest fungi species that are restricted to burns (e.g., morels, Morchella spp.) and the dead wood provides substrate for fungal growth that supports many arthropod species, including unique fire-following native beetles. [...] Beetles, in general, colonize fire-killed trees in complex early <b>seral</b> forests and their abundant larvae support species like Black-backed Woodpeckers ...|$|E
