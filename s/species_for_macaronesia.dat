40|$|Abstract The Azorean endemic {{gymnosperm}} Juniperus brevifolia (Seub.) Antoine is a {{top priority}} <b>species</b> <b>for</b> conservation in <b>Macaronesia,</b> based on its ecological significance in natural plant communities. To evaluate genetic variability and differentiation among J. brevifolia populations from the Azorean archipelago, we studied 15 ISSR and 15 RAPD markers in 178 individuals from 18 populations. The average number of polymorphic bands per population was 65 for both ISSR and RAPD. The majority of genetic variability was found within populations and among populations within islands, and this partitioning of variability was confirmed by AMOVA. The large majority of population pairwise FST values were above 0. 3 and below 0. 6. The degree of population genetic differentiation in J. brevifolia was relatively high compared with other species, including Juniperus spp. The geneti...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 70 benthic marine algal taxa was {{identified}} from collections made around Sakurajima Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Eighteen species belonging to phylum Chlorophyta, 15 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> Phaeophyta, 34 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> Rhodophyta, 1 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> Cyanophyta and 2 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> sea-grass were reported from collections of 1986. More common genera were Codium, Sargassum, Gelidium and Gracilaria. Fauchea leptophylla SEGAWA (Rhodymeniaceae, Rhodophyta) was a newly reported species from {{southern part of}} Japan. This paper dealt with the distribution, seasonal succession and reproductive period of benthic marine algae found in Sakurajima Island. 1986 年に鹿児島県桜島の海藻相調査を行ない,海産顕花植物 2 種,藍藻 1 種,緑藻 18 種,褐藻 15 種,紅藻 34 種の合計 70 種(sp. 2 種を含む) を明らかにした。本海域での優占種は,緑藻ミル属,褐藻ホンダワラ属,紅藻マクサ属およびオゴノリ属であった。また紅藻トゲナシマダラFauchea leptophylla SEGAWA (Rhodymeniaceae) の生育が本海域で新たに確認された。さらに桜島に出現した藻類各種の成熟時期をも明らかにしたのでその結果を報告した...|$|R

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to explore {{traditional}} medicinal knowledge of plant materials belonging to various genera of the Euphorbiaceae, readily available in Vidharbha region of Maharasthtra state. Ethnobotanical information were gathered through several visits, group discussions and cross checked with local medicine men. The study identified 7 species to cure skin diseases (such as itches, scabies); 5 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> antiseptic (including antibacterial); 4 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> diarrhoea; 3 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> dysentery, urinary infections, snake-bite and inflammations; 2 <b>species</b> <b>for</b> bone fracture/ dislocation, hair related problems, warts, fish poisons, night blindness, wounds/cuts/ burns, rheumatism, diabetes, jaundice, vomiting and insecticide; 1 species as laxative, viral fever and arthritis.
