Heat is concentrated at the projections, which permits the welding of heavier sections or the closer <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds.</b> The projections can also serve as a means of positioning the workpieces. Projection welding is often used to weld studs, nuts, and other screw machine parts to metal plate. It is also frequently used to join crossed wires and bars. This is another high-production process, and multiple projection welds can be arranged by suitable designing and jigging.|$|E

Weld bonding is used for improvement of stiffness, durability,strength, crash performance and weight reduction of car body structures. This thesis work focus {{on the effect of}} adhesive in crash performance for High Strength Steel (HSS) and Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS). The influence of epoxy-based and rubber-based adhesives was investigated in hat-lid beams. The beams were tested in different sheet thicknesses (1, 5 mm or 1, 0 mm), spot weld spacing (80 mm or 40 mm), steel grades (Usibor or DP 600) and joining methods (spot welding or weld bonding). In the case <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> bonded beams, the joints were bonded with either epoxy- based or rubber-based adhesive. The beams without adhesive were used as reference. The beams were tested in 4 -point bending in computer simulations and in experimental tests. The weld bonded beams were compared with the resistance spot welded beams, in order to distinguish which combination was able to reduce the deformation. The possibility to increase spot <b>weld</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> bonded beams for different thicknesses was also studied.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate how the keyhole responds to {{a decrease in the}} ambient pressure using a coaxial observation method in the laser <b>welding</b> <b>of</b> zinc-coated steel sheets. To understand the effect of zinc coating on keyhole dynamics, both zinc-coated and uncoated DP 590 steel sheets were studied using a 2 kW multi-mode fiber laser in a zero-gap lap-weld configuration. Two energy density conditions (1830 W, 12. 5 mm/s and 1230 W, 21. 2 mm/s) and four ambient pressures (101. 3, 10, 1 and 0. 1 kPa) were considered systematically. For these conditions, time-averaged 3 -D keyhole shapes were reconstructed by analyzing top and bottom surface video images. This study showed that zinc evaporation was much more intensified than the evaporation of steel at subatmospheric pressures, which made the keyhole highly fluctuating and elongated in the welding direction for the zinc-coated steel. Also, the bottom aperture opening time increased as the ambient pressure was decreased due to the enhanced effect of evaporation, which led to less energy absorption and smaller melt pools. The weld quality became poorer as the <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> chevrons were wider and more erratic, and more fumes with less light emission were observed at reduced ambient pressures...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The <b>weld</b> joint <b>of</b> large {{thin-wall}} {{metal parts}} which deforms in manufacturing and clamping processes {{is very difficult}} to manufacture for its shape is different from the initial model; thus, the <b>space</b> normals <b>of</b> the part surface are uncertain. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an effective method is presented to calculate cutter location points and to estimate the space normals by measuring some sparse discrete points <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> joint. First, a contact-type probe fixed in the end <b>of</b> friction stir <b>welding</b> (FSW) robot is used to measure a series of discrete points on the weld joint. Then, a space curve can be got by fitting the series of points with a quintic spline. Second, a least square plane (LSP) of the measured points is obtained by the least square method. Then, normal vectors of the plane curve, which is the projection <b>of</b> the <b>space</b> curve on the LSP, are used to estimate the <b>space</b> normals <b>of</b> the <b>weld</b> joint curve. After path planning, a post-processing method combing with FSW craft is elaborated. Findings - Simulation and real experiment demonstrate that the proposed strategy, which obtains cutter locations <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> and normals without measuring the entire surface, is feasible and effective for the FSW of large thin-walled complex surface parts. Originality/value - This paper presents a novel method which makes it possible to accurately weld the large thin-wall complex surface part by the FSW robot. The proposed method might be applied to any multi-axes FSW robot similar to the robot studied in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{friction}} stir weld (FSW) on the buckling behavior of an integrally stiffened panel (ISP) structure was investigated. For proper {{consideration of the}} buckling modes, the Riks method based on geometric imperfection was introduced. The Ramberg-Osgood deformation plasticity model {{was used for the}} elasto-plastic material behavior. A basic buckling benchmark test with a simple square plate was performed to verify the effect of the element type, Ramberg-Osgood model and the Riks method on the critical buckling load. Buckling analyses with two different sectional shapes were conducted corresponding to 400 and 600 kN buckling loads. After confirming that the predicted results without FSW were in excellent agreement with known analytical solutions, finite element (FE) analyses for 2 - and 3 -stiffener ISP sections joined by FSW were performed. The simulated results with and without FSW were compared to each other. The presence <b>of</b> the <b>weld</b> reduced the maximum buckling load from 3 % to 10 % depending on the sectional shape {{as a result of the}} reduction in material strength in the weld zone. The reduction in buckling load was greater for the 2 -stiffener ISP section than for the 3 -stiffener ISP configuration, due to the closer <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>welds.</b> For both ISP configurations, the percentage decrease in the buckling load for the higher load case (600 kN) was less than that for the lower load case (400 kN) ...|$|R
