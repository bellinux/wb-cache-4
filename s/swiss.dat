5|$|A {{system of}} single weights and {{measures}} was introduced and in 1850 the <b>Swiss</b> franc became the <b>Swiss</b> single currency. Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, {{with the exception of}} serving the Vatican, though the <b>Swiss</b> were still obliged to serve Francis II of the Two Sicilies with <b>Swiss</b> Guards present at the Siege of Gaeta in 1860, marking the end of foreign service.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the figures}} from 2012 show that 34.7% of the {{permanent}} resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third of this population (853,000) held <b>Swiss</b> citizenship. Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants (first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised <b>Swiss</b> citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised <b>Swiss</b> citizens).|$|E
5|$|After the war, the <b>Swiss</b> {{government}} exported credits {{through the}} charitable fund {{known as the}} Schweizerspende and also donated to the Marshall Plan to help Europe's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefited the <b>Swiss</b> economy.|$|E
5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the <b>Swiss</b> peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the <b>Swiss</b> exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many <b>Swiss</b> peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having a}} main {{military}} goal of deterrence, strategists envisioned the <b>Swiss</b> nuclear strike capability {{as part of}} a preemptive war against the Soviets. The <b>Swiss</b> Air Force Mirage III jet {{would have been able to}} carry nuclear bombs as far as Moscow. They also suggested the weapons could be used on <b>Swiss</b> soil against a possible invading force.|$|E

5|$|In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established <b>Swiss</b> {{independence}} and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise <b>Swiss</b> neutrality. <b>Swiss</b> troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments.|$|E
5|$|In 1995the <b>Swiss</b> {{abandoned}} traditional {{doctrine and}} implemented a defensive plan that made control of <b>Swiss</b> airspace its highest and main priority. Modernization of the <b>Swiss</b> Air Force {{to achieve this}} mission was subject to popular referenda challenging its cost and practice.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the <b>Swiss</b> Football Association {{appointed}} long-time <b>Swiss</b> resident Schumacher as the country's {{ambassador for}} the 2008 European football championship.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, {{the last}} <b>Swiss</b> airman died in combat, {{shot down by}} an American P-51 Mustang while escorting a {{crippled}} U.S. B-17 Flying Fortress to the Dübendorf airfield. During the entire war, 6,501Allied and Axis aircraft violated <b>Swiss</b> airspace, 198of which aircraft landed on <b>Swiss</b> soil and were interned, and 56of which crashed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s green {{became the}} color of the third biggest <b>Swiss</b> Federal Council {{political}} party, the <b>Swiss</b> People's Party SVP. The ideology is <b>Swiss</b> nationalism, national conservatism, right-wing populism, economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, euroscepticism. The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.|$|E
5|$|In this time, the <b>Swiss</b> Air Force {{also tested}} a few from the <b>Swiss</b> industry-developed Ground to Air Defence Systems but didn't {{introduce}} {{any of them}} into service (see: 35 mm anti aircraft tank B22L, RSD 58 and RSE Kriens (Missile)). Also a Mobile Ground to Air Defence System based on the <b>Swiss</b> wheeled APC Mowag Shark equipped with the French Crotale (missile) was not bought for the <b>Swiss</b> Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Learning one of {{the other}} {{national}} languages at school is compulsory for all <b>Swiss</b> pupils, so many <b>Swiss</b> are supposed to be at least bilingual, especially those belonging to linguistic minority groups.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{conflict}} was the ancient distrust, rivalry, and hostility between the Old <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which {{had risen to}} the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, {{the members of the}} <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The <b>Swiss</b> had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a far-reaching autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, even more so as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the <b>Swiss.</b> Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the <b>Swiss</b> on several occasions; and the <b>Swiss</b> had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes who had tried to regain their former territories.|$|E

5|$|<b>Swiss</b> International Air Lines (<b>Swiss)</b> {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} join Oneworld in September 2003, after signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on 23 September 2003 to establish a wide-ranging commercial agreement with British Airways. However, <b>Swiss</b> later decided not to proceed with key elements of its agreement with British Airways and was therefore released from its commitment to join Oneworld. <b>Swiss</b> was later taken over by Lufthansa in 2005 and joined Star Alliance in 2006.|$|E
5|$|<b>Swiss</b> {{aircraft}} also intercepted U.S. aircraft {{who were}} off-course, or whose crews preferred asylum in <b>Swiss</b> internment camps over German or Italian POW camps; {{they were then}} forced to land on <b>Swiss</b> airstrips. When the bombers did not cooperate or even fired at the <b>Swiss</b> (who were using Axis-type interceptors), they were shot down.|$|E
5|$|<b>Swiss</b> {{military}} aviation {{began in}} 1900with {{the creation of}} an observation balloon force. <b>Swiss</b> balloonists were first engaged in combat on 7October 1918, near the end of World War I, when a German airplane accidentally attacked a <b>Swiss</b> observation balloon stationed close to the German border and killed the observer, Lieutenant Werner Flury. The balloon force was eventually disestablished in 1938when developments in aviation made it obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland is home {{to several}} large {{multinational}} corporations. The largest <b>Swiss</b> companies by revenue are Glencore, Gunvor, Nestlé, Novartis, Hoffmann-La Roche, ABB, Mercuria Energy Group and Adecco. Also, notable are UBS AG, Zurich Financial Services, Credit Suisse, Barry Callebaut, <b>Swiss</b> Re, Tetra Pak, The Swatch Group and <b>Swiss</b> International Air Lines. Switzerland is ranked as {{having one of the}} most powerful economies in the world.|$|E

5|$|The first {{purpose-built}} {{military aircraft}} in the <b>Swiss</b> air force was a Fokker D.II seized after a German pilot made a forced landing in foul weather near Bettlach on 13 October 1916. In June 1917, five Nieuport 23 C.1 fighter planes were acquired from France. <b>Swiss</b> industry manufactured more than 100 Häfeli DH-3 observation aircraft, but efforts to build a <b>Swiss</b> fighter (the Häfeli DH-4) were halted in 1918 because of the prototypes' poor performance. By {{the end of the}} war, the <b>Swiss</b> air force had only 62 pilots and 68 aircraft of nine different makes, almost all of which were suitable only for observation missions. Its wartime budget of CHF 15 million amounted to just 1.25% of <b>Swiss</b> military expenditures.|$|E
5|$|This {{resulted}} in a massive strengthening of the <b>Swiss</b> franc against the Euro, US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and several other currencies, {{as well as a}} reduction in <b>Swiss</b> franc interest rates.|$|E
5|$|UBS also {{entered the}} life {{insurance}} business in 1993 establishing UBS Life. UBS formed {{a joint venture}} with <b>Swiss</b> Life in 1995, known as UBS <b>Swiss</b> Life. UBS took a 25% ownership position in <b>Swiss</b> Life in exchange for a 50% share in the joint venture.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The <b>Swiss</b> refused to fight {{alongside}} the French {{in the name of}} the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading <b>Swiss</b> politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored <b>Swiss</b> autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons. Henceforth, much of <b>Swiss</b> politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.|$|E
5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and intermittently thereafter, but annual training abroad for the <b>Swiss</b> Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use of <b>Swiss</b> air space for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The <b>Swiss</b> modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, particularly among NATO European members, to meet their training needs.|$|E
5|$|After a US$2.56 billion {{lawsuit was}} filed against UBS and other <b>Swiss</b> banks {{on behalf of}} the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, a {{settlement}} was reached between UBS and other <b>Swiss</b> banks that had laundered Nazi assets totaling US $1.25 billion in August 1998.|$|E
5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the Alsace and further down along the Rhine. But {{the events of the}} war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the <b>Swiss</b> recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the <b>Swiss</b> cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
5|$|But the Three Leagues {{had already}} called upon the <b>Swiss</b> {{for help and}} troops from Uri had already arrived in Chur. Upon {{learning}} about the truce, they withdrew, but met a small troop of Habsburg soldiers {{on their way back}} home. When those engaged in the usual insults on the <b>Swiss,</b> the latter crossed the Rhine and killed the scoffers. In retaliation, Habsburg troops sacked the village of Maienfeld on February 7 and called the Swabian League for help. Only five days later, <b>Swiss</b> troops from several cantons had been assembled and reconquered the village and moved towards Lake Constance, pillaging and plundering along the way. On February 20, they again met a Habsburg army, which they defeated in the battle of Hard on the shores of Lake Constance near the estuary of the Rhine, and at about the same time, other <b>Swiss</b> troops invaded the Hegau region between Schaffhausen and Constance. On both sites, the <b>Swiss</b> retreated after a few days.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} months of the war, airmen and {{anti-aircraft}} soldiers saw only sporadic combat; it was on 10May 1940, when Germany commenced the drive into the west, that the <b>Swiss</b> army as a whole was mobilized a second time. At the onset of the campaign, German military aircraft first violated <b>Swiss</b> airspace.|$|E
5|$|Effective on 15 January 2015, the <b>Swiss</b> National Bank (SNB) {{discontinued}} {{the minimum}} targeted exchange {{rate for the}} <b>Swiss</b> franc versus the euro of 1.20 CHF/EUR, set forth in September 2011, and it also moved the target range for three-month LIBOR to between negative 1.25% and negative 0.25% (previously negative 0.75% to positive 0.25%).|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{with the}} option of nuclear weapons {{discarded}} {{and the likelihood of}} operations beyond the <b>Swiss</b> border severely restricted, the Federal Military Department (EMD) decided that the next generation of aircraft acquired by the <b>Swiss</b> Air Force would be for close air support. While resurrection of the P-16 was discussed in the <b>Swiss</b> press (FFA had continued theoretical development the aircraft at its own expense, with its final variant, the AR-7, to be equipped with a Rolls-Royce RB168-25 engine), the choice narrowed to the Milan (a joint Swiss-French prototype variant of the Mirage III) and the American A-7G Corsair II, each of which had strong advocates within the <b>Swiss</b> Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, the Pakistan {{government}} {{in response to}} the court orders, finally wrote to the <b>Swiss</b> authorities seeking to reopen the corruption cases against Zardari. The <b>Swiss</b> government responded by saying that the corruption cases being time barred cannot be reopened.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007 Lokvenc {{scored the}} only goal in Salzburg's 1–0 UEFA Cup first round win against AEK Athens This {{was not enough}} for his team to advance, having lost 3–0 in {{the first leg of}} their two-legged tie. Lokvenc {{featured}} less for Salzburg in the 2007–08 season, prompting him to join <b>Swiss</b> Super League team Basel on loan in February 2008 {{for the remainder of the}} season. He scored in Basel's 1–0 semi-final <b>Swiss</b> Cup victory against Thun. The club went on to win the 2008 league championship title and the 2008 <b>Swiss</b> Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been {{in conflict with the}} <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the <b>Swiss</b> had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the <b>Swiss</b> in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the <b>Swiss,</b> and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the <b>Swiss</b> and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.|$|E
