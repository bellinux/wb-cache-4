First, the Jacobsen catalyst N,N'-bis(3, 5 -di-tert-butylsalicylidene) - 1, 2 -cyclohexanediaminomanganese (III) chloride is covalently immobilized and highly dispersed on mesoporous phenolic resins through a direct and simple procedure.

In a second example, the mesoporous phenolic resins were functionalized with sulphonic acid groups and acted as novel support for the non-covalent immobilization of a L-phenylalanine derived chiral diamine organocatalyst for asymmetric aldol reactions.

40|$|When {{producing}} mechanical pulps the fibre separation {{will take}} place in the weakest part of the wood matrix. A prerequisite to swelling in wood and mechanical pulps is that the wood matrix is softened. The position of where the weakest part of the wood matrix is situated can to a large extent be controlled by adjustment of the swelling and softening properties of each of the wood polymers (lignin, hemicelluloses and cellulose). Most probably the efficiency of the external and internal fibrillation of the fibre walls is also influenced by how the swelling and softening properties are controlled. The combination of position of fibre-fibre separation together with the efficiency of the external and internal fibrillation will to a large extent determine the energy demand to produce mechanical pulps. Refining of wood chips with different state of softening and swelling will give rise to fibres with different optical and physical properties. The most important parameters that influence the wood matrix and wood fibres’ ability to swell are temperature, pH, ionic form of and the amount of charged groups in the hemicelluloses and lignin of the cell walls. In order to improve the level of knowledge on how to influence the degree of wood matrix and fibre wall swelling of mechanical pulps we have undertaken to study the swelling properties of wood and fibres produced by means of different mechanical pulping processes. It was found that pulps not containing <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>groups</b> need to be heated above the softening temperature of lignin {{in order to be able}} to swell to their full capacity. Introduction of <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>groups</b> also opens up the rigid structure of lignin which lowers the softening temperature and increases the swelling potential even at lower temperatures. The effect of valence of the counter ion was also shown to be more pronounced after adding more carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>groups</b> to a pulp. Depending on the number and type of anionic <b>acid</b> <b>groups</b> in the fibres, high-yield pulps will have different combinations of properties in different ionic conditions.

Mechanical pulp fibres (TMP) were treated with hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium sulphite during conditions resembling those used in chemimechanical and bleaching processes commonly used in the industry. In conventional chemimechanical processes sulphite treatment is used before refining while peroxide treatment can be utilized both before and after refining. In this study we did however also use sulphite after peroxide treatment. When subjecting sodium sulphite treated pulps to a subsequent hydrogen peroxide step, all pulps show a decrease in <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>groups,</b> which could be owed to dissolution of highly charged lignin. Pulps treated with a high hydrogen peroxide charge (4 %), showed a loss in carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>groups</b> during subsequent treatment with sodium sulphite. This loss is probably due to dissolution of highly charged fibre material such as demethylated pectins. Both increased degree of sulphonation and carboxylation of the lignin reduces the softening temperature by means of reducing the degree of cross-linking in the lignin matrix. This softening probably improves the compressibility of the fibre pads in the sample holders of the WRV centrifuge, which would counteract an otherwise expected increasing WRV-value due to increased swelling potential. This makes it difficult to see clear trends in WRV as a function of increase in degree of sulphonation and carboxylation. When changing counter ion form from proton or calcium form to sodium form there is however always a clear increase in WRV in the range from 20 to 30 %.

By synthetically organising the sequence-distribution so that it consists of fully defined ionic segments (containing singlets, doublets or quadruplets of <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>groups)</b> alternating strictly with equally well-defined nonionic spacer segments, {{a new class of}} polymers which may be described as microblock ionomers has been developed. These materials exhibit very different properties and morphologies from analogous randomly substituted systems. Progressively extending the nonionic spacer length in the repeat unit (maintaining a constant equivalent weight by increasing the degree of sulphonation. of the ionic segment) leads to an increasing degree of nanophase separation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains in these materials. Membranes cast from ionomers with the more highly phase-separated morphologies show significantly higher onset temperatures for uncontrolled swelling in water. This new type of ionomer design has enabled the fabrication of swelling-resistant hydrocarbon membranes, suitable for fuel cell operation, with very much higher ion exchange capacities (> 2 meq g(- 1)) than those previously reported in the literature. When tested in a fuel cell at high temperature (120 degrees C) and low relative humidity (35 % RH), the best microblock membrane matched the performance of Nafion 112.

The {{development of these}} power sources involves finding and characterising materials that are well suited r the application. The materials investigated in this thesis are the perfluorosulphonic ionomer NafionTM (DuPont) and metal oxides incorporated into the membrane form of this material.

Crystallinity in cast Nafion films can be introduced by ion beam exposure or aging.

The method of precipitation used most often to remove metals from waste water consists of precipitating them in the form of hydroxides. The usual procedure involves the addition of chemicals such as lime (CaO or Ca(OH) 2), Mg(OH) 2, NaHCO 3, Na 2 CO 3, (NH 4) 2 CO 3, NaOH or NH 4 OH. The precipitation of metals by carbonates or sulphides is an effective alternative to hydroxide precipitation. The use of carbonates allows the precipitation of metals to occur at pH values lower than those necessary with the hydroxides. Moreover, the precipitates thus formed are denser and have better characteristics of solid-liquid separation. Precipitation by sulphides is normally carried out with reagents such as: Na 2 S, NaHS, H 2 S or FeS. In acidic media, the lower solubility of metal sulphides (Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Mn, Zn, etc.), makes it possible to reach concentrations lower than those obtained by precipitation as hydroxides. Coprecipitation with aluminum and iron salts is also an effective means for the removal of metals from effluents. Adsorption methods are also widely applied and examined for this purpose. However, in most cases the use of adsorbents requires an effluent neutralization step. Indeed, the neutralization of acid effluents must take place to allow their disposal in sewerage systems. A wide variety of adsorbents can be employed, both organic and inorganic: aluminum or iron oxides, sand, activated carbon, mixtures of coal and pyrite, iron particles, gravel or crushed brick, cement, etc. Studies have demonstrated the possibility of eliminating metals by adsorption on vegetable matter: peat moss, sawdust and wood bark, etc. Chitin and chitosan, two natural polymers that are abundant in the cell walls of fungi and shellfish, also have excellent properties of metal fixation. The utilization of different agricultural by-products (peanut skins, coconuts, corn cobs, onions skins, tea leaves, coffee powder, canola meal, etc.) for metal adsorption has also been proposed. Biosorption has been intensively studied in recent years as an economical treatment for metal recovery from dilute industrial effluents. Biosorption implies the use of live or dead biomass and/or their derivatives, which adsorb the metal ions with the ligands or functional groups located on the external surface of the microbial cells. Capacities for metal adsorption on various types of biomass (bacteria, yeasts, fungi, marine and freshwater algae) have been evaluated. The microorganisms used for the metal adsorption step must usually be immobilized in a matrix or in an easily recoverable support. The immobilizing agents or matrices most usually employed are alginate, polyacrylamine, polysulphone, silica gel, cellulose and glutaraldehyde. Electrowinning is a well-established technology that is widely employed in the mining and metallurgical industries (heap leaching, acid mine drainage, etc.), in metal transformation industries (wastes from plating and metal finishing), and in the electronics and electrical industries for the removal and/or the recovery of metals in solution. Many metals (Ag, Au, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn) present in the effluents can be recovered by electrodeposition using insoluble anodes. Electrocoagulation is another electrochemical approach, which uses an electrical current to remove several metals in solution. In fact, the electrocoagulation systems can be effective in removing suspended solids, dissolved metals, tannins and dyes. The contaminants present in waste water are maintained in solution by electrical charges. When these ions and the other charged particles are neutralized with ions of opposite electric charge, provided by a electrocoagulation system, they become destabilized and precipitate in a form that is usually very stable. Cementation is a type of precipitation method implying an electrochemical mechanism. In this process, a metal having a higher oxidation potential passes into solution (e. g., oxidation of metallic iron, Fe(0), to ferrous iron, Fe(II)) to replace a metal having a lower oxidation potential. Copper is the metal most frequently separated by cementation. However, the noble metals (Ag, Au and Pd), as well as As, Cd, Ga, Pb, Sb and Sn, can also be recovered in this manner. Reverse osmosis and electrodialysis are two processes using semipermeable membranes applicable to the recovery of metal ions. In electrodialysis, selective membranes (alternation of cation and anion membranes) fit between the electrodes in electrolytic cells. A continuous electrical current and the associated ion migrations, allow the recovery of metals. The techniques of membrane separation are very efficient for the treatment of dilute waste waters. The metallurgical industry has used solvent extraction for many years for a broad range of separations. This technique is employed today for the removal of soluble metals (Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Mo, U, V, Zn, etc.) from waste water. Separation is carried out in contact with an immiscible organic phase to form salts or complex compounds, which give a favorable solubility distribution between the aqueous and organic phases. Various types of reagents can be used for the extraction: carboxylic acids, aliphatic or aromatic amines, amino acids, alkyl phosphates, phenolic compounds. The non-selective removal of metal contaminants in aqueous solutions can be obtained with a whole range of organic reagents. Promising new reagents have been proposed recently for the selective extraction of metals, such as Cd, Co, Cr and Zn. Ion exchangers are insoluble substances having in their molecular structure acidic or basic groups able to exchange, without modification of their physical structure, the positive or negative ions fixed at these groups. The first ion exchangers used were natural substances containing aluminosilicates (zeolites, clays, etc). Nowadays, the most-used ion exchangers are mainly organic in nature (resins). For the extraction of metals, the removal of cations in solution is usually done with the <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>group</b> (-SO 3 - H+) of a polystyrene resin, or, with a chelating resin containing iminodiacetate functional groups. Ion exchange has recently received considerable attention for the separation and concentration of metals from waste water. These developments are especially applicable to the plating and metal transformation industries, for the removal of Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, Ni, Fe and Zn. The more sophisticated processes, such as electrowinning, solvent extraction, membrane separations and ion exchange, although frequently used in metallurgical processes, are less popular for wastewater treatment than are precipitation methods. Finally, recycling and optimal management of effluents constitutes an approach more and more widely applied by industries to satisfy new environmental regulations and laws...|$|E

The MEA durability {{in a real}} working fuel cell (FC) is closely linked to specific operating conditions such as temperature, gas humidity, load dynamics, etc. This often results in both chemical and mechanical degradation of the ion-conducting membrane and subsequent operation failure of the FC. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used to identify and distinguish between two different degradation processes for a 1, 500 h in situ aged FC membrane. The primary process {{is due to the}} loss of proton conducting <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> end <b>groups</b> over the entire membrane. The secondary process is a degradation of the fluorinated backbone concentrated to the cathode interface; making possible the collapse of carbon into the resulting voids of the membrane.

By varying the "barrier" layer of PMMA {{it has been}} confirmed that different effective penetration depths into the PVOH are achieved, in very good agreement with the calculated electric field {{as a function of}} distance away from the substrate surface. These results show that the two-layered model system can be successfully employed to provide a semi-quantitative depth profile of the laminate. Following the FTIR-ATR study on polymer/polymer interface we have demonstrated how the evanescent field absorption from a IR beam {{can also be used to}} monitor in situ the molecular interaction at polymer/liquid interfaces. The chosen system was a series of sulphonated polyethersulphones (SPES) and water. The v(_s) (SO(_ 3)) and V(_a) (SO(_ 3)) vibrational modes were monitored as the degree of hydration was varied. It has been found that the v(_ 3) (SO(_ 3)) mode increases with hydration suggesting that, with hydration the <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>groups</b> of SPES are dissociated into SO(_ 3) ions. It has been found that changes also occur in the benzene ring vibrational band that are dependent on the degree of hydration. Spectral subtraction has been employed to highlight changes in the V(_a) (SO(_ 3)) mode which were not readily observed in the raw spectra due to overlapping bands. The particular behaviour of V(OH) vibrational mode of water molecules has also been analysed. The main conclusion in this case was that the average hydrogen bond strength of the sorbed water is considerable lower than that in pure water. This would favour an efficient flux of water through the membrane. A method based on monitoring the time dependent change in the v(OH) mode of water has been developed to calculate the diffusion of water on SPES membranes. After reaching a steady state, the normalised absorbance plot versus time has been used for numerical evaluation. Two models have been developed, one for Fickian diffusion and another for the dual sorption mode. The experimental results show a much better agreement for the second model. The diffusion coefficient values have been calculated for different samples and interesting variations of the diffusion coefficient as a function of sulphonation level, solvent and film thickness have been analysed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Lignosulphonates are by‐products {{from the}} {{sulphite}} pulping {{process for the}} manufacture ofspecialty dissolving pulps and paper. During the liberation of the cellulose, the lignin isfractionated and solubilised through covalent addition of <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>groups</b> at variouspositions in the structure. The formed sulphonated lignin, lignosulphonate is then furtherisolated and refined. The amphiphilic nature of lignosulphonates has enabled them {{to be used as}} additives to varioussuspensions to improve their dispersion and stability. The by far largest utilisation oflignosulphonates is as dispersants in concrete. Here, lignosulphonates act by dispersing cementparticles to prevent flocculation, un‐even particle distribution and reduced strengthdevelopment. The dispersion is achieved through steric and electrostatic repulsion of the cementparticles by the lignosulphonate polymer. This behaviour is intimately linked with the overallsize and amount of charged groups in the dispersing polymer. Traditional modifications oflignosulphonates have been limited to removal of sugars, filtration and fractionation. Thesemodifications are not sufficient for utilisation of lignosulphonates in high‐strength concrete. Heresynthetic dispersants and superplasticisers are used which are considerably more efficient evenat low dosages. To compete with these, additional modifications of lignosulphonates are likely tobe necessary. The molecular weight and functional group composition have been identified anddescribed as the most interesting parameters that can be modified. Currently, no suitable method exists to increase the molecular weight of lignosulphonates. Oxidation by the natural radical initiating enzyme laccase is an interesting tool to achieve suchmodifications. In this thesis several aspects of the mechanism through which this enzyme reactswith lignin and lignosulphonate structures have been elucidated through model compoundstudies. Further studies showed that laccase alone was a highly efficient tool for increasing themolecular weight of commercial lignosulphonates at low dosages and in short incubation times. Immobilisation of the laccase to a solid support to enable re‐utilisation was also investigated. Modification of functional group composition of lignosulphonates was achieved throughozonolysis and the Fenton’s reagent, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and iron(II) acetate. Introduction of charged carboxylic groups was achieved through opening of the benzyl rings oflignosulphonates. It was found that a two‐stage process consisting of laccase oxidation followedby ozonolysis was an efficient technique to create a polymer enriched with carboxylic acidgroups with a sufficient molecular size. Oxidation by the Fenton’s reagent was shown to yield similar modifications as the combinedlaccase/ozonolysis treatment albeit with less pronounced results but with a large level of controlthrough variation of a number of reaction parameters. The Fenton’s reagent can therefore be aninteresting alternative to the aforementioned two‐stage treatment. These modifications are interesting for large‐scale applications not only because of theirsimplicity in terms of reaction parameters but also because of the ubiquity of the used enzymeand the chemicals in the pulp and paper industry.
