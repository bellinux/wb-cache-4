25|$|Robson {{was still}} a regular choice for United during the 1991–92 season despite {{competition}} from much younger players including Paul Ince, Neil Webb and Andrei Kanchelskis. During that season he made his 90th and final appearance for the England team, who by this stage were being managed by Graham Taylor. But the 1991–92 season ended in disappointment for Robson as United were overhauled in the First Division championship race by Leeds. He missed their League Cup final victory over Nottingham Forest through injury and his first-team chances were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> increasingly numbered as he faced competition from other players within the United squad and the press reported that Alex Ferguson was hoping to sign a new, younger midfielder, although no such addition took place in 1992.|$|E

He noted that Inside No. 9 storylines [...] "were never meant to be topical satires, but we're so steeped in electioneering that everything is <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like political comment now". He compared the character of Hugo, a [...] "public school chancer ... with a breezy nonchalance and an answer for everything", to David Cameron, and the character of Maxwell, [...] "the uptight little man with the funny voice ... who had committed murder to win his comfy berth and was now beginning to wonder if he’d made a mistake", to Ed Miliband. Stevens claimed that Inside No. 9 [...] "is bizarre enough for any interpretation".|$|E

Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label.

He has nerves {{of steel and}} thews of whipcord", even if [...] "he's <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> a little older." [...] Doolittle was fulsome in his praise for the novel, saying [...] "Fleming's new book will not disappoint his millions of fans". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning, although even he admitted that [...] "you can't argue with success". However, {{he went on to}} say that [...] "simply pro forma, I must set down my opinion that this is a silly and tedious novel." [...] Boucher went on to bemoan that although On Her Majesty's Secret Service was better than The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "it is still a lazy and inadequate story", going on to say that [...] "my complaint is not that the adventures of James Bond are bad literature... but that they aren't good bad literature". Boucher finished his review lamenting that [...] "they just aren't writing bad books like they used to." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} {{considerable}} {{mention of the}} evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. [...] "heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds," [...] wrote Brian Lowry of Variety. The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a [...] "jump the shark" [...] moment for the series: The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of The Guardian wrote: House of Cards has never felt like the real presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.|$|E

500|$|Philadelphia Inquirer {{television}} critic Jonathan Storm strongly {{criticized the}} show, {{calling it a}} flat, [...] "miscast mess" [...] with serious structural problems. Storm also said the Leslie character lacked energy and Poehler was playing the part against her comedic strengths. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said, [...] "Poehler's show unfortunately isn't worthy of her. It's dry and hesitant when one longs {{for it to be}} raucous and madcap." [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News said the show was not funny enough to deserve Poehler's comedic talents, and compared the dialogue to a Saturday Night Live sketch that he said could not sustain a whole sitcom. New York Post television critic Linda Stasi said the pilot lacked laughs and was so similar to The Office that [...] "it's <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a one-trick pony outfit that's gonna keep dressing that horse up in new saddles, hoping that no one will guess it's been around the track so many times, it's worn a ditch in the dirt." [...] The pilot episode premiered in Australia on Channel Seven on December 1, 2009, when episodes from the critically acclaimed second season were already playing in the United States. Sacha Moritorisz of The Sydney Morning Herald said of the episode, [...] "To be frank, tonight's premiere is weak. But the potential is obvious and word from the US is that it gets much better." ...|$|E

Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock.

Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance.

2500|$|In {{recognition}} of Torquay’s impressive {{start to the}} season, Paul Buckle was named League Two Manager of the Month for August. [...] However, after a near perfect August, September was to prove something of a reality check for the Gulls. [...] With Torquay’s clean sheet record ending against Port Vale in their previous match, a 2-1 defeat away to Southend in their {{first game of the}} month put to an end a twelve match unbeaten run in the League which had stretched back to March. [...] This was then followed up by two successive 0-0 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage. [...] Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net. [...] With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> a little light up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.|$|E
2500|$|Under Evans, Barnes {{and young}} players like Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler (who {{had been given}} their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) began playing attractive, attacking football, and were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like title contenders again {{after several years of}} {{dominance}} in the title race by Manchester United as well as the likes of Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. They won the League Cup in 1995, began challenging for the FA Premier League title, and lost the 1996 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Barnes had now been converted into a holding midfielder where he, Redknapp and McManaman would pass their way through teams and set up goals. He often captained the side in 1995–96 when regular captain Ian Rush lost his place to new signing Stan Collymore, and when Rush departed to Leeds United {{at the end of the}} season he became full-time captain. Barnes played a pivotal role in the midfield, and created the final goal after a dribble and passing movement for Stan Collymoore during Liverpool's 4–3 win at Anfield against Newcastle. A young Jamie Carragher was breaking through into the team towards the end of Barnes's career at Liverpool and said that despite Barnes supposedly being past his peak by then, in his 34th year, he was still the best player at the club. [...] "Technically, he’s the best player I've ever trained or played with, he was great with both feet, they were both exactly the same. I'd say he's the best finisher I've ever played with (including Torres, Fowler, Owen). Barnes never used to blast his shots – they’d just get placed right in the corner. You speak with the players from those great Liverpool sides and ask them who the best player they played with was and they all say John Barnes".|$|E
