50|$|By definition, a {{magazine}} paginates with each issue starting at page three, with the <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> being 8 3/8 × 10 7/8 inches.

Thus Business Week, which starts each issue anew with page one, is {{a magazine}}, but the Journal of Business Communication, which starts each volume with the winter issue and continues the same sequence of pagination throughout the coterminous year, is a journal. Some professional or trade publications are also peer-reviewed, an example being the Journal of Accountancy. Academic or professional publications that are not peer-reviewed are generally professional magazines. That a publication calls itself a journal {{does not make it}} a journal in the technical sense; The Wall Street Journal is actually a newspaper.|$|E

50|$|In the Discworld universe, {{magic is}} broken into {{elementary}} particulate fragments {{in much the}} same way that energy and other forces are in real-world quantum physics. The basic unit of Discworld magic is the thaum (from the Greek thauma, marvel), equal to the amount of mystical energy required to conjure up one small white pigeon, or three normal-sized billiard balls. Several SI-modifiers have been applied to it (e.g. millithaum, kilothaum) in the books. Magic can be measured with a thaumometer, which is described as a black cube with a dial on one side. A standard thaumometer is good for up to a million thaums, beyond that level, Discworld reality starts to break down. Parodying the introduction of the metric system, later Discworld novels refer to the introduction of the newer unit, the Prime, to avoid arguments over the <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> of pigeons. It is more defined as the magical energy required to move one pound of lead one foot, referencing the Joule.|$|E
50|$|The scheme did {{not produce}} a more {{powerful}} locomotive; the maximum practical tractive force was governed by the weight on the drivers, and this did not change. The advantage was efficiency: the compounding reduced the steam required for the same performance. According to Baldwin's <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> tables, the high-pressure cylinder on the compound was about 70% {{the diameter of the}} single cylinder of the conventional engine; therefore, steam consumption for the same stroke and degree of cutoff was about half that of the conventional engine. In practice lesser results were generally achieved, with Baldwin in 1900 reporting trials by various railroads showing fuel savings of 17% to 45%. In order to produce symmetrical forces, the low-pressure cylinders had to be about 66% larger in diameter than the high, or about 20% larger than conventional cylinders; for small drivers this could lead to the clearance issues mentioned earlier, thus requiring the low-pressure cylinders to be on top.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Garment {{production}} {{is a high}} value-added industry in the global textile manufacturing chain. <b>Standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems of garment are crucial issue, play an even important role for garment manufacturing industry. The extraction of knowledge from large database has been successfully applied {{in a number of}} advanced fields by data mining. However, little research has been done in the area of developing <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems of garment manufacture, using data mining. Focusing on the anthropometric data of adult males in Taiwan, the goal {{of this study was to}} develop <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems, using a novel cluster-based data mining cycle. Certain advantages may be observed when <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems are developed, using the data mining cycle. These include being able to cover a higher percentage of the population, using fewer sizes, and providing manufacturers with reference points to promote products, according to body type and distribution. Since the anthropometric database must be repeatedly updated, <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems may also be continuously renewed via application of the proposed data mining cycle. These <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems will remain continually beneficial for both production planning and reducing inventory costs, while facilitating the advanced garment manufacture.

Thus, establishing <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems are necessary and important for manufacturers. Because <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems need anthropometric data for reference, so we first construct a large anthropometric database. Data mining has been extensively used in many fields.

The newly developed sizing systems can correctly predict the requirements for different sizes of uniforms, and thus to generate a realistic production planning.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{possible}} uses of data mining methods in establishing <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> system based on anthropometric body measurements variables. Sudanese army officers database was selected for establishing sizing system because of the need for producing army officers uniform (poshirt) for the whole body types (upper and lower). The anthropometric data was collected for 841 army officers from Sur Military Clothing Factory in Sudan. For each individual (13) anthropometric variables were involved resulting in a total of 10933 variables. The data mining methods applied to establish the <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> system were (WEKA 3. 6. 9 and SPSS).

This {{is the reason that}} establishing <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems is necessary and important for garment manufacturers in Taiwan. As the <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems need anthropometric data for reference, an anthropometric database for Taiwan army servicemen was first constructed for the purpose of simplifying the entire process. Anthropometric data collected from scratch are used to establish the sizing systems. The data mining method, which has been extensively used in many fields, is applied in this project. Few researches have been conducted in addressing the establishment of sizing systems. This study aims to establish systems for determining the sizes of garments for army personnel using the data mining technique. The newly developed sizing systems can be adopted to better accurately predict the requirements of different sizes of uniforms, and then to generate a practical production planning procedure. This study found that, by applying data mining technique, unnecessary inventory costs resulting from sizing mismatches that portend large differences between the numbers of soldiers and of produced garments can be significantly minimized...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with apparel sizing system design. One {{of the most important}} issues in the apparel development process is to define a sizing system that provides a good fit to the majority of the population. A sizing system classifies a specific population into homogeneous subgroups based on some key body dimensions. <b>Standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems range linearly from very small to very large. However, anthropometric measures do not grow linearly with size, so they can not accommodate all body types. It is important to determine each class in the sizing system based on a real prototype that is as representative as possible of each class. In this paper we propose a methodology to develop an efficient apparel sizing system based on clustering techniques jointly with OWA operators. Our approach is a natural extension and improvement of the methodology proposed by McCulloch, Paal, and Ashdown (1998), and we apply it to the anthropometric database obtained from a anthropometric survey of the Spanish female population, performed during 2006...|$|E
