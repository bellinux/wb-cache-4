40|$|Fortlax is an {{air-cooled}} {{data center}} in Norrbotten. The potential of future investments in data centers is prosperous, but sustainability is {{an increasingly important}} factor. It is important {{to make sure that}} the data centers are sufficiently cooled while too much forced cooling leads to economical losses and a waste of energy. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a CFD model of a server room at Fortlax data center that accurately predicts the temperature and flow field. The goal is to develop the CFD model in order to evaluate different cooling systems and also improve the placement of the <b>server</b> <b>racks.</b> Most of the <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> are only half full at the moment, but the heat load is supposed to increase in the near future. Therefore, it has been assumed that all the <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> generate full heat load. The commercial CFD software ANSYS CFX 16. 0 has been used to perform the simulations. The current cooling system with the current placement of the <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> resulted in some insufficiently cooled <b>server</b> <b>racks.</b> The performance of the cooling system was significantly improved when the hard-floor configuration was replaced by a raised-floor configuration. The design strategy based on hot/cold-aisles has become the standard when raised-floor configurations are used. However, the raised-floor configuration with parallel rows of <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> turned out to be the setup that performed best based on the performance metrics that were used to evaluate the results in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Servers have {{substantially}} {{increased their}} workload capacity {{over the years}} as an effect of a more digitalized way of living. With server capacity growing, so does the corresponding heat accumulation in data centers and <b>server</b> <b>racks.</b> There is little clear consensus of how heat as an environmental threat to <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> is mitigated. This study addresses how system administrators can address thermal threats to <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> through its own methodology and instrumentation; an approach based on heat mitigation standards and own experimentation. An own rack health indicator has been created. InteliRack facilitates its own calculation of a health metric for <b>server</b> <b>racks.</b> Based on principles of thermal segregation in terms server placement and temperature relationships in the rack. Various experimentation of technical and physical nature was implemented to manipulate server performance and analyze effects of realistic and unrealistic scenarios. Through experimentation and detailed data collection, the study has {{come to the conclusion that}} short term physical and technical manipulation of the rack does not interfere with heat behavior to a considerable extent. The project provides its own approach to create an health indicator for monitored racks based on heat convection principles and temperature data...|$|R

40|$|Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) is the {{coupling}} {{of solving the}} flow field using numerical method and it predicts the sound field generated by the flow numerically using the results obtained from the flow field. This method can be classified into two categories namely, direct CAA and Hybrid CAA respectively. Direct CAA can solve the flow field and the sound field simultaneously while Hybrid CAA can solve the flow field first, and then uses the results obtained from the flow field to calculate the sound field. These two approaches are studied systematically {{as a means to}} reduce the noise generated by a flow field. Direct and Hybrid CAA were validated by comparing the results obtained computationally and experimentally on two benchmark cases. In addition, the Direct CAA was compared to Hybrid CAA to show that both approaches were feasible; results indicate that the Hybrid Approach was more efficient. Following the studies, a ventilated deflector was designed by utilizing the CAA method to reduce the wind buffeting noise by a subsonic flow over a cavity. The mechanism of buffeting noise was exploited by considering a model cavity. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the computational scheme developed in this thesis. Experimental and computational results showed that the designed ventilated deflector allows an effective control of the buffeting noise at higher flow speeds. Another study, that uses the CAA approach is the study of flow induced noise inside a generic <b>server</b> <b>rack.</b> A hybrid CAA was used to explore the cause of noise creation in the <b>server</b> <b>rack,</b> while proposing a new design that split the flow into front and rear panels. Computational results showed that the splitter was able to suppress the tonal component that appeared in a generic <b>server</b> <b>rack.</b> ...|$|E
