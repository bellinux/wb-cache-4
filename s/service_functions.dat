25|$|As {{the need}} for such <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> became more acute (as, for example, during the Investiture Controversy), and their duties and privileges, at first nebulous, became more clearly defined, the ministeriales {{developed}} in the Salian period (1024–1125) into a new and much differentiated class. They received fiefs, which to begin with were not heritable, in return for which they provided knightly services. They were also allowed to possess, and often did hold, allods: ownership of real property (land, buildings and fixtures) that is independent of any superior landlord, but it {{should not be confused with}} anarchy as the owner of allodial land is not independent of his sovereign. Ministerials were found holding the four great offices necessary to run a great household: seneschal, butler, marshal and chamberlain. They were vidames (vice dominus, or runners of estates) or castellans, having both military and administrative responsibilities. Conrad II of Kuchl was the financial adviser to four archbishops over the course of 40 years.|$|E
25|$|Tange {{organised}} {{the spaces}} of the three firms by function {{to allow them to}} share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.|$|E

[...] Scope of practice and all treatment protocols are developed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute on a national basis, and cannot be unilaterally changed at the local level by individual physicians. [...] Scope and protocols are reviewed, revised, and announced every four years, and any physician who wishes a change to those protocols must provide sound reasons and present a successful argument before a committee of the DIA. [...] The medical managers for each private carrier operate in a role approximating that of Medical Director, but only for that one company; their authority does not extend to other companies operating in the same community. [...] These individuals do perform quality <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> such as chart audits and complaint investigation, but they cannot unilaterally change treatment protocols. [...] They may provide guidance, advice and direction to paramedics by telephone or radio, or they may attend the scene in person to provide care. [...] The Dutch system also operates a network of four helicopters staffed by physicians for rapid response to support paramedics in the field. [...] While many of the individuals working in the Dutch system may be occasionally described as 'emergency physicians', the majority, as in the Franco-German model, are actually anesthetists.|$|E

40|$|Fragmentation in {{healthcare}} {{has led to}} a desire to align and integrate care processes horizontally. The concept of value-based healthcare has been introduced, suggesting a maximized value creation to occur when optimal conditions are created for selected patient segments, integrating all activities that jointly determine the success in meeting a set of patient needs. While targeting specialized segments {{has been shown to be}} beneficial, theories of diversification suggests that an increased scope may be an even more efficient approach to improve performance. By sharing resources and capabilities across several specialized units, coordination and knowledge sharing of a hospital’s ancillary services becomes important.   In this study, we examine how an ancillary <b>service</b> <b>function,</b> providing resources and capabilities that are shared across specialized units, can be organized to ensure contribution to the overarching goal of maximizing value for patients. This is done through a qualitative case study of the Karolinska University Laboratory – an ancillary <b>service</b> <b>function</b> of the Karolinska University Hospital. It is concluded that an ancillary <b>service</b> <b>function</b> can, in a diversified context, facilitate and support the value creation around medical conditions by developing a comprehensive structure for knowledge management and sharing, both externally towards medical conditions and internally within the ancillary <b>service</b> <b>function.</b> If structured properly, clear benefits, such as economies of scale, scope and knowledge spillovers, can be achieved by separating sharable resources from the patient flows...|$|R
