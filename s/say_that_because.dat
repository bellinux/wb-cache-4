5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan proponents <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E

25|$|Others take Mach {{principle}} to mean some physical law tying {{the definition of}} nonspinning inertial frames at each event to the global distribution and motion of matter everywhere in the universe, and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the nonspinning inertial frames are precisely tied to {{the rotation of the}} dust in just the way such a Mach principle would suggest, this model does accord with Mach's ideas.|$|E

25|$|Farmers {{oppose a}} VAT {{increase}} from 8% to 20% and demand swift {{access to a}} credit line of nearly €100 million offered by Poland with a subsidized interest rate. Farmers <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> of the devaluation of the leu, resulting from de facto nationalization of the banks {{at the heart of}} the economic crisis, they can't service outstanding loans. They had several meetings with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Finance, but were not satisfied with the result. The farmers' demands include replenishment of subsidy funds in 2015 to 1.2 billion lei, the release of the lending process in agriculture and the decrease of the lending interest rate.|$|E
500|$|The court {{heard that}} Silcott's {{interview}} notes were contaminated, and that Raghip's suggestibility and Braithwaite's having been denied a lawyer rendered their confessions unreliable. The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot, {{conceded that the}} apparent contamination rendered all three convictions unsafe: [...] "e would not have gone on against Braithwaite, against Raghip, against any other defendants, having learned of the apparent dishonesty of the officer {{in charge of the}} case. I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the Crown has to depend on the honesty and integrity of officers in a case... The impact is obviously severe." [...] Rose writes that the statement was [...] "one of the more sensational speeches in English legal history." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Speechless" [...] after a water balloon {{fight with}} {{children}} in Germany. It took him 45 minutes. In an interview with [...] Vibe magazine, the musician commented, [...] "I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. I hate to <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> it's such a romantic song." [...] He added, [...] "But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. I felt {{it would be good}} enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity." [...] Jackson would consider [...] "Speechless" [...] to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.|$|E

500|$|Gates {{continued}} to have hopes {{of being able to}} take on [...] J. P. Morgan again-this time with a rival steel trust. [...] After the sale of his Louisville and Nashville Railroad stocks to Morgan in 1902, Gates quietly began buying shares of Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. [...] He and his associates easily owned more than 50 percent of the company's stock shares, but the company's owner and founder, John C. Osgood, claimed the shares were not valid. [...] Osgood said that while the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, any transfer of the shares without his signature and approval, made them invalid. [...] He went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of their invalidity, those who held shares of the company's stock without them, were not eligible to attend the annual stockholders' meeting. [...] Osgood was upheld in this opinion by the company's board of directors.|$|E
500|$|Never {{afraid to}} speak his mind, in July 1991 in an {{interview}} by The Straits Times Woon commented: [...] "We effectively don't have a Constitution. We have a law {{that can be easily}} changed by Parliament, and by the party in power because the party is Parliament. The changes themselves might not be controversial, but it is unsettling how flexible the Constitution is, unlike, say, in the United States." [...] In reply, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed out that past changes to the Constitution had been made only with a two-thirds parliamentary majority and not done lightheartedly, as the intensive discussions and the two-year gestation period of the Elected President Bill proved. He affirmed that the Constitution had to evolve to reflect the changing needs of the people, and that it could not be assumed that the Constitution, drafted in 1965, would be the best Constitution for always and should be frozen in time. [...] "So to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the Government in power changes the Constitution there is no Constitution is ridiculous, to put it mildly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate". The singer continued to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E

5000|$|Tom Hazelhurst remarked, [...] "Under Bill's tutelage, {{they built}} damn good boats. I'm not <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> I was their {{advertising}} man, but because I bought {{two of their}} boats. The boats just don't break." ...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{speaking}} to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said [...] "You and I both know they can’t {{go back to}} the other [...] borders. But we must not, on the other hand, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that we just go on with status quo. It can't be done." [...] Kissinger replied [...] "I couldn't agree more" ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, the Israeli {{government}} shelved {{the plan}} to forcibly relocate about 40,000 Bedouin Arabs from their ancestral lands to government designated towns. One of the plan's architects stated that the Bedouin had neither been consulted nor agreed to the move. [...] "I didn't tell anyone that the Bedouin agreed to my plan. I couldn't <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> I didn't present {{the plan to}} them," [...] said the former minister Benny Begin.|$|E

2500|$|Mr Falkoff, {{representing}} Ahmad, continued: [...] "There is {{only one}} meaning that can be gleaned from this short passage," [...] the petition says. [...] "The government believes that Mr. Ahmad has information that it wants but that it cannot extract without torturing him." [...] The petition goes on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> torture is not allowed at Guantanamo, [...] "the recommendation is that Mr. Ahmad {{should be sent to}} another country where he can be interrogated under torture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given {{a set of}} all {{possible}} -bit values, we can assign the lower (by the binary value) half to be the integers from 0 to [...] inclusive and the upper half to be [...] to −1 inclusive.

[...] That is to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> [...] any value in the set [...] can be used in place of.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, {{speaking}} at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying."Yeah, I think he does (chuck), and I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because,</b> {{if you read the}} laws of the game, there's {{no doubt in my mind}} that he and many others, throughout cricket history have." [...] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} conduct the spraying, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (not the state agency) was able to obtain an [...] "emergency {{exemption}} from registration" [...] from the U.S. EPA. [...] Representatives of the California Department of Pesticide Regulation <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of that exemption, the spraying program {{is not subject to}} state approval. [...] But Santa Cruz city Attorney John Barisone has said that the moth [...] "isn't an emergency. We've known about it for quite a while." [...] The legal brief he is involved in argues that the state first knew, in 1995, that the moth was [...] "highly likely" [...] to establish itself in the United States, but that no environmental studies were done on how best to deal the moth, resulting in the spray plan and consequent panic among residents fearful of spray effects.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rind, Bauserman and Tromovitch {{responded to}} this {{criticism}} by saying that [...] "the representativeness of college samples is in fact irrelevant to the stated goals and conclusions of our study" [...] since the purpose of their research was [...] "to examine {{the validity of the}} clinical concept" [...] of CSA. They added that according to the commonly understood definition of the term, child sexual abuse is extremely and pervasively harmful, meaning that [...] "in any population sampled - drug addicts, psychiatric patients, or college students - persons who have experienced CSA should show strong evidence of the assumed properties of CSA." [...] The authors of the study <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the college sample did not show pervasive harm, [...] "the broad and unqualified claims about the properties of CSA are contradicted". Rind et al. also said that using college samples was appropriate because their study found similar prevalence rates and experiences of severity and outcomes between college samples and national samples.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the film}} {{involving}} boxing, Ring Magazine also gave its critique, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it left out the Trilogy with Arturo Gatti, it was like doing a movie about the entire life of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and not including World War II.|$|R
