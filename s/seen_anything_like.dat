5|$|This {{film was}} shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, {{and on his}} arrival at Southampton aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, Cagney was mobbed by {{hundreds}} of fans.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, [...] "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers.
