5000|$|On February 6, {{fears about}} the private banks {{collapsing}} led to bank runs by customers to withdraw their funds.

40|$|Orientation: The study {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} labour turnover trends amongst African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa. There {{is a perception}} that turnover amongst African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> is higher than average. There is also a perception that African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> are only motivated by financial rewards when considering job change. Research purpose: The study focused on understanding why African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> have a propensity to change jobs and how organisations can resolve the trend. Motivation for the study: To develop {{a better understanding of}} the push and pull factors for African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> in organisations. Research design, approach and method: The research was conducted in two phases, namely as part of a qualitative study and a quantitative study: Creswell (2003) refers to this approach as triangulation. The target population was African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> on the database of a large Human Resources Consultancy, The South African Rewards Association and the Association of Black Actuaries and Investment Professionals (ABSIP) (n = 2600). A total of 208 usable responses were received. Main findings: The main findings and contribution to the field of study was that African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> do not trust organisations with their career development. They would rather take control of their own career development by moving from organisation to organisation to build their repertoire of skills and competence. They want to be in charge of their careers. This finding has profound implications for organisations employing African Black <b>managers</b> in the <b>senior</b> cadre. Practical/managerial implications: Managers of African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> need to create attractive employee value propositions that address the main findings. Contribution/value-add: The research shows that African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> generally seek corporate environments that encourage a sense of belonging and with a clear career growth plan. </p...|$|R

There is a specific focus on the tensions experienced by these <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> and the related tactics they adopted to successfully manage them. We gathered data from focus groups made up of 20 <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> from companies operating in the Milan County in Italy.
