5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their <b>sexual</b> <b>history</b> would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{older men}} and women {{maintaining}} interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; {{it is a way}} of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active <b>sexual</b> <b>history</b> were important to male sexual activity.

To increase knowledge of HIV status, CDC guidelines seek to make HIV screening a routine part of medical care. This paper examines how routinely California primary care providers test for HIV and how providers' knowledge of California's streamlined testing requirements, use of <b>sexual</b> <b>histories,</b> and having an electronic medical record prompt for HIV testing, relate to test offers. We surveyed all ten California health plans offered under health reform's Insurance Exchange (response rate = 50 %) and 322 primary care providers to those plans (response rate = 19 %) to assess use of HIV screening and risk assessments. Only 31. 7 % of 60 responding providers reported offering HIV tests to all or most new enrollees and only 8. 8 % offered an HIV test of blood samples {{all or most of}} the time despite the California law requiring that providers offer HIV testing of blood samples in primary care settings. Twenty-eight of the 60 providers (46. 6 %) were unaware that California had reduced barriers to HIV screening by eliminating the requirement for written informed consent and pre-test counseling. HIV screening of new enrollees all or most of the time was reported by 53. 1 % of the well-informed providers, but only 7. 1 % of the less informed providers, a difference of 46 percentage points (95 % CI: 21. 0 %- 66. 5 %).

[...] Johnson's evidence is mostly letters to the editor found in women's magazines written by asexual/autoerotic women. She portrays them as invisible, [...] "oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent," [...] and left behind by both the sexual revolution and the feminist movement. Johnson argued that society either ignores or denies their existence or insists they must be ascetic for religious reasons, neurotic, or asexual for political reasons.|$|E

500|$|Webster's {{behaviour}} {{in court}} and her <b>sexual</b> <b>history</b> also counted against her. She was widely described by reporters as [...] "calm" [...] and [...] "stolid" [...] in facing the court and only cried once during the trial, when her son was mentioned. This contradicted the expectation that [...] "properly feminine" [...] women should be penitent and emotional in such a situation. Her succession of male friends, one of whom had fathered her child outside wedlock, suggested promiscuous female sexuality—again, strongly counter to expected norms of behaviour. During her trial she attempted unsuccessfully to evoke sympathy by blaming Strong, the possible father of her child, for leading her astray: [...] "I formed an intimate acquaintance with one who should have protected me and was led away by evil associates and bad companions." [...] This claim played on social expectations that women's moral sense was inextricably linked with sexual chastity—"falling" [...] sexually would lead {{to other forms of}} [...] "ruin"—and that men who had sexual relations with women acquired social obligations that they were expected to fulfil. Webster's attempt to implicate three innocent men also caused outrage; O'Donnell commented that [...] "public opinion, as a whole, undoubtedly condemned Kate Webster, as much, perhaps, for her attempts to bring three innocent men to the scaffold as for the actual murder itself".|$|E
500|$|McKenzie {{wrote that}} Tripp only {{partially}} succeeded in {{his goal of}} describing homosexuality, that his bibliography omitted basic works and included some dubious sources, and that while some of Tripp's observations were thought-provoking, others were ludicrous. He also described the book as a rambling, awkwardly written, and poorly organized anecdotal survey. Hendin called The Homosexual Matrix pseudoscience and Tripp an [...] "erudite con man" [...] who lacked impartiality and had a [...] "bias toward homosexuality". Hendin argued that Tripp saw homosexuality as superior to heterosexuality and sexual passion as dependent upon anger, mistakenly drew conclusions about heterosexuality from observations about homosexual behavior, and had a distorted view of <b>sexual</b> <b>history</b> and a negative view of women. Hendin wrote that Tripp's conclusion that homosexuality {{is not related to}} fear or anger toward women, family relationships, or a reflection of confusion over sexual identity, was baseless. His review was followed by letters of protest from the historian Martin Duberman, Pomeroy, Weinberg, and others, to which Hendin replied with a rebuttal. Cameron called Tripp [...] "vulgar" [...] and prejudiced and characterizing Tripp's evidence as [...] "largely literary." [...] Cameron criticized Tripp for treating the Kinsey Reports as authoritative, writing that they had been [...] "critically studied for almost thirty years" [...] and were out of date, for being careless in his discussion of history, and for focusing mainly on male homosexuality and neglecting lesbianism. Cameron was convinced by Tripp's argument that strains and tensions are necessary in a relationship to keep the partners interested in each other, and found his discussion of psychotherapy insightful.|$|E
