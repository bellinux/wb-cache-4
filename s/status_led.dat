The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how attackers can covertly leak data (e. g., {{encryption}} keys, passwords and files) from highly secure or air-gapped networks via {{the row of}} <b>status</b> <b>LEDs</b> that exists in networking equipment such as LAN switches and routers. Although {{it is known that}} some network equipment emanates optical signals correlated with the information being processed by the device ('side-channel'), intentionally controlling the <b>status</b> <b>LEDs</b> to carry any type of data ('covert-channel') has never studied before. A malicious code is executed on the LAN switch or router, allowing full control of the <b>status</b> <b>LEDs.</b> Sensitive data can be encoded and modulated over the blinking of the LEDs. The generated signals can then be recorded by various types of remote cameras and optical sensors. We provide the technical background on the internal architecture of switches and routers (at both the hardware and software level) which enables this type of attack. We also present amplitude and frequency based modulation and encoding schemas, along with a simple transmission protocol. We implement a prototype of an exfiltration malware and discuss its design and implementation. We evaluate this method with a few routers and different types of LEDs. In addition, we tested various receivers including remote cameras, security cameras, smartphone cameras, and optical sensors, and also discuss different detection and prevention countermeasures. Our experiment shows that sensitive data can be covertly leaked via the <b>status</b> <b>LEDs</b> of switches and routers at a bit rates of 10 bit/sec to more than 1 Kbit/sec per LED...|$|R

500|$|Daniel Bryan's eight-month road to WrestleMania {{began at}} SummerSlam in August 2013, {{when he started}} feuding with Triple H and Randy Orton. Since June, Bryan had been praised {{as one of the}} top {{performers}} in WWE by critics and veterans of the professional wrestling industry, as his rise in <b>status</b> <b>led</b> him to a title shot at SummerSlam. At the event, Bryan defeated John Cena to win his first WWE Championship with Triple H as the special guest referee. After the match, Triple H turned heel by attacking Bryan, which directly led to Orton using his Money in the Bank title opportunity for an immediate title shot. Orton pinned a downed Bryan to capture the WWE Championship. After SummerSlam, Triple H claimed that it was a [...] "business decision" [...] to sabotage Bryan because Bryan did not fit the type of wrestler that the company was looking for as its champion; therefore, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon (later known as the Authority) instead endorsed Orton as the [...] "face of the WWE". Over the next few months, Bryan was constantly sabotaged in his attempts to gain and hold on to the WWE Championship. Bryan defeated Orton to regain the WWE Championship at Night of Champions, but due to referee Scott Armstrong making a fast count, Triple H stripped Bryan of the title the next night on Raw. At Battleground, a match between Bryan and Orton for the vacant title ended in a no contest when Big Show (who had been manipulated by the Authority in the weeks prior) attacked both men. Bryan once again challenged Orton for the vacant championship at Hell in a Cell; Triple H interfered in the match and was attacked by Bryan, resulting in special guest referee Shawn Michaels attacking Bryan, which led to Orton capturing the WWE Championship again.|$|E

50|$|A 4L's four <b>status</b> <b>LEDs</b> {{will also}} light in unusual {{patterns}} to indicate service requirements; for example, a lit error {{light and a}} lit ready light would indicate a fuser problem (usually just needs to be reseated - most 4L problems can be resolved by simply disassembling the printer, cleaning it, then reassembling it). This was much more cryptic than the alphanumeric display of earlier models like the II/IID, III/IIID, IIP, and IIIP, as {{it was impossible to}} determine the meaning of the patterns of LEDs without comparing them against a manual (or having their meaning memorized, which some technicians exposed to them often might actually do, intentionally or not). Interestingly, the 4L used early light pipes, with surface-mounted LEDs on the control board {{on the left side of}} the printer, and plastic channels to conduct light from the lit <b>status</b> <b>LEDs</b> to the top of the printer. The LaserJet 4/4 Plus/4M/4M Plus retained an alphanumeric display, and in fact upgraded from the LCD displays of earlier models by using a 16-character alphanumeric dot-matrix vacuum fluorescent display. To this day, professional-grade LaserJets retain more comprehensive displays.|$|R

2500|$|BALPA {{was also}} in an {{industrial}} dispute with BEA over pay and conditions. The dispute was controversial, those in favour being mainly younger pilots, and those against mostly older. A group of 22 BEA Trident co-pilots known as supervisory first officers (SFOs) were already on strike, citing their low status and high workload. To help train newly qualified co-pilots, SFOs were told to occupy only the third flight deck seat of the Trident as a [...] "P3", operating the aircraft's systems and helping the captain (known as [...] "P1" [...] on the BEA Trident fleet) and the co-pilot ("P2") who handled the aircraft. In other airlines and aircraft, the job of SFO/P3 was usually performed by flight engineers. As {{a result of being}} limited to the P3 role, BEA Trident SFOs/P3s were denied experience of aircraft handling, which led to loss of pay, which they resented. In addition, their <b>status</b> <b>led</b> to a regular anomaly: experienced SFO/P3s could only assist while less-experienced co-pilots actually flew the aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|This {{decision}} {{was taken by}} the British Liberal Judaism already in the 1950s. The North American Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) accepted it in 1983, and The British Movement for Reform Judaism affirmed it in 2015.

British Liberals offer [...] "blessing ceremonies" [...] if the child is to be raised Jewish, and the MRJ allows its clergy to participate in celebration of civil marriage, though none allow a full Jewish ceremony with Chupah and the like. In American Reform, 17% of synagogue-member households have a converted spouse, and 26% an unconverted one. Its policy on conversion and Jewish <b>status</b> <b>led</b> the WUPJ into conflict with more traditional circles, {{and a growing number of}} its adherents are not accepted as Jewish by either the Conservative or the Orthodox.
