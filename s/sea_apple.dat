60|$|Daylight came, {{soon after}} we got under way, {{and in the course}} of an hour or two we reached the Dead Sea. Nothing grows in the flat, burning desert around it but weeds and the Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>apple</b> the poets say is {{beautiful}} to the eye, but crumbles to ashes and dust when you break it. Such as we found were not handsome, but they were bitter to the taste. They yielded no dust. It was because they were not ripe, perhaps.|$|E
60|$|He was as alert as a fox, {{as tough}} as a caribou cutlet and as broad-gauged as the aurora borealis. He stood sprayed by a Niagara of sound--the crash of the {{elevated}} trains, clanging cars, pounding of rubberless tires and the antiphony of the cab and truck-drivers indulging in scarifying repartee. And so, with his gold dust cashed in to the merry air of a hundred thousand, and with the cakes and ale of one week in Gotham turning bitter on his tongue, the Man from Nome sighed to set foot again in Chilkoot, the exit {{from the land of}} street noises and Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>apple</b> pies.|$|E

50|$|When disturbed, <b>sea</b> <b>apples,</b> {{like other}} holothuroids, can {{projectile}} vomit their entrails from both ends. In addition, <b>sea</b> <b>apples</b> can release a toxic saponin called holothurin {{into the water}} as a defense mechanism.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>apples</b> {{are often}} harassed by many {{aquarium}} inhabitants. Crustaceans, such as hermit crabs, and fish often pick on <b>sea</b> <b>apple's</b> feathery tentacles. This {{may be for}} predatory purposes, or simply to steal trapped particles and plankton from the tentacles.|$|R

50|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>apple</b> feeds {{primarily}} on plankton, which it filters {{from the water}} with its tentacles. It alternately brings each tentacle to its mouth, scraping off the captured plankton.|$|E
5000|$|Holothuria arenicola is {{described}} as a sea cucumber suitable for keeping in aquaria as it does not eviscerate, whereas the [...] "Australian" [...] <b>sea</b> <b>apple</b> (Paracucumaria tricolor) frequently eviscerates.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>apples</b> usually feed {{at night}} {{at which time}} their {{delicate}} tentacles are less at risk from predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies and}} tentacles of <b>sea</b> <b>apples</b> come in many {{different}} colorings. The Australian species has a primarily purple body, red feet, and purple and white tentacles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>apples</b> are holothuroids, {{and as such}} {{share many}} of the same {{physical}} characteristics. A few notable characteristics are discussed below. For more information about the physiology of holothuroids in general, see the appropriate sections in the main article Sea cucumbers.|$|R
50|$|The ovate body of {{an adult}} <b>sea</b> <b>apple</b> can grow up to 7.8 in long. A central mouth-like cavity is {{surrounded}} by feathery tentacles, which add additional length. Sea apples, like many echinoderms, have rows of tube feet which help them move over and adhere to structures.|$|E
50|$|Syzygium grande or <b>sea</b> <b>apple</b> {{is a tall}} {{tree that}} can reach 30 m. The trees can be found along the coastal line of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are large with dark green color. The flowers are white and compact in {{clusters}} with strong scent. Fruits are oblong in shape and green.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the many}} conjectures as to this tree, the most {{probable}} {{is that it}} is the osher (Calotropis procera) of the Arabs, which grows from Jordan to southern Egypt. The fruit of Calotropis procera is therefore called [...] "apples of Sodom", Sodom apple, and Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>apple.</b> Although beautiful to the eye, are bitter to the taste.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{of their}} {{interesting}} appearance and behaviour, <b>sea</b> <b>apples</b> are often widely desired as specimen for display marine aquaria. They are considered reef safe {{as far as}} their compatibility with other species. However, they can be considered unsafe for reef aquaria for multiple reasons: ...|$|R
50|$|In addition, if {{threatened}} {{or in an}} unsuitable environment, <b>sea</b> <b>apples</b> can consume large amounts of surrounding seawater to swell to nearly double their original size, this allows them to be {{moved to a new}} area by water currents, and much more quickly than they could walk.|$|R
50|$|Certain genera {{including}} the <b>sea</b> <b>apples</b> in the genera Paracucumaria and Pseudocolochirus, contain toxic holothurin and holotoxin and release {{it into the}} water when damaged or killed. Spawning may also be accompanied by release of these toxins. For this reason, although they are interesting and attractive to keep in aquaria, it is inadvisable {{to keep them in}} a tank with other reef species.|$|R
50|$|Sea apples often {{starve to}} death in display aquaria. Levels of {{plankton}} in aquaria are often lower than optimal, and sea apples are often seen attempting to feed not only at night, as in their natural habitat, {{but also in the}} daytime. With only low levels of food available, these sea apples often starve, becoming progressively smaller as this happens. To try to circumvent these problems, hobbyists attempt to give the <b>sea</b> <b>apple</b> specimens supplemental feedings of plankton and liquid food.|$|E
5000|$|Linton was a {{singularly}} gifted man, who, in {{the words}} of his wife, if he had not bitten the Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>apple</b> of impracticable politics, would have risen higher in the world of both art and letters. As an engraver on wood he reached the highest point of execution in his own line. He carried on the tradition of Bewick, fought for intelligent as against merely manipulative excellence {{in the use of the}} graver, and championed the use of the [...] "white line" [...] as well as of the black, believing with Ruskin that the former was the truer and more telling basis of aesthetic expression in the wood-block printed upon paper.|$|E

6000|$|During the {{conversation}} several sea-maids came swimming {{into the room}} bearing trays of <b>sea</b> <b>apples</b> and other fruit, which they first offered to the queen, and then passed the refreshments around to the company assembled. Trot and Cap'n Bill each took some, {{and the little girl}} found the fruits delicious to eat, as they had a richer flavor than any that grew upon land. Queen Aquareine was much pleased when the old sailor asked for more, but Merla warned him dinner would soon be served and he must take care not to spoil his appetite for that meal. [...] "Our dinner is at noon, for we have to cook {{in the middle of the}} day when the sun is shining," [...] she said.|$|R

I believe now he was right. But he was wrong too, as such a man always is. That kind of tree bears Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>apples,</b> after all. He sowed evil, and he must reap evil. He may never know it, but he will reap what he has sown. The dreadful thing is that others must share in his harvest. What do you think?" ...|$|R

50|$|Crop {{production}} initially {{concentrated on}} raising cereals; in 1941 cereals covered 95.1 percent of sown areas, while 3.4 percent {{was devoted to}} potatoes and 1.5 percent to vegetables. In 1960, Mongolia became self-sufficient as far as cereals were concerned. Cultivation of fodder crops began in the 1950s. In 1985 cereals covered 80.6 percent of sown areas, fodder crops 17.7 percent, potatoes 1.3 percent, and vegetables 0.4 percent. Mongolia's staple crops were wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, vegetables, hay, and silage crops. Since 1960 agricultural performance as measured by gross output, per capita output, and crop yields was uneven. Although sown acreage expanded dramatically between 1960 and 1980, output and crop yields remained stagnant and, in some cases, fell because of natural disasters and poor management. In addition to the staple crops mentioned, Mongolia also produced small quantities of oil-yielding crops, such as sunflower and grape, and fruits and vegetables, such as <b>sea</b> buckthorn, <b>apples,</b> European black currants, watermelons, muskmelons, onions, and garlic. Small amounts of alfalfa, soybean, millet, and peas also were grown to provide protein fodder.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} immobilization of stearic acid on microcrystalline naphthalene for preparation of microcolumn and evaluation of its potential for adsorption and preconcentration of trace amounts of metal ions. It was found that this sorbent has high affinity for lead. Consequently, a rapid on-line preconcentration technique for the determination of lead by Flow Injection Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry had been devised. Preconcentration was based on accumulation of analyte on immobilized stearic acid microcolumn and subsequent elution by injection of a small volume of nitric acid (250 µL of 1 mol L- 1). A sample volume of 20 mL resulted in a preconcentration factor of 84, and relative standard deviations for solutions containing 40 and 200 µg L- 1 were 5. 1 and 1. 2 %, respectively. The procedure was applied to tap water, river water, <b>sea</b> water, <b>apple</b> juice, beet leaf, urine, and certified stainless steel. The accuracy was proved by performing recovery experiments, Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry measurements, and analysis of a stainless steel certified reference material...|$|R
50|$|Namp'o was {{originally}} a small fishing village {{that became a}} port for foreign trade in 1897, developing into a modern port in 1945 after World War II. With the rapid increase in state investment, the city's industrial capacity grew. Some of the city's industrial facilities include the Namp'o Smelter Complex, the Namp'o Glass Corporation, the Namp'o Shipbuilding Complex, the Namp'o Fishery Complex, and other central and local factories. Namp'o is a center for the DPRK shipbuilding industry.

6000|$|But it was October before Lord Lufton {{was made}} a happy man;--that is, if the {{fruition}} of his happiness was a greater joy than the anticipation of it. I will not say that the happiness of marriage is like the Dead <b>Sea</b> fruit--an <b>apple</b> which, when eaten, turns to bitter ashes in the mouth. Such pretended sarcasm would be very false. Nevertheless, is it not {{the fact that the}} sweetest morsel of love's feast has been eaten, that the freshest, fairest blush of the flower has been snatched and has passed away, when the ceremony at the altar has been performed, and legal possession has been given? There is an aroma of love, an undefinable delicacy of flavour, which escapes and is gone before the church portal is left, vanishing with the maiden name, and incompatible with the solid comfort appertaining to the rank of wife. To love one's own spouse, and to be loved by her, is the ordinary lot of man, and is a duty exacted under penalties. But to be allowed to love youth and beauty that is not one's own--to know that one is loved by a soft being who still hangs cowering from the eye of the world as though her love were all but illicit--can it be that a man is made happy when a state of anticipation such as this is brought to a close? No; when the husband walks back from the altar, he has already swallowed the choicest dainties of his banquet. The beef and pudding of married life are then in store for him;--or perhaps only the bread and cheese. Let him take care lest hardly a crust remain--or perhaps not a crust. But before we finish, let us go back for one moment to the dainties--to the time before the beef and pudding were served--while Lucy was still at the parsonage, and Lord Lufton still staying at Framley Court. He had come up one morning, as was now frequently his wont, and, after a few minutes' conversation, Mrs. Robarts had left the room--as not unfrequently on such occasions was her wont. Lucy was working and continued her work, and Lord Lufton {{for a moment or two}} sat looking at her; then he got up abruptly, and, standing before her, thus questioned her:-- ...|$|R
