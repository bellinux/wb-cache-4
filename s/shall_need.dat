500|$|Paine's text {{is still}} {{published}} today, {{one of the}} few eighteenth-century religious texts to be widely available. Its message still resonates, evidenced by Christopher Hitchens's statement that [...] "if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time, we shall require an age of reason". His [...] ends with the claim that [...] "in a time [...] [...] [...] when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we <b>shall</b> <b>need</b> to depend." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the vehicle's {{use of a}} low-density fuel in {{the form}} of liquid hydrogen, a great volume is {{required}} to contain enough energy to reach orbit. The propellant is intended to be kept at low pressure to minimise stress; a vehicle that is both large and light has an advantage during atmospheric reentry compared to other vehicles due to a low ballistic coefficient. Because of the low ballistic coefficient, Skylon would be slowed at higher altitudes where the air is thinner; as a consequence, the skin of the vehicle would reach only [...] In contrast, the smaller Space Shuttle was heated to 2,000K on its leading edge, and so employed an extremely heat-resistant but fragile silica thermal protection system. The Skylon design does not require such an approach, instead opting for using a far thinner yet durable reinforced ceramic skin; however, due to turbulent flow around the wings during re-entry, some sections of the vehicle <b>shall</b> <b>need</b> to be provided with active cooling systems.|$|E
