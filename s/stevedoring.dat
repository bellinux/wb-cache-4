25|$|In Oakland, California, police fired rubber {{bullets and}} beanbags at protesters and dockworkers outside the port, {{injuring}} {{at least a}} dozen demonstrators and six longshoremen standing nearby. Protestors were protesting the Iraq War related action performed by American President Lines and defense contractor <b>Stevedoring</b> Services of America. Most of the 500 demonstrators were dispersed peacefully, but a crowd of demonstrators was blocking traffic on private property near the port and failed to disperse after police warnings. The Oakland Police Chief said demonstrators also threw objects and bolts at the police, and said the use of weapons was necessary to disperse the crowd. He indicated that the rubber bullets were used to respond to direct illegal action and the longshoremen were caught in the crossfire. A dockworker spokesman reported that police gave two minutes to disperse, then opened fire rather than making arrests. Demonstrators also claim that the police took direct aim at them, rather than firing in the air or at the ground. Thirty-one people were arrested. Demonstrators regrouped and marched to the Oakland Federal Building. In New York, United States, protesters targeted the Carlyle Group, an investment firm with deep connections to the war. About 20 protesters were arrested in a planned civil disobedience, but police then also surrounded and arrested close to 100 people who were simply watching the protest from across the street.|$|E

2500|$|O'Brien was {{promoted}} to captain in the Australian Garrison Artillery on 2 February 1932. He was posted to the 10th Field Artillery Brigade as its acting adjutant and temporary quartermaster on 15 November 1932, and transferred to the Australian Field Artillery on 6 December 1933. He became acting commander of the 24th Battery in June 1936. This appointment became substantive when he {{was promoted}} to major on 19 March 1937. [...] He joined the United <b>Stevedoring</b> Company, a subsidiary of P, in 1932. He worked on a project to improve the unloading of coal, which had been accomplished by shovelling it into baskets and hoisting them down to the wharf. He replaced these with clamshell buckets, which hoisted the coal directly onto railway trucks. In 1938, he went into business with his former boss at United <b>Stevedoring,</b> Captain Jack Williams, founding a general engineering company called Fleet Forge Pty Ltd. A major contract was from the Royal Australian Navy to equip defensively equipped merchant ships. He married Gwen Victoria Goddard Britton, a [...] saleswoman, on 31 March 1934 at St Columba's Church in Elwood, Victoria. He wore his Army uniform for the ceremony.

2500|$|The 1999 Act's reforms mean {{a number}} of old cases would be decided {{differently}} today. In Beswick v Beswick while the House of Lords held that Mrs Beswick could specifically enforce a promise of her nephew to her deceased husband to pay her £5 weekly in her capacity as administratrix of the will, the 1999 Act would also allow her to claim as a third party. In Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd {{it would have been}} possible for a <b>stevedore</b> firm to claim the benefit of a limitation clause in a contract between a carrier and the owner of a damaged drum of chemicals. Lord Denning dissented, arguing for abolition of the rule, and Lord Reid gave an opinion that if a bill of lading expressly conferred the benefit of a limitation on the <b>stevedores,</b> the <b>stevedores</b> give authority to the carrier to do that, and [...] "difficulties about consideration moving from the <b>stevedore</b> were overcome" [...] then the <b>stevedores</b> could benefit. In The Eurymedon, Lord Reid's inventive solution was applied where some <b>stevedores</b> similarly wanted the benefit of an exclusion clause after dropping a drilling machine, the consideration being found as the <b>stevedores</b> performing their pre-existing contractual duty {{for the benefit of the}} third party (the drilling machine owner). Now none of this considerably technical analysis is required, given that any contract purporting to confer a benefit on a third party may in principle be enforced by the third party.|$|R

2500|$|The {{amendments}} required {{unions and}} employers to give 80 days' notice {{to each other}} and to certain state and federal mediation bodies before they may undertake strikes or other forms of economic action in pursuit of a new collective bargaining agreement; it did not, on the other hand, impose any [...] "cooling-off period" [...] after a contract expired. The Act also authorized the President to intervene in strikes or potential strikes that create a national emergency, a reaction to the national coal miners' strikes called by the United Mine Workers of America in the 1940s. Presidents have used that power less and less frequently in each succeeding decade. President George W. Bush invoked the law in connection with the employer lockout of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union during negotiations with West Coast shipping and <b>stevedoring</b> companies in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Then the Wobblies {{through their}} {{newspaper}} the Industrial Worker {{made the call}} for a citywide strike on May 1, 1923 (the historic May Day of international socialism).

On the same day, IWW leaders persuaded approximately 450 of 2,200 men to strike at refinery construction jobs two miles north of the harbor, and it seemed likely that the dispute would spread beyond the water front. Employers therefore decided to take immediate action both to prevent this and to move ships more rapidly. [...] Negotiations with the longshoremen, however, foundered on their demand for their own hiring hall and the abandonment of the Sea Service Bureau, or [...] "Fink Hall," [...] controlled by the <b>stevedoring</b> and shipping firms.
