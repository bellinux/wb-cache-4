As at present war has not been {{formally}} declared {{between us and the}} sultan, peaceful traders, as you know, carry on their avocations unmolested either by the warships of the Turks or by ours; they do not enter our ports without a special permit, and the crews are never allowed to land, in order that no detailed account of our fortifications may be taken to the sultan. Moreover, brawls might arise between them and the native population, or they might aid slaves to escape. However, you will be altogether safe from interference from Turkish war vessels, and if overhauled by one of them the safe conduct will be sufficient to prevent interference with you. But it is not so with pirates. They will plunder their own countrymen as readily as they will Christians, and the <b>safe</b> <b>guard</b> of the governor of Syria will be of no use whatever to you. In this consists the danger of your mission. I cannot send one of our war galleys on such an errand, and if there are not enough knights on board to beat off any pirate, the fewer there are the better. I hear that the craft is a fast sailor, and as the crew will be as anxious to avoid pirates as you, they will do their best to escape. I leave it to you to take any route. You can either sail hence direct for Acre, or you can coast along the shores of Anatolia and Syria, lying up at night in bays.|$|E

40|$|We {{revisit the}} moving k nearest {{neighbor}} (MkNN) query, which computes one's k nearest neighbor set and maintains it while at move. Existing MkNN algorithms are mostly safe region based, which lack efficiency due to either computing small safe regions {{with a high}} recomputation frequency or computing larger safe regions but with a high cost for each computation. In this demonstration, we showcase a system named INSQ that adopts a novel algorithm called the Influential Neighbor Set (INS) algorithm to process the MkNN query in both two-dimensional Euclidean space and road networks. This algorithm uses a small set of <b>safe</b> <b>guarding</b> objects instead of safe regions. As long as the the current k nearest neighbors are closer to the query object than the <b>safe</b> <b>guarding</b> objects are, the current k nearest neighbors stay valid and no recomputation is required. Meanwhile, the region defined by the <b>safe</b> <b>guarding</b> objects is the largest possible safe region. This means that the recomputation frequency is also minimized and hence, the INS algorithm achieves high overall query processing efficiency. Comment: Accepted to appear in ICDE 201...|$|R

40|$|The moving k nearest {{neighbor}} query, which computes one’s k {{nearest neighbor}} set and maintains it while at move, is gaining im-portance {{due to the}} prevalent use of smart mobile devices such as smart phones. Safe region is a popular technique in processing the moving k nearest neighbor query. It is a region where the move-ment of the query object does not cause the current k nearest neigh-bor set to change. Processing a moving k nearest neighbor query is a continuing process of checking {{the validity of the}} safe region and recomputing it if invalidated. The size of the safe region largely de-cides the frequency of safe region recomputation and hence query processing efficiency. Existing moving k nearest neighbor algo-rithms lack efficiency due to either computing small safe regions and have to recompute frequently or computing large safe regions (i. e., an order-k Voronoi cell) with a high cost. In this paper, we take a third approach. Instead of safe regions, we use a small set of <b>safe</b> <b>guarding</b> objects. We prove that, as long as the the current k nearest neighbors are closer to the query ob-ject than the <b>safe</b> <b>guarding</b> objects, the current k nearest neighbors stay valid and no recomputation is required. This way, we avoid the high cost of safe region recomputation. We also prove that, the region defined by the <b>safe</b> <b>guarding</b> objects is the largest pos-sible safe region. This means that the recomputation frequency of our method is also minimized. We conduct extensive experiments comparing our method with the state-of-the-art method on both real and synthetic data sets. The results confirm the superiority of our method. 1...|$|R
