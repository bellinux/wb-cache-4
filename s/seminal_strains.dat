40|$|AbstractGenetic {{differences}} between blood and mucosal-derived HIV- 1 strains {{have been widely}} reported. As amplification of HIV- 1 strains from mucosal samples including semen or saliva by co-culture has low sensitivity, we developed the construction of chimeric viruses expressing wild-type seminal HIV- 1 envelope protein. Chimeric viruses were produced by co-transfection of a V 1 â€“V 3 deleted pNL 43 vector and PCR fragments spanning the deleted region, amplified from HIV- 1 RNA positive seminal plasma samples. After an initial testing of co-receptor usage by a tropism recombinant test, replication capacity and amplification of these recombinant viruses were assessed using PBMC. Four chimeric replicative strains, all using CXCR 4 as coreceptor, were produced. The interaction between cell-free viral particles and reporter cell lines was assessed by confocal microscopy. These replicative chimeras exhibiting HIV- 1 env from <b>seminal</b> <b>strains</b> represent useful tools for the in vitro study of the heterosexual transmission of HIV- 1 and testing of microbicide activity...|$|E
