5|$|Transport {{problems}} {{meant that}} the slate was usually used fairly close to the quarries. There was some transport by sea. A poem by the 15th century poet Guto'r Glyn asks the Dean of Bangor to send him a shipload of <b>slates</b> from Aberogwen, near Bangor, to Rhuddlan to roof a house at Henllan, near Denbigh. The wreck of a wooden ship carrying finished <b>slates</b> was discovered in the Menai Strait and is thought to date from the 16th century. By {{the second half of}} the 16th century, there was a small export trade of <b>slates</b> to Ireland from ports such as Beaumaris and Caernarfon. Slate exports from the Penrhyn estate are recorded from 1713 when 14 shipments totalling 415,000 <b>slates</b> were sent to Dublin. The <b>slates</b> were carried to the ports by pack-horses, and later by carts. This was sometimes done by women, the only female involvement in what was otherwise an exclusively male industry.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, Plymouth has {{a mixture}} of limestone, Devonian slate, granite and Middle Devonian limestone. Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because of its geology. The bulk {{of the city is}} built upon Upper Devonian <b>slates</b> and shales and the {{headlands}} at the entrance to Plymouth Sound are formed of Lower Devonian <b>slates,</b> which can withstand the power of the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtues of}} slate as a {{building}} and roofing material {{have been recognized}} since the Roman period. The Roman fort at Segontium, Caernarfon, was originally roofed with tiles, but the later levels contain numerous <b>slates,</b> used for both roofing and flooring. The nearest deposits are about five miles (8km) away in the Cilgwyn area, indicating that the <b>slates</b> were not used merely because they were available on-site. During the mediaeval period, there was small-scale quarrying of slate in several areas. The Cilgwyn quarry in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century, and {{is thought to be}} the oldest in Wales. The first record of slate quarrying in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413, when a rent-roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5,000 <b>slates.</b> Aberllefenni Slate Quarry may have started operating as a slate mine as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 16th century when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in <b>slates</b> from this quarry.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slate</b> {{industry}} is the industry {{related to the}} extraction and processing of <b>slate.</b> <b>Slate</b> is either quarried from a <b>slate</b> quarry or reached by tunneling in a <b>slate</b> mine. Common uses for <b>slate</b> include as a roofing material, a flooring material, gravestones and memorial tablets, and for electrical insulation. <b>Slate</b> mines are found {{around the world and}} the major <b>slate</b> mining region in the United Kingdom is Wales: in Cornwall {{there are a number of}} <b>slate</b> quarries (famously the village of Delabole) and in the Lake District there are numerous <b>slate</b> mines and quarries.|$|R
50|$|The Dark {{mutation}} {{produces a}} more noticeable effect {{in combination with}} <b>Slate</b> than it does with Grey, but these darker <b>Slate</b> shades differ from one another very much less than Skyblue, Cobalt and Mauve differ. The Cobalt <b>Slate</b> and Mauve <b>Slate</b> are distinctly darker than the Skyblue <b>Slate,</b> with the Mauve <b>Slate</b> being very dark. When Violet is also introduced the resulting Violet Mauve <b>Slate</b> {{is said to be}} extremely dark, of a dense blue-black colour.|$|R

5|$|Stone is quarried {{in various}} parts of Wales, and slate {{quarrying}} has been a major industry in North Wales. The Cilgwyn Quarry was being worked in the 12th century, but later Blaenau Ffestiniog became the centre of production. The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing <b>slates,</b> though at a reduced capacity compared to its heyday, and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a visitor attraction. Several of the railways that used to carry the <b>slates</b> to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions, including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.|$|E
5|$|The dark slaty shales {{may have}} the {{necessary}} cleavage and hardness to be worked, and were quarried for low grade roofing slate in eastern Pennsylvania during the 19th century. The <b>slates</b> from the Marcellus were inferior to the Martinsburg Formation slate quarried further south, and most quarries were abandoned, with the last significant operation in Lancaster County. The Marcellus black slate was also quarried in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, for school <b>slates</b> used by students in 19th-century rural schools.|$|E
5|$|In the 1989 form nominating {{it for the}} National Register of Historic Places, it {{was noted}} that the church had {{undergone}} only minor alterations, including an interior redecoration in 1964, the replacement of roof <b>slates</b> with asphalt shingles in 1977, and the addition of a concrete ramp for access by the handicapped in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>slate</b> in Europe {{comes from}} Spain, the world's largest {{producer}} and exporter of natural <b>slate,</b> and 90 percent of Europe's natural <b>slate</b> used for roofing originates from the <b>slate</b> industry there.|$|R

5|$|Other {{buildings}} {{constructed by}} David Balfour include the Dishan Tower, {{known locally as}} The Douche. This is a saltwater shower building with a dovecote on top. A local landmark due to its high visibility when approaching the island by sea, the building {{is now in a}} serious state of disrepair, with roofing <b>slates</b> missing and the dovecote in danger of collapsing.|$|E
5|$|Robert Mann's {{original}} 1730s {{house was}} a two-storey brick building seven bays wide with a break front. This was extended for the fifth Earl Cornwallis in 1825 by Thomas and William Cubitt. The Cubitts' alterations included adding a third storey to the original house and building two-storey wings four bays wide on each side. The {{house was a}}lso refinished with stucco render. Its hipped roof is covered with <b>slates.</b>|$|E
50|$|Writing is {{accomplished}} by placing a piece of heavy paper in the <b>slate,</b> aligning it correctly and closing the <b>slate.</b> The pins {{in the back of}} the <b>slate</b> puncture or pinch the paper securely between the two halves of the <b>slate.</b>|$|R

5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian <b>slates</b> and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four <b>slates</b> that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four <b>slates</b> are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|Externally, {{there are}} slate roofs and coped gables with cross finials. The roofs have {{patterned}} bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey <b>slates,</b> {{except on the}} nave. There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century addition of a north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the chancel, is less certain. Externally, the nave downpipes on the south side are dated 1884.|$|E
50|$|Bomoseen State Park {{has several}} quarry holes and {{adjacent}} colorful <b>slate</b> rubble piles. These quarries provided <b>slate</b> for the West Castleton Railroad and <b>Slate</b> Company, {{a complex of}} sixty to seventy buildings that stood between Glen Lake and Lake Bomoseen. Several <b>slate</b> buildings and foundations remain in the park, and a self-guided <b>Slate</b> History Trail brochure {{is available at the}} contact station.|$|R
50|$|Delta is at {{the heart}} of the Peach Bottom <b>Slate</b> Region. <b>Slate</b> {{quarries}} opened in Delta in the 1840s, as quarrymen arrived from Wales. At the Crystal Palace Exposition of 1850, Peach Bottom <b>slate</b> was judged the finest in the world. Most of Delta's houses still have <b>slate</b> roofs, and remnants of the original blue-black <b>slate</b> sidewalks still exist throughout the borough.|$|R
5000|$|A second <b>slate,</b> the [...] "Rabid Puppies", was {{announced}} {{a day later}} by Vox Day, taking most of the items from the Sad Puppies <b>slate</b> and adding additional works to form a similar but not completely overlapping <b>slate.</b> While the Sad Puppies <b>slate</b> was listed as [...] "recommendations," [...] Day explicitly instructed his followers to nominate the <b>slate</b> [...] "precisely as they are." ...|$|R
5|$|Further south {{there are}} newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte <b>Slates.</b> These include {{sandstone}} and limestone, {{which have been}} quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, is the only limestone cave in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger New Red Sandstone rocks of the Triassic period. These rocks were laid down in a shallow sea and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was mined on the foreshore at Watchet.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or <b>slates)</b> are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all <b>slates</b> and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{accepted}} his first teaching {{position in the}} First District School in Dresden from 1852 to 1853, and he taught at the Budich Institute beginning in 1854. Maeser continued his teaching career {{when he arrived in}} Utah. He taught at the Deseret Lyceum, an academy established in Salt Lake City in November 1860. The teachers at the Lyceum constructed school <b>slates</b> and performed janitor duties because conditions were so poor. When students' families could not afford to pay tuition, Maeser often collected payments of produce via wheelbarrow.|$|E
50|$|However, by 2002 it was {{no longer}} {{economical}} to extract <b>slate</b> at Aberllefenni and the mine closed. The <b>slate</b> mill continues to operate, processing <b>slate</b> imported from Blaenau Ffestiniog and Penrhyn. Small pieces of Aberllefenni <b>slate</b> are still available for name plates.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Slate</b> Valley (the {{district}} of Granville, New York) {{is well known}} for its <b>slate.</b> <b>Slate</b> was quarried in 1839 at Fair Haven, Vermont. An influx of immigrants from the North Wales <b>slate</b> quarrying communities saw a boom in <b>slate</b> production that peaked {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century. The <b>slate</b> of the region comes in a variety of colors, notably green, gray, black and red. Some production continued in 2003 with 23 operating full-time mines employing 348 people.|$|R

5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent <b>slates</b> in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|The Greaves Welsh Slate Company {{produces}} roofing <b>slates</b> {{and other}} slate products from Llechwedd, and work also continues at the Berwyn Quarry near Llangollen. The final large-scale underground working to close was Maenofferen, {{associated with the}} Llechwedd tourist mine, in 1999: part of this site, now effectively amalgamated with Votty / Bowydd, is still worked by untopping. The Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff uses waste slate in many different colours in its design: purple slate from Penrhyn, blue from Cwt-y-Bugail, green from Nantlle, grey from Llechwedd, and black from Corris.|$|E
5|$|The White House, {{originally}} {{dating back}} to 1750, is timber framed and was extended in 1830 {{and again in the}} 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung <b>slates,</b> which caused extensive damage to the original frame which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed in shape, to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up from the fire. The lawn {{in front of the building}} was the house's original turning circle, with the road once being a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.|$|E
50|$|Extensive <b>slate</b> {{deposits}} {{were located}} in 1846 in nearby Fair Haven, and in 1850 more <b>slate</b> deposits were found in Middle Granville.
