Laboratory analysis of individual carotenoids by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is time consuming, expensive, and not amenable to use beyond a research laboratory. The aim of this research is to establish a rapid, simple, and inexpensive <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>assay</b> of plasma total carotenoids that has a very strong correlation with HPLC carotenoid profile analysis. Results Plasma total carotenoids from 29 volunteers ranged in concentration from 1. 2 to 7. 4 μM, as analyzed by HPLC. A linear correlation was found between the absorbance at 448 nm of an alcohol / heptane extract of the plasma and plasma total carotenoids analyzed by HPLC, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 989. The average coefficient of variation for the <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>assay</b> was 6. 5 % for the plasma samples. The limit of detection was about 0. 3 μM and was linear up to about 34 μM without dilution. Correlations between the integrals of the absorption spectra in the range of carotenoid absorption and total plasma carotenoid concentration gave similar results to the absorbance correlation. <b>Spectrophotometric</b> <b>assay</b> results also agreed with the calculated expected absorbance based on published extinction coefficients for the individual carotenoids, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 988. Conclusion The <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>assay</b> of total carotenoids strongly correlated with HPLC analysis of carotenoids of the same plasma samples and expected absorbance values based on extinction coefficients. This rapid, simple, inexpensive assay, when coupled with the carotenoid health index, may be useful for nutrition intervention studies, population cohort studies, and public health interventions. </p...|$|E

Because enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse, enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the rate of reaction. There are many methods of measurement. <b>Spectrophotometric</b> <b>assays</b> observe change in the absorbance of light between products and reactants; radiometric assays involve the incorporation or release of radioactivity to measure the amount of product made over time. <b>Spectrophotometric</b> <b>assays</b> are most convenient since they allow {{the rate of the}} reaction to be measured continuously.

40|$|A new, {{continuous}} 96 -well plate <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>assay</b> for the branched-chain {{amino acid}} aminotransferases is described. Transamination of L-leucine with alpha-ketoglutarate results in formation of alpha-ketoisocaproate, which is reductively aminated back to L-leucine by leucine dehydrogenase {{in the presence}} of ammonia and NADH. The disappearance of absorbance at 340 nm due to NADH oxidation is measured continuously. The specific activities obtained by this procedure for the highly purified human mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of BCAT compare favorably with those obtained by a commonly used radiochemical procedure, which measures transamination between alpha-ketoiso[1 - 14 C]valerate and L-isoleucine. Due to the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase substrates (alpha-ketoglutarate, ammonia, and NADH) and L-leucine (an activator of glutamate dehydrogenase) in the standard assay mixture, interference with the measurement of BCAT activity in tissue homogenates by glutamate dehydrogenase is observed. However, by limiting the amount of ammonia and including the inhibitor GTP in the assay mixture, the interference from the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction is minimized. By comparing the rate of loss of absorbance at 340 nm in the modified <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>assay</b> mixture containing leucine dehydrogenase to that obtained in the modified <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>assay</b> mixture lacking leucine dehydrogenase, it is possible to measure BCAT activity in microliter amounts of rat tissue homogenates.
