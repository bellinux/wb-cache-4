We have always over-looked the emotional factors during machine learning and decision making; however, it is quite conceivable to artificially model certain emotions in machine learning. This paper presents an emotional neural network (EmNN) {{that is based on}} the emotional back propagation (EmBP) learning algorithm. The EmNN has emotional weights and two emotional parameters; anxiety and confidence, which are updated during learning. The performances of the EmNN and a conventional BP-based neural network, using two to-pologies for each network, will be compared when applied to a blood cell type identifica-tion problem. Experimental results show that the additional emotional parameters and weights improved the identification rate as well as the classification time...|$|E

You, as an eager candidate, comply with the request and, unbeknownst to you, the employer runs your picture through a software program that scans you for any common genetic diseases and that estimates your longevity. Alas, your face indicates that you may die young. No job for you. Although this <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction, we may not be that far off from this scenario. In June 2014, scientists from Oxford reported that they have developed a facial recognition program that uses ordinary family photos to help diagnose rare genetic conditions. This article discusses the heightened need for privacy when dealing with genetic conditions, an individual’s right not to know about their genetic predispositions, and the current and proposed regulatory regimes for facial recognition technology. It also considers whether health-related legislation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA), the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), or the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), provides adequate privacy protection from software that uses facial recognition to screen for diseases or health and concludes that they do not...|$|E

Because these challenges are presumably far from fruition, and perhaps even impossible, a special emphasis is placed on selecting incremental and affordable research that addresses the critical issues behind these challenges.

40|$|Most of {{what are}} called grains {{are members of the}} grass family, which has the {{scientific}} name of Gramineae or Poaceae. Grains are the most important plants in human diet, contributing most of the carbohydrates as well as a certain amount of protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Generally speaking, grains are quite undemanding in terms of soil or weather. Unfortunately most of our knowledge of raising grain in small quantities with simple tools has been lost, or at least it is hard to find. Nearly all of the present-day research is geared to modern agribusiness — hybridization, genetic engineering, and very expensive machinery and chemicals. The information gained from such research would be of no use if anything went wrong with the technical or economic infrastructure. Grains are all that stand between the human race and starvation, but the human race has made very little effort to record the fundamental information. For the purposes of survival and small-scale gardening, never get involved with hybrids or with genetically engineered grains; this is most commonly a question with corn. Hybrid grain cannot reproduce properly, so if you wanted more of the same you would have to buy again from the supplier. Genetically engineered grains pose a number of dangers, but the biggest problem is again that of reproduction, because such grains are often given a “terminator gene ” that prevents you from regrowing such seeds. The excuse for creating such a gene is that the manufacturers need to recover the cost of research and development — <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction, but it isn’t...|$|E
40|$|Building a {{computer}} out of living cells may <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction, but {{the foundations of}} such a technology are already being laid down. In the last 25 years we have seen astounding developments in microelectronics and computation, {{but even the most}} modern computers still have their weaknesses. First of all, current computer technology is fast approaching the limits of its capabilities, so there is considerable interest in finding newer, better technologies. Also, with current computers, a single fault in one circuit or a single line error in a program can cause the entire computer system to fail because these models rely heavily on the perfection of their parts and programming to function. In contrast, biological systems demonstrate remarkable robustness. For example, simple and potentially faulty cells cooperate to form incredibly complex structures during embryological development, which are subsequently well maintained. For computer engineers, there are clearly important lessons to b...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea behind}} {{pervasive}} computing is that embedded and invisible technology calms our lives {{by removing the}} annoyances. Everyday life, however, is shaped by what people do, how they do it, and how they perceive what they are doing. As a consequence everyday life is difficult to grasp in computational terms. A look at the pervasive computing literature indicates that {{in a number of}} pervasive computing scenarios these difficulties are addressed by assuming that it is feasible to build intelligent behavior and common-sense understanding into pervasive computing environments. We believe that such assumptions are prominent among the reasons why many pervasive computing scenarios still <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction although most of the technologies required are readily available. Making these assumptions along with known difficulties explicit would greatly help pervasive computing become part of everyday life. Example scenarios from the pervasive computing literature will be used to illustrate a number of difficulties and some of the lessons to be learned from related disciplines having investigated similar ideas before...|$|R
40|$|In {{the cinema}} history of astronomy, we are {{currently}} at {{the stage of the}} Lumiere brothers with contemporary surveys providing short monochromatic time sequences of the sky. By the end of the next decade, however, panchromatic blockbusters will be commonplace and science will be predominantly driven by the objects that change in successive “frames”. Web-scale computing resources will be required just to process the torrents of data events but the key to understanding them will be contextualisation — linking together disparate (sets of) events and relating them to archival and supplementary data in a machine-comprehensible way. Much of the data mining and analysis of such data portfolios will be performed by proxy scientists — intelligent agent avatars that represent an individual’s particular research interests in high-dimension parameter spaces. Although this view might <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction, in this paper, I will review the technologies that will make it achievable.

How should we take such claims? Are they just fantastic visions or hype meant to impress funding {{agencies and the}} public or are they symptoms of a specific epistemic attitude? In considering the visions of the future developed in synthetic biology the paper attempts to evaluate the research agendas of synthetic biology from philosophical perspectives. It will first characterize the ambition to re-engineer life and distinguish the visions of the future underlying the various research agendas assembled under the umbrella synthetic biology. Then addressing the question 'who actually believes in such futures?' the paper contrasts the complicit belief of ethicists and critical activists with the doubts occasionally formulated by synthetic biologists. Doubts however never generate scepticism within the synthetic biology community, which develops an epistemic opportunism. Finally the third section discusses to what extent, and in which sense, the futuristic visions of synthetic biology belong to the genre of techno-utopia. It concludes that imagined futures are {{integral part of the}} techno-epistemic culture of synthetic biology and that the tension between the possible and the actual is a criterion of distinction between the various trends that constitute synthetic biology...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology {{has been}} heralded as a "revolution" in science, for two reasons: first, {{because of its}} revolutionary view {{of the way in}} which {{chemicals}} and elements, such as gold and silver, behave, compared to traditional scientific understanding of their properties. Second, the impact of these new discoveries, as applied to commerce, can transform the daily life of consumer products ranging from sun tan lotions and cosmetics, food packaging and paints and coatings for cars, housing and fabrics, medicine and thousands of industrial processes. 9 Beneficial consumer use of nanotechnologies, already in the stream of commerce, improves coatings on inks and paints in everything from food packaging to cars. Additionally, "Nanomedicine" offers the promise of diagnosis and treatment at the molecular level in order to detect and treat presymptomatic disease, 10 or to rebuild neurons in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. There is a possibility that severe complications such as stroke or heart attack may be avoided by means of prophylactic treatment of people at risk, and bone regeneration may keep many people active who never expected rehabilitation. Miniaturisation of diagnostic equipment can also reduce the amount of sampling materials required for testing and medical surveillance. Miraculous developments, that <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction to those people who eagerly anticipate these medical products, combined with the emerging commercial impact of nanotechnology applications to consumer products will reshape civil society - permanently.
