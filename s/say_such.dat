25|$|Some ufologists <b>say</b> <b>such</b> {{seemingly}} impossible coincidences {{show that}} extraterrestrial beings had some {{influence on the}} evolution of life on Earth in the distant past (the theory of ancient astronauts), specifically that extraterrestrials were directly involved in the evolution of primates, including humans. This was supposedly done by genetic engineering, cross-breeding, or a combination of both. This idea may have first gained widespread exposure with the 1968 publication of Chariots of the Gods? by Erich von Däniken and has since been the source of much controversy, inspiring numerous other books with various related theories.|$|E

25|$|The {{chairman}} of the congress stopped Elbegdorj's speech and warned him not to <b>say</b> <b>such</b> things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that every other person was an unofficial communist party spy who would report people who expressed opinions other than socialism and communism. During the break of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to found a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to other young people. Later the three met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia's Democratic Revolution. On his return from the congress, his boss at the newspaper Ulaan Od warned Elbegdorj {{that he would be}} fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with other young people in the circle auditorium of the National University of Mongolia and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.|$|E
500|$|Seven were {{subsequently}} summoned {{to appear before}} a second commission in Paisley: Margaret Lang, John Lindsay, James Lindsay, John Reid, Catherine Campbell, Margaret Fulton, and Agnes Naismith. They were charged with murder and tormenting a number of people, including Christian Shaw. Their advocate, James Roberston, argued that the prosecution was obliged {{to rule out the}} possibility that the events surrounding the case could be explained by natural causes before a conviction could be safely secured. Matthew Brisbane gave evidence stating that he had been unable to find any such cause for Shaw's condition. James Hutchison, the minister of Kilallan, about [...] north of Paisley, delivered a sermon to the commission; it was commonplace at the time for a member of the clergy to preach to the court in Scottish witch trials, and they were not infrequently instrumental in securing convictions. Hutchison placed great store on the presence of witches' marks on the bodies of the accused, and cast doubt on the natural explanations of those marks offered by some physicians: [...] "And however doctors may <b>say</b> <b>such</b> and such things of it , we know not upon what ground. It may be that they have been budded and bribed to <b>say</b> <b>such</b> things".|$|E
500|$|... "Normally, {{failure to}} avail an {{interviewee}} of [...] would be fatal to {{the admission of}} a subsequent interview... However, the requirement is not absolute, nor can it be... it is not hollow {{to say that the}} suspect had the right to choose whether to proceed without that legal access. He had the right to choose not to answer, and wait for the legal bus which might never arrive, or to answer, in the legitimate aim of ultimate return to Australia. To <b>say</b> <b>such</b> a choice is no choice at all is revisionism." ...|$|E

500|$|Economics {{is often}} thought of as [...] "the study of how society manages its scarce resources" [...] and as such is limited to {{mathematical}} inquiry. Traditional economists often <b>say</b> <b>such</b> an approach assures objectivity and separates economics from [...] "softer" [...] fields such as sociology and political science. Feminist economists, argue on the contrary that a mathematical conception of economics limited to scarce resources is a holdover from {{the early years of}} science and Cartesian philosophy, and limits economic analysis. So feminist economists often call for more diverse data collection and broader economic models.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would <b>say</b> <b>such</b> a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: how could you do this to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E
500|$|Although his {{accession}} was {{at first}} welcomed by politicians of all parties, {{the first years of}} his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. George was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat. On his accession, the Crown lands produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the Crown Estate to Parliamentary control in return for a civil list annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government. Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts are disputed by historians who <b>say</b> <b>such</b> claims [...] "rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition". Debts amounting to over £3million over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time. He aided the Royal Academy of Arts with large grants from his private funds, and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity. Of his art collection, the two most notable purchases are Johannes Vermeer's Lady at the Virginals and a set of Canalettos, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered. The King's Library was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.|$|E

500|$|Lang did not {{disguise}} his {{relief that}} the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, how can you <b>say</b> <b>such</b> a thing!" [...] cried the archbishop. [...] "I only wish it was beginning over again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The phrase [...] "On the Bowery", {{which has}} since fallen into disuse, was a generic way to say one was down-and-out.

2500|$|Canadian {{columnist}} Paul Schneidereit has written, [...] " [...] we've seen {{cases where}} the bodies of Palestinian martyrs carried on stretchers are inadvertently dropped, then, of their own volition, climb back on again. We’ve seen reports of massacres, as in Jenin in 2002, that turned out, after independent investigation, to have been greatly exaggerated. Needless to <b>say,</b> <b>such</b> episodes don’t instil an abiding trust in subsequent Palestinian claims, at least until they’re verified." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{boundary}} is {{the scoring}} {{of four or}} six runs from a single delivery with the ball reaching the boundary of the field.
