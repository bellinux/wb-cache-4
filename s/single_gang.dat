60|$|The cornfield {{in front}} of our {{transports}} terminated {{at the edge of a}} dense forest. Before I got back the enemy had entered this forest and had opened a brisk fire upon the boats. Our men, with the exception of details that had gone to the front after the wounded, were now either aboard the transports or very near them. Those who were not aboard soon got there, and the boats pushed off. I was the only man of the National army between the rebels and our transports. The captain of a boat that had just pushed out but had not started, recognized me and ordered the engineer not to start the engine; he then had a plank run out for me. My horse seemed to take in the situation. There was no path down the bank and every one acquainted with the Mississippi River knows that its banks, in a natural state, do not vary at any great angle from the perpendicular. My horse put his fore feet over the bank without hesitation or urging, and with his hind feet well under him, slid down the bank and trotted aboard the boat, twelve or fifteen feet away, over a <b>single</b> <b>gang</b> plank. I dismounted and went at once to the upper deck.|$|E

While the LAPD indicates that the area is a sort of neutral zone, which has not been claimed by any <b>single</b> <b>gang</b> and random gang violence is rare, the area remains one of the major areas for street drug sales in Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|The BBC {{television}} {{drama series}} called Peaky Blinders, starring Cillian Murphy, premiered in October 2013.

After killing all of these gang members, a <b>single</b> <b>gang</b> member would move randomly around the screen with a woman next to him. This functioned a bit like a sharpshooting competition, as shooting the woman would cause the player to lose points, while successfully shooting only the ganger would cause her to [...] "take the arm" [...] of your character.|$|E

5000|$|It is a debated {{question}} whether the Peaky Blinders were a <b>single</b> <b>gang</b> or a local Birmingham term for a form of violent youth subculture. Eric Moonman states that youth street-gangs in Birmingham were known as [...] "Peaky Blinders" [...] or as [...] "Sloggers". Paul Thompson writes, [...] "These gangs would attack a drunkard and probably leave him insensible in the gutter. If they cannot trip a man or knock him down, they kick or use the buckles of belts, again similar to the Scuttlers of Manchester ... They will use knife, poker, fork or anything." ...|$|E

50|$|The use of gang {{injunctions}} can end {{up being}} very costly to the neighborhoods {{they are supposed to}} protect. When an injunction is implemented, the property of the entire community decreases which only exacerbates problems for the whole community rather than only aiming at gangs. The cost of a <b>single</b> <b>gang</b> injunction is approximately 40,000 dollars. The loss of value in properties affected once an injunction is implemented also is costly and can reach a cost of 12.2 billion dollars overall. By providing injunctions, the price of the injunction is being outweighed by the monetary gain of reducing the amount of crimes to process.|$|E

40|$|Using a <b>single</b> {{traditional}} <b>gang</b> scheduling algorithm cannot {{provide the}} best performance for all workloads and parallel architectures. A solution for this problem {{is the use of}} an algorithm that is capable of dynamically changing its form (configuration) into a more appropriate one, according to environment variations and user requirements. In this paper, we propose, implement and analyze the performance of a Reconfigurable Gang Scheduling Algorithm (RGSA) using simulation. The RGSA uses combinations of independent features that are often implemented in GSAs such as: packing and re-packing schemes (alternative scheduling etc.), multiprogramming levels etc. Ideally, the algorithm may assume infinite configurations and it reconfigures itself according to entry parameters such as: performance metrics (mean utilization, mean jobs response time etc.) and workload characteristics (mean jobs execution time, mean parallelism degree of jobs etc.). Also ideally, a reconfiguration causes the algorithm to output the best configuration for a particular situation considering the system's state at a given moment and based on past information. The main contributions of this paper are: the definition, proposal, implementation and performance analysis of RGSA...|$|R

The reputation of this class of people was anything but above suspicion, as is proved by the verse of Manetho (“Apotheles,” iv., 276), {{in which they are}} described as the “birds of the country, the foulest brood of the city.” Male and female jugglers jumped forward and backward over swords or tables; girls threw up and caught again a number of balls or hoops to the accompaniment of a musical instrument; others displayed an astounding skill with their feet and toes while standing on their hands.|$|R
5000|$|Gang Affiliated is {{the debut}} album {{released}} by Gospel Gangstaz. It {{was released on}} October 28, 1994 for MYX Records and featured production from DJ Dove and Mr. Solo. The album is widely considered as the first harder-edged Christian rap album as the sound and lyrics had a gritty element to them that was virtually unseen in the genre {{at the time as}} this album sounded much like the popular West Coast Gangsta G-funk music of the Mid-90's. Gang Affiliated managed to make it to 19 on the Top Christian Albums Billboard chart, however the three <b>singles,</b> [...] "Mobbin' (<b>Gang</b> Affiliated)", [...] "Testimony" [...] and [...] "Y Cain't da Homiez Hear Me?"

This giant alliance would be called [...] "The Family", and every gang would become a division in the larger gang.
