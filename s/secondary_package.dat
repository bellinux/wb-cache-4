40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test and compare Monolayer, Amosorb 2 %, and Multilayer 3 % PET wine jugs for package integrity and mechanical properties. In addition, two <b>secondary</b> <b>package</b> configurations were tested and analyzed. The first a shipper with load bearing inserts, the second configuration consisted of no inserts. Further, both shipping configurations and PET material have different costs associated. A Monolayer PET bottle has a savings of 17 % a case compared to Amosorb and Multilayer PET bottle substrate. Shippers not utilizing inserts are $. 20 less per case. The analysis was broken into three test and result phases. Phase I used compression testing to compare PET variables with two different shipper configurations. One shipper configuration was tested with load bearing inserts, the second with no inserts. The minimum compression force calculated was 500 lbs (based on warehouse stacking). Phase II testing included drop and vibration for <b>secondary</b> <b>package</b> configurations. Phase III tested primary package compression strength and drop testing. The results concluded both shipper configurations met the minimum 500 lbs compression force. Therefore a shipper with no insert is recommended for a savings of $. 20 a case. Multilayer PET did not pass performance testing due to delaminating. Both Monolayer and Amosorb passed testing, however, Monolayer is recommended for production due to the 17 % cost savings on material...|$|E

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen {{attempts}} to replace non biodegradable, synthetic food packaging films with alternatives made from biopolymers. The objective of the present work was to evaluate sensory quality of tea leaf and culinary tastemaker powder when sealed in pouches based on starch films. Films were developed from corn starch and a functional polysaccharide (FP) from amylose (AM), methylcellulose (MC), and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), using a casting technique. Pouches were stored inside a <b>secondary</b> <b>package</b> (plastic jar) under ambient condition for 90 days. Sensory attributes of the stored food samples were evaluated (tea in liquor form) and the scores analysed by fuzzy logic. Results were compared with similarly stored foods but using market available poly-pouches as packaging material. For tea and tastemaker in general, {{the relative importance of}} the sensory attributes under consideration was assessed as:  aroma (Highly important) >taste (Highly important) >colour (Highly important) > strength (Important) for tea, and taste (Highly important) >aroma (Highly important) >colour (Important) >appearance (Important) for tastemaker. Among the three films that were developed, the highly important sensory attributes of aroma and taste were maintained as ‘Very good’ when the foods were packed in starch–HPMC/AM film. When the products were packed in market-available poly-pouches they exhibited similar attributes. With the exception of ‘Very good’ maintenance of the colour of tastemaker by the commercial pouch, irrespective of film and food, the colour and strength/appearance were retained in the ‘Good’-‘Satisfactory’ range. The overall sensory score of tea was also maintained as ‘Very good’ in starch-HPMC film. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the thermal inertia of a pallet loaded with returnable plastic crates containing primary packages of smoked ham. Based on this, food quality variations within the pallet were also investigated. Thermal time constants from 83 sensor locations were identified by studying the temperature changes when the pallet was exposed to instant temperature drops (16 C - 2 C) and temperature elevations (2 C - 16 C). The thermal time constants were used in microbiological prediction models to calculate the maximum difference in shelf life between packages at the two most extreme spots in the pallet unit load, when temperature elevated from 4 C to a higher temperature (ranging from 4. 5 C to 12 C), during different periods of time (ranging from 0. 5 h to 200 h). The results showed a maximum difference in shelf life of approximately 1. 8 days. The identified thermal time constants were also {{used to calculate the}} maximum difference in shelf life between packages at the two most extreme spots of a pallet unit load, in a real chilled food supply chain lasting for about 2. 5 days. This resulted in a maximum difference of 0. 1 days. The results imply that the location of a product in a pallet has a relatively low influence on the product shelf life. This means that a temperature sensor used for calculating the predicted shelf life of a product, can be placed relatively far from the product itself (e. g. on the <b>secondary</b> <b>package</b> or even on the pallet) without jeopardizing the reliability of the resulting shelflife prediction. However, the results also emphasize the importance of continuous temperature monitoring along the entire chilled food supply chains...|$|E
