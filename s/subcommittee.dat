5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary <b>Subcommittee</b> on Constitutional Rights. On the latter <b>subcommittee,</b> Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and <b>subcommittee</b> chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E

Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate <b>subcommittee</b> argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E
