25|$|Soon {{after the}} break-in, Nixon's team (chiefly Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean) asked Helms in effect to assert a phony {{national}} <b>security</b> <b>reason</b> for the break-in and, under that rationale, {{to interfere with}} the ongoing FBI investigation of the Watergate burglaries. Such a course would also involve the CIA in posting bail for the arrested suspects. Initially Helms made some superficial accommodation that stalled for several weeks the FBI's progress. At several meetings attended by Helms and Walters, Nixon's team referred to the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco, using it as if a talisman of dark secrets, as an implied threat against the integrity of CIA. Immediately, sharply, Helms turned aside this gambit.|$|E

50|$|Dennis and Brockhurst, old antagonists in {{conflicts}} {{between the military and}} the press, clash again when Jenks attempts to reveal the day's target to the reporter. Kane asks Brockhurst to leave for <b>security</b> <b>reason,</b> and Dennis identifies the target as Schweinhafen. Kanes realizes Dennis has begun Operation Stitch in Kane's absence. Kane takes Jenks outside to talk to him privately; in his absence Garnett quibbles with Dennis over the danger inherent in Ted Martin leading missions. When Kane returns, Garnett demands to be informed about the nature of Stitch. Dennis outlines the threat of new German German jet fighters, and that Stitch seeks to destroy the factories building them before they can go into operation and crush American strategic bombing. It becomes clear that Kane has deliberately withheld information about the jet from the Pentagon to delay the operation and hold down losses.|$|E

The importance of rubber production in India can a strategic and <b>security</b> <b>reason</b> had been realized by the government during the Second World War period. The rubber growers in India were encouraged to produce the maximum rubber required for the use during war. After the war, there were growing demands from the growers for setting up a permanent organisation {{to look after the}} interests of the industry. Thereupon the government set up an ad hoc committee in 1945 to study the situation and to make appropriate recommendation. On the recommendation of this ad hoc committee, the government passed the Rubber (Production and Marketing) Act, 1947, on 18 April 1947, and the Indian Rubber Board was constituted forthwith. The Rubber Production and Marketing (Amendment) Act, 1954, amended the name of the Board as The Rubber Board ...|$|E
