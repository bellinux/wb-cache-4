5|$|Critics of the {{argument}} include Averroes, who objected to its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who disagreed with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes allows people to accept parts of {{the argument}} but still reject God's existence. There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification {{of the argument}}; some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ontological while others say it is cosmological.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that {{to allow them to}} do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

50|$|From a {{psychological}} operations perspective, The Vietnam War Phoenix Program is controversial to this day. Supporters <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a legal and closely controlled US-Vietnamese intelligence {{program aimed at}} destroying the Vietcong infrastructure, while the critics <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an illegal system of arresting, torturing and murdering innocent Vietnamese civilians...|$|R

For instance one French site <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more or less bitter {{and because of this}} characteristic and its soft consistency, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> best left aside. [...] Another site <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> edible but needs to be well cooked.|$|R
5000|$|Ethnologue {{notes that}} Songe is [...] "related" [...] to Mbagani, {{which they do}} not include in their database. Maho (2009) labels as [...] "Mbagani (Binji)" [...] {{one of the two}} {{geographic}} areas Ethnologue assigns to Songe, but <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> closer to Lwalu; he <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a different language, Binji, that is close to Songe.|$|R
25|$|Some grammarians, however, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{only the}} past that can be connoted in this construction; the option of connoting {{the present and future}} is no longer available. And others say that no tense at all can be connoted.|$|E
25|$|Critics of Alford’s theory <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> atheistic, that planets do not explode, or {{that the}} ancients did not even {{understand}} the concept of a planet. More pertinent are the critics who suggest he is wrong to see the exploded planet as a monolithic explanation of all myth.|$|E
25|$|Critics say {{large-scale}} CCS deployment is unproven {{and decades}} {{away from being}} commercialized. They <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> risky and expensive and that a better option is renewable energy. Some environmental groups point out that CCS technology leaves behind dangerous waste material {{that has to be}} stored, just like nuclear power stations.|$|E

50|$|In the 1930s, the aerodrome {{may have}} moved further along Canewdon Road in Ashingdon. Some people <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> moved by {{expanding}} {{into the larger}} adjacent field. Others <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have <b>been</b> at two separate locations in that road and others deny both suggestions and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only ever at one place in Canewdon Road. The aerodrome was called Canute Aero Park, after King Canute the Great, {{as well as being}} called Ashingdon Aerodrome.|$|R
25|$|A {{complimentary}} {{definition of}} principal root (though not formally defined or universally accepted) is to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> always the complex root {{that has the}} least value of the argument among all roots; here “argument” means the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive real axis and the line joining the complex number to the origin.|$|E
25|$|Conservative Judaism {{has always}} been premised on the total embrace of {{critical}} inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, I would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a mitzvah {{to learn about the}} world and the way it works {{to the best of our}} abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.|$|E
25|$|According to H. L. Oldie, {{writing in}} Russian is {{an easier way}} for Ukrainian authors to be {{published}} and reach a broader audience. The authors <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> because of Ukraine's ineffective book publishing policy: while Russian publishers are interested in popular literature, Ukrainian publishers rely mostly on grant givers. Many Ukrainian publishers agree and complain about low demand and low profitability for books in Ukrainian, compared to books in Russian.|$|E

50|$|The Laurentian was {{a society}} of Trinity College, Dublin, created during the {{academic}} year 1952-3. Trinity News articles differ in the exact year in which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> founded, since one number <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> created in 1952, whereas other <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> created in 1953. The fact that the very society celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1963 makes the latter date seem more probable.|$|R
25|$|Fielding for a fast bowler {{is usually}} aggressive, {{that is to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{set up for the}} purpose of getting a wicket rather than {{preventing}} the flow of runs. On occasion, particularly when the fielding team is batting last and is chasing a total, a defensive field is required. As a general rule it is difficult to bowl defensive fast bowling – that task is better suited to spin bowlers.|$|E
25|$|CCDC130 {{has shown}} to be {{differentially}} expressed in several cancers, including breast, colon, and pancreatic through microarray studies of cancer cells. It was {{shown to be}} down-regulated in colon cancers, suggesting {{that it could be}} a biomarker for cancers. There is still research being done on this topic to confirm its function as a cancer identifier. Many websites also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> involved in the cell's response to viral infection, but there is no specific information on this nor any elaboration.|$|E
25|$|In recent decades, Christine de Pizan's {{work has}} been {{returned}} to prominence by the efforts of scholars such as Charity Cannon Willard, Earl Jeffrey Richards and Simone de Beauvoir. Certain scholars have argued {{that she should be}} seen as an early feminist who efficiently used language to convey that women could play an important role within society. This characterization has been challenged by other critics, who <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> either an anachronistic use of the word or a misinterpretation of her writing and intentions.|$|E

Others <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> founded in the 7th century by {{the army corps of}} the Khurasanid dynasty. In any case, this market existed during the Hafsid dynasty.|$|R

25|$|In response, many {{communities}} began passing ordinances that either restricted or prohibited their sale outright. The head shops and other sellers of paraphernalia challenged them in court. While some surivived, many early ones were overturned by courts as vague {{due to their}} drafters' lack of familiarity with the targeted items {{and the fact that}} most smoking equipment {{can also be used to}} smoke tobacco and other legal substances, therefore making it hard to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> intended and sold only with illegal use in mind.|$|E
25|$|Some African American {{students}} have reported feeling that their self-esteem {{has been raised}} by the class. However, some students feel that the class has shortcomings; they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> pretty similar to a typical US history course, and that critical conversations about race are generally absent from class. The class does not always relate the topics of the course to issues related to race and racism that are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E
25|$|For example: A person seeks donations. That {{person may}} find another person willing to donate a {{substantial}} sum. However, {{if the person}} seeking the donations met the person donating, not {{for the purpose of}} collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> by chance.|$|E

25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability to describe it. That is enough under the law to allow a court to consider such activity harmful to a child. To declare that homosexuality is harmful {{is not to make}} new law but to reaffirm the old; to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} by Fitch, a credit-rating agency, determined {{that as many}} as four of Atlantic City's eight casinos would be bankrupted by expanding casino gambling outside the city. Supporters of gambling in North Jersey say that the measure would help Atlantic City by redirecting as much as $200 million a year in tax revenue to the city. Opponents <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unlikely that much revenue would be generated and that it would not make up for the losses due to new competition. In recent years four Atlantic City casinos have closed, causing severe economic problems.|$|E
25|$|Under this scheme, {{the foreign}} partner {{that makes the}} initial {{investment}} can repatriate the return on the investment (at a pre-agreed fixed rate) through goods and services produced by the project. While many foreign companies believe that this method is a mere financing instrument for Iran, it is more accurate to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a compromise formula for foreign investment in the short-run. In the medium to long-term, more appropriate laws and regulations will probably replace the buy-back scheme. In other words, once the constitutional concerns have been dealt with, the foreign partners of buy-back agreements can take over the projects that they are involved in, or they can enter into {{a joint venture with}} an Iranian partner.|$|E
