5|$|Vaporising the {{additional}} flux requires greater {{heat in the}} wire, so these gasless machines operate as DCEP, rather than the DCEN usually used for GMAW to give deeper penetration. DCEP, or DC Electrode Positive, makes the welding wire into the positively-charged anode, which is the hotter side of the arc. Provided that it is <b>switchable</b> from DCEN to DCEP, a gas-shielded wire-feed machine may {{also be used for}} flux-cored wire.|$|E

5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and <b>switchable</b> windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with <b>switchable</b> battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E

25|$|Plasma polymer {{surfaces}} with tunable wettability and reversibly <b>switchable</b> pH-responsiveness {{have shown}} the promising prospects due to their unique property in applications, such as drug delivery, biomaterial engineering, oil/water separation processes, sensors, and biofuel cells.|$|E
25|$|Electro-wetting display (EWD) {{is based}} on {{controlling}} {{the shape of a}} confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the <b>switchable</b> element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast <b>switchable</b> element.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{tungsten}} trioxide has been {{employed in the}} production of electrochromic windows, or smart windows. These windows are electrically <b>switchable</b> glass that change light transmission properties with an applied voltage. This allows the user to tint their windows, changing the amount of heat or light passing through.|$|E
25|$|Some {{architectures}} (including ARM versions 3 and above, PowerPC, Alpha, SPARC V9, MIPS, PA-RISC, SuperH SH-4 and IA-64) {{feature a}} setting {{which allows for}} <b>switchable</b> endianness in data fetches and stores, instruction fetches, or both. This feature can improve performance or simplify the logic of networking devices and software. The word bi-endian, when said of hardware, denotes the capability of the machine to compute or pass data in either endian format.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the later}} G2 Contender, the {{original}} Contender may be safely dry-fired (provided the hammer is not drawn {{back from the}} second notch) to allow a shooter {{to become familiar with}} the trigger pull. The break-action only has to be cycled, while leaving the hammer in the second notch position, to practice dry-firing. G2's with <b>switchable</b> firing pins (centerfire or rimfire) can be safely dry-fired with the hammer only in the safety (center) position.|$|E
25|$|After several {{supporting}} {{experiments were}} published, Jacques et al. claimed that an experiment of theirs follows fully the original scheme proposed by Wheeler. Their complicated experiment {{is based on}} the Mach-Zender interferometer, involving a triggered diamond N-V colour centre photon generator, polarization, and an electro-optical modulator acting as a <b>switchable</b> beam splitter. Measuring in a closed configuration showed interference, while measuring in an open configuration allowed the path of the particle to be determined, which made interference impossible.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveform}} generator {{is a fundamental}} module in a sound synthesis system. A {{waveform generator}} usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), square wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology comprise the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console, and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (<b>switchable</b> between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave duty cycle), a channel for 4-bit PCM playback, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64, however, used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each <b>switchable</b> between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.|$|E
25|$|The {{changeover}} {{to selling}} of petrol by the litre {{rather than by}} the gallon took place after the Board was wound up. It was prompted by a technical shortcoming of petrol pump design: pumps (which were electro-mechanical) had been designed to be <b>switchable</b> between metric and imperial units, but had no provisions for prices above £1.999 per unit of fuel. Once the price of petrol rose above £1 per gallon, the industry requested that they be permitted to sell fuel by the litre rather than the gallon, enabling them to reduce the unit price by a factor of about 4.5 and so to extend the lives of existing pumps.|$|E
25|$|Phonon is {{the name}} of the {{multimedia}} API in KDE4. Phonon is a different approach to multimedia backends than in previous versions of KDE. This is because Phonon only functions as a wrapper, abstracting the various multimedia frameworks available for Unix-like operating systems into runtime <b>switchable</b> backends that can be accessed through a single API. This was done to provide a stable API for KDE 4 and to prevent it from depending on a single multimedia framework. Applications that use the Phonon API can be switched between multimedia frameworks seamlessly by simply changing the backend used in System Settings. Nokia adopted Phonon for multimedia use in Qt4.4 and are developing backends for Gstreamer, Windows and OS X in the KDE SVN repository under the LGPL.|$|E
25|$|The Better Place {{network was}} the first modern {{commercial}} deployment of the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. {{was the first}} electric car enabled with <b>switchable</b> battery technology available for the Better Place network in operation in Israel and Denmark. Better Place used the same technology to swap batteries that F-16 jet fighter aircraft use to load their bombs. Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The battery exchange process took five minutes. , about 600 Fluence Z.E.s had been sold in the country. Sales {{during the first quarter}} of 2013 improved, with 297 cars sold, bringing the total fleet in Israel close to 900. , there were 17 battery switch stations fully operational in Denmark, enabling customers to drive anywhere across the country in an electric car. Fluence Z.E. sales totaled 198 units through December 2012.|$|E
25|$|Wheeler's {{version of}} the double-slit {{experiment}} is arranged so that the same photon that emerges from two slits can be detected in two ways. The first way lets the two paths come together, lets the two copies of the wavefunction overlap, and shows interference. The second way moves {{farther away from the}} photon source to a position where the distance between the two copies of the wavefunction is too great to show interference effects. The technical problem in the laboratory is how to insert a detector screen at a point appropriate to observe interference effects or to remove that screen to reveal the photon detectors that can be restricted to receiving photons from the narrow regions of space where the slits are found. One way to accomplish that task would be to use the recently developed electrically <b>switchable</b> mirrors and simply change directions of the two paths from the slits by switching a mirror on or off. As of early 2014 no such experiment has been announced.|$|E
25|$|High-pass {{filters are}} also used for AC {{coupling}} at the inputs of many audio power amplifiers, for preventing the amplification of DC currents which may harm the amplifier, rob the amplifier of headroom, and generate waste heat at the loudspeakers voice coil. One amplifier, the professional audio model DC300 made by Crown International beginning in the 1960s, did not have high-pass filtering at all, and {{could be used to}} amplify the DC signal of a common 9-volt battery at the input to supply 18 volts DC in an emergency for mixing console power. However, that model's basic design has been superseded by newer designs such as the Crown Macro-Tech series developed in the late 1980s which included 10Hz high-pass filtering on the inputs and <b>switchable</b> 35Hz high-pass filtering on the outputs. Another example is the QSC Audio PLX amplifier series which includes an internal 5Hz high-pass filter which is applied to the inputs whenever the optional 50 and 30Hz high-pass filters are turned off.|$|E
25|$|Tonearm skating {{forces and}} other {{perturbations}} are also {{picked up by}} the stylus. This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal (restoring force) used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic frequencies below about 20Hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble ("tracking noise") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5Hz (the frequency at which a rpm record turns on the turntable; Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for very low frequency material can be a warped disk: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a <b>switchable</b> subsonic filter. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the <b>switchable</b> rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E

500|$|Like the E-series HSV GTS, the {{suspension}} is fitted with <b>switchable</b> Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide") offering Luxury or Performance modes. It does this by electrically adjusting the viscosity of the ferrofluid inside the shock absorbers, producing different damping levels. Magnetic Ride Control also enhances braking by preventing forward weight transfer {{when the car}} is under heavy braking. The MRC system development took three years and cost HSV more than $4.5 million.|$|E
500|$|The Acoustic Seismic Intrusion Detector (ACOUSID), {{combined}} {{the operations of}} both seismic and acoustic devices, with the added ability to transmit sound from a built-in microphone. The ACOUSID had three <b>switchable</b> detection modes: in the C mode, a line spectrum detector determined the presence of enemy vehicles and had an effective range of an I Mode which was activated by sounds picked up by its internal microphone and could detect personnel at a range of and a B Mode that combined both of the above abilities and operated in a continuous real-time mode of 40 activations per hour with a battery life of 30 days.|$|E

2500|$|Modifications to {{the bridge}} {{commenced}} in March 1982, and were completed by 3 September the same year, at a total cost of $435,000.

2500|$|Both bogies are {{powered by}} two forced-air cooled {{traction}} motors each. Each motor has a continuous power rating of 1,250kW, the UIC power {{rating of the}} vehicle is 4,800kW, and the largest starting tractive effort 200kN. The drive system uses asynchronous three-phase AC motors pioneered in the Henschel-BBC DE2500 locomotives {{as well as the}} InterCityExperimental. These motors are fitted between bogies and frame using pneumatics that are electronically adjusted depending on the current speed ("Umschaltbare Antriebsmasse UmAn," [...] i.e., <b>switchable</b> drive mass). The power cars are directly derived from the Class 120 locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|Particle {{detection}} of alpha and beta can {{used in both}} integral and two-piece designs. A pancake probe (for alpha/beta) is generally used to increase the area of detection in two-piece instruments whilst being relatively light weight. In integral instruments using an end window tube there is a window {{in the body of}} the casing to prevent shielding of particles. [...] There are also hybrid instruments which have a separate probe for particle detection and a gamma detection tube within the electronics module. The detectors are <b>switchable</b> by the operator, depending the radiation type that is being measured.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Marshall updated {{its product}} line {{again with the}} JCM900 series. Reviewed by Guitarist {{magazine}} in the UK and given the line, [...] "Shredders, here is an amp you won't need to have modified", this move by Marshall was again an outgrowth of musicians' desires, featuring more distortion than ever and retaining popular aspects of the late JCM800 models. However, despite such marketing claims they were not as hi-gain as advertised and lacked a full gain stage. Marshall rectified this with the SL-X series (as used by the group Kiss). This model was one channel, 2 <b>switchable</b> master volumes, and was given an additional pre-amp ECC83/12AX7 instead of diode-based distortion. Still, if not for shredders, the JCM900 was well received by younger players associated with pop, rock, punk and grunge which was widespread by the early 1990s. The Dual Reverb was also notably used by Dave Navarro.|$|E
2500|$|A {{landmark}} {{year for}} Jim Marshall was 1987. It marked 25 {{years in the}} amplifier business and 50 years in music. This was celebrated {{with the release of}} the Silver Jubilee series of amps. The Silver Jubilee series consisted of the 2555 (100 watt head), 2550 (50 watt head) along with other 255x model numbers denominating various combos and even a [...] "short head". The Jubilee amps were heavily based on the JCM800s of the time, featuring a very similar output section along with a new preamp. Their most publicised feature was the half-power switching, which is activated by a third rocker switch next to the standard [...] "power" [...] and [...] "standby" [...] switches. On the 50-watt model this was reflected in the numbering – 2550 is <b>switchable</b> from 25 to 50 watts – and also reflected Marshall amps' 25th anniversary and Jim Marshall's 50 years in music. The amps were trimmed in silver covering, and had a bright silver-coloured faceplate, along with a commemorative plaque.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} Amiga 500 models use {{nearly the}} same Original Amiga chipset as the Amiga 1000. So graphics can be displayed in multiple resolutions and color depths, even on the same screen. Resolutions vary from 320×200 (up to 32 colors) to 640×200 (up to 16 colors) for NTSC (704×484 overscan) and 320×256 to 640×256 for PAL (704×576 overscan.) The system uses planar graphics, with up to five bitplanes (four in high resolution) allowing 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-color screens, from a palette of 4096 colors. Two special graphics modes are also available: Extra HalfBrite, which uses a 6th bitplane as a mask to cut the brightness of any pixel in half (resulting in 32 arbitrary colors plus 32 more colors set at half {{the value of the}} first 32), and [...] which allows all 4096 colors to be used on screen simultaneously. Later revisions of the chipset are PAL/NTSC <b>switchable</b> in software.|$|E
2500|$|Shotshell presses {{typically}} use {{a charge}} bar to drop precise amounts of shot and powder. [...] Most commonly, these charge bars are fixed in their capacities, {{with a single}} charge bar rated at, say, 1-1/8 oz. of lead shot, with a <b>switchable</b> powder bushing that permits dropping precisely measured fixed amounts {{of different types of}} powder repetitively (e.g., MEC.) [...] On the other hand, some charge bars are drilled to accept bushings for dropping different fixed amounts of both shot and powder (e.g. Texan.) [...] For the ultimate in flexibility, though, universal charge bars with micrometers dropping fixed volumes of powder and shot are also available; these are able to select differing fixed amounts of both powder and shot, and are popular for handloaders who load more than just a few published recipes, or, especially, among those who wish to experiment with numerous different published recipes. [...] Fixed charge bars are rated for either lead or steel shot, but not for both. [...] Universal charge bars, on the other hand, are capable of reloading both lead or steel shot, being adjustable.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity was {{provided}} via a bleed air-driven turbine {{housed in the}} rear fuselage, which in turn drove an AC alternator and DC generator; the approach was considered unusual at the time due to most aircraft using driveshaft-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power. Aviation author Kev Darling stated of the Lightning: [...] "Never before had a fighter been so dependent upon electronics". Each engine was equipped {{with a pair of}} hydraulic pumps, one of which would provide pressure for the flight-control systems and the other, pressure for the undercarriage, flaps, and airbrakes; <b>switchable</b> hydraulic circuits were used for redundancy {{in the event of a}} leak or other failure. A combination of Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes on the main wheels and an Irvin Air Chute braking parachute slowed the aircraft during landing; a tailhook was also fitted. Accumulators on the wheel brakes performed as backups to the hydraulics, providing minimal braking. Above a certain airspeed a stopped engine would 'windmill', i.e., continue to be rotated by the air flowing through it in a similar manner to a ram air turbine, sufficiently to still generate adequate hydraulic power for the powered controls during flight.|$|E
2500|$|... 1992 marked 30 {{years in}} the {{amplifier}} business. To commemorate this milestone, Marshall released the 30th Anniversary series of amplifiers, the EL34 powered 6100LE with commemorative blue covering and gold faceplate, which {{was followed by the}} 6100 (in blue tolex and still EL34 powered) and then in 1994 the 6100LM (in standard Marshall livery but now 5881 powered like the JCM900s of the time). All versions of the 6100 had three channels; clean, crunch and lead. The clean channel featured a mid shift, which gave the option of a more [...] "Fender-like" [...] voicing, and the crunch channel featured three modes recreating all the classic Marshall crunch tones of the past three decades. The lead channel featured a <b>switchable</b> gain boost and a mid-range contour switch, which gave it the tone and gain levels, which Marshall's engineers hoped would keep it competitive in the high-gain world in the early to mid-1990s. In fact some players felt the lead channel was perhaps the weaker link in the amplifier's arsenal, and it came in for revisions in the third year of production (the LM standing for [...] "Lead Mod"). This revision featured even higher gain.|$|E

On 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about [...] million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark.|$|E
