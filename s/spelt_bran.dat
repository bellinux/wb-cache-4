40|$|In this study, {{polyvinyl}} alcohol films incorporated with lysozyme, as active compound, and natural fibres were investigated. Various composite systems {{were developed to}} control the release of lysozyme from the matrix by using different surface treatments of the natural fibres. Specifically, the plasma enhanced-chemical vapour deposition of acrylic acid and diamond-like coating on <b>spelt</b> <b>bran</b> powders, in a particular home-made rotating plasma reactor, were studied. Moreover, a mathematical model able to describe the release kinetics of the active compound from the {{polyvinyl alcohol}} film into water was presented. To validate the model the release kinetic of lysozyme were determined. The model was successfully used to fit the above experimental data, corroborating {{the validity of the}} hypothesis made to derive it. Results showed that the incorporation of treated natural fibres to the polymeric matrix allows to obtaining a decrease of the lysozyme diffusion coefficient up to 73. 5 % compared to active film without fibre...|$|E
40|$|Goal of {{this thesis}} was to {{formulate}} and create pasta from spelt products with diferent recipies. 14 recipies of pasta were created, 7 {{for each of}} color-flavouring agent. There were made from <b>spelt</b> <b>bran,</b> soft spelt white flour, spelt wholegrain flour, color-flavouring agent eithet spinach powder or red beet powder, salt and water. Color-flavouring agent spinach was labeled as "A", red beet powder as "B". In recipies 1 A/B [...] 4 A/B, the main variable part of the recipe was wheat bran, flour was added as residual to the 500 g of whole mixture. 3 % of spinach/red beet powder was used constantly. In recipies 5 A/B [...] 7 A/B the wholegrain spelt flour was used as constant part, variable part was addition of spinach/red beet powder with aim to study the changing properties of pasta with increasing percentge of color-flavouring agent. As methods to evaulate the quality of pasta were selected measuring of color by spectrometer, measuring of frigidity and sensory analysis. The best recipe {{seemed to be the}} one from wholegrain flour with addition of 3 % of color-flavourinf agent...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus terricola and Aspergillus ochraceus, {{isolated}} from Brazilian soil, were cultivated in Vogel and Adams media supplemented with 20 different carbon sources, at 30 A degrees C, under static conditions, for 120 and 144 h, respectively. High levels of cellulase-free xylanase were produced in birchwood or oat <b>spelt</b> xylan-media. Wheat <b>bran</b> {{was the most}} favorable agricultural residue for xylanase production. Maximum activity was obtained at 60 A degrees C and pH 6. 5 for A. terricola, and 65 A degrees C and pH 5. 0 for A. ochraceus. A. terricola xylanase was stable for 1 h at 60 A degrees C and retained 50 % activity after 80 min, while A. ochraceus xylanase presented a t (50) of 10 min. The xylanases were stable in an alkali pH range. Biobleaching of 10 U/g dry cellulose pulp resulted in 14. 3 % delignification (A. terricola) and 36. 4 % (A. ochraceus). The brightness was 2. 4 - 3. 4 % ISO higher than the control. Analysis in SEM showed defibrillation of the microfibrils. Arabinase traces and beta-xylosidase were detected which might act synergistically with xylanase.
