After some distance, it enters Dickson City and reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-defined}} {{low pressure}} system located about 350statute miles (560km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Bermuda organized into a tropical depression on September 5. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Nate that evening {{and continued to}} strengthen with little change in position, becoming the sixth hurricane of the season on September 7.|$|E
5|$|The first {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} formed 75mi (120km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Puerto Vallarta on June 11. Tropical Storm One headed out to sea without intensifying further than 50mph (80km/h). Heading west-northwestward, the storm dissipated on July 12, centered roughly halfway between Socorro Island and Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two were when the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the <b>south-southwest,</b> which was the strongest ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average wind speed of 45mph (72km/h), along with a wind gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two weeks of July, a series of low {{pressure}} areas formed off the coast of Mexico. The fourth of these was spawned by a tropical wave several hundred miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on July9. Amid favorable conditions, convection associated with the low developed and increased in organization, and a tropical depression formed on the afternoon of July11 centered 290mi (465km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Manzanillo, Mexico. Despite moving over sea surface temperatures of at least 82°F (28°C), moderate northeasterly wind shear hindered development; however, the depression soon obtained sufficient organization to be upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Darby. On July13, the shear decreased, and as a result Darby began to intensify quickly, strengthening into a hurricane 30hours after becoming a tropical storm. At that time, Darby was located about 570miles (920km) <b>south-southwest</b> of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|With the San Jacinto Fault Zone to the northwest, the Elsinore fault to the <b>south-southwest,</b> and the Imperial fault {{centered}} {{directly under}} the Imperial Valley, the area frequently encounters seismic activity, including moderate and damaging earthquakes. Other events in 1852, 1892, 1915, 1940, 1942, and 1987 have impacted the region. More small to moderate events of less than 6.0 (local magnitude) have occurred in this area than any other section of the San Andreas fault system.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak low-level trough extended from the Caribbean Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began to drift eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico. Two days later a low-level circulation formed, and midday on October 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E while located about 250miles (410km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Huatulco in the state of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 16. The wave axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. By August 27, the wave axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5mph (7km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230miles (370km) <b>south-southwest</b> of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} again, Gretelle slowed in the Mozambique Channel. A cold front bypassed the storm to the south, and a building ridge behind it turned Gretelle to a west-northwest drift. Although it approached southeastern Africa on January28, an advancing trough turned the storm to the southeast. The next day, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Gretelle to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, and on January30, the MFO estimated a secondary 10minute wind peak of 85km/h (50mph). Accelerating to the south-southeast, Gretelle dissipated on January31 well to the <b>south-southwest</b> of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level tropospheric trough {{persisted in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{developing}} a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860miles (1380kilometers) <b>south-southwest</b> of the western Azores. Moving westward, the depression was forecast to attain winds of at least 60mph (95km/h), although it failed to reach that intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun to separate from the circulation, {{and later in the}} day Lorenzo became extratropical; shortly thereafter, its remnants merged with a frontal system about 690mi (1,110km) west of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and {{moved away from the}} region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area. Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the <b>south-southwest,</b> and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E
5|$|Characterized with disorganized convection, a broad surface trough {{formed in}} {{association}} with the wave the same day and environmental conditions were expected to favor gradual development. Initially, upper-level winds were only marginally favorable, and although the thunderstorms remained disorganized, the NHC estimated a 50%chance for development by early on October12. The next day, the system became better defined, and, the NHC noted that the system {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone. Although operationally not classified until 2100UTC on October 13, a post-season analysis conducted on the system revealed that it attained enough organization to be considered a tropical depression at 1200UTC, while positioned about 645mi (1040km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Continuing <b>south-southwest,</b> {{the river}} {{along with the}} parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) {{to the south of}} where the river entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook. Saw Mill River Road continues to parallel its namesake.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hurricane}} weakened to {{a tropical storm}} again on October 14 as it moved overland, and began to curve north-northwest, restrengthening to a major hurricane by October 17 while it was west-southwest of Cuba. The hurricane made landfall over Cuba {{on the evening of}} October 17. The hurricane passed over southern Florida near Pigeon Key and Downtown Miami on October 18. The hurricane continued traveling north-northwest; however, it was forced to re-curve <b>south-southwest,</b> {{as a result of a}} high-pressure area. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm overland, eventually becoming a tropical depression. The system meandered into the Gulf of Mexico, making a final landfall in Central America on October 23.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Daniel {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on July2. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection, and on July12, it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. Convection increased on July13, and two days later the system began to exhibit signs of tropical development to the south of Mexico. It tracked westward at about 15mph (25km/h), and on July16, the disturbance became better organized. With convective rainbands near an associated low-level circulation, it is estimated the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression late on July16. At the time, it was located about 525miles (845km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (<b>south-southwest).</b> This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes {{well away from the}} Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while <b>south-southwest</b> of the island chain.|$|E
5|$|On December19, a {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia, which initially tracked to the south-southeast {{before turning to}} the southwest. Later that day, the system intensified to moderate tropical storm status, prompting the Mauritius Meteorological Service to name it Bakoly. The storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone, reaching peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) on December23. After maintaining that intensity for about 12hours, Bakoly weakened below cyclone status as it turned to the south-southeast. On December25, the storm passed between Réunion and Mauritius, and later resumed its <b>south-southwest</b> trajectory. After executing a small loop, Bakoly turned to the southeast and dissipated on December30.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the NHC {{immediately}} classified {{the system}} as Tropical Storm Earl based on a Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance mission that found flight-level winds of 49mph (79km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 40mph (65km/h). Due {{to the existence of}} multiple circulation centers, the initial movement of the storm was uncertain, but forecasters anticipated a general northward movement. In post-season analysis, it was determined that the system intensified into Tropical Storm Earl while located about 575miles (925km) <b>south-southwest</b> of New Orleans. Initial advisories on Earl relocated the center of circulation several times before focusing on the true circulation center.|$|E
5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} <b>south-southwest</b> {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} {{wave that}} would become John moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 17. It entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 24, and quickly showed signs of organization. That night, Dvorak classifications were initiated on the system while it was just west of Costa Rica, and it moved west-northwestward at 10–15mph (15–25km/h). Conditions appeared favorable for further development, and convection increased late on August 26 over the area of low pressure. Early on August 27, the system became much better organized about 250miles (400km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Guatemala, although convection remained minimal. Early on August 28, banding increased within its organizing convection, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven-E.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August8, which subsequently tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August16, at which time convection increased along the wave axis. Three days later, a weak low pressure area formed along the wave, and early on August20 some broad cyclonic turning was evident within the cloud pattern. Gradually, banding features developed around the area of deep convection, and the system was expect to develop further as it moved into an increasingly favorable environment. Convection increased late on August20, although it initially remained disorganized; however, the thunderstorms consolidated near the low, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression by 1200UTC on August21, about 350mi (560km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on October4. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October18. The next day, it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather, resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern Mexico. The broad and disorganized system moved westward at 1015mph (1624km/h). On October20, the system developed an area of low pressure, and began to show signs of organization. It continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression Seventeen-E on October21 while located about 265miles (425km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Manzanillo. Upon forming, the depression possessed a small, tight low-level circulation beneath a well-defined mid-level circulation. Easterly wind shear initially restricted upper-level outflow as the cyclone moved to the west, a motion due to a subtropical ridge to its north.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek {{begins in}} Franklin Township. It flows <b>south-southwest</b> {{for a short}} {{distance}} before turning south for several tenths of a mile, passing through the border between Dallas Township, Franklin Township, and Kingston Township, and entering Kingston Township. The creek then continues south {{for more than a}} mile before turning southeast and eventually entering Frances Slocum Lake. On the southeastern end of the lake, the creek turns east-northeast for more than a mile, entering a deep valley. It then turns south-southeast for a few miles, entering West Wyoming flowing through a water gap. The creek then turns southeast for some distance before turning southwest and entering Wyoming. It then turns west-southwest for a few miles before turning south and then west. The creek then turns south again, crossing US Route 11. It then turns southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|After development, Dora was steered {{towards the}} {{northwest}} by a ridge over the Southwestern United States. Situated {{in an area}} of favorable atmospheric conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, the tropical cyclone quickly strengthened, developing an intermittent eye before being classified as a hurricane at 1800UTC on July19. At the time, the storm was roughly 245mi (400km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon reaching hurricane status, Dora began an episode of rapid intensification as its inner structure became more well-defined and its eye more permanent. At the same time, mesovorticies within the eye—often indicators of intense tropical cyclones—were noted on satellite imagery. By 1800UTC on July20, Dora had attained the threshold for major hurricane status. After acquiring some characteristics of an annular hurricane early on July21, Dora reached its peak intensity at 1200UTC that day with a minimum barometric pressure of 929mbar (hPa; 27.43inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h), making it a high-end Category4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} {{a brief period}} of rapid intensification from 18:00UTC on October29 – 06:00UTC on October30, the hurricane reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum pressure of 962mbar (hPa; 28.42inHg). The storm also began to turn towards the <b>south-southwest</b> as it reached its peak intensity and its maximum size, with tropical storm-force winds extending out 60mi (95km) from the center. However, as it neared the coast, cloud tops around the eye began to warm, signifying weakening. Around 12:00UTC on October30, Beta made landfall in central Nicaragua near La Barra del Rio Grande with winds of 105mph (165km/h). After making landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 65mph (100km/h), as the structure of the storm began to deteriorate. Early on October31, Beta weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated a few hours later over the mountains of central Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Classified as Tropical Depression Five-E, {{the system}} tracked westward under the {{steering}} currents of a mid-level ridge. In the hours after formation, the depression lacked {{a concentration of}} deep convection near the center. Conditions favored development, including warm sea surface temperatures, very low amounts of wind shear, and an established anticyclone over the cyclone. Convection became more centralized, coinciding with the improvement of upper-level outflow. Based on Dvorak classifications, {{it is estimated that}} the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Daniel at 1200UTC on July17. Daniel quickly became better organized, exhibiting increased thunderstorm activity and banding features. A central dense overcast developed, and a well-defined rainband wrapped around the center of circulation. Based on the formation of an eye feature, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Daniel to hurricane status late on July18 while it was located about 885miles (1420km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Bella was a {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that passed near the Mauritius outer island of Rodrigues. The second named storm of the season, Bella {{originated in the}} middle of January 1991 from a surge in the monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra. For several days, the system remained weak as it moved generally west-southwestward. On January25, it intensified to tropical storm status, but Bella took three more days to intensify to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute maximum sustained winds of 120kilometres per hour (75miles per hour). The cyclone attained peak intensity on January29, officially reaching winds of 155km/h (100mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially estimated winds of 240km/h (150mph), the highest the agency estimated for any storm in the Southern Hemisphere in the year. Bella later turned to the southeast and weakened, passing about 50km (30mi) west of Rodrigues on January31. The storm turned to the <b>south-southwest</b> and back to the southeast again, becoming extratropical on February4.|$|E
5|$|Dora {{held its}} peak {{strength}} for just six hours before {{it began to}} weaken due to cooler waters {{and the presence of}} wind shear. Although the hurricane's initial weakening phase was gradual, the overall structure of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm. The storm's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12hours after Dora's peak intensity, By 1800UTC on July22, the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity, undergoing an 80mph (130km/h) decrease in winds in just 24hours. Continued weakening prompted the NHC to downgrade Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area devoid of any thunderstorm activity. The low persisted for a day as it tracked north-northwestward, eventually dissipating 70mi (110km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Bahía Asunción on July 26.|$|E
5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over {{the next few}} days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over {{the next few days}}, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the <b>south-southwest,</b> passing through the Solomon Islands on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E
5|$|During mid-May, {{a frontal}} {{boundary}} stalled near The Bahamas and slowly degenerated. On May25, a shortwave trough caused the northern {{portion of the}} system to move north of the Bahamas. The following day, an {{area of low pressure}} developed along the boundary about 290miles (465km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Wilmington, North Carolina. Tracking towards the north, the system became increasingly organized. On May27, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began issuing Tropical Weather Outlooks for the low while it was located about 120miles (195km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. An upper-level ridge situated to the southeast of the system was steering it towards the northeast. The NHC issued their final outlook on the low around 0000UTC on May28 while the system was located about 90mi (150km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as development of the low was not expected.|$|E
5|$|Early on June17, the JTWC {{issued a}} second TCFA {{as the system}} {{continued}} to organize. By this time the system was nearly stationary and at 0600UTC, the JMA declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression. Several hours later, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W while the storm was situated about 705km (440mi) <b>south-southwest</b> of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Little movement took place {{for the first few}} days of the storm's existence as weak steering currents were in place over the South China Sea. Following further development of the depression, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June17. At 0600UTC on June18, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm and gave it the name Linfa. Limited poleward outflow hindered intensification for the remainder of June18. By this time, the storm began to increase in forward motion due to a strengthening subtropical ridge located east of Taiwan and a mid-latitude trough to the west.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Howard {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on August18. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection. By August26, the wave produced disorganized convection as it moved through the western Caribbean, across Central America, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. Paralleling the southern coast of Mexico, the wave became increasingly organized and it was estimated that the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression around 1200UTC on August30 about 400mi (645km) <b>south-southwest</b> of Acapulco, Mexico. Classified as Tropical Depression Eleven-E, the system tracked west-northwestward under the steering currents of a weak mid-level ridge. In the hours after formation, the depression lacked a concentration of deep convection near the center. However, conditions favored eventual development, including warm sea surface temperatures and low amounts of wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Late on September13, 1998, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa. The following day the system featured a large area of organized deep convection and the dvorak technique was initiated. By September15, ships within the vicinity of the wave reported that a surface circulation had developed and by 1200UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that {{a tropical}} depression, the seventh of the season, while situated about 345miles (555kilometres) <b>south-southwest</b> of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression tracked roughly due west in response to a mid-level ridge, building westward, {{to the north of the}} cyclone. Throughout the day, banding features developed around the system and deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation. Roughly 24hours after being declared a depression, the NHC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and gave it the name Georges.|$|E
