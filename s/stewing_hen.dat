5000|$|In the United States, {{laying hens}} are butchered after their second egg laying season. In Europe, they are {{generally}} butchered after a single season. The laying period begins when the hen is about 18-20 weeks old (depending on breed and season). Males of the egg-type breeds have little commercial value at any age, and all those not used for breeding (roughly fifty percent of all egg-type chickens) are killed soon after hatching. Such [...] "day-old chicks" [...] are sometimes sold as food for captive and falconers birds of prey. The old hens also have little commercial value. Thus, the main sources of poultry meat {{a hundred years ago}} (spring chickens and <b>stewing</b> <b>hens)</b> have both been entirely supplanted by meat-type broiler chickens.|$|R

The main ones are: kidney bean with pig, chaya with egg, <b>stew</b> of <b>hen,</b> stuffed cheese, salbutes, panuchos, venison pipian, papadzules, longaniza, cochinita pibil, joroches, mucbil chicken, pimes and tamales.|$|R
50|$|On average, {{a chicken}} lays one egg a day, {{but not on}} {{every day of the}} year. This varies with the breed and time of year. In 1900, average egg {{production}} was 83 eggs per hen per year. In 2000, it was well over 300. In the United States, laying hens are butchered after their second egg laying season. In Europe, they are generally butchered after a single season. The laying period begins when the hen is about 18-20 weeks old (depending on breed and season). Males of the egg-type breeds have little commercial value at any age, and all those not used for breeding (roughly fifty percent of all egg-type chickens) are killed soon after hatching. The old hens also have little commercial value. Thus, the main sources of poultry meat 100 years ago (spring chickens and <b>stewing</b> <b>hens)</b> have both been entirely supplanted by meat-type broiler chickens.|$|R
500|$|Before the {{industrialization}} {{of chicken}} production, {{and the creation}} of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. (This method is common in Australia.) Another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method. The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid, usually, a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in. This process (of flouring, frying and simmering in gravy) is known as [...] "smothering" [...] and can be used for other tough cuts of meat, such as swiss steak. Smothered chicken is still consumed today, though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens, or who seek out <b>stewing</b> <b>hens,</b> it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens.|$|R
