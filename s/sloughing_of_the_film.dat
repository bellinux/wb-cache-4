40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{requirements for}} <b>the</b> award <b>of</b> Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. The low-rate trickling filter {{is the most}} common biological treatment process used in small and medium sized sewage works in the UK. It produces an inconsistent effluent quality, which has traditionally been related to seasonal changes in solids accumulation, grazing activity and <b>sloughing</b> <b>of</b> microbial <b>film.</b> <b>The</b> final effluent solids and, organic matter content is then too high for discharge or reuse. Given the increasingly stringent effluent standards, both in terms of quality and consistency, tertiary treatment is often required. This study was designed to investigate the key parameters affecting <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> low-rate trickling filters and <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> their effluents in terms of contaminant size, which might influence <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> crossflow filtration as a tertiary treatment for the trickling filter.
