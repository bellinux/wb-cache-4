25|$|A {{ball that}} bounces {{a little way}} before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen {{is said to be}} short pitched or {{described}} as a long hop and is easier for a batsman to hit as he will have had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing. A short-pitched ball is also at a more <b>suitable</b> <b>height</b> for the batsman to play an attacking pull shot. A ball that bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a bouncer and can be an effective delivery. Any ball short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called wide by the Umpire. Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.|$|E

The former pedestrian bridge and support piers over Surrey Canal Road were demolished as a precursor to building the railway bridge.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to provide methods that can be used to {{determine}} the most <b>suitable</b> drop <b>height</b> for shock testing military equipment, in an efficient and cost ineffective manner. Shock testing is widely employed to assess the performance of electronic systems, including military devices and civilian systems. Determining the height of the drop for a test item is an important step prior to performing the test. Dropping a test item from excessive height leads high G-peak values to damage the test equipment. On the other hand, dropping an item from a low height may not generate the required G-peak value and duration. Therefore, prior to performing shock tests, an optimal drop height must be established to ensure that the resulting G-peak value and duration time match the required test values. The traditional trial-and-error methods are time-consuming and cost-ineffective, often requiring many attempts. To improve the conventional approaches, this study proposes the application of regression analysis and back-propagation neural network for determining the most <b>suitable</b> drop <b>height</b> for free-fall shock tests. A new method is suggested for determining the drop test height. The results of the model are verified, using the results of a series of experiments that are conducted to verify the accuracy of the suggested approaches. The results of the study indicate that both approaches are equally effective in providing an effective guideline for performing drop tests from heights that would result in the peak Gs and duration needed for testing electronic devices...|$|R

Current real-time rendering algorithms for dynamic height fields employ approximate ray-height field intersection methods, whereas accurate algorithms require pre-computation {{in the order}} of seconds to minutes and are thus not <b>suitable</b> for dynamic <b>height</b> field rendering. We alleviate this problem by using maximum mipmaps, a hierarchical data structure supporting accurate and efficient rendering while simultaneously lowering the pre-computation costs to negligible levels.
