40|$|It is well {{possible}} {{to reduce the}} emissions of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents in metal cleaning by substituting the cleaning equipment for the use with HHCs by those systems which operate with aqueous based cleaning solutions. The results from this project prove that the emission problems are not shifted from the exhaust air into the sewage. Systems fostering the lifetime extension of aqueous cleaning agents and special devices to circulate rinse waters in closed loops have encountered an advanced development within the frame of this project, so that a waste-water free operation of the cleaning equipment is possible. The object of creating more flexibility in cleaning processes was achieved by developing a modular equipment design. This concept permits any individual arrangement of operation processes with <b>standard</b> components. The <b>modular</b> <b>system</b> allows subsequent modifications or re-arrangements of the process units. The test results achieved can be utilized {{in a wide range}} for most different cleaning applications.

40|$|Modularity in {{programs}} is studied from a semantic point of view. A simple model of <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> and modularization mechanisms is presented, together with correctness criteria for <b>modular</b> <b>systems.</b> A concept of locality is defined for <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> and modularization mechanisms. In a local <b>modular</b> <b>system</b> the correctness of each module {{can be established}} by only looking at the module specifications, i. e., without using any information about how the modules are implemented. Locality is thus a basic property of <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> and justifies the use of Parnas' information hiding principle {{in the construction of}} <b>modular</b> <b>systems.</b> A characterization of locality is given, and the locality of hierarchical and recursive <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> is studied. Hierarchical <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> are shown always to be local, while recursive systems need not be local. A sufficient condition for the locality of recursive <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> is given. Finally, the composition of <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> to yield higher level <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> is described and analyzed.

40|$|The goal of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} mechanical performance of full-scale timber beams containing scarf joint with a dowel. Work focused on <b>standard</b> testing using <b>modular</b> <b>system</b> to obtain effective stiffness and strength of the beams with and without the joint. The work further researched a contact zone between two timber parts of the joint – at the scarf face. This was carried out using non-destructive optical technique – digital image correlation (DIC) and newly developed algorithm. The joint was made of Norway spruce, dims. 6 × 0. 2 × 0. 24 [*]m and was loaded by two modes: a) 3 -point bending and b) 4 -point bending. During the loading, a sequence of images was acquired for further investigation of contact zone using the proposed algorithm. The joint with scarf and dowel provided enough effective stiffness, ie. 73 – 93 % for 3 -point bending test and 71 % for 4 -point bending with respect to MOE measured on reference solid beams. Effective strength of the joint was also relatively high and {{in a range of}} 55 % and 60 % with respect to reference solid beams in both 3 -point and 4 -point bending tests. Contact length differed for loading modes. Mean contact length in symmetrical 4 -point bending was about 40 %, for asymmetrical 3 -point bending test, it was approx. 20 % on face closer to support and 44 % on a face closer to loads...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>modular</b> {{construction}} <b>systems</b> {{for residential}} purposes currently represents {{a very small}} proportion of all housing construction. The focus of these systems is on niche markets typified as cheap alternatives, homeowner involvement in construction or adaptations to construction constraints (build time availability, site access, etc.). Governments, regulatory bodies and industrial members are progressively moving towards increased environmentally sustainable practice. This progression {{is evidenced by the}} development of design and construction rating tools and the introduction of statutes and regulations governing construction and design. This work investigates the improvement of residential construction practice in terms of environmental sustainability outcomes through the use of <b>modular</b> housing <b>systems.</b> Two key aspects of environmental sustainability identified are embodied energy and material waste reduction. A <b>modular</b> <b>system</b> has been investigated because methods and procedures that directly relate to these two areas are well addressed by such systems. In order to validate the potential of <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> in this environmental regard, three main areas have been addressed. The first is the ability for <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> to generate the type of floor plans currently offered by Australian high-volume builders. Second, the environmental improvement potential offered by <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> is addressed. Lastly are the issues of structural performance and the means of the tailoring of prefabricated <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> to residential construction standards. Through the treatment of these three areas, potential benefits of <b>modular</b> <b>systems</b> are identified, with future work necessary to implement such benefits highlighted.
