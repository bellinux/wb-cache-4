For six years, for instance, he fought against a streetcar line which was due to be laid near the PTR. However, before the streetcar was to make its first journey, the institute succeeded in developing an astatic torsion magnetometer which was uninfluenced by disturbing electromagnetic fields. The use of this instrument and the <b>shielded</b> <b>wire</b> galvanometer developed by du Bois and Rubens meant that precision electrical and magnetic work continued to be possible.|$|E
50|$|Shielding cables - In general, using {{shielded}} cables {{to protect}} the wires from unwanted noise frequencies in a sensitive circuit is good practice. A <b>shielded</b> <b>wire</b> {{can be thought of}} as a small Faraday cage for a specific wire as it uses a plastic or rubber enclosing the true wire. Just outside the rubber/plastic covering is a conductive metal that intercepts any noise signal. Because the conductive metal is grounded, the noise signal runs straight to ground before ever getting to the true wire. It is important to ground the shield at only one end to avoid a ground loop on the shield.|$|E

The first pair of jaws is pressed against the wire so the blades cut into the insulation, and the device is turned to form circumferential cuts in the insulation. Then the second pair of jaws is pressed against the wire so the blades cut into the insulation, and the wire is moved through the device to form longitudinal cuts that permit easy removal of the insulation. Each of the blades is located within the concave face of a V-block, to center the blades on the wire and to limit the depth of blade penetration...|$|E

40|$|Lightning strokes to {{transmission}} lines causes {{a majority of}} the power quality issues that are so severe that sensitive industrial loads are disturbed. Historically Vattenfall concluded that it is too expensive to use <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> for the 132 kV grid due to the high soil resistivity in Sweden. Today the situation is different with sensitive industrial loads and the current Vattenfall standard is to build portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> is however not used {{to reduce the amount of}} lightning faults, it is used to ground the cross arm and reduce the amount of short circuits. In this project the lightning performance of different tower configurations used in the 132 kV grid is investigated using statistical insulation coordination in the softwares LPE and PSCAD. The optimal placement of the <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> on towers located on flat ground is determined. Furthermore, the <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> configuration of a new portal tower with two <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> and typical Swedish conditions is proposed and compared to a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The demand is that the amount of lightning faults should be reduced by half compared to the case with a portal tower without <b>shield</b> <b>wires.</b> It is concluded that in order to achieve this decrease in the amount of faults a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> requires a tower foot resistance of 16. 5 while a portal tower with two <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> requires a tower foot resistance of 35. 1. The distribution between single line to ground faults and short circuits for both configurations is estimated, where a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> proved to reduce the amount of short circuits. Furthermore, it is concluded that every cross arm needs to be grounded properly in order to achieve the desired lightning performance. A cost estimation based on an average 132 kV line with average loading showed that a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could not cover its own costs. It is important to remember that the cost estimation is based on an average 132 kV line and it does not consider important industries or costs of groundings. If this would be included a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could be profitable in some cases. Therefore it is recommended to consider the local conditions when deciding if a new transmission line is built with one or two <b>shield</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This {{paper has}} {{proposed}} a modeling method to simulate steady-state and transient induced voltages to an underground gas pipeline from an overhead transmission line. The simulation results of the steady-state ac induced voltages agree well with analytical results obtained from a well-known formula. The induced voltages are significantly dependent on the configuration of an overhead line. A hori-zontal line induces the largest voltage to a gas pipeline, and an induced voltage by a vertical twin-circuit line is smaller by about 20 % than that by a vertical single-circuit line.

30|$|This paper {{describes}} new methodology in {{the current}} unbalance calculations in meshed grids. The meshed grids, mainly the transmission ones, consist of more parts connected together which are formed using different conductor types, phase sequence arrangements, tower constructions, and various number of lines on the same tower. Therefore several computational challenges arise {{in comparison with the}} widely discussed point-to-point configuration. The methodology divides the grid into a number of impedance matrices respecting all the self and mutual impedances among all conductors and all parallel lines. Another challenging issue for the lines impedance description is changing the number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> along the line if the line is composed of several sections with different tower configurations. For the current unbalance calculation, <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> must also be included in the algorithms, and matrices of various dimensions can be obtained. For the overall matrix description to be used, dimensions of all matrices in final equations must be equal, and therefore the virtual <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> are created. To compare more conductor transposition cases with each other, the line loadings caused by voltage sources should be equal. This is necessary mainly in case of meshed grids where the supplying sources on different lines can have strong mutual couplings. This can be achieved by an appropriately designed optimization of the connected voltage sources.|$|R

We reveal that both optimal SINO problems are NP-hard, and propose effective approximate algorithms for the two problems. Experiments show that our SINO/NB algorithm uses from 15 % to 57 % fewer <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> when compared to separated net ordering and shield insertion procedure.

50|$|Overhead {{power lines}} are often {{equipped}} with a ground conductor (<b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> or overhead earth wire). The ground conductor is usually grounded (earthed) {{at the top of}} the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors. In circuits with earthed neutral, it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two ground conductors. These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use surge arresters every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. <b>Shield</b> <b>wires</b> on transmission lines may include optical fibers (optical ground wires/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system.|$|R

The meshed system consists of several sections with different phase arrangements, a different number of transmission lines on one tower, and a different number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires.</b> Some basic aspects of current unbalance have been mentioned in Sect.  1. As for calculations, several challenges described in Sect.  2 have been solved. Since {{it may be necessary}} to connect sections with a different number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires,</b> the virtual <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> have been created to keep impedance matrix dimensions, and the correct values of line supplying voltage sources have been determined for the required average values of the line currents by an appropriately designed optimization process. The unbalance factors for all the possible phase arrangements in the selected section C have been calculated, and the best solution has been found. The aforementioned procedures have been demonstrated in a case study of part of Czech transmission system designed for a new 400 kV substation connection. The best calculated transposition in section C was used, and values of calculated unbalance factors have been verified after putting the substation into operation. The measurement has shown very good agreement with the calculated values with an error less than 8 %. This is accepted as a very successful result taking into consideration a range of the line input parameters uncertainties. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the unbalance factor has been performed with view to the fact that the grounding input data is never easy to determine.|$|R

ADLash® is {{the trade}} name for an {{optical fibre cable}} {{attached}} to a transmission line <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> using aramid-reinforced bands. The installation {{of this type of}} optic fibre cable has been considered for the HVDC line from the Songo hydroelectric scheme at Cahora Bassa in Mozambique, to Apollo substation in South Africa. The impact that installation of this cable will have on the onset of corona is examined. The <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> with and without ADLash attached is modelled for both the actual line configuration and for corona cage studies. The electric field is calculated using the Method of Images and the Boundary Element Method to predict the electric field enhancements and to estimate the corona onset gradient. Corona onset gradients and phenomena for smooth and stranded conductors are researched to aid the prediction of voltage onset magnitudes for the corona cage. Estimated values are compared with observed values for both AC and DC applied voltages. Different patterns of corona and different corona onset voltages are observed for AC and negative DC applied voltages. The relative permittivity of the ADLash is higher than the surrounding air and this is shown to lead to greatly enhanced electric fields at the air/ dielectric/ <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> interfaces that are significant enough to cause corona at the rated operating voltage. The corona will bombard the ADLash and probably damage it.
