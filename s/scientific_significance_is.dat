40|$|The disease {{pattern of}} {{osteoarthritis}} has existed at all times. In industrial nations osteoarthritis {{is one of}} the most frequent causes for physical deficiencies and is detrimental to the quality of life of elderly people. Due to the increase in life expectancy and the continually increasing rate of adipose people the prevalence of the disease will clearly rise in the next few years according to scientific estimation. Until now there are no forms of therapy by which osteoarthritis can be treated directly and curatively in the sense of a „restitutio ad integrum“. Moreover the mechanisms of the origin of the disease have not been sufficiently decoded and investigated so far. The main focus of research is primarily concentrated on all the molecular biological mechanisms which contribute to the pathogenesis. The intention of this essay is to analyze the quantity of research on the subject of osteoarthritis with the aid of scientiometric and bibliometric methods. It will include publications which were published in the period from 1900 to 2007. The registered entries on osteoarthritis at the data bank “ISI Web of Science“ will act as the source of information. The collected data will be further analyzed with scientiometric methods. The evaluation covers the total score, the analysis of the individual year of publication, the language, the form of publication, the subject area, the institutes, the journals, the authors with their cooperation and the countries of publication with their cooperation. In addition a precise analysis of the mode of citation of the articles will be made regarding the years, the countries, the journals and the authors. The number of entries during the analyzed period in the data bank „ISI Web of Science“ (1900 – 2007) amounts to 24. 266 publications on the subject of osteoarthritis. About 92 % of the publications were published in the last twenty years. Since the beginning of the 1990 s the annual number of publications has risen enormously. This trend continued until the year 2007. In the course of publications the “Article” is also the most frequent form of publication. Over 93 % of the publications were written in English. The dominance of the English language can also be seen from the publishing countries. The United States of America has with 8. 197 articles the highest amount of research on osteoarthritis. Great Britain and Germany are clearly left behind. As to the cooperation with other countries the USA also plays a leading role. The subjects of rheumatology, orthopaedics, and surgery predominate in the scientific arguments on the disease pattern of osteoarthritis. The leading institutes have their seat at the Harvard University and at the University of Boston. The professional journal with the most publications on the theme is „Arthritis and Rheumatism“ with 2. 531 entries. This journal also has the highest impact-factor (7, 68) among the journals with the most publications. The examination of the citation rate shows that the articles of the year 1991 were mostly quoted with an average of 35 citations. The average citation rate of all articles amounts to 14, 23 citations. Measured by the citations depending on the year of citation the year 2007 was most frequently quoted with a total number of 46. 571 citations. The country with the highest citation rate as an evaluation criterion for <b>scientific</b> <b>significance</b> <b>is</b> Mexico. The fifteen most productive authors participate in 10 % of the whole publications on osteoarthritis. They published between 273 and 102 articles. The share in publications as a first author and senior author is high with an average share of 63 %. With most quoted authors there is a remarkably clear difference to the share of self-citations, which are relatively high with all authors. The analysis of the correlative frequency of citations shows a clear concern in the publications of their colleagues. Moreover this repeated cooperation among the authors leads to a broad network within the community of science. The analyzed data on the subject of osteoarthritis over the period from 1900 – 2007 show a continual growth in the amount of research. Not only the North American continent but also Europe and Asia contribute more and more to this development. As only a limited part of the worldwide publications on the theme could be evaluated, this publication only describes a trend. Based on these results you can proceed to the assumption that this disease will be met with the same amount of concern by science and research in the future as it was in the past...|$|E

40|$|Includes {{published}} papers co-authored with othersMany {{properties of}} steels, {{especially those that}} are important for engineering purposes, are determined by their microstructures. Therefore the key driver to controlling properties of these materials lies within the characterisation and manipulation of their microstructure down to their atomic-scale structure. For industrial product development, strength and ductility {{are considered to be}} the most important properties and are highly ‘microstructure sensitive’. This thesis investigates the effect of niobium microalloying and clustering on the microstructure-property relationship of ultra-thin strip cast steels produced by the CASTRIP® steel manufacturing process using mechanical testing and advanced microanalysis techniques. The CASTRIP® process is a revolutionary new method of steel strip casting that requires significantly less energy, time, equipment, and floor space compared to conventional strip casting methods. New and improved microanalysis characterisation techniques were also developed as a part of this project in order to better characterise these steels. The work presented in this thesis will have industrial and <b>scientific</b> <b>significance</b> that <b>is</b> both of benefit to the CASTRIP® steel making process and its products and more generally for the microstructural characterisation of ferrous alloys, one of the most important classes of engineering materials.

40|$|Abstract Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) {{is one of}} {{the first}} pharmacologic {{compounds}} evaluated for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The most important effects of TA consist in the stabilisation of the blood-retinal barrier and the down-regulation of inflammation. TA also has anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties. The peculiar characteristic of being well tolerated by ocular tissues and the capability to remain active for many months after a single intravitreal injection, make this drug a safe and effective alternative. In the past decade, intravitreal injection of TA (IVTA) has emerged as a useful treatment of several ocular diseases such as uveitis, macular edema secondary to retinal vasculature disease, neovascularisation and vitreoretinopathy. In this paper, we review all the available evidence of its use in AMD as mono-therapy or in combination with other treatments, and we discuss which role TA will play in the treatment of AMD in the future. The first experiences with IVTA as monotherapy for the treatment of exudative AMD reported a positive outcome in transiently reducing the leakage from CNV. However, in the long-term follow-up, IVTA as monotherapy had no effect on the risk of severe visual acuity loss, despite a significant anti-angiogenic effect found 3 months after the treatment. Consequently, studies using the combination of IVTA and photodynamic therapy (PDT), which acts synergistically, were performed. They reported to improve vision and to reduce the number of re-treatments with PDT. A large number of publications confirmed the positive synergic role of combining TA and PDT (therapies) for the treatment of all types of CNV: classic or predominantly classic, occult or minimally classic and RAP (Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation) lesions. The advantages registered with the use of IVTA plus PDT compared to PDT alone were partially limited by the side effects, such as the rapid evolution of cataract. Nevertheless, cataract surgery may stimulate the development of CNV (result in stimulating CNV). However, in large, randomized, clinical trials on combination therapy of TA and PDT, visual acuity failed to show an improvement, even though the lesion size and subretinal fluid had decreased, compared to controls treated with PDT alone. Some authors reported an increased risk of developing macular atrophy after the combination therapy with IVTA and PDT. Reduction of the PDT fluence rate in association with the use of steroids resulted in reducing the risk of macular atrophy and in a better visual acuity outcome. The introduction of anti-VEGF-based drugs has revolutionized the treatment of AMD and has replaced all the previous therapies used for CNV. Visual improvement becomes an expectation in a higher proportion of patients, previously limited to minimizing vision loss. Anti-VEGF therapy also resulted in superior visual improvement compared to all types of combination therapy with IVT and PDT. Nevertheless, anti-VEGF monotherapy also has many limitations due to the need of repetitive treatments, increased costs and tachyphylaxis. Treatment regimens involving TA in combination therapy with anti-VEGF and PDT may preserve benefits for substantially longer periods. A question remains open on whether a combination treatment with anti-VEGF, triamcinolone and/or PDT may be a treatment option in patients with exudative AMD, by offering, with one cycle of therapy, functional VA benefits comparable to those observed with continued monthly anti-VEGF therapy. Further trials, of higher <b>scientific</b> <b>significance,</b> <b>are</b> needed to study the potential of these treatment options...|$|R
