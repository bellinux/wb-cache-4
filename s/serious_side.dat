5|$|The {{side effects}} of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of {{substance}} consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{side effects}} of {{amphetamine}} are varied, {{and the amount of}} amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{should not}} be given to people with heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} until platelet count has improved or normalised. Warfarin is usually best avoided in people with protein C or protein S deficiency as these thrombophilic conditions {{increase the risk of}} skin necrosis, which is a rare but <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effect associated with warfarin.|$|E

5|$|Numerous anime and manga {{publications}} have praised {{and criticized}} Kakashi's character. Although {{he has been}} noted to be an echo of similar detached shōnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and <b>serious</b> <b>sides</b> have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls.|$|R

5|$|Common {{side effects}} include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. <b>Serious</b> <b>side</b> effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including optic nerve damage.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects.|$|E
50|$|The most <b>serious</b> {{possible}} <b>side</b> effects include cardiac arrhythmias {{and severe}} bronchospasms. Timolol {{can also lead}} to fainting, congestive heart failure, depression, confusion, worsening of Raynaud's syndrome and impotence.|$|R
50|$|Maraviroc {{can cause}} <b>serious,</b> {{life-threatening}} <b>side</b> effects. These include liver problems, skin reactions, and allergic reactions. An allergic reaction may happen before liver problems occur. Official labeling of Selzentry has black box warning for hepatotoxicity.|$|R

5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.|$|E
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} ephedra {{consumption}} may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia.

5000|$|When a What's on TV {{columnist}} branded Serena [...] "a bit cold-hearted", Russell defended her {{explaining that}} she had a great bedside manner, but she did not care what people thought about her, which made her [...] "so scary". She stated [...] "Serena Campbell does not give a damn whether you like her or not!" [...] In September 2014, Russell told Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly that she enjoyed playing Serena as she was such [...] "a multi-dimensional character" [...] with both fun and <b>serious</b> <b>sides</b> to her. Russell also stated that a genuine friendship would develop between Serena and Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden), and they would enjoy some [...] "drunken evenings" [...] together.|$|R
5|$|Other {{works that}} {{followed}} continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed {{his first major}} liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which {{has become the most}} frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and {{it was not until the}} 1950s that his <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> was widely recognised.|$|E
5|$|Poulenc's wealthy family {{intended}} him for {{a business}} career in the Rhone Poulenc family company and did not allow him to enrol at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc soon came {{under the influence of}} Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became {{one of a group of}} young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.|$|E
5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
50|$|Its current {{investigation}} as an antagonist for respiratory depression caused by morphine has shown {{there to be}} no <b>serious</b> cardiovascular <b>side</b> effects. However, a slight decrease in blood pressure was a more minor effect. Repinotan has been linked with pupil diameter reduction.|$|R
50|$|Long-term {{administration}} of {{large quantities of}} creatine is reported to increase the production of formaldehyde, which {{has the potential to}} cause <b>serious</b> unwanted <b>side</b> effects. However, this risk is largely theoretical because urinary excretion of formaldehyde, even under heavy creatine supplementation, does not exceed normal limits.|$|R
50|$|On January 17, 2008, the Philippines Department of Health ordered Novartis Healthcare Phils. Inc. (Novartis) {{to remove}} (recall) all lumiracoxib from local drug stores in 2 weeks {{due to the}} harmful effects of the drug (potential <b>serious</b> liver-related <b>side</b> effects, {{hepatotoxicity}} or malfunction of the lungs).|$|R

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As {{amiodarone}} can have <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. <b>Serious</b> <b>side</b> effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding {{it can cause}} problems in the baby. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include {{weight gain}} and hypoglycemia.
