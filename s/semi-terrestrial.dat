5|$|Oniscidea – <b>Semi-{{terrestrial}}</b> and terrestrial isopods fully {{adapted for}} life on land. There are over 4,000 species of woodlice inhabiting forests, mountains, deserts and the littoral zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{family has}} adapted {{to most of}} the {{habitats}} available on the planet. These species may be arboreal, terrestrial, or <b>semi-terrestrial.</b> Various species also inhabit savannas, grasslands, deserts, temperate woodlands and forests, mangrove forests, and even the barren sands and gravels of atolls.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is diurnal and <b>semi-{{terrestrial}}.</b> It {{is the most}} terrestrial of lemur species, spending as much as 33% of its time on the ground. However it is still considerably arboreal, spending 23% of its time in the mid-level canopy, 25% in the upper-level canopy, 6% in the emergent layer and 13% in small bushes. Troop travel is 70% terrestrial.|$|E
5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or <b>semi-terrestrial</b> lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the amphipods, {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} isopods are entirely benthic. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and {{may explain why}} so many species are endemic to restricted ranges. Crawling is the primary means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the Flabellifera can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The <b>semi-terrestrial</b> sea slaters (Ligia spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups {{and also in the}} marine sphaeromatids.|$|E
5|$|Frog larvae {{are known}} as tadpoles and {{typically}} have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The free-living larvae are normally fully aquatic, but the tadpoles of some species (such as Nannophrys ceylonensis) are <b>semi-terrestrial</b> and live among wet rocks. Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming. Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills. The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak. Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 study {{indicated}} that the ancestors of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed {{at the base of}} a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were <b>semi-terrestrial,</b> and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} species of snails listed here are <b>semi-terrestrial</b> and so are {{sometimes}} also found on lists of marine species. Two listed here, in the genera Onchidella and Otina, are fully marine in habitat, but are pulmonate snails which breathe air at low tide rather than having gills like most marine species. Other species listed here live in habitats that are intermediate between land and saltwater, or in brackish water habitats intermediate between freshwater and full-salinity saltwater.|$|E
25|$|This {{description}} is strongly {{reminiscent of a}} common brushtail possum which despite being primarily arboreal sleeps in burrows or dens. It usually forages in trees but this is more subject to food availability than a genuine preference of this voracious and quite indiscriminate carnivore. They have wreaked havoc among New Zealand's unwary reptiles and (often <b>semi-terrestrial)</b> birds. While the introduced species seems a near-perfect match, {{it is not known}} to have been established until 1858; it was numerous enough to be encountered in many places from 1860 at the earliest.|$|E
500|$|Monkey lemurs, or baboon lemurs, share {{similarities}} with macaques, {{although they}} have also been compared to baboons. [...] Members of the family Archaeolemuridae, {{they were the most}} terrestrial of the lemurs, with short, robust forelimbs and relatively flat digits. [...] Although they {{spent a lot of time}} on the ground, they were only <b>semi-terrestrial,</b> spending time in trees to feed and sleep. They were heavy-bodied and ranged in size from approximately [...] They had relatively good day vision and large brains compared with other lemurs. [...] Their robust jaws and specialized teeth suggest a diet of hard objects, such as nuts and seeds, yet other evidence, including fecal pellets, suggests they may have had a more varied diet, including leaves, fruit, and animal matter (omnivory). [...] Dental wear analysis has shed some light on this dietary mystery, suggesting that monkey lemurs had a more eclectic diet, while using tough seeds as a fall-back food item. [...] Within the family, the genus Archaeolemur was the most widespread in distribution, resulting in hundreds of subfossil specimens, and may have been one of the last subfossil lemurs to die out.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} found in {{lowlands}} in Madagascar at altitudes below 400–500ft, near {{the east coast of}} the island, and on trees that are at the edge of forests. Usually it is attached to trees with fewer leaves and to areas of the branch or trunk that are driest. This allows the plant to obtain a great deal of light and air movement. Larger plants are usually found growing within 12–20ft from the ground, whereas smaller plants are often found higher up in the canopy. Rarely A.sesquipedale is also found growing as a lithophyte and sometimes even as a <b>semi-terrestrial.</b> The orchid lives in an environment with heavy rainfall, up to [...] per year. There is no dry season so the growing season is continuous.|$|E
60|$|It is {{difficult}} to conjecture how many reflex actions have originated, but, {{in relation to the}} present case of the affection of the lacrymal glands through irritation of the surface of the eye, it may be worth remarking that, as soon as some primordial form became <b>semi-terrestrial</b> in its habits, and was liable to get particles of dust into its eyes, if these were not washed out they would cause much irritation; and on the principle of the radiation of nerve-force to adjoining nerve-cells, the lacrymal glands would be stimulated to secretion. As this would often recur, and as nerve-force readily passes along accustomed channels, a slight irritation would ultimately suffice to cause a free secretion of tears.|$|E

50|$|The adult frogs live in {{patches of}} shrubby {{vegetation}} occurring on the inselbergs or gneiss domes {{in the forest}} on which it lives. Tadpoles are unusual compared to other Amietophrynus species: they are not aquatic but <b>semi-terrestrial,</b> living in shallow water-films on wet, sometimes nearly vertical rocks.|$|E
50|$|Logrunners are <b>semi-terrestrial</b> {{birds of}} weak flight. They are {{strictly}} carnivorous, with insects and larvae being their chief food, whilst the larger chowchilla will also eat small lizards. They find their food by {{digging in the}} soil, using their spiny tails as a support in the wet forest.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>semi-terrestrial,</b> {{returning}} to the sea to spawn. The species appears to be adversely affected {{by the presence of}} raccoons (Procyon lotor), an invasive predator.
