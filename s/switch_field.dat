The equilibrium phase boundary line between the normal and superconducting phases in the H-T plane obtained by fitting the resistive transition is consistent with that obtained by the I-V curve measurements. As the magnetic field is lower than a certain value, Hs, the scaling exponents are magnetic-field independent, but at H = H s, they begin to increase with the magnetic field and gradually get saturation. The <b>switch</b> <b>field,</b> Hs, decreases with decreasing the grain size in the samples. The results show that the magnetic-field-dependent scaling behaviour of the I-V curve observed in weak-link containing systems originates from the transition of a "weak" vortex-glass state to a "strong" vortex-glass state...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{switching}} {{characteristics of}} submicron permalloy elements were systematically studied {{as a function}} of interisland spacing. The result was an increase of the <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> with reduction in spacing, with a maximum value for near zero spacing. However, in overlapped segments, all elements switched simultaneously at lower fields than the maximum at zero spacing. The <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> depends on the number of connected segments as described by the Jacobs–Bean model, whereas the switching of the separated islands is governed mainly by the field emanating from the nearest-neighbor magnetic poles. The reversal behavior of the branched contiguous array was also studied. The angle between the branch axis and the easy axis {{played a critical role in}} establishing the <b>switching</b> <b>field.</b> The reversal field of the branched segment reached a minimum at 45 and a maximum at 90.

40|$|Using {{the highly}} {{sensitive}} anomalous Hall effect (AHE) {{we have been}} able to measure the reversal of a single magnetic island, of diameter 220 nm, in an array consisting of more than 80 of those islands. By repeatedly traversing the hysteresis loop, we measured the thermally actuated fluctuation of the <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> of the islands at the lower and higher ends of the <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> distribution. Based on a novel easy-to-use model, we determined the <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> in the absence of thermal activation, and the energy barrier in the absence of an external field from these fluctuations. By measuring the reversal of individual dots in the array as a function of temperature, we extrapolated the <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> and energy barrier down to 0 K. The extrapolated values are not identical to those obtained from the fluctation of the <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> at room temperature, because the properties of the magnetic material are temperature dependent. As a result, extrapolating from temperature dependent measurements overestimates the energy barrier by more than a factor of two. To determine fundamental parameters of the energy barrier between magnetisation states, measuring the fluctuation of the reversal field at the temperature of application is therefore to be preferred. This is of primary importance to applications in data storagea and magnetic logic. For instance in fast switching, where the <b>switching</b> <b>field</b> in the absence of thermal activation plays a major role, or in long term data stability, which is determined by the energy barrier in the absence of an external field...|$|R
