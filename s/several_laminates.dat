50|$|Decorative {{laminates}} {{were made}} by impregnating large sheets of kraft paper with phenolic resin, which was then partially cured (B-staged by passing through a long drying oven) and cut to sheet lengths at the oven exit. The dry treated sheets were stiff and somewhat brittle. A decorative sheet (solid colored, or wood-grained, or patterned), impregnated with melamine resin and B-staged and cut to length {{in a similar manner}} to the phenolic core sheets, was laid on a polished stainless steel press plate. Then several plies or layers of kraft paper impregnated with a phenolic resin were placed on top of the decorative layer. The number of plies of kraft used yielded products of varying thickness depending upon end-use requirements. Next, a sheet of release paper that would not bond to the phenolic resin was placed on top of the phenolic kraft and following this a mirror image build-up of the assembly already on the press plate. Finally, another polished stainless steel press plate was placed on top of the pack assembly. On {{the other side of this}} plate another similar assembly was built until there were <b>several</b> <b>laminates</b> in one press pack to go into a single opening in the hydraulic press. The huge hydraulic presses, perhaps 5 feet by 12 feet, had many heated openings thus many laminates could be produced in a single press cycle of about one hour duration. Great pressure (in excess of 1000 psi and heat to 150 degrees Celsius) were applied to each press pack. The B-staged melamine and phenolic resins first flowed to bond the interlaminar plies together, then the plastic resins thermoset to provide a very durable product that could tolerate much heat and abrasion.|$|E

The considered laminated plate theories pertain to the family of Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) as well as Layer-Wise (LW) descriptions.

40|$|Classical {{lamination}} theory {{predicts the}} room-temperature shape of all unsymmetrically laminated, elevated-temperature cure composites to be a saddle shape. Experimental observation indicates, however, {{that in many}} cases the room-temperature shape is cylindrical. In addition, a second cylindrical shape can often be obtained from the first by a simple snap-through action. It is the elastic couplings between inplane and out-of-plane deformations which are inherent in unsymmetric laminates that are responsible for the room-temperature shape. However, the couplings are so strong that geometrically nonlinear effects are produced. These are not accounted for in the classical theory. This paper reviews a theory developed to explain the effects of the coupling on laminate shape. The theory is based on a minimization of the laminate's total potential energy. The theory accounts for geometric nonlinearities. Because the problem is nonlinear, approximate solutions are sought by using a Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. Because of the observed snap-through of some laminates, stability of the predicted shapes is examined.

40|$|Tropical {{hardwood}} {{species are}} more and more used in the field of construction due to the particular qualities they can offer. Presently it is no longer possible to envisage the development of construction materials and products without taking into consideration the problem of their fire behaviour, and more particularly of their fire resistance. In the case of timber elements, this characteristic is mainly influenced by the charring rate of the external layers of the element. On the other hand this parameter is influenced by the density of the material. Limited information is available on the charring rate of tropical hardwood species. Therefore experimental investigations have been conducted at the University of Liege to study this characteristic. Seven tropical and three timber species from temperate countries have been examined. Two types of test have been used, one on small specimens, the other on a construction element made of one single material. In the first type, 20 specimens have been manufactured by gluing <b>several</b> <b>laminates</b> together. The specimens were instrumented with four thermocouples inserted at various depths in four different laminates. In the second type, a non-loaded wall made of 12 glued-laminated spruce beam profiles was instrumented with thermocouples embedded at different depths in the panel for the evaluation of the charring rate. Experimental charring rates have been compared with the results derived from Eurocode EC 5 - 1. 2 recommendation [ENV 1995 - 1 - 2. Eurocode 5 : Design of timber structures - Part 1 - 2 : General rules - Structural fire design. European prestandard; 1994], Australian standard AS 1720. 4 relation [AS 1720. 4.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} analysis of the free vibration of multilayered, fully free rectangular plates with arbitrary layups is proposed. The model is based on a displacement field that assumes a non-linear distribution of the in-plane displacements with respect to the thickness coordinate and a transverse displacement that is constant through the plate thickness. The displacement field accounts for a parabolic distribution of the transverse shear strains and satisfies the condition of zero transverse shear stresses on top and bottom surfaces of the plate. The mathematical problem is solved by Ritz technique, which relies on the minimization of the maximum Lagrangian functional, using a displacement field defined by beam functions in the form of finite series with undetermined parameters. The required mathematical operations {{for the development of the}} eigenvalue problem are carried out by symbolic manipulation. By deleting the higher order terms of Reddy’s displacement field or assuming Love-Kirchhoff hypothesis, the first order shear deformation and the classical plate theory models, respectively, are also obtained.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The low {{velocity}} {{impact behavior}} of <b>several</b> <b>laminate</b> systems has been studied. lnstruniented impact tests {{were compared with}} static indentation tests using the same specimen and test configurations. The impact behavior, defined by impact force, damage size and energy absorption, {{was found to be}} similar to the static indentation re-sponse. The damage growth process during impact as the force surged to its maximum value can be visualized from the static indentation damage induced at incrementally in-creased force levels. Delamination impact damage suddenly appeared only when the im-pact force reached a threshold value which was dependent on laniinate fracture toughness. Further force increxe resulted in gradual damage size growth until fiber damage caused the force to level off. There was evidence that laminate fracture toughness also affected the level-off force. Fiber damage not only absorbed significant energy but also allo for fur-ther delamination damage growth. Overall, the characteristics of impact force versus damage size varied with materials. As the impact energy levels varied, different stages of the impact failure process would be =ached.
