40|$|Since the {{publication}} by Williamson (1968) of his seminal paper on antitrust {{there has been}} a growing recognition by regulators of the need to assess tradeoffs between merger-related efficiency gains and merger-induced increases in market power. This paper addresses that need by presenting a structural econometric model of recent mergers in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rail</b> industry. The paper extends the structural methodology by evaluating actual (as opposed to simulated) merger effects and by incorporating parametric estimates of merger efficiencies. The paper's empirical finding is that consumer surplus in U. <b>S.</b> <b>rail</b> freight markets increased by about 30 per cent between 1986 and 2001 despite dramatic industry consolidation...|$|R

However, the parties discovered that the trackage rights over A&R, which had since been merged into the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway, had never been authorized, and concurrently filed for approval of the 1995 agreement. The STB rejected the latter notice of exemption, citing the opposition of the TP&W to continuance of trackage rights, thus requiring a more extensive proceeding.

Such an empirical investigation is significant, in part, because economic theory does not provide an obvious prediction on post-deregulation earnings patterns in the rail industry. Findings reveal uneven earnings declines for the three groups of rail employees, as the earnings of railroad non-union labor experienced a greater decline in the deregulation period than those for union labor. The decline in earnings for railroad managers was generally smaller than that for union and non-union labor. ...|$|R
