5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next year. At this time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a <b>senior</b> <b>clerk</b> to the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and rolls of the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E

25|$|Around 209, {{when the}} warlord Liu Bei {{took charge of}} Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) {{after the death of}} its Inspector (刺史), Liu Qi, he {{recruited}} Ma Liang to serve as an Assistant Officer (從事) under him. Later in 211, when Liu Bei left Jing Province for an expedition in Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), Ma Liang remained behind in Jing Province. Ma Liang was a close friend of Liu Bei's strategist Zhuge Liang and they were sworn brothers. He once wrote a letter to Zhuge Liang, who was in Yi Province at the time, to praise and encourage him. Ma Liang was later promoted to the position of a <b>Senior</b> <b>Clerk</b> (掾) {{in the office of the}} General of the Left (左將軍).|$|E
25|$|Sometime between 1412 and 1415, {{probably}} in the latter year, the chapter of Whithorn elected Gilbert to succeed the late Elisaeus Adougan as Bishop of Galloway; but, despite travelling to the papal court in Spain, Gilbert failed to obtain papal confirmation, and the papal chaplain and auditor, Thomas de Buittle, Archdeacon of Galloway, was provided to the bishopric instead by Pope Benedict XIII on 14 June 1415. This probably occurred against {{the will of the}} Douglas family, to whom Cavan was a <b>senior</b> <b>clerk.</b> Perhaps in compensation, six days later (20 June) Gilbert received provision to the now vacant archdeaconry of Galloway, a position Cavan held only very shortly, for he resigned it on exchange with John Gray sometime before 20 May 1417. On 3 July 1415, he was given a canonry in the diocese of Moray with the prebend of Invecheclyn (i.e. Inverkeithny, Strathbogie), being permitted to retain Carnesmole. The Pope had earlier allowed him to retain the parish church of Carnesmole even after becoming archdeacon. He received the church of Kirkandrews (Purton), near Borgue in Kirkcudbrightshire.|$|E
500|$|As {{a reward}} for his service to the [...] "Avignon Pope", now only {{recognised}} in Scotland, Sicily, Aragon and Castile, Thomas was provided to the bishopric of Galloway {{following the death of}} Elisaeus Adougan, the previous bishop. This occurred on 14 June 1415. Although the local chapter had elected one Gilbert Cavan, a clerk of the Earl of Douglas, to fill this position, Benedict overturned this election and put Thomas there instead. This probably occurred against the will of the Douglas family, to whom Cavan was a <b>senior</b> <b>clerk.</b> Thomas resigned the archdeaconry of Galloway, with Gilbert Cavan succeeding him there. Presumably in compensation, Gilbert also received Thomas' previous holdings in the dioceses of Moray and Aberdeen. It had been supposed by some authorities that Thomas supported the capitulation of Narbonne, renounced his allegiance to Pope Benedict and supported the adherence to the Council of Constance in December 1415, but this is based on a misreading of the evidence.|$|E

500|$|Kanō Jigorō {{was born}} to a sake-brewing family {{in the town of}} Mikage, Japan (now within Higashinada-ku, Kobe). The family sake brands {{included}} [...] "Hakushika", [...] "Hakutsuru", and [...] "Kiku-Masamune". But Kanō's father Kanō Jirōsaku (né Mareshiba Jirōsaku) was an adopted son and he did not go into the family business. Instead he worked as a lay priest and as a <b>senior</b> <b>clerk</b> for a shipping line. Kanō's father was a great believer in the power of education, and he provided Jigorō, his third son, with an excellent education. The boy's early teachers included the neo-Confucian scholars Yamamoto Chikuun and Akita Shusetsu. Kanō's mother died when the boy was nine years old, and his father moved the family to Tokyo. The young Kanō was enrolled in private schools, and had his own English language tutor. In 1874 he was sent to a private school run by Europeans to improve his English and German language skills.|$|E
500|$|In the New Year, Pooter is {{promoted}} to <b>senior</b> <b>clerk</b> at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement {{that he has}} just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, {{the source of his}} gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. [...] Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the [...] situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{acquisition}} and nurturing of humanistic skills and attitudes constitute an important aim of medical education. In {{order to assess}} how conducive the physician-learning environment is to the acquisition of these skills, the authors determined {{the extent to which}} clinical teachers are perceived by their trainees as humanistic with patients and students, and they explored whether undergraduate and graduate students share the same perceptions. METHODS: A mail survey was conducted in 1994 / 95 of all <b>senior</b> <b>clerks</b> and second-year residents at Laval University, University of Montreal and University of Sherbrooke medical schools. Of 774 trainees, 259 <b>senior</b> <b>clerks</b> and 238 second-year residents returned the questionnaire, for an overall response rate of 64 %. Students' perceptions of their teachers were measured on a 6 -point Likert scale applied to statements about teachers' attitudes toward the patient (5 items) and toward the student (5 items). RESULTS: On average, only 46 % of the <b>senior</b> <b>clerks</b> agreed that their teachers displayed the humanistic characteristics of interest. They were especially critical of their teachers' apparent lack of sensitivity, with as many as 3 out of 4 declaring that their teachers seemed to be unconcerned about how patients adapt psychologically to their illnesses (75 % of clerks) and that their teachers did not try to understand students' difficulties (78 %) or to support students who have difficulties (77 %). Compared with the clerks, the second-year residents were significantly less critical, those with negative perceptions varying from 27 % to 58 %, 40 % on average. Except for this difference, their pattern of responses from one item to another was similar. INTERPRETATION: This study suggests the existence of a substantial gap between what medical trainees are expected to learn and what they actually experience over the course of their training. Because such a gap could represent a significant barrier to the acquisition of important skills, more and urgent research is needed to understand better the factors influencing students' perceptions...|$|R
