40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the prospects for}} agricultural utilisation of the sludge produced from wastewater treatment plants in Greece and more specifically focuses on a critical review of the legislatory framework, determination of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the produced sludges, examination of possible sludge treatment methods and evaluation of the possibilities and prospects of <b>sludge</b> <b>utilisation</b> {{on the basis of}} the above considerations. Landfilling is practically the only route to sludge disposal in Greece. However, in view of the anticipated future restrictions for landfilling within the European Union, this method is clearly a short-term solution and alternative options, including agricultural reuse, must be implemented. The results of a recent survey are presented and discussed in relation to this need...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{nitrogen}} fixation by Rhizobium in symbiosis with leguminous host-plants including white clover, broad bean and peas {{have been established}} in soils that have been amended experimentally with heavy metal-contaminated sewage sludges. Results from 15 N-dilution experiments for the measurement of N 2 fixation have shown that adverse heavy metal effects are apparent on symbiotic N 2 fixation rates for white clover grown in inter-specific competition with ryegrass under mixed sward conditions, compared to white clover grown in pure sward. Further experiments on broad bean and pea indicated a significant, but minor-inhibitory metal-related effect on the rate of N 2 fixation compared to untreated soils and soils amended with a relatively uncontaminated sludge. The implications of the results with respect to <b>sludge</b> <b>utilisation</b> in agriculture are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Fifth Environmental Discussion was, firstly, to present the {{solution}} that has been found for Duesseldorf, namely to dry and then co-combust the sludge in a coal power plant equipped for slag tap firing. This solution is undoubtedly also available to other municipalities. On the other hand, there are no ready-made solutions, and disposal concepts for sewage sludge will always have to take regional features into account. The solution adopted for Duesseldorf was an attractive choice because the present power plant works with slag tap firing, which provides burn out at high temperatures, and has for some years now been equipped with a filtering installation including a cocinic filter and thus already complies {{to the requirements of}} the Seventeenth Ordinance Concerning the Federal Emission Control Law. The present solution allows a significant reduction of emissions from sewage sludge combustion compared with earlier ones. Notwhithstanding the present success, {{in view of the fact}} that there can be no patent recipes here the organisers invited proponents of diverse technical solutions to the problem of sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>utilisation</b> and disposal. The discussion was to serve an exchange of concepts and experiences made in pilot tests or pilot plantsSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|E
40|$|Sewage <b>sludge</b> {{disposal}} and <b>utilisation</b> {{is subject}} to legal boundary conditions. Several new laws and ordinances were passed in recent years. Against this background, the effects of mechanical disintegration on the biological processes of anaerobic digestion of excess sludge were investigated. A process for short-term digestion in the temperature range of mesophilic organisms is investigated, and - as a basic precondition - the experimental method used for assessing the success and rate of decomposition of organic sludge particles is checked.

40|$|Recycling {{of plant}} {{nutrients}} in sewage products to arable land {{is regarded as}} a step towards a more sustainable society, as todayâ€™s use of scarce resources is a threat to future generations. Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today. However, the use of sewage sludge in agriculture is a controversial issue. Blackwater from separating systems seems to fulfil agricultural requirements on a fertiliser product to a higher degree than sewage sludge without many of the hazardous substances in sludge. The main objective {{of this study was to}} analyse environmental impact and resource use in systems integrating wastewater management and agriculture. The methodology used was based on LCA methodology. Three different wastewater systems were evaluated together with the agricultural production potentially affected. The first alternative (the Surahammar reference system) represented a system that a large part of the population in Surahammar is connected to today. Food waste disposers were installed in 50 % of the households, wastewater was treated in a conventional wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for production of a soil conditioner. The second alternative (the <b>sludge</b> <b>utilisation</b> system) symbolised a wastewater system more commonly represented in Swedish municipalities, and included also agricultural use of the sewage sludge. The third alternative (the blackwater system) was based on a future vision of Surahammar. Here, toilet water from low-flush vacuum toilets and milled organic waste were digested separately. The blackwater product was stored and spread in growing oats, thereby replacing mineral fertilisers. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE. Assumed conditions for the agricultural system were mainly based on site-specific data from a farm producing according to the Svenskt Sigill label. All energy used and all emissions were related to a functional unit. The functional unit included wastewater treatment for 8830 persons in Surahammar, disposal of the sewage products and production of 2100 tonnes of oats on 486 hectares. As regards the operating phase of the whole system, the blackwater system required less fossil fuel and electricity than the other two systems. Although the blackwater system required considerably more fossil fuel for collection and transport, the total use of fossil fuel was lower due to a reduced need for mineral fertiliser. Construction of storage tanks and pipes for the blackwater system may, however, give a considerable contribution to the total environmental load. Including the construction phase too revealed that the use of fossil fuel increased considerably and was highest from the blackwater system. The emissions of greenhouse gases were of the same magnitude for all three systems, although slightly lower for the blackwater system. This was also evident when the construction phase was considered. The eutrophying emissions were reduced considerably in the blackwater system according to a maximum scenario, mainly due to reduced emissions of ammonium from the treatment plant. The emissions of SO 2 were of the same magnitude for all three systems studied, although slightly lower for the <b>sludge</b> <b>utilisation</b> system, As regards NH 3 and NOx, the emissions were highest for the blackwater system. A high substitution of mineral fertiliser, an optimal spreading technique and an appropriate design of the system for collecting and storing the blackwater were highlighted as important for many environmental aspects in the blackwater system...|$|E
