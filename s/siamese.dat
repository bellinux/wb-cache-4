5|$|The <b>Siamese</b> {{success at}} {{repelling}} the Burmese {{would not be}} repeated. This first ever invasion gave the Burmese an important experience on fighting with <b>Siamese.</b> The next invasion would be conducted by Bayinnaung, a man accustomed to fighting against <b>Siamese</b> soldiers and familiar with marching through <b>Siamese</b> terrain. The unrest in Burma delayed that next invasion for fifteen years, until the War of 1563 or the War of the White Elephants.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched <b>Siamese</b> forces. As planned, the <b>Siamese</b> vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the <b>Siamese</b> forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining <b>Siamese</b> forces into the city.|$|E
5|$|At any rate, the {{remaining}} <b>Siamese</b> forces retreated. Tabinshwehti readied his army for a siege of the <b>Siamese</b> capital. He made his camp {{north of the}} city, with his headquarters at Klum Dong, and had his commanders encamp in strategic places surrounding the city walls, Bayinnaung at Phaniat, the Viceroy at Ban Mai Makham, and the Governor of Bassein at the plain of Prachet. The Burmese would not, however, take the <b>Siamese</b> capital so easily.|$|E

5|$|Maha Chakkraphat saw the Burmese army's retreat as an {{opportunity}} {{take advantage of their}} weakness, so he ordered Princes Ramesuan and Thammaracha to follow and harass the enemy out of <b>Siamese</b> territory. For three days, the <b>Siamese</b> chased the invaders, inflicting great losses upon them. Once the forces of Ramesuan and Thammaracha closed in, Tabinshwehti made a stand near Kamphaeng Phet, dividing his forces {{on both sides of the}} road. The <b>Siamese</b> in their eagerness fell into the trap. The Burmese captured both Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} defense preserved <b>Siamese</b> {{independence for}} 15 years. Still, {{the war was}} not decisive. The next Burmese invasion in 1563 would force a <b>Siamese</b> surrender in February 1564, and make Ayutthaya a vassal state of Burma for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{casus belli}} {{have been stated}} as a Burmese attempt to expand their {{territory}} eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya {{as well as an}} attempt to stop <b>Siamese</b> incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to the Burmese, began in January 1547 when <b>Siamese</b> forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the Burmese forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, <b>Siamese</b> counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important <b>Siamese</b> nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.|$|E

The following day they met with King Chulalongkorn who told Kalākaua that the <b>Siamese</b> and Native Hawaiians were related by the common Malayan bloodline.

50|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} Minekaze series destroyers, the Fubukis {{did not have}} a {{forecastle}} break containing the forward torpedo launchers.

5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take Ayutthaya, Tabinshwehti claimed to have regained control of the Tavoy frontier. Indeed, the Burmese chronicles claim the <b>Siamese</b> king had agreed to pay an annual tribute. Even if this claim was true, the Toungoo Dynasty's control over Tavoy lasted {{a little over a}} year in any case. Tabinshwehti was assassinated just a year after the <b>Siamese</b> {{campaign}} on 30 April 1550, and the empire he had built in the previous 16 years quickly collapsed, with each town claiming a king. Even after Bayinnaung had restored the kingdom in the following years, the frontier region was likely under overlapping spheres of influence. (During his 1554–1555 campaign against Upper Burma, his southernmost garrison was at Ye, not Tavoy.) It was only in 1562 that Bayinnaung made an emphatic claim on the region by setting up a Burmese garrison at Tavoy, in preparation for his invasion of Siam a year later.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} six years, Toungoo was busy {{fighting}} against Hanthawaddy's allies: Prome (1542), the Confederation (1542–1544), and Prome's ally Mrauk-U (1546–1547). On {{the eve of the}} <b>Siamese</b> war, in 1547, Toungoo controlled a Lower Burma region from Pagan (Bagan) in the north to Moulmein in the south.|$|E

Three of their Anglo-Chinese offspring, including Lizzie Bunker, Haynes's mother, married into the local Haynes clan.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} initially met little resistance, as the Burmese {{forces were}} {{too large for}} the small guard posts around the border. Upon hearing of the Burmese invasion, Maha Chakkraphat mobilized his kingdom, then gathered his forces at Suphanburi, a town just west of Ayutthaya. When Tabinshwehti and his army arrived at the walled town of Kanchanaburi, they found it completely deserted. About a month into the invasion, mid-November 1548, the King of Burma then continued his march eastward, capturing the villages of Ban Thuan, Kaphan Tru and Chorakhe Sam Phan. The Burmese continued their advance and captured the ancient town of Uthong {{as well as the}} villages of Don Rakhang and Nong Sarai and closing in on Suphanburi. When the Burmese attacked the town, <b>Siamese</b> defenders could not withstand the onslaught and retreated towards Ayutthaya. Tabinshwehti ordered his army southeast along two canals, and crossed the Chao Phraya river near Phong Phaeng. From here he encamped his army directly north of the <b>Siamese</b> capital of Ayutthaya on a field called the Lumpli plain.|$|E
5000|$|German firm Konig, who {{specialised}} in racing outboard motors, built a few 1000cc H-8s c. 1970s, {{which were}} basically {{two of their}} VC500 flat fours mounted one above the other, with the direction of rotation reversed on one of them. Each half of the engine was a water cooled 2-stroke with rotating disc valve driven by a toothed belt via two 45/90 degree pulleys, plus two <b>siamesed</b> expansion chamber exhausts, fed by two single choke carbs. Both cylinders {{at each end of}} each engine fired at the same time, hence the <b>siamesed</b> exhausts for each pair. At least one H-8 found its way into a motorcycle & sidecar racing combo. The VC500 was rated initially at 68 bhp, later 75 & c.100 in the single seater Voigt Renwick Special designed for Hillclimbing, so the H-8 might achieve double these figures, although with very narrow power band and some reliability issues.|$|R
5000|$|White Tiger Trails {{were also}} {{made for the}} Gulf Petroleum {{sponsored}} Royal Military Police display team. The frames of these white Tigers omitted the pillion footrest brackets whilst the <b>siamesed</b> exhaust system was of a different design and their tanks sported metal badges instead of decals and being of later Italian manufacture, had 'flip-up' petrol caps. The front mudguard also had a perforated lower end.|$|R
5000|$|Inspired by the LS1.R in {{size and}} {{performance}} goals, this family of blocks was designed for race oriented performance. The only engine with this bore size {{that was used in}} a production vehicle is the LS7 with the LSX being only for aftermarket use. One unique feature of this family is that the cylinders are <b>siamesed,</b> no water passages between neighboring cylinders. [...] This was done to increase both bore size and block strength.|$|R

Two existing arsenal reworked Type 26s show stampings of <b>Siamese</b> numerals on the front grips indicating official procurement by the Thai government. Two additional reworked Type 26s have a five-pointed star stamped on the side plate of the revolver indicating Indonesian service after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and <b>Siamese,</b> some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|Bond then {{travels to}} Bangkok to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy <b>Siamese</b> {{entrepreneur}} suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured {{and placed in}} Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping {{with the aid of}} Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} water-cooled, and is {{produced}} using cast-iron cylinder block, with cast-in cylinders. The engine utilizes diesel fuel {{delivered in a}} direct injection method from a Bosch PES style inline injection pump. The cylinder head is a single unit for all cylinders, and the cylinder head cover and air intake are shared by a single cast aluminum alloy. Interestingly, exhaust ports 2&3 and 4&5 are <b>siamesed</b> together, presenting an exhaust manifold with only four outlets.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{design of}} the engine block and {{cylinder}} head was handled by Hyundai. It features <b>siamesed</b> bores, an aluminum block with cast-iron cylinder liners, and an aluminum head. Different cylinder liners could be fitted to increase or decrease displacement depending on manufacturers needs. Each manufacturer configured their variants of the initial design differently based on their engineering needs and standards, so consumers may experience very different power, fuel efficiency, and [...] "feel" [...] from each manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{produced}} some unusual and advanced features. The third group of Fubukis introduced a unique splinterproof torpedo tube turret (later retrofitted), allowing the tubes to be reloaded in action. In addition, they introduced splinterproof, gas-tight turrets for the 5-inch guns, {{far ahead of}} their time. To increase comfort, the forecastle was raised and the bridge enlarged and enclosed, to offer protection against weather in the Pacific. Furthermore, in line with Japan's evident preference for two stacks, Fubukis had an unusual <b>siamesed</b> design.|$|R
