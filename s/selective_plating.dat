40|$|A {{gold plating}} {{process in the}} {{electronics}} industry can be classified as (i) all surface plating or (ii) <b>selective</b> <b>plating.</b> <b>Selective</b> <b>plating</b> is more widely used than all surface plating because it can save more gold used in the plating process and takes less plating time. In this research, the <b>selective</b> <b>plating</b> process called jet plating was studied. Factors that possibly affected the gold usage and plating voltage were also studied to reduce the production cost. These factors included (a) plating temperature, (b) crystal (inhibitor) amount, (c) distance between workpiece and anode, (d) plating current and (e) plating speed. A two-level Full Factorial design with center points was first performed to screen the factors. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was then employed to optimize the factors in jet plating. The amount of gold usage should be reduced to 0. 366 g / 10, 000 pieces, the plating speed should be increased to 4 m/min and the plating voltage should not exceed 8. 0 V. According to the analysis, the optimal settings should be as follows: the plating temperature at 55. 5 deg C, the crystal amount at 90 %, the distance at 0. 5 mm, the plating current at 2. 8 A, and the plating speed at 4. 5 m/min.

30|$|The {{identification}} of microbial species within sample specimens {{is relevant to}} both the microbiological research laboratory and the clinical setting. A number of standard methods of species identification are currently used. <b>Selective</b> <b>plating</b> {{may be used to}} identify the constituent species and to obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the initial concentrations of bacteria present in a sample. Since this method involves serial dilutions, it can take up to several days and is insensitive to cells that are dead or incapable of reproduction by the time the sample is procured. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is highly sensitive to the initial concentrations of known species, but it requires prior knowledge of their genomes in order to provide specificity. Both qPCR and <b>selective</b> <b>plating</b> disrupt the initial sample’s architecture, and are thus ill-suited for spatial mapping studies of specimens such as biofilms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can provide spatial resolution, but requires sample fixation (eliminating the potential to study a sample over time), extensive preparation steps, and a genetically-targeted exogenous marker. A new measurement method that could map the spatial distribution of multiple species in intact, unfixed specimens in a label-free, non-contact manner would therefore be valuable. Such a technique could also make longitudinal study of samples like biofilms a possibility.|$|E

These two media allowed the growth of at least 62 - 72 % of R. equi present in the artificially contaminated samples, and the inhibition of unwanted contaminant bacteria and fungi was satisfactory with both media.

'' If such a mechanism was responsible, mutants should originate on <b>selective</b> <b>plates</b> rather than in the preceding culture in nonselective conditions and should give rise to Poisson-like fluctuation curves upon plating of sister cultures on selective medium. Poisson-like distribution profiles were indeed observed for Leu(+) mutants of S. typhimurium MA 412. However, an explanation for the observed Poisson-like fluctuation patterns without a need for selection-induced mutations was found. Microscopical analysis and cell mass/viable count measurements showed that the size of Leu(+) mutant cells was often much larger than those of nonmutants. This size difference was a stable characteristic of a large proportion of Leu(+) mutants, was observed both in stationary and growing culture and did not measurably affect the division rates of the cells in nutrient broth. As the transition from normal-sized nonmutant to oversized mutant cells during the nonselective culture phase of the fluctuation experiment may have been accompanied by a period with no or few completed cell division cycles, the number of mutant offspring may have been smaller than that of sibling nonmutants.
