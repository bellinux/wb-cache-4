50|$|As Centennial College's first site, <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Campus (651 <b>Warden</b> Avenue) {{opened its}} doors on October 17, 1966, with 514 {{students}} enrolled in 16 career-oriented programs including journalism, secretarial science and early childhood education. The campus made use of a decommissioned federal building that had been renovated {{to serve as a}} teaching institution. It evolved over the years to include the health/nutrition, hospitality, child studies and community services programs. In 1973, the Ontario government transferred responsibility for nursing education from the province’s hospitals to its colleges. Locally, the Scarborough Regional and the Toronto East General schools of nursing joined Centennial College to form the School of Health Sciences, based at <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Campus. <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Campus was demolished in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Nearby {{landmarks}} {{include the}} Providence Healthcare, <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Park, <b>Warden</b> Hilltop Community Centre and Pine Hills Cemetery. It is near much {{vacant industrial land}} (including the former site of Centennial College and <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Mall/Power Centre) where major redevelopment is expected over the coming years, including numerous new housing developments on the former Power Centre property. It is also near the Toronto District School Board high school W.A. Porter C.I., which brings about 700 students in the station each year.|$|R
50|$|One of the group's ongoing {{projects}} {{has been the}} restoration of the Taylor-Massey Creek watershed. Some of their naturalization projects include the Goulding Estate on Dawes Road and parts of <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{retired from}} active politics, Harris {{occasionally}} spoke on various municipal {{issues in the}} late 1980s and early 1990s, such as transit concerns and the proposal for the potential amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto. He {{died at the age}} of 91 due to complications from Parkinson's disease. A nature trail that passes through <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Park on Taylor-Massey Creek was named in his honour.|$|R
50|$|Centennial College grew rapidly, necessitating the {{establishment}} of additional campuses in {{the east end of}} Toronto to accommodate new programs and students. <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Campus closed in autumn of 2004 and was demolished thereafter {{to make way for a}} housing development. Most programs were relocated to the new Centennial Science and Technology Centre (Morningside Campus), which began operations the same year.|$|R
50|$|The {{section of}} the Danforth running through Oakridge {{provides}} its residence with shopping, dining and other entertainment. The Oakridge Community Centre is also {{where many of the}} youth in the neighbourhood find their entertainment. The Bloor-Danforth subway line of the TTC runs through the <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> park, and both the Warden and Victoria Park stations are located within the community.|$|R
5|$|Two {{post-secondary}} {{institutions were}} established in Scarborough. The University of Toronto expanded in 1964 and built the University of Toronto Scarborough, which has an enrolment of 10,000 students as of 2006. Centennial College was opened in 1966. It was the first community college to open in Ontario. Starting from one campus in <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods,</b> it grew to three campuses across Scarborough (and a fourth in East York).|$|R
25|$|In 1892 Wood was {{considered}} for the position of Commander-in-Chief, India, a move which the Queen favoured, while the Duke of Cambridge wanted him to become commander-in-chief at Madras so that the Queen's son the Duke of Connaught (himself a former commander-in-chief at Bombay, a few years earlier) could replace him at Aldershot. Henry Brackenbury, a senior military adviser to the Viceroy of India, thought Wood better suited to remain at Aldershot. <b>Wood</b> became Prime <b>Warden</b> of the Fishmongers' Company in 1893.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} {{intersection}} of St. Clair and Victoria Park was home to a small village named Moffat's Corners, {{and the rest of}} the region was rural. Clairlea was one of the first parts of Scarborough to be developed as a Toronto suburb, being transformed in the early 1950s. Today it is a middle income neighbourhood that features many affordable homes and mature streets. The <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> ravine is the landmark of the neighbourhood, offering some downtown nature.|$|R
50|$|South of Eglinton Avenue East {{it enters}} a shallow ravine and flows south passing through Pine Hills Cemetery. It exits the {{cemetery}} travelling west and enters a small park on St. Clair Avenue East. At Warden Avenue it turns southwest, moving through a park called <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods.</b> West of Pharmacy Avenue it enters a city run golf course. At Victoria Park Avenue it enters Taylor Creek Park and continues uninterrupted {{to where it}} empties into the Don River East Branch, {{just north of the}} forks of the Don.|$|R
50|$|Frank <b>Wood</b> was the <b>warden</b> of Stillwater prison when {{he helped}} {{come up with}} the plan for Oak Park Heights in 1982. He was also the first warden of the prison from 1982 until 1996 when he retired. His deputy James Bruton became the warden from 1996 until 2001. Constructed in 1981 and opened in 1982 at a cost of $31.5 million, Oak Park Heights is home to {{approximately}} 481 offenders. According to the Minnesota Department of Corrections, the prison's nine complexes are “specialized uniquely to help facilitate a safe, secure, and humane environment for the offenders incarcerated as well as the staff who work at Oak Park Heights”.|$|R
50|$|Subway trains {{travelling}} eastbound towards Victoria Park Station from Main Street Station {{exit the}} underground tunnel at the Tyra Portal {{several hundred feet}} from Victoria Park into an outdoor section of track. Then, a short section of the line is elevated through Victoria Park Station. Continuing east after the station, the track returns to ground level and angles northeast, diagonal to the street grid. <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Park, a city park that is mostly covered in forest with a central trail, {{is located on the}} northwest side of the tracks (on the left side of a train travelling eastbound). The scenery is thus relatively unique—subway trains travelling through forest, particularly when lush trees conceal the neighbourhood {{on the other side of}} the tracks in the summer with their leaves.|$|R
40|$|This {{application}} {{was made on}} or after January 1, 2007 and {{is subject to the}} new provisions of the Planning Act and the City of Toronto Act, 2006. The zoning by-law amendment application seeks a revision to a previously approved residential development to provide flexibility to the current zoning by permitting rear lane townhouses. This application to amend the zoning by-law proposes to permit the redevelopment of the property at 300 Danforth Road with approximately 258 to 281 dwelling units in a variety of housing forms, such as stacked townhouses, rear lane townhouses, street townhouses and semi-detached units. The current density which provides for a total of 348 dwelling units will remain unchanged. The proposed land use is consistent with the Mixed Use Area and Neighbourhood policies of the City’s Official Plan. The proposal implements objectives of the <b>Warden</b> <b>Woods</b> Community Secondary Plan. The zoning by-law amendment will allow for the appropriate development of the site, compatible with the surrounding development. Staff report for action – Final Report – 300 Danforth Road 2 This report reviews and recommends approval of the application to amend the zoning by-law...|$|R
