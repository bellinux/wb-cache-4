2500|$|Depending on what {{is being}} controlled, a forced-air air {{conditioning}} thermostat generally has an external switch for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the blower fan on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running. [...] Four wires come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a closet, basement, or occasionally in the attic): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three <b>supply</b> <b>control</b> signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green {{to turn on the}} blower fan. [...] The power is supplied by a transformer, and when the thermostat makes contact between the 24 volt power and {{one or two of the}} other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).|$|E
2500|$|A recent {{proposal}} from the European Senlis Council hopes {{to solve the}} problems caused by the large quantity of opium produced illegally in Afghanistan, most of which is converted to heroin and smuggled for sale in Europe and the United States. This proposal is to license Afghan farmers to produce opium for the world pharmaceutical market, and thereby solve another problem, that of chronic underuse of potent analgesics where required within developing nations. Part of the proposal is to overcome the [...] "80–20 rule" [...] that requires the U.S. to purchase 80 percent of its legal opium from India and Turkey to include Afghanistan, by establishing a second-tier system of <b>supply</b> <b>control</b> that complements the current INCB regulated supply and demand system by providing poppy-based medicines to countries who cannot meet their demand under the current regulations. Senlis arranged a conference in Kabul that brought drug policy experts {{from around the world to}} meet with Afghan government officials to discuss internal security, corruption issues, and legal issues within Afghanistan.|$|E
