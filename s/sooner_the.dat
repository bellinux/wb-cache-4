Pembleton asks for {{time to consider}} it, and the duo ask him {{not to mention the}} offer to Gee. Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the discussion was nothing. After discussing the offer with his wife Mary (Ami Brabson), Pembleton decides not to take the job and confesses to Gee, who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him <b>sooner.</b> <b>The</b> episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which he seldom does.|$|E

5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E

50|$|The Big 12 South {{representative}} was <b>the</b> Oklahoma <b>Sooners.</b> <b>The</b> {{team was}} coached by Bob Stoops, in his eighth season at Oklahoma.

25|$|Starvation ensues {{when the}} fat {{reserves}} are completely exhausted and protein {{is the only}} fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, {{even if there are}} still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted earlier, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs <b>sooner.)</b> <b>The</b> ultimate cause of death is, in general, cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest brought on by tissue degradation and electrolyte imbalances.|$|E
25|$|The spacing between {{signals and}} points was {{designed}} to allow fast through running by freight trains and meant that gantry 8 was less than 100m {{to the west of}} a road bridge; this compromised the distance from which the signal could be seen by drivers of trains leaving Paddington. To allow the higher ('proceed') aspects to be seen <b>sooner,</b> <b>the</b> standard signals (with the four aspects arranged vertically) were replaced with non-standard 'reverse L' signals, with the red aspect {{to the left of the}} lower yellow. The Paddington resignalling scheme had been implemented ahead of formal HMRI approval; this had still not been received at the time of the crash.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the newlyweds}} did not {{immediately}} settle in Gibraltar. They left the Rock soon after the wedding, probably {{to go back to}} Livorno or elsewhere in Liguria. It was 1845 before Giovanni returned to the Rock's shores indefinitely, with Maria having made it back <b>sooner.</b> <b>The</b> marriage marked the start of the Sacarello family of Gibraltar. After having been settled in Gibraltar for some time, the couple's youngest son Francisco Felipe (born 26 June 1833) married Maria Magdalena Fava (born 1837). Their son Bartholomew Sacarello - better known as Bartolo - later founded the family business by establishing B. Sacarello Limited as a provisions merchant in 1888.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> padded <b>the</b> lead to 28-10 with another Murray {{touchdown}}. The Longhorns cut {{the lead to}} 28-20 with a rushing touchdown and field goal. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> had to punt with 1:02 left, giving the Longhorns hope at a chance of scoring again. However, returner Aaron Williams muffed the punt and <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> recovered <b>the</b> ball. This was the second loss in a row for the Longhorns.|$|R

500|$|The Americans {{were pulling}} out of Southeast Asia as quickly as {{negotiations}} with the North Vietnamese would allow them. Ambassador Godley, stunned by the diplomatic developments, ruminated that [...] "We had led him (Souvanna) down the garden path. Let's face it, we were cutting and running... Once {{we were out of}} Vietnam the only way we could have protected Laos was with an Army corps. It was totally out of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a separate agreement with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> fighting in Laos ceased, the <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

500|$|The {{enforcement}} of the Tea Act of 1773 became a heated issue with the colonists, with the well-known demonstration at the Boston harbor, the Boston Tea Party, a direct reaction to the act. However, a much more important shift occurred in the colonists' drink of choice. In 1773, John Adams {{wrote a letter to}} his wife stating, [...] "Tea must be universally renounced and I must be weaned, and the <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> better." [...] Thus began the American shift from tea to coffee. In a concentrated boycott, the housewives of Falmouth, Massachusetts publicly united, vowing to serve only coffee in their homes. This inspired other households throughout the colonies, both in the north and south, to do the same.|$|E
500|$|President Lincoln had had {{concerns}} that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 might be reversed or found invalid after the war. He saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution. He had remained outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous. Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment. After winning reelection in the election of 1864, Lincoln made {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning with his efforts in Congress during its [...] "lame duck" [...] session. Popular support for the amendment mounted and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6, 1864 State of the Union Address: [...] "there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go, at all events, may we not agree that the <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> better?" ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} fairy tale, the princess actually sleeps for 100 {{years before she}} is finally awoken by the prince's kiss; this detail was adjusted for the film in favor of having Prince Phillip introduced much earlier, and thus Aurora is awoken much <b>sooner.</b> <b>The</b> writers also omitted darker elements featured in the earliest versions of [...] "Sleeping Beauty", such as the princess being raped and impregnated with twins by the prince while she is asleep. In the Brothers Grimm's version, the princess is destined to prick her finger {{at the age of}} 15, while Disney decided to make the character one year older. Aurora's names are borrowed from both Tchaikovsky's ballet and the Brothers Grimm's version of the fairy tale. While Tchaikovsky referred to his princess as [...] "Aurora", the Brothers Grimm named her [...] "Little Briar Rose". This ultimately inspired Disney to use both, the latter of which serves as the character's alias while she is hiding from Maleficent. Aurora was the last princess in whose conception Walt Disney himself was directly involved.|$|E
