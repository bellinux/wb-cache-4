In May 1943 Allied armies {{completed}} {{the capture of}} North Africa, and on 17 August they drove the last Axis forces out of Sicily, rendering the threat to Gibraltar negligible. On 24 August 1943, the Director of Naval Intelligence sent a highly classified, one-time pad message in which he ordered one last wireless communications exercise, as well as blocking up of the chambers and distribution of the provisions that had been stored there. The manual for Operation Tracer is at the Naval Intelligence Division, #1001107/42. It elaborates on the selection of personnel, as well as heating, lighting, and sanitation. In addition, it has a dozen appendices on food, clothing, utensils, tools, equipment, furniture, cooking, stationery, games, library, <b>sundries,</b> medical stores, and surgical instruments. The manual also discusses the challenges encountered in constructing the covert facility.|$|E

The column ran in every issue until 27 June 1752, appearing irregularly thereafter.
