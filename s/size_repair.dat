40|$|Clefts of the lip and palate {{are among}} the most common {{congenital}} malformations. A unilateral deformity is {{the most common type of}} cleft, but even within this subgroup there is a great deal of variety due to the accompanying severe distortion of the upper lip, cheek, nose, and maxilla. To repair such a variety of clefts with good aesthetic results, several general incisional approaches should be mastered along with a variety of subtle techniques that improve the end product. The most common repair utilized in America is the Millard rotation-advancement technique. This is partly due to the perceived superiority in results compared with other repairs and the ease with which this repair can be taught to residents. This repair places the scar along an artificial philtral column and is often quite sufficient in small clefts. Unfortunately, adoption of this “one size fits all” approach can limit the arsenal of the surgeon facing the vast array of differing cleft lip deformities. For example, the modified triangular flap, or Tennison-Randall repair, can be of value when presented with the wider unilateral cleft lip. In an effort to not only demonstrate that excellent results can be achieved when incisional patterns (Millard and Tennison) are used appropriately (small versus large clefts), we compared the results of two types of repairs, performed by a single surgeon over a period of 30 years. In addition, a variety of subtle techniques are reviewed to assist in obtaining excellent aesthetic results for any <b>size</b> <b>repair...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} loss of thermally treated {{glass fibre}} (GF) at elevated temperature is well reported in literature. This phenomenon even occurs at {{short period of}} time such as 25 minutes. In the recycling technologies for composites, GFs are usually recovered by degradation of polymeric matrix with thermal and/or chemical treatments. Therefore thermal effect on the strength of GF is a significant factor when restricting the possibilities of recycling this material for a second life. This study reports on the strength of thermally treated commercial GF after acid treatment and silanization of the fibre surface to achieve a proper combination of treatments which may provide us with the ability to recover the mechanical properties of the heat treated GFs. It is thought that silane coupling agents can directly increase and recover the strength of GFs. Two factors associated with this recovery are the possibility of the <b>sizing</b> <b>repairing</b> the damage {{on the surface of the}} heat treated GFs and the reduction of the fibre-fibre friction in the bundle through lubricating effect. GF samples were heat treated at 4500 C for 25 minutes and coated with silanes, applying different combinations of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and the two silanes used in this study, γ-Aminopropyltrimethoxy Silane (APS) and γ- Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy Silane (MPS); these fibres were characterized by single fibre testing for strength. The results obtained demonstrated that the fibre strength improves slightly after combination of HCl and MPS treatment, and has a negative effect when the combination of HCl and APS was used.

40|$|The uvrD 252 {{mutation}} {{leads to}} increased UV sensitivity, diminished dimer excision and host cell reactivation capacity, {{and an increase}} in the average patch <b>size</b> after <b>repair</b> replication. A recA 56 uvrD 252 double mutant was far more resistant to UV than was a recA 56 uvrB 5 double mutant. Its host cell reactivation capacity was identical to that of uvrD 252 single mutant and was far greater than that of the uvrB 5 single mutant. The strain showed no Weigle reactivation. From these results, we concluded that the double mutant has no inducible DNA repair (including long-patch excision repair) but retains dimer excision capabilities comparable to the uvrD 252 single mutant. It appears, therefore, that the long patches detected in the uvrD mutant were not identical to the recA-dependent patches seen in wild-type cells...|$|R
40|$|The patch <b>size</b> for {{excision}} <b>repair</b> of {{ultraviolet radiation}} (UV) -induced pyrimidine dimers was determined in cultured murine epithelial cells with normal and enhanced pyrimidine dimer repair capabilities.

Pyrimidine dimer repair following exposure to UV from an FS- 40 sunlamp {{was determined by}} micrococcal dimer-specific nuclease digestion and alkaline sucrose ultracentrifugation. Patch size was estimated based on the photolytic lability of bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA. Excision repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in denV-transfected 308 cells was enhanced two- to threefold. Production of mRNA from the deny gene in cell lines with enhanced repair was confirmed by RNA blotting. In control cells, the patch <b>size</b> for excision <b>repair</b> of DNA photoproducts {{was estimated to be}} 34 nucleotides per photoproduct removed; in denV-transfected cells, a smaller average patch size of 10 - 16 nucleotides per photoproduct removed was calculated.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to study how {{biological}} properties, such as proliferation and commitment ability, of human adult dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) relate {{to the age of}} the donor. Human dental pulps were extracted from molars of healthy adult subjects aged 16 to > 66 years.

Proliferation ability was evaluated by determining doubling time, and commitment ability was evaluated by gene expression and morphological analyses for tissue-specific markers. The results confirm a well-defined proliferative ability for each donor age group at an early in vitro passage (p 2). DPSCs from younger donors (up to 35 years) maintain this ability in long-term cultures (p 8). Stem cells of all age donor groups maintain their commitment ability during in vitro culture.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{selectively}} photolyze bromouracil-(BrUra-) containing repaired regions in cellular DNA has {{allowed us to}} estimate the average <b>size</b> of <b>repaired</b> regions in ultraviolet (UV) light-irradiated Escherichia coli. Cells were labeled with thymidine- 3 H, irradiated at 254 nm, and incubated in nonradioactive bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). After incubation the cells were exposed to 106 ergs·mm- 2 at 313 nm, lysed, and sedimented in alkaline sucrose gradients so as to measure the average molecular weight of single DNA strands. In strains that had excised ∼ 45 cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers/ 108 daltons, the 313 nm treatment resulted in ∼ 6 single-strand breaks/ 108 daltons. In an excisionless strain, the same treatment resulted in only 1. 5 breaks/ 108 daltons. From {{the determination of the}} sensitivities of fully substituted DNAs to 313 nm light, we calculate that the repaired regions in excising strains of E. coli contain an average of 4 - 6 BrUra residues.

40|$|Embryogenesis is an {{extraordinarily}} robust process, exhibiting {{the ability to}} control tissue <b>size</b> and <b>repair</b> patterning defects in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations. The size and shape of a developing tissue {{is a function of the}} number and size of its constit-uent cells as well as their geometric packing. How these cellular properties are coordinated at the tissue level to ensure developmental robustness remains a mystery; understanding this process requires studying multiple concurrent processes that make up morphogenesis, including the spatial patterning of cell fates and apoptosis, as well as cell intercalations. In this work, we develop a computational model that aims to understand aspects of the robust pattern repair mechanisms of the Drosophila embryonic epidermal tissues. Size control in this system has previously been shown to rely on the regulation of apoptosis rather than proliferation; however, to date little work has been done to understand the role of cellular mechanics in this process.

After {{a discussion of}} service life and preventive conservation, this thesis extracted and analyzed historic mentions of repairs in the record books of the Concord School House in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which span from 1775 to 1987. Repairs to the building’s masonry, carpentry, windows, finishes, and roof assemblies were chosen for investigation.

Ultimately, this thesis found that data from historic records of repairs was not specific enough to stand alone in estimating service lives of the building systems for use in preventive conservation planning. However, analysis of the historic records identified repair cycles which, when supplemented with conditions assessments, could be used to inform preventive conservation planning and the formation of building reinvestment plans.
