Twenty-five to 60 hatchlings from each control or experimental dip group were held in containers and the water was tested (excretion method) for <b>Salmonella</b> and <b>Arizona</b> every 15 or 30 days for 180 to 210 days after hatching. Representative turtles were homogenized (blending method) to determine if systemic infections were present. All specimens tested were enriched in tetrathionate and selenite cystine broth. Nondipped eggs and water-dipped eggs routinely showed <b>Salmonella</b> and <b>Arizona</b> present in egg homogenate and hatchlings emerging from these eggs excreted these pathogens.

The prevalence of Wegener’s granulomatosis is three cases per 100, 000 patients. Cardiovascular, neurologic, cutaneous, and joint manifestations {{have been reported in}} many case reports and case series. Gastrointestinal manifestations are less noted in Wegener’s granulomatosis, although they have been previously reported in the form of intestinal perforation and intestinal ischemia. Additionally, there are characteristic findings of vasculitis that are noted with active Wegener’s granulomatosis of the small bowel. We report a case of an elderly patient who presented with weight loss, diarrhea, and hematochezia. His symptoms were chronic and had lasted for more than 1 year before diagnosis. Inflammatory bowel disease or chronic enteritis due to <b>Salmonella</b> <b>arizonae</b> because of reptile exposure originally were suspected as etiologies of his presentation. The findings of proteinuria, renal failure, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy, in conjunction with an elevated c-ANCA titer, confirmed the diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis with associated intestinal vasculitis. This case demonstrates an atypical presentation of chronic duodenitis and jejunitis secondary to Wegener’s granulomatosis, which mimicked inflammatory bowel disease.

40|$|On {{commercial}} turtle farms {{more than}} 40 % of the hatchlings excrete detectable levels of <b>Salmonella</b> and <b>Arizona</b> spp. when hatched from nonsanitized eggs incubated in sawdust or dirt-filled chambers. Over a 3 -year period on 10 farms, more than 10 (6) turtle eggs were treated {{in an attempt}} to hatch Salmonella-free turtles. Eggs were sanitized in disinfectant, treated by temperature- or pressure-differential dip methods in solutions containing 500 micrograms or more of gentamicin sulfate per ml, and hatched in sanitized plastic chambers free of bedding material. The <b>Salmonella</b> and <b>Arizona</b> spp. infection levels for turtles produced from treated eggs were 0 and 1. 12 % for years 1 and 2, respectively, whereas infection levels for hatchlings produced from nontreated eggs during these periods were 47 and 44 %, respectively.

Other Salmonella spp., namely, S. arizona SL 5302, S. <b>arizona</b> SLS, <b>Salmonella</b> austin, and Salmonella memphis, formed aerobactin but contained no detectable large plasmids.

40|$|A lysine-iron agar is {{described}} and recommended {{for the detection}} of Arizona strains which ferment lactose rapidly. Black colonies which appear on bismuth sulfite agar should be transferred to the medium. <b>Salmonellae</b> and <b>Arizona</b> cultures produce a distinctive reaction since they are the only recognized groups of enteric bacteria which regularly produce lysine decarboxylase rapidly and form large amounts of hydrogen sulfide. Use of the medium is particularly recommended in the examination of specimens from enteric infections in which shigellae and salmonellae are not detected...|$|R
40|$|One hundred {{samples of}} ten poultry meat {{products}} {{were collected from}} AL-Ahsa markets (King Saudi Arabia). The samples were ranked from carcass cuts “filet and thigh ” to minced meat or further processed products as burger, nuggets, frankfurter and meat paste loaf. Samples were collected in triplicate for sensory, chemical and microbiological analysis to assure their quality and safety. The obtained results revealed variation in chemical composition; some products with high fat % have an increased thiobarbituic acid value, which results in their unacceptability due to the appearance of abnormal flavor. Bacteriological analysis revealed that the mean total bacterial count was ranged form 2. 7 X 104 /g for nuggets 1 to 3. 3 X 107 /g for burger 2 and the other products {{in the range of}} 105 to 10 6 /gm, while S. aureus mean count ranged from less than 102 /gm for all samples, accept 104 /g and 106 /g for mince 2 and frankfurter samples respectively. E. Coli isolated form 70 % of the samples and <b>salmonella</b> <b>arizona</b> was isolated at once form thigh samples. Thirty % of samples not comply with Saudi Standards due to sensory unacceptability and 20 % of samples nonconforming with bacteriological specifications...|$|R
