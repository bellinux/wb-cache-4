50|$|Water {{lines or}} kitchen systems can get gravel, {{deposits}} that break free, and other stray {{items in the}} line. Due to the velocity of the water pushing them, they can severely damage or clog devices installed in the flow stream of the water line, for example p-traps or pipes. A strainer is essentially a screen installed to allow water to pass through, but not larger items. The larger items fall to the bottom or are held in a basket for later clean out. They normally have an access that allows {{for them to be}} cleaned or have the <b>strainer</b> <b>plate</b> or basket replaced.|$|E
50|$|Strainers come {{in several}} {{different}} styles based on the needs. A <b>plate</b> <b>strainer</b> is the simplest, in which water flows through a perforated plate. Often the plate is corrugated shape to increase surface area. A basket strainer is a design where the strainer is shaped like a basket and usually installed in a vertical system. The basket strainer is easier to clean, since debris is captured in the basket. It can also sometimes offer more straining surface area than a <b>plate</b> <b>strainer,</b> improving flow rates, or decreasing pressure loss through the strainer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{extracted}} milk {{passes through}} a <b>strainer</b> and <b>plate</b> heat exchangers before entering the tank, {{where it can be}} stored safely for a few days at approximately [...] At pre-arranged times, a milk truck arrives and pumps the milk from the tank for transport to a dairy factory where it will be pasteurized and processed into many products. The frequency of pick up depends and the production and storage capacity of the dairy; large dairies will have milk pick-ups once per day.|$|R
40|$|Following {{informed}} consent, tumor samples {{classified as}} glioblastoma based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, {{were obtained from}} patients undergoing medically indicated surgical resection of their tumors. Within 1 to 3 hours after surgical removal, tumors were washed and enzymatically dissociated into single cells. Red blood cells were removed by differential centrifugation. Tumor {{cells were cultured in}} NBE media consisting of Neurobasal media (Invitrogen), N 2 and B 27 supplements (0. 5 x each; Invitrogen), human recombinant FGF 2 and EGF (25 ng/ml each; R&D systems). Uncoated plastic dishes were used for neurosphere culture of NBE cells, whereas plates were pre-coated with poly-ornithine (Invitrogen) for adherent cultures of NBE cells. Recombinant BMP 2, CNTF (R&D systems) and LIF (Invitrogen) were used as indicated. Cytokine-induced differentiation of TICs and NSCs Spheroid-forming cells cultured in serum-free media with FGF 2 and EGF were dissociated, filtered through a 70 Âµm <b>strainer,</b> and <b>plated</b> in the poly-ornithine coated plates for adherent cultures. Cells at early passages in vitro were used in these studies (0308, 0822, and 1228 : passage 4; 0707 : passage 3). Once cells were attached, NB...|$|R
