In this project, the visualization of flow is studied using PTV simulation of an Oseen vortex. For statistically fitting the fluid data, two main methods were used: regressive <b>fitting</b> and <b>spline</b> <b>fitting.</b> Final fits of data were done using Kriging, which is a sophisticated regression method, and thin plate <b>spline</b> <b>fitting.</b> Then, comparisons of the two methods were drawn using statistical methods. Kriging yielded lower mean squared error overall, but thin plate <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> method takes smoothness of fit into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer a mathematically simple and {{theoretical}} based alternative model to existing techniques for the estimation of beta cell secretion of peptides. This is achieved by applying gamma variate analysis rather than cubic <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> techniques to measured insulin and glucose levels. The resulting fits between experimental and theoretical data are excellent. Cubic <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> methods can also give excellent results, though to some extent this is an artefact of these methods, which by their very nature give smooth fitting to experimental or plotted points. Unfortunately, <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> is very sensitive to the choice of knot points, the interval of measurement, and the accuracy of initial estimates of the parameters...|$|R

The calibration study is carried out with uniform temperature field image captured at various temperatures. It is found that the calibration error due to the viewing angle variation is reduced with {{an increase in the number}} of calibration points and by the introduction of smoothing technique.

50|$|Because {{the aim of}} step {{detection}} is to find {{a series}} of instantaneous jumps in the mean of a signal, the wanted, underlying, mean signal is piecewise constant. For this reason, step detection can be profitably viewed as the problem of recovering a piecewise constant signal corrupted by noise. There are two complementary models for piecewise constant signals: as 0-degree splines with a few knots, or as level sets with a few unique levels. Many algorithms for step detection are therefore best understood as either 0-degree <b>spline</b> <b>fitting,</b> or level set recovery, methods.|$|R

40|$|Colonic polyps are growths on {{the inner}} wall of the colon. They appear like {{elliptical}} protrusions which can be detected by curvature-derived shape discriminators. For reasons of computation efficiency, {{much of the past}} work in computeraided diagnostic CT colonography adopted kernel-based convolution methods in curvature estimation. However, kernel methods can yield erroneous results at thin structures where the gradient diminishes. In this paper, we investigate three surface patch fitting methods: Cubic B-spline, paraboloid, and quadratic polynomials. This “patch ” approach is {{based on the fact that}} a surface can be re-oriented such that it can be approximated by a bivariate function locally. These patch methods are evaluated by synthesized data with various orientations and sampling sizes. We find that the cubic spline method performs best regardless of large orientation variances. Cubic spline and quadratic polynomial methods perform equally well for large samples while the latter performs better for small ones. Based on the performance evaluation, we propose a new, two-stage curvature estimation method. The cubic <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> is performed first for its insensitivity to orientation. If the <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> errs by more than a preset value (indicating high surface tortuosity), a small data sample is fitted by a quadratic function. The evaluation is performed on 29 patients (58 data sets).
