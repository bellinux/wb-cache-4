25|$|The first fossil of Euoplocephalus {{was found}} in 1897 in Alberta. In 1902, it was named Stereocephalus, but that name had already been given to an insect, so it was changed in 1910. Later, many more ankylosaurid remains were found from the Campanian of North America and often made {{separate}} genera. In 1971, Walter Coombs concluded that they all belonged to Euoplocephalus which then {{would be one of}} the best-known dinosaurs. Recently however, experts have come to the opposite conclusion, limiting the authentic finds of Euoplocephalus to about a dozen specimens. These include a number of almost complete skeletons, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> nevertheless known about the build of the animal.|$|E
25|$|The JWST has {{a history}} of major cost overruns and delays which have {{resulted}} from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. The first budget estimates were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011, but NASA has now scheduled the telescope for a 2019 launch on a budget that has grown to $8.8 billion. In 2011, the United States House of Representatives voted to terminate funding, after about $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. Funding was restored and capped at $8 billion. , the telescope remained on schedule for a spring 2019 launch and within the 2011 revised budget. One of the reasons why the cost grew <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> {{that it is difficult to}} forecast the cost of development, and in general budget predictability improved when initial development milestones were achieved.|$|E

[...] The Senate sent the bonus bill back to committee, but the issue returned when Congress reconvened in December 1921. A bill providing a bonus, without a means of funding it, was passed by both houses in September 1922. Harding vetoed it, and the veto was narrowly sustained. A bonus, not payable in cash, was voted to soldiers despite Coolidge's veto in 1924.|$|E

500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> that it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E

Lack of reading skills is more disgraceful than listening in bovine silence to the screams of 300 people as they are burned to death behind the locked doors of a church you're guarding to prevent them from escaping the flames. Which is what Hanna did, although, of course, it's not shown in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1970s until today, {{a new and}} {{especially}} young field {{in the area of}} second-language acquisition was developed. It is connected cross-sectionally throughout different research areas. Language attrition, in general, is concerned with what is lost (linguistic focus), how it is lost (psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic focus) and why it is lost (sociolinguistic, sociologistic and anthropologistic focus) (Hansen 1999). Over 25 years research has been concentrated on studying the attrition of second languages. First studies, dealing with the topic of language loss or language attrition, were published in the late 1970s (de Bot & Weltens 1989: 127). In 1980, the University of Pennsylvania hosted the conference [...] "The Loss of Language Skills", and language attrition was recognized as a field in the research of second-language acquisition. Since then, various scientific research papers – mainly within America – have been published. Later, several studies in Europe – especially the Netherlands – followed. In other countries, however, language attrition research was paid hardly any attention (de Bot & Weltens 1995). Compared to the field of second-language acquisition, language attrition is still relatively young; <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> still unknown.|$|E
2500|$|During this timeframe, Freddie Roach {{selected}} Calderón as a {{sparring partner}} for Oscar De La Hoya. The {{reason for this}} was that the trainer was seeking a fast adversary. On November 16, 2008, Roach rememorated the event in his blog for The Ring, stating that [...] "Calderon slapped Oscar around like it was unbelievable." [...] The trainer also noted that he asked De La Hoya to pursue the offense, but the boxer's attempts were unsuccessful. In response, Calderón expressed that he participated in [...] "three or four rounds" [...] of sparring, during which he [...] "gave him problems" [...] and [...] "made him uncomfortable", while De La Hoya [...] "tried to hit" [...] but seemed [...] "out of timing". Similarly, Calderón competed against Shane Mosley in a four-round sparring match. The session was in preparation, serving as training {{for the first of}} a series of fights against Hugo Cázares. During the actual contest, Mosley had problems landing punches due to his adversary's speed. While Calderón recognized that his opponent's weight made the practice feel like a complete workout. Subsequently, Mosley expressed that [...] "Iván uses the angles very well and sparring against someone that moves <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> fun". Calderón noted that competing against a heavier boxer helped him adjust to the pressure that could be presented by Cázares.|$|E
