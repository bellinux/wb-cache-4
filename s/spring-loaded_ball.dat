50|$|To resist {{movement}} (or when creating incremental steps), {{methods are}} employed {{which include a}} <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>ball</b> bearing that locates in small incremental depressions, {{or a piece of}} spring steel that snaps into position on flat surfaces or shallow notches milled into the shaft or wheel.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} some early CD-ROM drives for desktop PCs in which its tray-loading {{mechanism}} will eject slightly and user has {{to pull out}} the tray manually to load CD, similar to the tray ejecting method used in internal optical disc drives of modern laptops and modern external slim portable optical disc drives. Like the top-loading mechanism, they have <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>ball</b> bearings on the spindle.|$|E
50|$|A {{float collar}} is {{installed}} {{near the bottom}} of the casing string. Cement plugs land on it during the primary cementing operation, thus retaining inside the casing a small portion of the cement slurry that may have become contaminated as the top plug scrapes the inside of the casing. It is similar to a float shoe; often both are used for redundancy. The internal check valves may be flapper type or <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>balls.</b>|$|R
50|$|A further {{development}} was {{the addition of}} motors for driving each axis. Operators {{no longer had to}} physically touch the machine but could drive each axis using a handbox with joysticks {{in much the same way}} as with modern remote controlled cars. Measurement accuracy and precision improved dramatically with the invention of the electronic touch trigger probe. The pioneer of this new probe device was David McMurtry who subsequently formed what is now Renishaw plc. Although still a contact device, the probe had a <b>spring-loaded</b> steel <b>ball</b> (later ruby ball) stylus. As the probe touched the surface of the component the stylus deflected and simultaneously sent the X.Y,Z coordinate information to the computer. Measurement errors caused by individual operators became fewer and the stage was set for the introduction of CNC operations and the coming of age of CMMs.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum modulator. The valve body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of <b>spring-loaded</b> valves, check <b>balls</b> and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle valve or modulator) to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of drive models, mostly compact {{portable}} units, have a top-loading mechanism where the drive lid is opened upwards and the disc is placed directly onto the spindle (for example, all PlayStation One consoles, portable CD players, and some standalone CD recorders all feature top-loading drives). These sometimes {{have the advantage of}} using <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>ball</b> bearings to hold the disc in place, minimizing damage to the disc if the drive is moved while it is spun up.|$|E
5000|$|... 1 - Minolta-35 (Model A)On {{entering}} the miniature camera business, Chiyoda Kogaku {{had decided to}} make the frame size 24×32mm, a logical proposition at the time since most photo copies were made on paper closer to this format. The already established international standard was 36 images of 24×36mm. By doing so, a standard length of film yielded four more exposures on a 36-exposure load. The Minolta-35 has a combined viewfinder and rangefinder eyepiece, negating the need to move the sight from one window to the other. It also features a self-timer and a hinged rear door to facilitate film loading. The camera came with a decent Super Rokkor 45mm f/2.8 standard optic comprising five elements in three groups, including the front group of three cemented elements designed to secure sharp images on the small negative. When the camera appeared all engravings on the lens and on the slow-speed dial were oriented to be read from the front side of the camera. Later, at about serial no. 4000, they were turned to be read as one holds the camera for picture taking. Accessory mounted in the shoe on top of the camera is secured by a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>ball</b> that sometimes mistakenly is assumed to be a flash synchroniser contact, which it is not.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball bearing lock action, which features <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>ball</b> bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Only very {{recently}} has modern technology {{been applied to}} the design of the tennis racket. In fact, the tennis player of a few hundred years ago would easily recognize today's racket. Although the literature reveals a surprising number of studies on racket mechanics, little work has been reported on the dynamic stresses involved during tennis play. Such investigations lead naturally to questions of fully stressed design optimization. An AMF/Head "Professional" tennis racket was modeled on an IBMPC-AT using the MSC-PAL finite element code. Experimental verification of the computer model was accomplished in two ways. First, the racket was clamped at the handle, loaded statically, and deflections measured by dial indicator. Next, the racket was instrumented with piezoelectric accelerometers, caused to vibrate in its fundamental mode, and the resulting acceleration-time history recorded on a digital oscilloscope. This data was translated on the IBMPC-AT to reveal the racket's fundamental natural frequency. These experimental results were then compared to the predictions from the finite element model. For dynamic loading, the racket was mounted in a test fixture utilizing a <b>spring-loaded</b> arm. Tennis <b>balls</b> were fired from a pitching machine with the acceleration-time history again recorded on a digital oscilloscope. The data was processed on the IBMPC-AT and used as input for the finite element transient analysis, and dynamic stresses in the racket frame were determined. The results are disscused and future research opportunities are indicated...|$|R
40|$|A {{remotely}} operable {{pressure regulator}} and shutoff valve particularly suited for achieving high resolution and flow control, and positive shutoff is described. The valve {{is characterized by}} a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>ball</b> coaxially aligned with a fluid port to be sealed, a spring-loaded pintle extended through the port into engagement with the ball, for controlling the position, a spring-loaded diaphragm for controlling the position of the pintle, and an axially displaceable spring supported by a movable stop which, in turn, is repositioned by a selectively operable stepper motor. Thus, the pressure-response characteristics for the valve can be varied through a selective repositioning of the stop...|$|E
40|$|DE 3915862 A UPAB: 19930928 The {{motor vehicle}} is {{provided}} with a centrally controlled locking system for the doors, boot lid, and bonnet. Each lock is actuated by means of two rolling diaphragms (10, 11) installed in chambers (4) and (5) respectively which are mounted side by side. The diagram shows the lock mechanism in the locked position. The lock is released either by actuating an outside lever (24) or an inside lever (25) which set the pump (8) operating. This pump draws air from the chamber (5) so that the rolling diaphragm moves upwards and swings the anti-theft lever (17) upwards. The rod (27) attached to the diaphragm (11) opens the valve (9) so that air is drawn from the second chamber (4) and the second diaphragm moves upwards together with the rod (12) to allow the security lever (14) to move upwards. The mechanism is held in this position by a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>ball</b> catch (20). USE - Central locking for motor vehicles. 1 /...|$|E
