5|$|American {{experts in}} {{military}} law {{agreed that the}} 1950 events violated {{the laws of war}} prohibiting targeting of noncombatants, but said that prosecuting ex-soldiers a half-century later was a practical impossibility.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a flow-sensitive algorithm to compute interprocedural definition-use chains of dynamic pointer-linked data structures. The {{goal is to}} relate the <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> construct links of dynamic pointer-linked data structures (i. e. definitions) to the <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> might traverse the structures through the links (i. e. uses). Specifically, for each <b>statement</b> S <b>that</b> defines links of pointer-linked data structures, the algorithm finds the set of <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> traverse the links which are defined by S. This algorithm solves the definition-use chaining problem by performing backward iterative data flow analysis to compute the set of upward exposed uses at each statement. The results of this algorithm {{can be used to}} identify parallelism in programs even with cyclic pointer-linked data structures...|$|R
