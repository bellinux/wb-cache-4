40|$|The {{importance}} of strengthening local governments is widely recognised as local governments face new challenges {{against the backdrop}} of global decentralisation processes. Municipal International Cooperation (MIC) contributes strategically to such processes by peer-to-peer learning within existing local institutions, a development process that is both efficient and provides continuity. Empirically, the paper draws upon the findings of an evaluation of the Dutch support programme for MIC called LOGO South. The main conclusion is that partnerships between local authorities do strengthen local governments in the South; the unique approach of the LOGO <b>South</b> <b>programme</b> adds important spillover effects in mutual learning, resulting in both policy transfer and mobility. By creating multilevel governance networks, knowledge circulation was also strengthened. This paper contributes to the debate by showing that locally based, multilevel hybrid networks are strategic for governance processes...|$|E

The MPA <b>programmes</b> in <b>South</b> Africa are compared with the MPA programmes that are offered in the United States of America (USA). The research shows that not all the <b>South</b> African MPA <b>programmes</b> meet the HEQF’s requirements for a course work master’s degree. Most of the MPA programmes will therefore have to be adapted to meet the requirements of the HEQF. The requirements of the HEQF for a course work master’s degree will give the <b>South</b> African MPA <b>programmes</b> a higher research component than the MPA programmes that are offered in the USA. The implications of this will be that the research component of <b>South</b> African <b>programmes</b> with below average research components will have to be increased...|$|R

40|$|The <b>South</b> African housing <b>programme</b> is {{acclaimed}} internationally and {{has achieved}} important successes {{since its inception}} in 1994. However, there are also concerns about its negative impacts. The ambiguity of this achievement is underlined when the programme is viewed from different perspectives. To consider the complex picture of positive and negative outcomes, this paper takes the viewpoints of the nation, the city and the household and reveals a range of problems that suggest the need to reform the housing programme. It then uses these three viewpoints to reveal the constraints that hold back reform. The paper argues {{that it is necessary to}} understand the 'competing rationalities' reflected in the three viewpoints. Although this is not the only factor holding back fundamental transformation, recognising it does help to explain the persistence of significant problems in the housing <b>programme.</b> <b>South</b> Africa, housing <b>programme,</b> constraints to reform, reconstruction and development programme projects,...|$|R
