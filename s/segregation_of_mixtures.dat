40|$|This is {{the first}} {{experimental}} study of <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixtures</b> of spherocylindrical rods of same volume and different elongations (down to the limit of spheres, where elongation is zero). When vibrated in a cylinder, we observe that short spherocylinders tend to migrate above isovolume spheres, while long spherocylinders tend to migrate to the bottom. More generally, short spherocylinders tend to migrate {{to the top of}} long spherocylinders. Moreover, the particles migrating to the bottom tend to arrange in an ordered state. We couple experiments and numerical simulations. Our discrete element model (DEM) faithfully captures the physical behavior, contrarily to previous studies made with Monte Carlo methods. We extend the study to binary mixtures of spheres and spherocylinders that have different volumes. We link these observations to the tendency of rods to orient vertically and interpret both phenomena through an extension of the void-filling mechanism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{in a column}} of wet disks {{subjected}} to tapping is studied through a simple model that simulates, through a pseudo-dynamics algorithm, {{the formation of the}} packing and the successive tapping of it. The particles consist in a binary mixture of disks with two different sizes and the capillary forces are simulated stochastically by a sticking probability between the particles. We have recently shown that arch formation is one of the chief mechanisms determining size segregation in a non-convecting ensemble of dry disks (R. O. U˜nac et al., Eur. Phys. J. E 37, 117 (2014)). In the present paper, we focus on the special role that capillary bridges can have on this type of segregation process, besides the proven effect of the presence of arches. We find that humidity between grains can enhance the segregation process in a binary mixture. In particular, for the case of the segregation of an intruder, humidity can promote the rise of the big particle even in cases where the number or the size of the arches would not normally favor the climb...|$|E
40|$|We {{review a}} few {{representative}} examples of granular experiments or models where phase separation, accompanied by domain coarsening, is a relevant phenomenon. We first elucidate the intrinsic non-equilibrium, or athermal, nature of granular media. Thereafter, dilute systems, the so-called "granular gases" are discussed: idealized kinetic models, {{such as the}} gas of inelastic hard spheres in the cooling regime, are the optimal playground to study the slow growth of correlated structures, e. g. shear patterns, vortices and clusters. In fluidized experiments, liquid-gas or solid-gas separations have been observed. In the case of monolayers of particles, phase coexistence and coarsening appear in several different setups, with mechanical or electrostatic energy input. Phenomenological models describe, even quantitatively, several experimental measures, both for the coarsening dynamics and for the dynamic transition between different granular phases. The origin of the underlying bistability is in general related to negative compressibility from granular hydrodynamics computations, even if {{the understanding of the}} mechanism is far from complete. A relevant problem, with important industrial applications, is related to the demixing or <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixtures,</b> for instance in rotating tumblers or on horizontally vibrated plates. Finally, the problem of compaction of highly dense granular materials, which has many important applications, is usually described in terms of coarsening dynamics: there, bubbles of mis-aligned grains evaporate, allowing the coalescence of optimally arranged islands and a progressive reduction of total occupied volume.

Four different particle size ratios (Dl/Ds) are varied.

40|$|The {{presence}} of liquids can significantly affect {{the dynamics of}} granular flow. This paper investigates the effect of liquids on radial <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> granular <b>mixture</b> in a rotating drum using the discrete element method. The wet granular mixture, {{due to differences in}} particle size and density, segregates in a similar way to that of dry particles: lighter/larger particles move to the periphery of the bed while heavier/smaller particles stay in the centre. An index based on the variance of local concentration of one type of particles was proposed to measure the degree <b>of</b> <b>segregation.</b> While the liquid induced capillary force slows down the segregation process, its effect on the final state is more complicated: small cohesion shows no or even positive effect on segregation while high cohesion significantly reduces particle segregation. The effect {{can be explained by the}} change of flow regimes and the competing effects <b>of</b> mixing and <b>segregation</b> (un-mixing) in particle flow which are both reduced by the interparticle cohesion.

When one or both bead types bounce up and down in synchronization, the effective repulsive force between the two types of beads is likely to be larger than that found within a single bead type, resulting in the mixture segregating.

Two different systems were investigated: fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon surfactant mixtures and lipid-surfactant mixtures. In fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon surfactant mixtures the repulsive interactions between the chains can lead to a demixing into different types of coexisting micelles, fluorocarbon rich and hydrocarbon rich. From NMR self-diffusion measurements such a demixing was found to occur in the <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> the partially fluorinated surfactant HFDePC and C 16 TAC. We furthermore suggested a demixing also within the micelles to explain 19 F-NMR line width data and results from neutron scattering. In lipid-surfactant <b>mixtures,</b> a <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> the molecules may instead be caused by a difference in the preferred curvature of the lipid and the surfactant residing within the same aggregate.

Perforated vesicles were observed by cryo-TEM in the mixture with C 16 TAC. To explain the results from the binding isoterms, the formation of pores in the bilayer was regarded as a cooperative process, similar to micelle formation. The surfactant accumulates {{at the edges of the}} pores, and increasing the surfactant concentration results in an increased number of pores with a constant surfactant/lipid ratio at the edges.
