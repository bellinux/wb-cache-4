In this article, we report a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -based model to capture key transport processes in rotary cement kilns. Separate but coupled computational models were developed for the bed <b>and</b> the <b>freeboard</b> regions of the rotary kiln. The complex swirling airflow produced by kiln burners, coal combustion, gas-phase combustion of volatile matter and radiative heat transfer in the freeboard region were modeled. The clinkerization reactions in the bed region were modeled assuming solids as pseudo fluids. Coating formation in cement kilns (for both bed <b>and</b> <b>freeboard</b> regions) was considered. Appropriate source and sink terms were developed to model transfer of CO(2) from the bed to the freeboard region due to calcination reaction in the bed region. The developed bed <b>and</b> <b>freeboard</b> models were coupled by mass and energy communication through common interface. These coupled computational models were able to quite satisfactorily predict the available data from industrial kilns and previously published results. The computational models were also able to capture {{the intricacies of the}} burning zones of rotary cement kilns for changing burner-operational parameters like axial to swirl ratio and oxygen enrichment. The developed approach, computational models and simulation results will not only help in developing better understanding of cement kilns but also provide quantitative information about influence of burner design and other design parameters on kiln performance.

40|$|Stability is one {{of safety}} {{parameters}} of ships in seaways {{as required by the}} International Maritime Organization (IMO) or national ship classification in order to get safety certificates. Therefore characteristics the ship stability should be initially controlled in design stage. In order to easily investigate the ship stability in design process, it is necessary to investigate relationship between the ship geometry <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> characteristics. This paper discuss effect of several geometry characteristics of ship, such as breadth and draft ratio as well as <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> breadth ratio. These geometries ratio are varied in a certain range and calculate righting arm of the ships. The obtained righting arms are evaluated using the IMO intact stability kriteria. Basec on the evaluation results, the minimum breadth and draft ratio as well as the minimum <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> breadth ratio can be obtained as function of vertical center of gravity and height ratio. These results show that the ship stability tends to increase when the breadth and draft ratio increases. The ships with larger draft have better stability than the smaller one for the same breadth and draft ration. The ship stability also increases when the <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> breadth ration increase. In cases of <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> breadth ration less than 0, 06 the difference of stability characteristics are not significant for all ships subject. A significant difference occurs when the ratio of <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> breadth is larger than 0, 10.

40|$|AbstractA {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} bubbling fluidized bed has been developed to simulate {{the performance of the}} fuel reactor (FR) in chemical looping combustion systems. This model considers both the hydrodynamic of the fluidized bed (dense bed <b>and</b> <b>freeboard)</b> <b>and</b> the reduction kinetics of the oxygen carrier (OC). The main outputs of the model are solid conversion and gas composition at the reactor exit, the axial profiles of gas composition, and the fluidynamics structure of the reactor. The FR model was validated using the experimental data obtained from the CH 4 combustion in a 10  kWth prototype built at the “Instituto de Carboquímica” (ICB-CSIC, Spain) using a Cu-based OC. The influence of OC circulation rate, fuel gas load, reactor temperature and OC particle size were analyzed. Combustion efficiency predicted by the model showed a good agreement with experimental results. Once the FR model was validated, important consequences for the design and optimization of the FR in a CLC system were obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{budget of}} Earth's oceanic {{sediment}} masses was discussed {{in terms of}} crustal growth and recycling. Based on estimates of the volume of oceanic sediments and the average age of oceanic crust, a continental denudation rate of 1. 65 cu km/yr was computed. This crudely balances estimated crustal production rates of about 1 cu km/yr, but the efficiency of sediment loss via subduction, for example, must be considered. It was argued, on the basis of earthquake focal solutions, imagery of subduction zones, and plate kinematic reconstructions that little, if any, sediment was lost in this way. This yields a present day crustal growth rate of about 1 cu km/yr. The volume of continents to 1. 5 Ga ago was discussed, assuming constant continental thickness <b>and</b> <b>freeboard,</b> <b>and</b> a constant hydrosphere volume. It was concluded that ocean ridge length was a factor of about 1. 75 greater 1. 5 Ga ago, but a major uncertainty is the average spreading rate in the past...|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 14th century, ships {{like the}} carrack began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers {{decreased}} the vessel's <b>stability,</b> <b>and</b> in the 15th century, the caravel, designed by the Portuguese, based on the Arabic qarib which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the forecastle and sterncastle, as in the carrack Santa María of Christopher Columbus.

40|$|In October 2003 a {{campaign}} {{on board the}} Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis had the objective to validate standard Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) sea-ice products. Additionally, the satellite laser altimeter on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was in operation. To capture the large-scale information on the sea-ice conditions necessary for satellite validation, the measurement strategy was to obtain large-scale sea-ice statistics using extensive sea-ice measurements in a Lagrangian approach. A drifting buoy array, spanning initially 50 km 100 km, was surveyed during the campaign. In situ measurements consisted of 12 transects, 50 500 m, with detailed snow and ice measurements as well as random snow depth sampling of floes within the buoy array using helicopters. In order {{to increase the amount}} of coincident in situ and satellite data an approach has been developed to extrapolate measurements in time and in space. Assuming no change in snow depth <b>and</b> <b>freeboard</b> occurred during the period of the campaign on the floes surveyed, we use buoy ice-drift information as well as daily estimates of thin-ice fraction and rough-ice vs smooth-ice fractions from AMSR-E and QuikSCAT, respectively, to estimate kilometer-scale snow depth <b>and</b> <b>freeboard</b> for other days. The results show that ICESat freeboard estimates have a mean difference of 1. 8 cm when compared with the in situ data and a correlation coefficient of 0. 6. Furthermore, incorporating ICESat roughness information into the AMSR-E snow depth algorithm significantly improves snow depth retrievals. Snow depth retrievals using a combination of AMSR-E and ICESat data agree with in situ data with a mean difference of 2. 3 cm and a correlation coefficient of 0. 84 with a negligible bias...|$|R

The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths.

Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|R

40|$|A crown {{wall is a}} gravity based L- shaped {{concrete}} structure {{on top of a}} rubble mound breakwater. Functions of a crown wall are: reduction of wave overtopping, enable transport on the breakwater and placement of pipelines on top of the flat surface. Marine contractor Van Oord was awarded to extend a breakwater with a crown wall on top, located in Romania. The design, already made by a local consultant, was reviewed by Van Oord, which led {{to the conclusion that the}} crown wall would be blown of the breakwater for that particular design in combination with the design wave conditions. Subsequently, physical scaled model tests were executed by Artelia in Grenoble, but, against all expectations the crown wall appeared to remain stable. Based on the contradiction between <b>stability</b> calculations <b>and</b> the outcome of the scaled model tests, the hypothesis arose that currently used wave load calculation methods lead to designs that seem to be conservative especially when freeboard, the vertical distance between the still water level and the base of the crown wall, increases. An experimental research is carried out in which the effect of freeboard is examined by varying water levels and wave conditions while geometrical properties of the structure remain constant. Tests are divided in three main subjects: pressure measurements, uplift <b>stability</b> <b>and</b> overall <b>stability.</b> Based on pressure measurements it is concluded that the mostly used design method PEDERSEN [1996] and its extended version of NØRGAARD et al. [2013], assume an upward pressure distribution which is too conservative in shape and distance over which pressure is exerted against the base of the crown wall. These methods assume a linear pressure distribution whereas this seems to be conservative based on test results since S-shaped and parabolic upward pressure distributions are found. Furthermore, it is assumed that upward pressure acts over the full length of the base whatever wave conditions <b>and</b> <b>freeboard</b> are. However, a relation is found which indicates that the effective length of the upward pressure actually depends on wave height <b>and</b> <b>freeboard.</b> Comparing the predicted vertical loads based on the methods of PEDERSEN [1996] and NØRGAARD et al. [2013] to the found vertical loads derived from uplift stability in this research, lead to substantial overpredictions when freeboard increases. Generated data with respect to critical weights confirms that the conventional methods of PEDERSEN [1996] and NØRGAARD et al. [2013] are too conservative in predicting overall stability with respect to sliding, especially when freeboard increases. However, by implementing the found relations for the effective length, especially NØRGAARD et al. [2013] become more reliable with respect to the found critical weights. Design guidelines are presented. It is advised to use these guidelines for prior design purposes in combination with the adapted method of NØRGAARD et al. [2013] in which a reduction coefficient for vertical loads must be taken into account. Since the range of application for the critical weight predictions is still small it is recommended to extend this range by varying more parameters in further research, which should make these guidelines generally better applicable.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThere is an {{increasing}} demand for energy in the world, and as the traditional fossil fuel supplies are diminishing, it is pushing {{the oil and gas}} industry to seek for natural resources in remote and harsh environments. One of these distant and tough environments is in the Arctic region. Vessel icing from both sea-spray icing and atmospheric icing are common in these waters and can impact the safety of a platform or a ship in different ways. Ice accumulation on vessels contributes to an extra load on the vessel and consequently there will be a change in the <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> <b>stability.</b> A reduction in one or both of these parameters can cause a vessel to capsize and sink. There have been numerous accidents in the past where small fishing vessels have capsized due to heavy icing. Scientists have discussed for years whether or not vessel icing is going to be a problem for larger vessel when considering the change in <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> <b>stability.</b> Four different types of vessels were analysed in order to study the effect the ice has on dissimilar vessels, which are a fishing boat, a platform supply vessel, a drillship and a semi-submersible platform. Further, a case study and a parameter study have been undertaken for these vessels. The case study examines an icing event that could occur in the Barents Sea under a winter storm. The parameter study reveals the exact amount of sea-spray ice needed in order to make the vessels unsafe. The calculated results revealed that icing accumulations had a significant impact on the <b>freeboard,</b> <b>stability</b> <b>and</b> motion response for the vessels. It was also calculated that the smallest ship, the fishing boat, was much more likely to lose its <b>freeboard</b> <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> due to vessel icing. This boat has a length of 23. 10 m, which was three times shorter than the platform supply ship and almost ten times shorter than the drillship. However, the calculated amount of ice needed in order to make the two larger ships and the semi-submersible unsafe was so immense that such a situation is considered as highly unlikely to occur. Further, this work also includes a proposal for further studies that can be done on this subject...|$|R
