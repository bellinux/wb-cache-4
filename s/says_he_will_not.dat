5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is {{a big fan of}} hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
25|$|Georges begins {{employing}} a nurse {{three days a}} week. Their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), wants her mother to go into care, but Georges <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> break the promise he made to his wife. He employs a second nurse, but fires her after he discovers she is mistreating his wife.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to judge him by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (cf. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> use sophistic {{language}} — carefully arranged ornate words and phrases — but will speak using the common idiom of the Greek language. He affirms that he will speak in the manner he is heard using in the agora and at the money tables. Despite his claim of ignorance, Socrates speaks masterfully, correcting the Orators and showing them what they should have done — speak the truth persuasively and with wisdom. Although offered the opportunity to appease the prejudices of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. Accordingly, the jury condemns Socrates to death.|$|E

When Rory as Itchy arrives, the others are dismayed when he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be reading [...] "Frosty the Snowman"; he instead reads the biblical nativity story from the Gospel according to Luke.|$|E
500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) has {{returned}} to Scranton full-time, saying he has realized that he cannot devote himself to both {{his family and his}} new job, and has decided to go [...] "all in" [...] on his family since that is what makes him most happy. David asks Jim his opinion on promoting Dwight, and Jim says that Dwight deserves the job and will be a great manager. Dwight then appoints Jim the new assistant to the regional manager. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) informs Jim that Athlead has found a buyer and wants them to do a promotional tour around the country for three months. With undisguised regret, Jim <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> do the tour because he cannot put his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) through that, unaware that Pam is listening in.|$|E
2500|$|Although DNA tests {{revealed}} Birkhead is the father, final {{custody of the}} baby remains unresolved. [...] "I hate {{to be the one}} to say this but...I told you so," [...] Birkhead told reporters and tourists waiting outside the courthouse in Nassau after a judge ruled behind closed doors that he was the biological father of Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern, who was born on the island September 7. Larry Birkhead announced that he was the father of Dannielynn, Anna Nicole Smith's baby. Stern <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> contest Birkhead for sole custody and wants a smooth transition for the baby.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he would}} only speak to his agents?" [...] said the secretary, [...] "but they <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not,</b> and <b>he</b> has a terrible fellow in ----shire, who I hear {{is one of the}} {{stewards}} for a dinner to Sir Robert." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has so many}} admirers," [...] she remarked, [...] "that I dare <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> notice my {{absence from}} the ranks. Perhaps I am a little prejudiced. At home, you know, we have rather strong {{opinions}} about this fusion of races." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2013 anti-Cyrillic protests started {{against the}} {{introduction}} of bilingual signs with Serbian Cyrillic alphabet in Vukovar. Milanović condemned them as [...] "chauvinist violence", <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> take down signs in Cyrillic in Vukovar as the [...] "rule of law must prevail".|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the exile}} term, Duryodhana refuses to return Yudhishthira's kingdom, despite the counsel of Bhishma, Dronacharya, and Vidura. Although Dhritarashtra criticizes his son, he tacitly desires that Duryodhana retain his throne. In a final attempt at {{securing}} peace, Krishna returns with the Pandavas' final proposal: the Pandavas would give up all claims to Indraprastha and Hastinapur in exchange for five villages. Scoffing, Duryodhana <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> even give [...] "five needlepoints of land" [...] to the Pandavas. Egged on by Krishna, Duryodhana attempts to arrest him. Krishna reveals his Vishvarupa form. The entire Kaurava court, save for Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, and Dhritarashtra(who was granted divine vision in order to see that by supporting his son, he was going against God), is temporarily blinded by the form. This confirms to those present that Krishna is indeed an avatar of Vishnu, implying that God and dharma lies with the Pandavas. Duryodhana, in some versions of the story an outright atheist, brushes off the incident, not convinced of Krishna's divinity, and believing that strength of arms, not philosophy, would win him a war.|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> meet you," [...] dryly exclaimed his friend, {{throwing}} {{himself into}} a chair, and ordering a glass of randy and water.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, and he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> {{let me come}} here, because I {{ought to}} give the Hetherington people ocular {{demonstration}} that I go to church,' said Lord Rotherwood.|$|E
50|$|The couple seeks {{help from}} Dyan Ardais, Elorie’s half brother {{to obtain an}} {{audience}} with Lord Hastur. Hastur admits {{that he should have}} done more to protect Cleindori, and her father, Damon Ridenow, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> make the same mistake with Elorie. He listens to her story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{with any}} {{positive}} commission, perhaps, for none was necessary. Templemore {{is a rich}} fellow, and has no need of appointments; but, it is hoped and understood, that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> look at the provinces, and report their condition to the government, I dare <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be impeached for his negligence, though it may occasion surprise." ...|$|R
25|$|When {{hearing about}} the German {{proposal}} regarding Yakov, Stalin rejects it, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> trade a Field Marshal for a soldier. The Yugoslav partisans break out of an encirclement. The Soviet counter-offensive is launched in Kursk. Erich von Manstein commits all his forces to a final assault, bringing the Soviets close to defeat. Vatutin urges to send in the strategic reserve, which repels the Germans.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{thinking}} of my lover, for he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> have a long engagement, so I must {{begin to think about}} the most important things at once, mustn't I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't tell him--he {{will not}} love me....I {{did not mean}} any disgrace--indeed I did not, so don't tell Harry. We {{were going to be}} married--that was why I ran away....And he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> have a kissed woman....And if you tell him he will go away, and I shall die. I pray have mercy--Oh!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Saw Sir Robert Dundas at Court, who condemns Lord Melville, and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> {{show his}} letter to any one; in fact it would be exactly {{placarding}} me in a private and confidential manner. He is to send my letter to Lord Melville. Colin Mackenzie concurs in thinking Lord Melville quite wrong. [...] "He must cool in the skin he het in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anybody {{would have}} thought so indeed. There will be very {{few people in the}} pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put on his {{greatcoat}} when he goes, but I dare <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not,</b> for <b>he</b> had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder he should dislike it, it must be so comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is yet {{two hours}} to noon," [...] said his wife. [...] "And Barber always keeps you so long! I cannot bear that Barber: I dare <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> advance you money again as you did not bring the job home on Saturday night. If I were you, Philip, I would go and sell the piece {{unfinished}} at once {{to one of the}} cheap shops." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly; but <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> stay long. <b>He</b> {{does not}} like Scroope at all. I knew that. <b>He</b> always <b>says</b> that,--that--" ...|$|R

"You know," [...] said Grace to her brother, [...] "Arthur and I {{are going}} East, to the States, to-morrow, and really, Gabe, he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> leave here until you consent {{to take back}} your house--your wife's house, Gabe. You know WE" [...] (there was a {{tremendous}} significance in this newly-found personal plural), [...] "WE have deeded it all to you." ...|$|E
60|$|The hero raises {{vague and}} feeble {{objections}} to this arrangement now and again. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> hear {{of such a}} thing, that he will stay no longer to be a burden upon these honest folk, but will go forth unto the roadside and there starve. The comic man has awful work with him, but wins at last and persuades the noble fellow to stop on and give the place another trial.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know you}} are all to come early,' said the former, 'I {{do not know how}} we should manage without you. Rotherwood insists on having {{everything}} the same day--poor people first, and gentry and farmers altogether. Mamma does not like it, and I expect we shall be dreadfully tired; but he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> have the honest poor men put out for the fashionables; and you know we are all to dance with everybody. But Jenny, who is this crossing the street? Look, you have an eye for oddities.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This little {{difference}} of opinion," [...] the Prince remarked, looking thoughtfully through the emerald green of his liqueur, [...] "interests me. Our friend Dolinski here thinks that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> come because <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be afraid. De Brouillac, on the contrary, <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> come because <b>he</b> is too sagacious. Felix here, who knows him best, <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> come because <b>he</b> prefers ever {{to play the}} game from outside the circle, a looker-on to all appearance, yet sometimes wielding an unseen force. It is a strong position that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That dear Monk <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> go home till he {{can carry}} home his patient. When {{that will be}} I cannot tell, for he cannot sit up in bed yet. Dear Sydney, how I thank her! John says {{it was not his}} treatment, but, under Divine Providence, {{youthful}} nature that had had her rest, and begun to rally her strength. But under that blessing, it was John's steady, faithful strength and care that enabled the restoration to take place. [...] "My dear child's loving [...] "MOTHER CAREY." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will not come!' shouted Umslopogaas; 'where is the dog who <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> {{come when}} my Father orders? Here, thou' -- {{and with a}} single bound he sprang upon the Wakwafi with whom I had first spoken, and, seizing him by the arm, dragged him towards us. 'Thou dog!' he said, giving the terrified man a shake, 'didst thou say that thou wouldst not go with my Father? Say it once more and I will choke thee' -- and his long fingers closed round his throat {{as he said it}} -- 'thee, and those with thee. Hast thou {{forgotten}} how I served thy brother?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. He {{seemed much}} struck by what I had said, and {{apparently}} understood it. I {{have heard that}} in some species of insanity the patient is perfectly able to comprehend everything addressed to him, though at that point his sanity ceases, and {{he is unable to}} answer or to act. This must be Beckendorff's case; for no sooner had I finished than he rose up immediately, and, saying that I spoke like a man of sense, abruptly quitted the room. The housekeeper <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be at home again till that infernal ceremony takes place called the noon meal. Now, do you not advise me to be off as soon as possible?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Locos (Democrats) {{here are}} in {{considerable}} trouble about Van Buren's letter on Texas, and the Virginia electors. They are growing {{sick of the}} Tariff question; and consequently are much confounded at V.B.'s cutting them off from the new Texas question. Nearly half the leaders swear they won't stand it. Of those are Ford, T. Campbell, Ewing, Calhoun and others. They don't exactly say they won't vote for V.B., but they <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be the candidate, {{and that they are}} for Texas anyhow.|$|R

[...] "Mr. Bathurst may not be perfect in all respects, but he is certainly too much of a gentleman to force his visits where they are not wanted. I do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> come here at all, for not to do so after being here so much would create comment and talk in the station, which would be as painful to you as to him, but <b>he</b> certainly <b>will</b> <b>not</b> come here more often than is necessary to keep up appearances." ...|$|R
