Fister limited the Yankees to one run on five hits and two walks over five innings in the Tigers 3–2 victory, which <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to the American League Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} noted as a joker on the pitch. After the {{replay of the}} Scottish Cup Final against Celtic in 1963 he stuffed the match ball up his shirt and later gave it to a new member of the team. The SFA insisted that the ball should be returned, and Rangers <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> a ball, but {{possibly}} not the match ball.|$|E

5|$|Unprepared for the Allied {{operation}} at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, {{commander of the}} newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.|$|E
5|$|Benedetto Pistrucci {{was born}} in Rome on 24 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (née Greco). His elder brother Filippo {{displayed}} artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci wanted his sons to follow in his footsteps and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys {{were enrolled in the}} Roman College.|$|E

5|$|De Soto then {{determined}} {{to set out}} for Cofitachequi. The people of Ocute explained that the great wilderness separated them, {{and that no one}} alive had ever crossed it due to the war, despite what De Soto's guide had claimed. Nevertheless, the army departed on April 13. A party from Ocute initially joined the Spanish to raid Cofitachequi, but De Soto <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> home upon realizing there was no easy way through the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of the area of operations around Stolac, the situation was significantly calmer than around Nevesinje, although a group of 200 Ustaše at Berkovići were falsely claiming that they were being surrounded by rebels at night. Despite this claim, they had suffered no casualties. Regardless, Prpić <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> ammunition and a platoon of the 18th Battalion. At 19:00 on 26 June, Francetić arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to be briefed on the situation. He resolved that he would travel to Berkovići the following day and take personal command of the Ustaše unit there.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August boats from Alceste put {{the party}} ashore at Ostia, near Rome, where they {{made contact with}} a {{representative}} of the Vatican who agreed to speak to the Pope but failed to return. When it was deemed necessary to travel to Rome to re-establish contact, the priests refused to go. Maxwell <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> back to Palermo in Acorn, which returned a week later with another volunteer of Drummond's. Landed on the night of 19 September, the envoy was captured and shot as a spy the following day. Consequently, the entire plan was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|The design {{department}} found all their locations and designed sets in eight weeks, guided by {{input from the}} filmmakers. Nowak started by creating artwork for all the major sets and locations, working with the two concept artists Tim Flattery and Jim Martin. Nowak created drafts and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to Flattery and Martin who continued to develop them until they were complete. The complete artwork was then presented to Chris Carter, Rob Bowman, Lata Ryan and Sackheim for approval. While considering the time schedule, they made no notable changes to the artwork.|$|E

5|$|The {{terms of}} Buckner's parole in Shreveport, Louisiana, on June 9, 1865, {{prevented}} {{his return to}} Kentucky for three years. He remained in New Orleans, worked {{on the staff of}} the Daily Crescent newspaper, engaged in a business venture, and served on the board of directors of a fire insurance company, of which he became president in 1867. His wife and daughter joined him in the winter months of 1866 and 1867, but he <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> back to Kentucky in the summers because of the frequent outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever.|$|E
5|$|These troops, {{who were}} trained soldiers, were {{responsible}} for preparing the combat reports {{to be used as}} source material for the OKW communiqués. The propaganda companies were only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda for immediate dissemination.|$|E
5|$|With {{government}} abatement and Quisling's personal engagement, Jews {{were registered}} in a German initiative of January 1942.

Over-65s were quickly released by the Norwegian government. Most controversially, the Jews's property was confiscated by the state.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party {{was seen by}} a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, {{and with}} the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. The second time he was informed {{there was only one}} uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E
