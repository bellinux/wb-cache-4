The steady state of the Bingham plane Poiseuille flow is characterized by an unyielded region of 2 y b width and two sheared regions close to the walls with both no-slip and <b>slip</b> <b>conditions</b> at the walls. A linear stability analysis of this flow with <b>slip</b> <b>conditions</b> is proposed in this paper. The <b>slip</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> case leads to flow destabilization compared with the results obtained in the no-slip case. Critical conditions are modified by varying C f, the friction number. For C f 30 the flow is stabilized, i. e. Ra c values increase and finally tend to that of the no-slip case when C f > 1000. Furthermore, for 1 < C f < 10 4, asymmetric modes were obtained. They are due to the <b>slip</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> at the walls...|$|R

Here, the no-slip boundary condition implies that {{the position of the}} contact line does not move, which is not observed in reality. Analysis of a moving contact line with the no <b>slip</b> <b>condition</b> results in infinite stresses that can't be integrated over. The rate of movement of the contact line is believed to be dependent on the angle the contact line makes with the solid boundary, but the mechanism behind this is not yet fully understood.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid past a nonlinearly shrinking permeable sheet. Partial <b>slip</b> <b>condition</b> is considered instead of no <b>slip</b> <b>condition</b> at the boundary.

It is found in this paper that the Cu-water nanofluid is slower than the TiO 2 -water nanofluid for both cases of the stretching/shrinking sheets. However, the temperature of the Cu-water nanofluid is always higher than the temperature of the TiO 2 -water nanofluid.

In particular stress gradients in rolling contact are investigated with a focus on differences in response between full and partial <b>slip</b> <b>conditions.</b> To this end the multiaxial state of stress beneath a wheel–rail contact featuring full or partial slip is quantified using a multiaxial equivalent stress criterion. A comparative study shows that the significant differences in peak interfacial shear stress magnitudes between full and partial <b>slip</b> <b>conditions</b> are significantly reduced when translated to equivalent stress magnitudes. An innovative procedure to quantify the gradient effects by comparing the multiaxial contact stress field to uniaxial conditions is developed and employed.
