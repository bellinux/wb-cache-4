500|$|On July 8, 2007, {{during the}} concert in St. Louis, {{two people in}} the crowd who {{attended}} the show suffered burns after pyrotechnics meant for the stage tumbled into the audience; Knowles visited them in the hospital after the show. During the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] at the Orlando, Florida show on July 24, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs. Her heel got caught in the bottom on her long coat and she tripped down; she quickly picked herself up and carried on with the show. After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World. A spokesperson for the singer said she was not injured during the fall, which she described as a [...] "mere spot on an otherwise sensational, flawless show" [...] adding, [...] "Miss Knowles picked herself right up, without missing a beat, showing to all that she is the best." [...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever I do something like that I always perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they got a really good show in the end." [...] During her performance in Toronto on August 25, while performing [...] "Déjà Vu", Knowles had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer revealed that the speculations weren't true, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the incidents, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect. A tumble down the stairs onstage in Orlando and a subsequent 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth {{was aware}} of the {{political}} ramifications of the story of Richard II: according to a well-known but dubious anecdote, in August 1601 she was reviewing historical documents relating to the reign of Richard II when she supposedly remarked to her archivist William Lambarde, [...] "I am Richard II, know ye not that?" [...] In the same historical report the Queen is said to have complained that the play was performed forty times in [...] "open streets and houses" [...] but there is no extant evidence to corroborate this tale. At any rate, the Chamberlain's Men do not appear to have suffered for their association with the Essex group; but they were commanded to perform it for the Queen on Shrove Tuesday in 1601, the day before Essex's execution. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> had favoured Essex, but, then, so had she, once.|$|E
60|$|Alvina laughed. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> all {{liked him}} for browbeating them, {{and having a}} heart over and above.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Does <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are come?' {{said the}} Canon. 'No? Then, Alwyn, {{let them have}} some tea, and take off their things. I can tell you, the nurses will never let them in just off a journey.' ...|$|R
50|$|A new and {{enhanced}} Ringer escapes Vosch's watchtower, but after spending 40 {{days in the}} wilderness, testing out the 12th system, she returns to Vosch because <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>they</b> have a mutual goal that he will help her with: Kill Evan Walker.|$|R
50|$|Jill {{takes her}} {{evidence}} to the police. She meets Diana who tells {{her that if she}} tells anyone what <b>she</b> <b>knows,</b> <b>they</b> will sue her. Meanwhile, the police look at the evidence and listen to an audio tape Jill took of Nick confessing.|$|R
60|$|Kate's {{heart was}} lighter; though it beat so terribly {{as she said}} those words. She knew that they pleased ONE of the two who were present, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were right.|$|E
6000|$|... "You 'll {{know what}} to do when you see him, better than I can tell you," [...] {{answered}} Polly, readily yielding, for <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> considered her [...] "quite one of the family," [...] as Tom said.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe {{could only}} give a thankful {{grasp of the}} kind hand. The Raymonds were rather despised at home for plain habits, strong {{religious}} opinions, and scanty fortunes, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were Miss Charlecote's great friends and advisers.|$|E
50|$|James J. Braddock is an Irish-American boxer from New Jersey, {{formerly}} a light heavyweight contender, who {{is forced to}} give up boxing after breaking {{his hand in the}} ring. This is both a relief and a burden to his wife, Mae. She cannot bring herself to watch the violence of his chosen profession, yet <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>they</b> will not have enough income without his boxing.|$|R
60|$|Put {{her in a}} room in London {{here with}} any six people {{old enough to be}} her parents, and her parents may be there for {{anything}} <b>she</b> <b>knows.</b> <b>They</b> may be in any house she sees, they may be in any churchyard she passes, she may run against 'em in any street, she may make chance acquaintance of 'em at any time; and never know it.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Westangle {{received}} their ideas with the twittering reticence that deceived {{so many people}} when <b>they</b> supposed <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>they</b> were talking about.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> had not gone, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> awaited her still. But {{she went}} on over the log bridge that their hoofs had churned and drummed, {{she went on}}, knowing things about them. She was aware of their breasts gripped, clenched narrow in a hold that never relaxed, {{she was aware of}} their red {{nostrils}} flaming with long endurance, and of their haunches, so rounded, so massive, pressing, pressing, pressing to burst the grip upon their breasts, pressing for ever till they went mad, running against the walls of time, and never bursting free. Their great haunches were smoothed and darkened with rain. But the darkness and wetness of rain could not put out the hard, urgent, massive fire that was locked within these flanks, never, never.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Lister awkwardly, [...] "I'd {{seen her}} {{look at her}} purse and frown, and as I helped her up the {{locomotive}} steps I pushed a few bills into her hand. I don't think <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were paper money. She was highly-strung and anxious to get off before Shillito came along." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was always}} ready to quarrel with Béla, whose sneering ways she resented, all the more that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were well-deserved. But her last words had {{apparently}} poured oil over the already troubled waters of the young man's wrath, for now his sullen expression vanished, and a light of satisfaction and of pride lit up his ungainly face: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>they</b> were {{welcoming}} her. Their hands, their smiles, their shouts, their affectionate eyes overcame her. She stammered, [...] "Thank you, oh, thank you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Somewhat tremulously, for {{unless the}} fire could be damped {{before it got}} full hold, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>they</b> might expect, the little hostess broke in with-- ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Liz is very {{interested}} in learning. She is very innocent, somewhat naive, but {{with the ability to}} read what is right or wrong. She has a big crush on this guy but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>they</b> can’t be together because of the circumstances, but she still hopes. She’s experiencing a whole lot of new things in her life, so it’s exciting to see how she deals with that." [...] Shiri Appleby, XPOSÉ Magazine, year 2000 ...|$|R
60|$|But Antonia stood {{smiling in}} the doorway. Brilliant and gay she looked, yet resentful, as if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> {{had been talking}} of her. She sat down by Shelton's side, and began asking him about the {{youthful}} foreigner whom he had spoken of; and her eyes made him doubt whether she, too, saw the fun that lay in one human being patronising others.|$|E
60|$|Pure {{men did not}} {{smile at}} her as they might at a pretty girl. They {{looked at her with}} wide, quiet eyes, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> meant to be {{perfectly}} respectful. There was one man looking at her like that when she looked up to pay the conductor. There was a deep sorrowful look in his eyes, and his face, too, was sad.|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth {{coloured}} deep red, and Susan {{cried out}} loudly {{that it was}} a shame in David; then explained {{that it was a}} long long time ago, that Hal and Bessie broke the drawing-room window by playing at ball with little hard apples, and had not 'told, but when questioned had said, [...] "No;" [...] but indeed they had been so sorry then that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> would never do so again.|$|E
60|$|Elfride was sorry--she {{could not}} tell why--that he gave such a {{legitimate}} reason. It was a disappointment that {{he had all the}} time a cool motive, which might be stated to anybody without raising a smile. Had <b>she</b> <b>known</b> <b>they</b> were offered in that spirit, she would certainly have accepted the seductive gift. And the tantalizing feature was that perhaps he suspected her to imagine them offered as a lover's token, which was mortifying enough if they were not.|$|R
50|$|Aunt Martha - Linda's {{maternal}} {{grandmother and}} close friend. Religious and patient, she is saddened {{about the treatment}} of her children and grandchildren by their white masters. She grieves when her loved ones escape to freedom, as <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>they</b> will never meet again. Family to her must be preserved even {{at the cost of}} freedom and happiness. Aunt Martha stands up for herself, speaking to the Flints out of her dignity. She is the only slave whom Dr. Flint respects.|$|R
5000|$|A {{second year}} {{and a friend of}} Sae since childhood. She just wants to be a normal high school girl and gets {{frustrated}} with Sae's obsession with the Magic Club, although she is proficient in magic herself. Nanaka has a crush on Aburatsubo but is afraid to admit her feelings because <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>they</b> won't be returned. She describes her family as [...] "all over the place", and though often embarrassed and aggravated by their antics, she loves them dearly.|$|R
60|$|Alvina {{hurried to}} bed and slept well. And {{the next day the}} same, she was all icy pleasantness. The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were a little bit put out by her. She was a spoke in their wheel, a scotch to their facility. She made them irritable. And that evening--it was Friday--Ciccio did not rise to {{accompany}} her to her house. And <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were relieved that she had gone.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young people}} {{received}} the decision with acclamation, {{and the two}} elder ones vied {{with one another in}} attempts to set her mind at rest by undertaking everything, and promising for themselves and the children perfect regularity and harmony. Sophy, with a bluntness that King Lear would have highly disapproved, said, 'She was glad mamma was going, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> should be all at sixes and sevens. She would do her best, and very bad it would be.' ...|$|E
60|$|Yet now her way was cut off. They were {{blocking}} her back. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> {{had gathered}} {{on a log}} bridge over the sedgy dike, a dark, heavy, powerfully heavy knot. Yet her feet went on and on. They would burst before her. They would burst before her. Her feet went on and on. And tense, and more tense became her nerves and her veins, they ran hot, they ran white hot, they must fuse and she must die.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "that will {{be quite}} enough." [...] <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>they</b> had talked up to {{the moment when he}} could best begin to work, and now left him to himself.|$|R
60|$|London doesn't dub {{such events}} melodrama; {{she does not}} sneer at them or call them unreal. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>they</b> are real: there is nothing stagey or {{artificial}} about them: they have even become commonplace.|$|R
5000|$|Pikulski and Frosik - {{are from}} sixth grade {{and they are}} around 4 years older then the main {{characters}}. They are school gangsters and the main characters are very afraid of them, in some episodes, they are always doing something mischievous to the main characters, such as stealing their property, or hitting them for fun. Suprisingly, the nurse also hates them because <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>they</b> are doing harm to other pupils, she will always help the main characters if Pikulski and Frosik have done wrong to them.|$|R
60|$|But a sunshiny {{day came}} {{full of the}} scent of a {{mezereon}} tree, when bees were tumbling into the yellow crocuses, and she forgot, she felt like somebody else, not herself, a new person, quite glad. But {{she knew it was}} fragile, and she dreaded it. The vicar put pea-flower into the crocuses, for his bees to roll in, and she laughed. Then night came, with brilliant stars that she knew of old, from her girlhood. And they flashed so bright, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were victors.|$|E
60|$|Well, well! {{she was a}} noble little Dot in such things, and it {{must have}} been an obdurate nature that could have {{withstood}} her influence. When she had got poor Caleb and his Bertha away, that they might comfort and console each other, as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> only could, she presently came bouncing back,--the saying is, as fresh as any daisy; I say fresher--to mount guard over that bridling little piece of consequence in the cap and gloves, and prevent the dear old creature from making discoveries.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know if {{my views}} are worth anything, {{and some of}} my friends doubt it, but you shall have them. After all, the matter's rather an {{important}} one. The wife for you is one who would sympathize with your notions even if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were crazy ones, because they were yours, and when they led you into lumber, as such notions generally do, stand beside you smiling to face the world and the devil. There are such women. I've met one or two." ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, {{during the}} latter part of August she {{wondered}} a good deal more about the Natchas than about Dr. Mitchell. But wondering about the Natchas would not help her. She felt, if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> where <b>they</b> were, <b>she</b> would fly to them. But then <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't.|$|R
6000|$|... [But {{he wishes}} {{she had spoken}} more sharply. Even profanation of the fine chair has not roused her. She takes up her knitting, and they all suspect that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> what <b>they</b> have been talking about.] ...|$|R
60|$|And as {{she peered}} into their smooth, humble faces, {{all at once}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> why <b>they</b> had come. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> it even before they put their {{proposals}} into words; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> why the praetorian praefect was so servile, and why my lord Hortensius Martius, despite his obvious weakness, wore an air of triumph.|$|R
