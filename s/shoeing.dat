5|$|Snow figures {{into many}} winter sports {{and forms of}} recreation, {{including}} skiing and sledding. Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snow <b>shoeing,</b> and snowmobiling. The design of the equipment used, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow, as with skis or snowboards and contends with the coefficient of friction of snow to allow sliding, often enhance by ski waxes.|$|E
5|$|To {{look after}} the regiment's horses, {{attached}} to the regimental headquarters, was a veterinary officer, a quartermaster sergeant farrier (also responsible for killing wounded or sick horses), a saddler sergeant, and a saddle-tree maker. Each squadron had two saddlers, one a sergeant, and each troop had a <b>shoeing</b> smith. The regiment had 528 riding horses, seventy-four draught horses, six pack horses, eighteen carts or horse-drawn wagons, and fifteen bicycles.|$|E
5|$|Controversies over <b>shoeing</b> rules, {{concerns}} about soring and the breed industry's {{compliance with the}} Horse Protection Act {{has resulted in the}} development of multiple governing organizations. The breed registry is kept by the TWHBEA which promotes all riding disciplines within the breed, but does not sanction horse shows. The USEF does not currently recognize or sanction any Tennessee Walking Horse shows. In 2013 it also banned the use of action devices and stacks at any time in any class.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and <b>shoeing</b> techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various <b>shoeing</b> techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful <b>shoeing.</b> There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
25|$|Toe-first landing {{is often}} caused by frog and heel overtrimming, long toes, and/or poor <b>shoeing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poor hoof {{shape is}} usually inherited, {{although}} poor <b>shoeing</b> and trimming {{can contribute to}} these shapes.|$|E
25|$|Gait manipulation: Some breeds {{such as the}} Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking Horse, {{and other}} gaited horses are judged on their high-stepping movement. Special <b>shoeing</b> can help enhance their natural movement.|$|E
25|$|Hyllested Church, 10km {{north of}} Ebeltoft, has a rich {{collection}} of frescos painted by the Brarup Master (Brarupmesteren) from Falster between 1500 and 1520. One of them depicts a man <b>shoeing</b> a cat.|$|E
25|$|Quarter cracks are {{vertical}} splits in a hoof wall, {{most commonly}} {{seen on the}} inside of the front hooves or the outside of the hind hooves. They can result from poor <b>shoeing</b> and management practices, natural hoof conformation, or injuries to the leg and hoof.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shoeing,</b> when {{performed}} correctly, causes no pain to the animal. Farriers {{trim the}} insensitive {{part of the}} hoof, {{which is the same}} area into which they drive the nails. This is analogous to a manicure on a human fingernail, only on a much larger scale.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{conformational}} defects {{that contribute to}} bone spavin. Those that cause uneven loading of the hocks, such as sickle hocks and cow hocks, are especially noteworthy. Poor trimming or <b>shoeing</b> can also contribute to bone spavin in any horse, {{no matter what their}} conformation.|$|E
25|$|An annual {{programme}} is offered of demonstrations of country skills, workshops and ranger-guided walks. Activities are {{spread throughout the}} year, such as the heavy horse show, the tractor show, the horse <b>shoeing</b> competition, the sheepdog trials, Kittochside Fair, Toytrac Scotland, Christmas at the Farm, the Halloween Party, Willow Harvest, etc.|$|E
25|$|Turkey {{production}} in the UK was centered in East Anglia, using two breeds, the Norfolk Black and the Norfolk Bronze (also known as Cambridge Bronze). These would be driven as flocks, after <b>shoeing,</b> down to markets in London from the 17th century onwards - the breeds having arrived in the early 16th century via Spain.|$|E
25|$|The National Cold-Weather Camping Development Center {{is located}} at the Charles L. Sommers Base. The center {{provides}} materials for, and specializes in problems associated with, cold-weather camping for councils and other organizations. In the winter, the Okpik program is offered, with activities such as cross-country skiing, dog sledding, snow <b>shoeing,</b> ice fishing, and shelter building.|$|E
25|$|Proper <b>shoeing</b> is {{critical}} {{in the management of}} a horse with bone spavin. Shoes most helpful for these horses include shoes that assist in breakover (like a square or rolled toe, or shoes with wedge pads). Shoes with heel support may also help horses with bone spavin, such as egg bar shoes.|$|E
25|$|Poor <b>shoeing</b> and conformation, such as long, sloping pasterns, upright pasterns, long-toes {{with low}} heels, pigeon toes, splay foot, or {{unbalanced}} feet may predispose {{the horse to}} ringbone, as they create uneven stress on the pastern and coffin joint, unequal tension on the soft tissues, or worsen the concussion that is absorbed by the pastern area.|$|E

25|$|About {{one-half}} mile east of Fairfax Station, Stuart's staff officers, Major Andrew Reid Venable, Major Henry B. McClellan and Captain John Esten Cooke {{along with}} a courier, were eating breakfast {{at the house of}} a blacksmith who was <b>shoeing</b> their horses. They were disturbed by some of the 11th New York cavalrymen running by on the road. Cooke did not immediately flee because he wanted to have his horses shoed but when a second group from the 11th New York Cavalry approached, Cooke barely escaped.|$|E
25|$|The BAC picked-up its ‘own’ {{resupply}} at a Refilling Point, as set up {{by their}} supporting Division Ammunition Column (DAC), the DAC holding an additional 44 rounds per howitzer. The BAC was divided into two sections, commanded by Lieutenants, each to supply two batteries, of the supported Brigade, and included a Battery Sergeant-Major, a Battery Quartermaster Sergeant, a Farrier-Sergeant, <b>Shoeing</b> Smiths (of which 1 would be a Corporal), 2 Saddlers (maintaining driver equipment), 2 Wheel-Wrights, a Trumpeter, 4 Sergeants, 5 Corporals, 5 Bombardiers, 3 Gunners acting as Batmen, Signallers, Drivers, and Gunners.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1871–1872, the 16-year-old Adolphe left Pierrefonds to travel around France as a Compagnon du Tour de France, an {{organization}} of craftsmen and artisans dating from the Middle Ages. He had saved 30 francs (circa 100 Euros in 2006) by doing multiple jobs for three years. He subsisted in each city by working in forges owned by the Compagnons du Tour de France, <b>shoeing</b> horses, repairing metal and doing any kind of work. He reached Paris in 1872 followed by Orléans and Tours where he encountered 'Truffault cycles'. This led him to acquire 2 wooden cart wheels and build an iron bicycle frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} programme {{offered by the}} Centre is based on three themes of International Friendship, High Adventure and Eco Adventure, designed to help guests learn, develop and have lots of fun. In the summer they offer, within the three themes, a fixed weekly in-camp programme including International Campfire, Pioneering Competition and BBQ, {{as well as a}} wide range of daily activities such as trails, nature workshops, hiking, rock climbing, crafts, mountain biking, paragliding, river rafting and trips to various parts of Switzerland. In the winter, the programme offers a range of alpine snow activities such as downhill or cross country skiing and snowboarding. There are also a variety of other activities in and around Kandersteg, like sledding, curling, ice skating, ice climbing and snow <b>shoeing.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{police and}} other {{security}} forces in Iraq began making similar displays of suspected insurgents and other criminals. Two defendants {{were taken to}} crime scenes to recount their role in a massacre to assembled media, while alleged members of a gang of robbers were posed behind tables stacked with the goods they had supposedly stolen. In one instance that officials later admitted they lost control of, suspected terrorists were led into an auditorium where the acting Minister of the Interior attempted to detail their crimes before not only the media but an audience {{of the family members}} of the victims. He was unable to finish as members of the latter group interrupted him with calls for the defendants' execution and <b>shoeing</b> attempts.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, beach walking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking and hiking. Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow <b>shoeing</b> is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.|$|E
25|$|Shoes {{are then}} {{measured}} {{to the foot}} and bent to the correct shape using a hammer and anvil, and other modifications, such as taps for shoe studs, are added. Farriers may either cold shoe, in which he bends the metal shoe without heating it, or hot shoe, in which he places the metal in a forge before bending it. Hot <b>shoeing</b> can be more time-consuming, and requires the farrier {{to have access to}} a forge; however, it usually provides a better fit, as the mark made on the hoof from the hot shoe can show how even it lies. It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|E
25|$|In Arab culture, {{showing the}} sole of one's shoe is {{considered}} an insult, and to throw a shoe and hit someone with it is considered an even greater insult. Shoes {{are considered to be}} dirty as they frequently touch the ground, and are associated with the lowest part of the body— the foot. As such, shoes are forbidden in mosques, and it is also considered unmannerly to cross the legs and display the soles of one's shoes to someone when talking to them. This insult was demonstrated in Iraq, first when Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in 2003, Iraqis gathered around it and struck the statue with their shoes. Secondly, in 2008, United States President George W. Bush had a shoe thrown at him by a journalist as a statement against the war that was brought to Iraq and the lives that it has cost. More generally, shoe-throwing or <b>shoeing,</b> showing {{the sole of}} one's shoe or using shoes to insult are forms of protest {{in many parts of the}} world. Incidents where shoes were thrown at political figures have taken place in Australia, India, Ireland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and most notably the Arab world.|$|E
500|$|Soring can be also {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers evaded detection from inspectors by training horses not {{to react to}} the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching after the sored area is touched. The practice is called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Others use topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine and benzocaine, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure <b>shoeing</b> is also used. This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or sharp object such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads. [...] It can also be done by trimming down the horse's hoof to its sensitive structures, then <b>shoeing.</b> Either method causes pain when the horse places its foot on the ground.|$|E
500|$|Heck {{horses are}} dun or grullo (a dun variant) in color, with no white markings. The breed has {{primitive}} markings, including a dorsal stripe and horizontal striping on the legs. Heck horses generally stand between [...] tall. [...] The head is large, the withers low, and {{the legs and}} hindquarters strong. The hooves are strong, often not needing <b>shoeing.</b> [...] The gait of the Heck horse is high stepping, which makes them comfortable to ride and which is considered attractive while being driven. The breed is described as being calm, friendly, curious and intelligent, although very independent. The physical description of tarpans was very similar - strong, approximately the same height, and with the same coloration and primitive markings.|$|E
500|$|Lordosis, {{also known}} as swayback, low back or soft back, {{has been found to}} have a {{hereditary}} basis in Saddlebreds and a recessive mode of inheritance. The precise mutation has not yet been located, but researchers believe it to be somewhere on horse chromosome 20. Researching this condition may help more than just the Saddlebred breed as it may [...] "serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species." [...] Due to the head position common in the show ring, Saddlebreds can have impairments to the upper respiratory system, while the <b>shoeing</b> and movement required of the horses can cause leg and hoof injuries and increased lameness. [...] A swayback is penalized as a fault at shows, in addition to other conformation flaws.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding enjoyed a revival in France, while {{the consumption of}} horse meat dropped. In 1991, the Agricultural College in Semur-en-Auxois began the production of horse milk using Auxois mares in Bierre-lès-Semur. In 1994, the French Official Journal published a decree restoring the name of [...] "draft horse" [...] from the almost 20-year use of [...] "heavy horse". In 1996, another decree prohibited the docking of tails of all French horses. French farmers moved towards the production of animals for recreation or agricultural uses, and the National Stud began supporting this aim. In July 1998, a promotional center for the Auxois opened in Bierre-les-Semur, through regional and departmental grants and using the National Stud to promote the breed. It focuses mainly on the training of young horses for riding and driving, and showcases various performances, {{as well as providing}} <b>shoeing</b> services and birthing assistance. In 1999, a study was undertaken of Auxois breeders, which showed opposition to changes in the breed. The author recommended expanding the breed standard to open new markets and save the Auxois from extinction.|$|E
500|$|Soring {{began in}} the 1950s with gaited horse {{trainers}} who were looking to improve their chances of winning at horse shows. To do this, they developed methods to enhance the desired high action gaits to levels greater than that produced by traditional training methods. Thus began the use of irritants, including chemicals and physical objects, or abusive <b>shoeing</b> and hoof-trimming practices on the front legs. Attempting to relieve the pain in its legs, a sored horse lifts its front {{feet off the ground}} more quickly, creating a flashier gait. By the 1960s, soring had gained popularity, as horses so treated gained an edge in competition. However, public opposition to the practice also grew, and in 1966, the American Horse Protection Association was created in part {{to address the issue of}} soring. In 1969, Senator Joseph Tydings sponsored legislation to prohibit soring, leading to the passing of the Horse Protection Act in 1970, amended in 1976. While Tennessee Walking Horses, Racking Horses and other [...] "high-stepping breeds" [...] are generally targeted by these abusive practices, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|E
500|$|Vaqueros {{were the}} {{horsemen}} and cattle herders of Spanish Mexico, who {{first came to}} California with the Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino in 1687, with two expeditions in 1769, and the Juan de Anza expedition in 1774. They were the first cowboys in the region. She learned horse training methods that derived from this tradition. In her teens, she was mentored in horsemanship by Morgan horse breeder and cattle rancher Mary [...] "Sid" [...] Spencer. The Spencer property, called Forsyth Ranch, was near Arroyo Grande on land that is now under Lopez Lake. Spencer helped Varian learn the underlying principles of training and riding horses, how to work cattle in the mountains, and introduced her to vaquero training methods. Spencer also did all of her own ranch work including <b>shoeing,</b> gelding, horse training, baling hay, and truck repairs. She learned how to handle well-trained horses by riding one of the Spencer family's finished Morgans, a gelding named Little Horse. With Spencer's help, she also learned to recognize correct conformation and balance in horses.|$|E
500|$|The {{two basic}} {{categories}} of Tennessee Walking Horse show competition are called [...] "flat-shod" [...] and [...] "performance". Flat-shod horses compete {{in many different}} disciplines under both western and English tack. At shows where both divisions are offered, the flat-shod [...] "plantation pleasure" [...] division is judged on brilliance and show presence of the horses while still being well mannered, balanced, and manageable. [...] "Park pleasure" [...] is the most animated of the flat-shod divisions. Flat-shod horses are shown in ordinary horseshoes, and {{are not allowed to}} use pads or action devices, though their hooves are sometimes trimmed to a slightly lower angle with more natural toe than seen on stock horse breeds. Performance horses, sometimes called [...] "padded" [...] or [...] "built up", exhibit flashy and animated gaits, lifting their forelegs high off the ground with each step. This exaggerated action is sometimes called the [...] "Big Lick". [...] The customary style for rider attire and tack is saddle seat. [...] Horses are shod in double and triple-nailed pads, which are sometimes called [...] "stacks". This form of <b>shoeing</b> is prohibited at shows governed by the National Walking Horse Association (NWHA), and the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF).|$|E
500|$|On April 14, 1894, {{a public}} Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, {{on the corner}} of 27th Street—the first {{commercial}} motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill. The machines were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison's former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the Black Maria, were descriptively titled: Barber Shop, Bertoldi (mouth support) (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), Bertoldi (table contortion), Blacksmiths, Roosters (some manner of cock fight), Highland Dance, Horse <b>Shoeing,</b> Sandow (Eugen Sandow, a German strongman managed by Florenz Ziegfeld), Trapeze, and Wrestling. As historian Charles Musser describes, a [...] "profound transformation of American life and performance culture" [...] had begun.|$|E
500|$|Soring can be {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers trick inspectors by training horses not {{to react to the}} pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching when the sored area is touched. The practice is sometimes called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Some trainers use topical anesthetics, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Pressure <b>shoeing</b> is also used, eliminating use of chemicals altogether. Trainers who sore their horses have been observed leaving the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspection teams are present. Although illegal under federal law for over 40 years, soring is still practiced and criminal charges have been filed against people who violate the Act. Enforcement of the HPA is difficult, due to limited inspection budgets and problems with lax enforcement by inspectors who are hired by the shows they were to police. As a result, while in 1999 there were eight certified HIOs, by 2010, only three organizations remained certified as HIOs, all known to be actively working to end soring.|$|E
500|$|There are two breed {{registries}} for the Spotted Saddle Horse. In 1979, the National Spotted Saddle Horse Association (NSSHA) {{was organized}} in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The association focuses on promoting naturally-gaited saddle horses with pinto coloration. The NSSHA is adamant about disallowing cruel and inhumane training and showing practices, including soring, sometimes seen in {{other elements of}} the Spotted Saddle Horse industry, and prohibited by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA). The NSSHA also bans the use of action devices (such as chains or other weights around the pasterns) and performance packages (stacks of pads attached to the shoe, sometimes weighted or used to conceal abusive <b>shoeing</b> practices) in their shows, which goes beyond the protection afforded by the HPA. In 1985, the Spotted Saddle Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association (SSHBEA) was formed, headquartered in Shelbyville, Tennessee. The SSHBEA is recognized as a [...] "Horse Industry Organization" [...] (HIO) under the HPA, and occasionally sees violations of the HPA at their shows. Violations of the HPA are addressed in the SSHBEA rulebook, and violations can result in disqualifications from individual shows or extended suspensions from Spotted Saddle Horse showing. Today, the Spotted Saddle Horse is seen at horse shows, as well as being used for pleasure and trail riding.|$|E
