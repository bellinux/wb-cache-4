5|$|Although most {{of their}} lives were <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the {{indigenous}} sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in {{the fact that she had}} never had to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E

5|$|Biographers {{and critics}} agree that Louis Lambert is a thinly veiled {{version of the}} author, {{evidenced}} by numerous similarities between them. As {{a student at the}} Collège de Vendôme, Balzac was friends with a boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant. Like the title character, Balzac's faith was shaken {{at the time of his}} first communion. Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep pigeons and tend gardens, and holidays were <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dormitories.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he was 6 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died, while his father and brother were {{continuously}} active in the Roman military, commanding armies in Germania and Judaea.

During the Jewish-Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as city prefect of Rome; or possibly even Marcus Cocceius Nerva, a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.|$|E

Many students left, and this affected the team (which had a 5–10–1 record). After that season, Warner left Carlisle to become head coach at Pittsburgh.|$|E

5|$|Joel (Troy Baker) is {{the protagonist}} of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps {{outbreak}} occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever {{he had to do}} to survive. In the time <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable of taking on and defeating much younger men in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E

During his years in Acre and Bahjí, since `Abdu'l-Bahá, his eldest son, had taken care of the organizational work, Bahá'u'lláh was able to devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, his book of laws. His other works included letters outlining his vision for a united world, as well as the need for ethical action; he also composed many prayers.|$|E

This attack was in an estimated two-company strength supported by a few tanks. The 27th Infantry broke up the attack and two more North Korean tanks were destroyed by the supporting artillery fire.

5|$|While at this {{training}} unit, Graf {{was promoted to}} Leutnant (equivalent to second lieutenant) on 1 May 1940. At Merseburg, Graf met and befriended two other pilot trainees, Alfred Grislawski and Heinrich Füllgrabe, with whom he would later spend much of his combat career. Their time <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unit meant they missed the air combat of the Battle of France and Battle of Britain. On 6 October 1940, Handrick was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of III./Jagdgeschwader 52 (III./JG52). Handrick had some influence on the personnel rotation within his Gruppe and had Graf and Füllgrabe transferred to 9./JG52 with him, where they rejoined Grislawski.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 3 is {{a racing}} game that retains {{the same basic}} {{elements}} of its predecessors, and introduces players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League. Set in 2116, Players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits (plus four hidden prototype tracks). Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane that is set apart from the main course. The less time <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pit lane, the less the shield will regenerate.|$|E
