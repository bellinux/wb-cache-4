5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E

25|$|Cruisers {{were popular}} {{throughout}} the 1930s and 40s and gained greater postwar success. Their combination of substantial weight (some models weighing over 50 pounds), <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> mechanicals, and wide tires made the bicycles primarily suited to flat terrain. They were popular with paperboys and bicycle couriers.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to chaindrive {{is to use}} a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain - popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> or with a hub gear.|$|E
25|$|Between 29 June and 3 July 2015, {{brothers}} Tyron and Aaron Bicknell {{recorded the}} fastest known {{crossing of the}} Nullarbor Plain on <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> bicycles.

25|$|In 1978 the US Department of Energy hired Ricardo Consulting to {{research}} the Stirling engine as a car engine. A series of engines, eventually forty-five in total, were built to test this system and showed very low emissions, but the efficiency was compromised {{by the need to}} operate under transient conditions—the design was best running at a <b>single</b> <b>speed,</b> making it less feasible as a car engine.|$|E
25|$|At {{an extreme}} {{opposite}} from a <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> bicycle, hub gears {{can be combined}} with both front and rear derailleurs, giving a very wide-ranging drivetrain {{at the expense of}} weight and complexity of operation- there are a total of three sets of gears. This approach may be suitable for recumbent trikes, where very low gears can be used without balance issues, and the aerodynamic position allows higher gears than normal.|$|E
25|$|In the {{jet engine}} application, the {{compressor}} faces {{a wide variety}} of operating conditions. On the ground at takeoff the inlet pressure is high, inlet speed zero, and the compressor spun at a variety of speeds as the power is applied. Once in flight the inlet pressure drops, but the inlet speed increases (due to the forward motion of the aircraft) to recover some of this pressure, and the compressor tends to run at a <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> for long periods of time.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of gear change mechanisms, known as derailleurs and hub gears. Both systems have {{advantages}} and disadvantages, and which is preferable depends on the particular circumstances. There are a few other relatively uncommon types of gear change mechanism which are briefly mentioned {{near the end of}} this section. Derailleur mechanisms can only be used with chain drive transmissions, so bicycles with belt drive or shaft drive transmissions must either be <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> or use hub gears.|$|E
25|$|One {{conversion}} first flown 25 November 1939. Streamlined XP-39 {{based on}} NACA wind tunnel testing resulting in revised canopy and wheel door shape, oil and radiator intakes moved from right fuselage to wing roots, fuselage increased length (by 1ft 1in, to 29ft 9in) and decreased wingspan (by 1ft 10in, to 34ft). The turbosupercharger was removed, and the single-stage, <b>single</b> <b>speed,</b> supercharged Allison V-1710-37 (E5) engine (1,090hp/813kW) {{was left in}} place. The carburetor air intake was moved behind canopy, just above the carburetor.|$|E
25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, <b>single</b> <b>speed,</b> pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E
