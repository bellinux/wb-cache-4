5|$|Sewerage. Sewage {{collection}} {{systems do}} not have sufficient hydraulic capacity to handle wastewater flows, especially in poor neighborhoods, which results in combined sewer overflows and <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
50|$|Simplified <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewers</b> {{consist of}} small-diameter pipes (typically 100 mm or about 4 inches), often laid at fairly flat {{gradients}} (1 in 200). The investment cost for simplified <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewers</b> can be {{about half the}} cost of conventional sewers. However, the requirements for operation and maintenance are usually higher. Simplified sewers are most common in Brazil and are also used {{in a number of other}} developing countries.|$|R
50|$|Food waste {{coming through}} the <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewers</b> from garbage {{disposal}} units is treated along with other sewage and contributes to sludge.|$|R
50|$|Sewage may {{be treated}} to control water {{pollution}} before discharge to surface waters. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>sewers</b> serving industrial areas also carry industrial wastewater.|$|R
5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow.|$|E
5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E

25|$|In some urban areas, {{municipal}} wastewater {{is carried}} separately in <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewers</b> and runoff from streets is carried in storm drains. Access {{to either of}} these systems is typically through a manhole.|$|R
50|$|There are {{approximately}} 1600 storm sewers that drain rainwater to creeks in rivers in the city. Accidental runoff from <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewers</b> {{have led to}} severe pollution {{in a number of}} water ways.|$|R
25|$|The village {{received}} a state grant of $400,000 in 2001 {{to connect to}} the Good Hope water supply system and to build a water tower. While Sciota has a water supply system, {{it does not have}} a <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> system; residents rely on septic systems for sewage disposal.|$|E
25|$|Typically, elaborate, {{capital-intensive}} {{storm sewer}} networks are engineered {{to deal with}} stormwater. In some cities, such as the Victorian era London sewers or much of the old City of Toronto, the storm water system is combined with the <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant {{at the end of}} the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs {{have also}} been commercially {{produced}} in Sweden since the mid-1990s. For example, between 1994 and 2010 the Separett company sold approximately 200,000 UDDTs. Numerous off-the shelf commercial products are now available and are used in locations where a connection to a <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> system is not possible, permitted or desired such as in remote summer cottages or for camping activities. At all times, users {{have also been}} building their own low-cost UDDTs with simple materials such as a funnel connected to a hose, a bucket and a seat.|$|E
50|$|Dry weather {{blockage}} is {{less likely}} within combined sewers; because combined sewers designed for the additional volume of surface runoff are much larger than <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewers.</b> Combined sewer storm water regulators may be vulnerable to blockage by debris, but overflow from such blockage typically enters the diversion outfall to avoid flooding private or public property.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1981, the {{community}} suffered from grave water contamination {{and public health}} problems. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>sewers</b> for the entire area were installed in 1981-82 due to federal grants secured by then Monterey County Supervisor Marc Del Piero.|$|R
25|$|The main {{public health}} hazard was the {{polluted}} water, {{mixed with the}} outflow of overwhelmed <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> systems, petroleum products {{and a variety of}} other toxic materials, to include asbestos. As the waters recede, tremendous amounts of potentially infectious debris added to the problem; this included uncollected garbage and dead animals. This issue was exacerbated by the onset of the hot and humid summer weather. Just making the affected areas sanitary again was a huge undertaking. The problem of mold propagating in flooded buildings was one of major concern.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson County Environmental Services {{serves the}} Birmingham metro area with <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> service. Sewer rates have {{increased}} in recent years after citizens concerned with pollution in area waterways filed a lawsuit {{that resulted in a}} federal consent decree to repair an aging sewer system. Because the estimated cost of the consent decree was approximately three times more than the original estimate, many blame the increased rates on corruption of several Jefferson County officials. The sewer construction and bond-swap agreements continue to be a controversial topic in the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} sanitation {{technology in}} urban areas is the collection of wastewater in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in wastewater treatment plants for reuse or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with storm drains or separated from them as sanitary sewers. Combined sewers are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy rainfall and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows, i.e., more or less diluted raw sewage being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.|$|E

50|$|Not all streets have gutters, {{and they}} are most often found in areas of a city which have high {{pedestrian}} traffic. In past centuries when urban streets did not have <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewers,</b> gutters were made deep enough to serve that purpose as well.|$|R
25|$|Significant {{barriers}} to more universal acceptance {{of this technology}} differ in their extent for {{different parts of the}} world but generally include: lack of awareness, a limited supply of prefabricated UDDT components and a lack of interest in financing any sanitation services for the non-sewered portions of urban settlements. Existing, affordable piped water supply and <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> infrastructure may also be an impediment to widespread adoption of UDDTs as their existence not only removes two of the main drivers for UDDTs but also represents a significant public investment. This can restrict efforts to switch to new toilet types and sanitation systems.|$|E
25|$|Average {{non-revenue water}} was 7.3% in 2007, varying {{from less than}} 5% up to 15%. The low level of water leakage, down from 18% in 1978, has been {{achieved}} through speedy repairs that are typically undertaken {{the same day that}} a connection is reported, and through the use of high-quality pipe materials. The government's target is to reduce losses to 2% for large utilities and 5% for small utilities. Japan is perhaps the only country in the world that also collects nationwide data on unaccounted for sewage, i.e. the amount of water that erroneously enters the <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> system e.g. through connections from stormwater sewers or groundwater leakage. The average unaccounted for sewerage is 12%, varying from 6% in Shiga to 30% in Sapporo.|$|E
25|$|Sewage {{may include}} {{stormwater}} runoff or urban runoff. Sewerage systems {{capable of handling}} storm water are known as combined sewer systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary sewers. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, {{and they are not}} designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive infiltration/inflow (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a <b>sanitary</b> <b>sewer</b> system. Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.|$|E
