40|$|High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) Inner Tracker designs {{may include}} {{the sharing of}} Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) signals between several tracker modules. This is {{possible}} because the highest frequency signals are common to all modules. Such designs are an attractive option because they {{reduce the number of}} optical links required and hence the cost. These designs will require optical signal <b>splitters</b> that are radiation hard up to high doses and capable of operating in cold temperatures. Optical <b>splitters</b> are available as either fused-fibre <b>splitters</b> or Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) <b>splitters.</b> PLC <b>splitters</b> are preferable because they are smaller than fusedfibre <b>splitters.</b> A selection of PLC <b>splitters</b> from different manufacturers and of two different technologies (silica and glass based) have been tested for radiation hardness up to a dose of 500 kGy(Si) and for temperature stability. All the tested <b>splitters</b> displayed small increases in insertion losses (< 0. 1 dB) in reducing the operating temperature from 25 °C to ? 25 °C. The silica based <b>splitters</b> from all manufacturers did not exhibit significant radiation induced insertion losses, despite the high dose they were exposed to. The glass based sample, however, had a per channel radiation induced insertion loss of up to 1. 16 dB. Whilst the silica based <b>splitters</b> can be considered as qualified for HL-LHC use with regards to radiation hardness, the glass technology would require further testing at a lower, more realistic, dose to also be considered as a potential component for HL-LHC upgrade designs. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen {{multicasting}} in optical networks {{is implemented}} within the switching control plane, it combines {{the efficiency of}} multicast tree along with high speed and low delay of optical communications.

A good placement of optical <b>splitters</b> can increase the efficiency of the multicast signaling and routing techniques on one hand, and reduce the number of those <b>splitters</b> on the other hand. This leads to faster multicast trees setting up, lower data transmission delays, and less traffic on the network links; thus saving of optical links capacity for other multicast and unicast transmissions. In order to achieve efficient multicasting in optical network, we propose to take into account network characteristics (link capacity and node degree) when placing the optical <b>splitters.</b> The benefits of the smart placement of light <b>splitters</b> will be clearly shown in heterogeneous optical networks, where multicast traffic is not uniformly distributed over the network, and optical links connecting different nodes in the network have different characteristics...|$|R

5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam <b>splitter</b> or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam <b>splitter</b> or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

30|$|The {{first stage}} of domain decomposition, as {{described}} in Section  4, involves a series of histogramming steps to determine a set of <b>splitters</b> that partition the simulation domain into tree pieces of roughly uniform particle count. This is implemented in terms of broadcasts from a single sorter object, which refines the <b>splitters,</b> to the tree pieces, and reductions of particle counts for each bin back to the sorter process. In strong scaling scenarios for highly clustered datasets, domain decomposition may become a performance bottleneck, {{as the number of}} <b>splitters</b> generally depends on the number of processors used in the run. Therefore, we implemented a number of optimizations aimed at improving the SFC domain decomposition performance. First, we replaced the broadcast of SFC keys from the sorter object with the broadcast of a bit vector indicating which of the bins evaluated in the previous step need further refinement. From the bit vector, the set of <b>splitters</b> to evaluate is determined once at each SMP node, and delivered to all tree pieces at that node for evaluation. This optimization greatly reduced the size of the buffers being broadcast. Secondly, we noticed that some histogramming steps were much more expensive than others, due to involving more <b>splitters.</b> This was particularly true for the first and last steps. The first histogramming step involved a full set of <b>splitters</b> due to none having been finalized yet. For this step, we were able to remove the broadcast of <b>splitters</b> by having tree pieces reuse the <b>splitters</b> determined the last time domain decomposition was done. We were also able to eliminate the last histogramming step in the original algorithm, in which the final set of <b>splitters</b> was broadcast to the tree pieces to collect a full histogram of particle counts. Instead, we modified the sorter object to preserve particle counts for all previously finalized <b>splitters,</b> so as to have the full set of counts at the end.|$|R

40|$|Partitioning is an {{important}} step in several database algorithms, including sorting, aggregation, and joins. Partitioning is also fundamental for dividing work into equal-sized (or balanced) parallel subtasks. In this paper, we aim to find, materialize and maintain a set of partitioning elements (<b>splitters)</b> for a data set. Unlike traditional partitioning elements, our <b>splitters</b> define both inequality and equality partitions, which allows us to bound the size of the inequality partitions. We provide an algorithm for determining an optimal set of <b>splitters</b> from a sorted data set and show that it has time complexity O(k lg 2 N), where k is the number of <b>splitters</b> requested and N is the size of the data set. We show how the algorithm can be extended to pairs of tables, so that joins can be partitioned into work units that have balanced cost.

5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam <b>splitter</b> allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam <b>splitter</b> or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace.
