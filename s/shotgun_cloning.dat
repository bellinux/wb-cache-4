The genome {{is composed of}} one chromosome and one megaplasmid and contains genes for plant-microbe inter-actions and the gene clusters for aromatic-compound degradations. Adenitrifying bacterium, Azoarcus sp. strain KH 32 C, was origi-nally isolated from soil of an agricultural field where paddy rice and soybean crops were rotationally cultivated every 2 years (10). KH 32 C can strongly reduce exogenousN 2 O, indicating the potential use of this bacterium to decrease N 2 O emissions from agricultural fields. Some Azoarcus spp. and related bacteria are known as nitrogen-fixing plant endophytes (3), while others are known to de-grade various aromatic compounds (9).

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the late}} {{stages of a}} whole-genome shotgun {{sequencing}} project, most DNA sequences will be assembled into large contiguous blocks, or contigs (Fraser and Fleischmann, 1997). As the project nears completion, the number of contigs grows smaller as the contigs themselves grow larger. Due to nonrandomness in the library and unclonable sequences, some regions of the genome are not represented in the contigs, resulting in gaps. Other gaps result from extremely GC-rich or GC-poor regions and large repeat sequences. Significant effort is needed to close these gaps to finish the project. Constructing the initial <b>shotgun</b> <b>clone</b> library with plasmid vectors allows double-strand sequencing, using universal forward and reverse primers, producing sequence data from both ends of most clones. In some cases, gaps between contigs will be spanned by clones whose forward sequencing read {{is located at the}} extreme end of one contig and whose reverse read ("clone mate") is located at the end o...|$|R

To recover bacterial DNA from complex samples, we devised a method that facilitates the cloning of DNA fragments of distinctive G+C contents in order to generate shotgun DNA libraries enriched in inserts having a specific base composition. DNA preparations are first treated with a restriction enzyme having a common cleavage site in a particular genome and then <b>shotgun</b> <b>cloned</b> following size-fractionation. This method was applied to whole bacteriomes of the psyllid, Pachypsylla venusta, which harbors the bacterial symbiont Candidatus Carsonella ruddii.

40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation {{is an important}} process that allows nitrogen uptake into biological systems. But it is still unclear from where the first nif gene was formed or evolved. Soil samples from different agro-climatic zones of western Indian Himalaya were analysed for the diversity of nifH in their metagenome. Metagenomic DNA was isolated followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and quantification. Soil of Pithoragarh (locality of temperate climatic region) was fur-ther used for shotgun meta-genomic library construction. Clones having similar insert were screened and finally 176 clones were used for colony hybridisation. All the clones were hybridised with two nifH probes, i.  e.

Consequently, methods are being developed for analyzing the phylogenetic affiliations of the constituents of natural microbial populations {{without the need for}} their cultivation. This is more than an exercise in taxonomy, for the extent of phylogenetic relatedness between unknown and known organisms is some measure of the extent of their biochemical commonalities. In one approach, total DNA is isolated from natural microbial populations and 16 S rRNA genes are <b>shotgun</b> <b>cloned</b> for rapid sequence determinations and phylogenetic analyses. A second approach employs oligodeoxynucleotide hybridization probes that bind to phylogenetic group-specific sequences in 16 S rRNA.

A plasmid, pF 130, containing {{part of the}} HindlII-F region of vaccinia virus was used to <b>shotgun</b> <b>clone</b> EcoRI fragments of FPV DNA into TK- vaccinia virus and select for TK ÷ recombinants. The TK ÷ recombinant vaccinia virus contained a 5. 5 kb EcoRI fragment of FPV. This FPV fragment was cloned into pUC 9 and the pr sence of the TK gene in this fragment was confirmed by its ability to rescue TK ÷ vaccinia virus from TK- virus, when inserted into pF 130. A recombinant vaccinia virus containing this FPV fragment induced TK enzyme activity in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The vaccinia virus RNA polymerase appeared able to recognize the FPV promoter sequences ofthe FPV TK gene since the fragment operated in the marker escue, irrespective of its orientation to the vaccinia virus promoter in pF 130. Using restriction enzyme analysis, insertion of subfragments of the 5. 5 kb FPV fragment into pF 130 and marker escue, {{we were able to}} map the position of the TK gene in the 5 - 5 kb EcoRI fragment.

In this study, we employed physical fractionation to characterize the morphological and genomic traits of a subset of uncultivated viruses from a natural marine assemblage. Viruses from Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawai‘i were fractionated by equilibrium buoyant density centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient, and one fraction from the CsCl gradient was then further fractionated by strong anion-exchange chromatography. One of the fractions resulting from this two-dimensional separation appeared to be dominated by only a few virus types based on genome sizes and morphology. Sequences generated from a <b>shotgun</b> <b>clone</b> library of the viruses in this fraction were assembled into significantly more numerous contigs than have been generated with previous metagenomic investigations of whole DNA viral assemblages with comparable sequencing effort. Analysis of the longer contigs (up to 6. 5 kb) assembled from our metagenome allowed us to assess gene arrangement in this subset of marine viruses.

40|$|Phosphotriesterases {{catalyze}} the hydrolytic detoxification of phosphotriester {{pesticides and}} chemical warfare nerve agents with various efficiencies. The directed evolution of phosphotriesterases {{to enhance the}} breakdown of poor substrates is desirable {{for the purposes of}} bioremediation. A limiting factor in the identification of phosphotriesterase mutants with increased activity is the ability to effectively screen large mutant libraries. To this end, we have investigated the possibility of coupling phosphotriesterase activity to cell growth by using methyl paraoxon as the sole phosphorus source. The catabolism of paraoxon to phosphate would occur via the stepwise enzymatic hydrolysis of paraoxon to dimethyl phosphate, methyl phosphate, and then phosphate. The Escherichia coli strain DH 10 B expressing the phosphotriesterase from Agrobacterium radiobacter P 230 (OpdA) is unable to grow when paraoxon is used as the sole phosphorus source. Enterobacter aerogenes is an organism capable of growing when dimethyl phosphate is the sole phosphorus source. The enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing dimethyl phosphate has been previously characterized as a nonspecific phosphohydrolase. We isolated and characterized the genes encoding the phosphohydrolase operon. The operon was identified from a <b>shotgun</b> <b>clone</b> that enabled E. coli to grow when dimethyl phosphate is the sole phosphorus source.

A <b>shotgun</b> <b>clone</b> bank of chimeric plasmids containing restriction enzyme digest fragments of pLZ 64 DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli K- 12. One clone contained the gene coding for beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase on a 7. 9 -kilobase PstI fragment cloned into the vector pBR 322 in E. coli strain chi 1849. The beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase enzyme isolated from E. coli showed no difference from that isolated from L. casei, and specific activity of beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase was stimulated 1. 8 -fold in E. coli by growth in media containing beta-galactosides. A restriction map of the recombinant plasmid was compiled, and with that information, a series of subclones was constructed. From an analysis of the proteins produced by minicells prepared from transformant E. coli cells containing each of the recombinant subclone plasmids, {{it was found that the}} gene for the 56 -kilodalton beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase was transcribed from an L. casei-derived promoter.

This B. subtilis gene is located at 251 degrees adjacent to the gerM gene on the B. subtilis genetic map. It has been named rph because, like its E. coli analog, it encodes a phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease activity, RNase PH, that removes the 3 ' nucleotides from precursor tRNAs.

A systematic search for useful vectors showed that the broad-host-range plasmid pIP 501 could transform S. faecalis at a high frequency (6. 3 X 10 (4) transformants per microgram). By combining a high-copy-number derivative of pIP 501, designated pGB 354, with the Escherichia coli vector pACYC 184, we constructed a new E. coli-S. faecalis shuttle vector (pAM 401) having nine unique restriction sites.

To identify plasmid sequences necessary for invasion, we isolated a series of Tn 5 insertions in pWR 100, the virulence plasmid of Shigella flexneri serotype 5. These insertions demonstrated that three separate EcoRI fragments of pWR 100 were required for invasion of HeLa cells. However, the corresponding native EcoRI fragments, when cloned into pBR 325, did not restore virulence to plasmidless strains. Construction of a lambda-sensitive, plasmidless Shigella recipient enabled us to <b>shotgun</b> <b>clone</b> plasmid DNA directly into S. flexneri by using the cosmid vector pJB 8 and score for expression of invasive functions. In this fashion, we succeeded in isolating six independent recombinants which restored invasion of HeLa cells in plasmidless Shigella recipients. The cloned inserts all contained a common core of ca. 37 kilobases, thus defining a minimum sequence necessary for invasion of HeLa cells. Virulence-associated peptides produced by wild-type S. flexneri were also produced by the recombinants. Expression of these peptides and expression of invasiveness by the clones were regulated by growth temperature, as is expression of these traits in wild-type S. flexneri. A complete invasive phenotype was not expressed by the recombinants in that they failed to produce a positive Sereny test.

A novel Chlorella virus, CVN 1, was isolated from the Inba-numa marsh sample. CVN 1 genomic DNA was partially digested and <b>shotgun</b> <b>cloned</b> into pUC 118 to identify the genomic region responsible for the lytic phenotype on Chlorella sp. NC 64 A.

CL 2 showed a weak homology (19. 8 % amino acid identity) to mannuronate lyase SP 2 from Turbo cornutus. CL 2 in Escherichia coli cells was purified using a nickel chelate column. Lyase activity of purified CL 2 on alginic acid was observed in an enzyme assay. The specific activity of purified CL 2 was 2. 1 U 10 32 Umg 31, the optimum pH for enzymatic activity was 10. 5, and Ca 2 ‡ was required for enzyme activity. This is the first report of a Chlorella virus protein with lyase activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of differential gene expressionbetween cells {{is a frequent}} goal in modern biological research. Here we demonstrate the coupling of representational difference analysis (RDA) of cDNA with microarray analysis of the output for high throughput screening. Two primary Ewing's sarcoma tissue samples with different biological behavior in vivo were compared by RDA: one which was metastatic and progressed rapidly; the other localized and successfully treated. A modified RDA protocol that minimizes the necessary starting material was employed. After a reduced number of subtractive rounds, the output of RDA was <b>shotgun</b> <b>cloned</b> into a plasmid vector. Inserts from individual colonies from the subtracted library were amplified with vector-specific primers and arrayed at high density on glass slides. The arrays were then hybridized with differentially fluorescently labeled starting amplicons from the two tissues and fluorescent signals were measured at each DNA spot. We show that the relative amounts of fluorescent signal correlate well with the abundance of fragments in the RDA amplicon and in the starting mRNA. In our system, we analyzed 192 products and 173 (90 %) were appropriately detected as being > 2 -fold differentially expressed. Fifty unique, differentially expressed clones were identified. Therefore, the use of RDA essentially provides an enriched library of differentially expressed genes, while analysis of this library with microarrays allows rapid and reproducible screening of thousands of DNA molecules simultaneously. The coupling of these two techniques in this system resulted in a large pool of differentially expressed genes...|$|R
