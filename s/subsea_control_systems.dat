40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} {{different}} topics {{regarding the use}} of Commercial off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software for <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> COTS basically means every product which is commercially available. The idea of using COTS is that it is supposed to reduce the development costs, and ensure a shorter time to market. When doing a COTS based software development, there are many issues that need to addressed. The main issues are discussed in this report. Because of the high reliability requirements on <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> future systems might have to be certified to IEC 61508 Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL 3). IEC 61508 regulates Functional Safety of electrical/electronic/-programmable electronic safety-related systems, and a summary of the standards software requirements for SIL 3 are presented. To make a SIL 3 certified control system one needs a SIL 3 certified controller. A broad search was performed to identify SIL 3 certified controllers, suitable for subsea installation. Twenty three products were found, but only five came close to meeting the requirements for subsea installation. Many <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> incorporate real time operating systems. In this thesis we perform a general evaluation of the four common COTS real time operating systems OSE, Windows CE, QNX and VxWorks. The evaluation showed that all four are good alternatives. The thesis was completed by developing a subsea control system using the COTS controller CompactRIO, from National Instruments. The control system was based on the Tyrihans subsea raw seawater injection pumping system, to see if the CompactRIO would be suitable for replacing the two programmable controllers used in the Tyrihans setup, a task it is believed to be capable of. </p...|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{studies of}} {{systems have been}} an {{important}} area of research within electrical engineering for {{over a quarter of}} a century. In this thesis, the reliability analysis of the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used in offshore petroleum facilities was examined. This thesis presents fault trees for the platform production facilities, <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> a typical SCADA system, and the human induced fault tree. Software reliability was also studied. The fault trees were developed based on a safety flow chart and Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID). This work was conducted as a subcontract to the United States Department of the Interior, Mineral Management Service, Technology Assessment & Research Program, Program SOL 1435 - 01 - 99 -RP- 3995 (project no 356) to the University of Missouri-Rolla. Based on the fault tree diagrams and fault rates, the reliability of the SCADA system used in the offshore facilities was assessed. The failure availability of the SCADA system used in offshore platforms was also found. iv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author wishes to thank Dr. Kelvin. T.

40|$|With the {{increased}} interest in developing offshore fields by subsea completions, also comes the need for minimizing the non-productive time of these systems caused by unexpected failures and lengthy repairs. Maintenance interventions {{that could be considered}} simple for surface equipment can become expensive and complicated when executed under water due to the difficult accessibility of the equipment. A simple failure of a subsea component can cause shutdown of a well for several days or even weeks until a repair is carried out, thus affecting hydrocarbon production rates significantly. Failure of components is unavoidable, but by introducing condition monitoring to subsea production systems (SPS), operators can diagnose and predict failures early, which allows them to plan maintenance activities in advance and reduce downtime. Most of today’s <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> collect great amount of data about the process and the operational parameters of the equipment, but this information is not used to determine the condition of the asset and predict future failures. The aim of this thesis is to develop a methodology tailored for conventional SPS, for appropriate utilization of available monitoring techniques and identification of additional surveillance methods needed to guarantee high system availability. Furthermore, this methodology describes how to integrate these monitoring methods into a comprehensive condition monitoring program that is able to detect asset state, diagnose faults, predict future failures and provide decision support for maintenance intervention. Considerable research and many standards have been written for condition monitoring of complex machinery, mostly for rotating machinery and some static machines for surface or onshore facilities, but little investigation has been done with respect to subsea equipment. The purpose of this research study is to bridge the gap by creating a set of guidelines for implementation of condition monitoring specifically for SPS, and make recommendations for application of these guidelines for the benefit of both field operators and subsea equipment manufacturers. A methodic process was created to guide the user through the different steps of creating a program for condition monitoring of underwater equipment, with emphasis in the active elements used to measure and control the flow of oil and gas, i. e. control systems (SCM, instruments, sensors, valves, electrical/hydraulic flying leads, etc.) and production equipment (XTs, manifolds and distribution units). Risers, flowlines, umbilicals, structures and subsea processing systems are excluded from this work. The methodology is exemplified with two case studies: First for gate valves with hydraulic actuators and, second for the power supply unit located in the subsea electronic module...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is towards the subsea Xmas Tree (XT) system. The XT is {{recognized}} by the industry as an overall reliable configuration, but as in all development projects, it is a constant battle to optimize the design in a life cycle perspective taking account of several aspects such as safety, availability, maintainability and reliability. Unplanned stoppage of equipment result in high equipment downtime, high cost of repair, extensive repair time and high penalty associated with loss of production. The main objective is to study a specific XT system and to estimate the retrieval rate due to tree failures based on commercially available reliability data. Further this shall be compared to high level experience data presented. This is to initiate the process to alleviate the gap seen between generic calculations of the tree retrieval rate compared to known field experience. The XT configuration chosen to evaluate, is the Deepwater Vertical Xmas Tree (DVXT). A generalized case was constructed as the DVXT with help from Endre Willmann, the supervisor in GE Oil & Gas. The scope is limited in this context to the DVXT system and systems that influence the DVXT system in terms of tree retrieval rate and downtime due to failures in the tree system. Therefor, the <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> with associated monitoring equipment are excluded from the analysis. To assess the DVXT system, a reliability analysis is performed. The reliability analysis is achieved in the following steps with proven methods from the reliability engineering discipline: 1. 	FMECA/Failure analysis 2. 	RBD/Reliability analysisA component-level FMECA is conducted to {{develop an understanding of}} main components with essential functional requirements and criticality and effect resulting from functional failure. The results from the reliability analysis conducted as a bottom-up approach indicate a retrieval rate of the production tree near 22 years. The DVXT system is shown to be a reliable configuration with high operating reliability and associated low risk through the reliability analysis. Nonetheless, several assumptions have been made. The {{focus of this}} thesis is not at the prompted absolute result, but to illustrate a reliability issue experienced by GE Oil & Gas when calculating reliability based on generic reliability data contra experience data. It is shown a significant gap between the bottom-up approach and the experience data presented. Based on the field experience collected it is indicated a MTTF for XT retrieval on the top-down approach between 100 to 200 years. This implies a factor of 5 to 10 between the bottom-up and the top-down approach. Further, it is indicated by GE Oil & Gas that a Pareto-rule seem to apply when deciding if failures require heavy workover such as XT retrieval or light intervention means such as ROV remedial actions upon repair. Applied to the sensitivity case to the bottom-up approach, assuming that in fact 80 % of XT critical failures can be restored by light intervention means, the total MTBF of 15 years predicted for XT critical failures then results in an XT retrieval rate of 75 years. This is closer to the expectations indicated by the top-down approach, but still not close to the levels indicated by recent field experience. This indicate that the bottom-up model should be calibrated with input data that is based on experience data rather than only generic to alleviate some of the distance between the two approaches. This can be performed in shape of additional model parameters, modification factors or other refinements. The results from this thesis give no clear answers to such model parameters, as no literature were found on this issue. The Pareto-rule can be utilized in order to calibrate this gap, if shown applicable based on comprehensive historic data., This has to be studied further thoroughly...|$|E

Much of the undiscovered hydrocarbon reservoirs {{are believed to be}} located in the Arctic region. The seasonable ice free waters surrounding the Arctic can be drilled utilizing conventional drilling vessels designed for open water conditions. The region introduces several new operational challenges leading to an increased possibility of the drilling vessel moving off location. This Master Thesis looks at the challenges related to operating a conventional drilling vessel in the seasonable open waters in the Arctic, using today’s methods for disconnecting and reconnecting the marine drilling riser from the BOP. The need for a reduction in the operational downtime related to planned and unplanned disconnections is identified and several alternative methods for reducing the dis-/reconnect time are presented and rated.

40|$|The subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) and the BOP <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{were the most}} important contributors to the Macondo accident in April 2010. A BOP is a large valve system used during the drilling phase; to seal, control, and monitor oil and gas wells. As a consequence of the Macondo accident, improved methods for reliability assessment of BOPs are now required. Over the years, several subsea BOP reliability studies have been performed, where technical solutions and potential failures are thoroughly investigated. As a result of the information gained, both maintenance and reliability of the BOP systems have improved. Despite overall improvements, the BOP is still a main contributor to risk and downtime in the drilling phase. A deeper look into the reliability reports reveals the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of the BOP as the root of the majority of failures. Most subsea BOPs are equipped with a multiplex <b>control</b> <b>system</b> with a combination of electronics and hydraulics, used to operate the different functions of the BOP. Despite the high level of redundancy, several sections of the system are subject to critical system failures. To prevent BOP failures, national regulations and standards have been developed in several countries. Most of the national requirements are similar, but there are also differences. These similarities and differences are illustrated in this study through a detailed comparison between the relevant regulations and standards in Norway and the United States, with respect to general-, design- and operational BOP requirements. The main focus of this study is the multiplex <b>subsea</b> BOP <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The potential critical failures of this system are identified and analyzed in a detailed failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA). This analysis shows that the shuttle valve, the pod selector valve, the subsea accumulators, and the fluid reservoir are the most safety-critical parts of the <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The BOP <b>control</b> <b>system</b> has several redundant elements and these may be vulnerable to common-cause failures. The potential common-cause failures are examined in this study and found to have a significant influence on the reliability of the <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Improving current reliability assessments of <b>subsea</b> BOP <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> requires a thorough review of both the system and the previously used methods. In this study, a fault tree analysis is performed to reveal the relevant failure combinations. To improve reliability calculations provided by common fault tree analysis programs, a post-processing of the minimal cut sets in a spreadsheet (i. e., Excel) is proposed to cover the effect of common-cause failures. The method gives a more conservative and accurate approximation compared to the existing methods. An event tree analysis is performed to cover the switching phases between the two pods, showing the time dependencies that can influence the consequences. This type of switching cannot be modeled in the fault tree, therefore, recommendations to apply the event tree analysis to similar situations to get a more accurate reliability estimate, is given. For components such as the shear ram, a perfect function test cannot be conducted. In the performed analysis, no such components are evaluated. However, in an expanded analysis of the <b>subsea</b> BOP <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> such components will be involved, therefore, adding the contribution from the proof test coverage factor to components prone to imperfect testing, is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Continual {{advances}} {{are being}} made in the control and monitoring of subsea oil wells by the application of new technology for sensors, subsea processing and communications devices. With these advances, the demands on the subsea umbilical are constantly increasing with deployment lengths and depths growing and the quantity of controlled functions now greater than ever. The need for {{a good understanding of}} the effects of deployment subsea is essential, as communications frequencies and data throughput constantly increase. This research aims to address some of the issues regarding umbilical modelling and sets up a series of tests to measure the effects of pressure and cable flooding within the umbilical and assesses the effect of steel tubes, hydraulic hoses and cable armouring on the operating parameters of the cables. In addition, the cables are modelled using electromagnetic field solver tools and the results compared with those measured. Once prediction losses have been established, these are compared with measurements taken on the full lengths of umbilical and the reasons for any discrepancies examined. It is shown that, in a typical subsea umbilical, the proximity of conducting cores to adjacent components, such as hydraulic hoses or steel wire armour, the flooding with sea water and the pressure due to the depth of deployment all {{have a significant impact on}} the impedance parameters of the cables. The effect of cable screening on attenuation is also examined and it is shown that, as well as affecting capacitance and conductance, the screen has a significant impact on the cable resistance and inductance, with the resistance rising to a maximum at a certain screen thickness before a subsequent reduction. This effect was investigated further by modelling with an electromagnetic field solver and a possible explanation for this effect is proposed. Comparison of the modelled data and measurement of cables under the various operating conditions investigated show good correlation with the results, allowing very accurate prediction of the effects on electrical performance of cables when deployed <b>subsea</b> in <b>Subsea</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> umbilicals...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyGassco is the {{operator}} of two platforms with gas transport functions. These platforms are getting old and require large modifications {{to extend the}} lifetime and maintain their functions. Rapid development in subsea technology the recent years enables functions that earlier where performed by offshore platforms to be converted into subsea systems. Subsea developments offer the potential of reduced CAPEX, OPEX and risk reduction in terms of HSE. This makes subsea developments an attractive alternative to conventional topside developments. As a case study, this thesis evaluates the challenges and opportunities related to moving the functions of Heimdal Riser Platform into a subsea system. The requirements of a mid/downstream operator such as Gassco have not been widely evaluated by the subsea industry. A subsea gas transition hub is fundamentally different from other subsea developments {{due to the fact}} that there is no production involved. Subsea production systems have an increasing demand for power due to their complexity. A subsea gas transition hub is simpler and the power demand is low compared. With no nearby topside host facilities, there are challenges with respect to the subsea power supply and communication. Traditionally these requirements are provided by an umbilical which are tied-back to a host platform. Considering the low power demand and the long offsets to nearby host facilities, a long and costly umbilical may be hard to justify. Hence has the focus of this thesis been to eliminate the requirement of an umbilical. Many R&D projects, with the objective of reducing costs and risks related to umbilicals, have commenced the later years. Although many of the projects have been successful, the umbilical maintains as the only option to meet subsea production systems requirements. In this thesis, based on earlier studies, alternative solutions for power supply and communication have been evaluated. All the equipment that are required to maintain the gas transport functions will be incorporated within a 230 tons subsea manifold(excluding protection structure). This includes a remotely operated <b>subsea</b> flow <b>control</b> valve, a <b>subsea</b> High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) and a subsea pig launcher guiding base. The structure also incorporate isolation valves which facilitate the opportunity to retrieve the HIPPS and flow control modules if maintenance is required. The <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is based on the All-Electric technology which eliminates the requirement of hydraulics for valve actuation. The <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is powered by a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery package which requires periodic recharging of energy from an intervention vessel. Communication between the subsea system and the master control station is provided by a connection to the integrated subsea fibre network in the North Sea.

40|$|Blowout preventers are {{designed}} to shut in a well under pressure so that formation fluids that have moved into the wellbore can be contained and circulated out while continuous control of the well is maintained. <b>Control</b> <b>Systems</b> for the BOPs are of necessity highly efficient hydraulic systems. The objective is to operate functions, such as closing rams, on the BOP stack in as short a time as possible. Supplying enough volume of pressured hydraulic fluid to operate those emergency functions is essential. To have the necessary quantity of control fluid under pressure requires storing this fluid in accumulators. These accumulators operate by the expansion and compression of nitrogen gas that is separated from hydraulic fluid by either rubber bladders or pistons. Accumulators are used both {{on the surface and}} at the seafloor. As long as you use accumulators on the surface or in relatively shallow waters, you may not {{have a problem with the}} volume of hydraulic fluid capacity of gas charged accumulators. The problem may arise when the wellhead is at water depth of more than 3500 ft. In deep water drilling, the accumulators should be placed on the subsea blowout preventer stack to reduce hydraulic response times and provide a hydraulic power supply in case of interruption of surface communication. Accumulators are also used in <b>subsea</b> production <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> to provide local storage that allows smaller line sizes in control umbilicals. Hydraulic fluid capacity of an accumulator drops to 15 % of its capacity on the surface and even less, depending on the water depth. A large number of accumulators are needed to perform BOP functions that could have been done by just a few of them on the surface or at relatively shallow water depth. Gas inside gas charged accumulators does not behave like an ideal gas as we go to very deep water, due to high hydrostatic pressure at that water depth. The higher the ambient pressure, the more the gas behaves like a real gas rather than an ideal gas and the lower the fluid capacity of the accumulators. Compressed gas has energy in it, and can release this energy at the time desired, that??s why it is used in accumulators. Now, we have to look for something that is able to store energy, but unlike the nitrogen, its functionality must not be affected by the increasing hydrostatic pressure of water as a function of water depth. Springs and heavy weights will be discussed as two options to replace nitrogen in accumulators. Efficient deep water accumulators would reduce the number of accumulators required in deepwater and cut the cost of the project. With the advent of such efficient accumulators, we can hope that one of the numerous problems of deepwater drilling has been solved and we can think of drilling in even deeper waters...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{oil and gas}} {{exploitation}} is principally {{conducted using}} dry or wet tree systems, otherwise called the subsea Xmas tree system. Due to the shift to deeper waters, subsea production system (SPS) {{has come to be}} a preferred technology with attendant economic benefits. At the centre of the SPS is the <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> module (SCM), responsible for the proper functioning and monitoring of the entire system. With increasing search for hydrocarbons in deep and ultra-deepwaters, the SCM system faces important environmental, safety and reliability challenges and little research has been done in this area. Analysis of the SCM reliability then becomes very fundamental due to the huge cost associated with failure. Several tools are available for this analysis, but the FMECA stands out due to its ability to not only provide failure data, but also showcase the system’s failure modes and mechanisms associated with the subsystems and components being evaluated. However, the technique has been heavily challenged in various literatures for several reasons. To close this gap, a novel multi-criteria approach is developed for the analysis and ranking of the SCM failures modes. This research specifically focusses on subsea tree-mounted electro-hydraulic (E-H) SCM responsible for the underwater control of oil and gas production. A risk identification of the <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> module is conducted using industry experts. This is followed by a comprehensive component based FMECA analysis of the SCM conducted with the conventional RPN technique, which reveals the most critical failure modes for the SCM. A novel framework is developed using multi-criteria fuzzy TOPSIS methodology and applied to the most critical failure modes obtained from the FMECA evaluation using unconventional parameters. Finally, a validation of these results is performed using a stochastic input evaluation and SCM failure data obtained from the offshore industry standard reliability database, OREDA...|$|R

40|$|Failure {{mode and}} effects {{analysis}} (FMEA) {{is one of}} the most common reliability engineering techniques used for identifying, evaluating and mitigating the engineering risks. In this paper, the potential failure modes of a <b>subsea</b> <b>control</b> module (SCM) are identified based on industry experts' opinions and experiences. This is followed by a comprehensive component based FMEA study using the risk-priority-number (RPN) where the most critical failure modes in the SCM are revealed. A fuzzy TOPSIS-based multiple criteria decision making methodology is then proposed to analyse and prioritise the most critical failure modes identified by the FMEA study. To this aim, a distinct ten-parameter criticality model is developed and, for the first time, is applied to evaluate the risks associated with SCM failures. The results indicate that the proposed fuzzy TOPSIS model can significantly improve the performance and applicability of the conventional FMEA technique in offshore oil and gas industry...|$|R
40|$|Underwater {{acoustic}} communication is a rapidly progressing field of technology, {{largely due to}} recent advances in low cost and power efficient digital signal processors. Unfortunately, the unpredictable and time varying physical properties of the underwater acoustic channel reduce communication reliability over long ranges. This study sought to characterise the performance of horizontal underwater acoustic data communication in various scenarios with particular application to <b>subsea</b> monitoring and <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> To fulfil the experimental needs, two custom-built high frequency ambient noise recorder and modem control units were developed to operate with commercial underwater acoustic modems. Additionally, an underwater {{acoustic communication}} simulator based on the Bellhop propagation model was developed for Matlab, capable of producing performance predictions in both spatial and temporal studies. A series of short-term trials were conducted to determine the limitations of modem performance over different ranges. These trials included shallow water studies {{off the coast of}} Perth, Western Australia (D < 30 m), and a French deep water trial (D ≤ 1000 m) which used stand-alone modems. Experimental findings were compared to predictions obtained using two-dimensional range-depth performance simulations. A long-term investigation of the environmental influences on modem reliability was carried out off the coast of Perth in approximately 100 m of water. This involved simultaneously collecting environmental and modem performance data for over 16 days. The signal to noise ratio remained high {{for the duration of the}} trial so modem performance fluctuations could be attributed to changes in channel propagation. Using multiple linear regression, the measured environmental parameters were correlated with the observed modem performance and their contributions to an overall fitting curve were calculated. It was determined that the sound speed profile, in addition to the sea surface roughness, contributed strongly to the fitting curve, with a weaker contribution from the measured signal to noise ratio. This result was confirmed by performing temporal simulations which incorporated more detailed time-dependant environmental parameters. By progressively adding more parameters to the simulator including ambient noise, wave height and the sound speed profile, simulations provided more accurate predictions of the observed performanceOverall, the horizontal performance of underwater acoustic communication was characterised in several scenarios from a series of experimental and numerical investigations. Additionally, the developed simulator was shown to be an effective and flexible tool for predicting the performance of an underwater acoustic communication system. The results and tools discussed in this thesis provide an extensive investigation into the factors influencing horizontal underwater acoustic communication. The analysis demonstrates that whilst underwater acoustic communication can be effective, it is not yet a viable alternative to cabled telemetry for long-range <b>subsea</b> monitoring and <b>control</b> applications, where reliability is crucial. Underwater acoustic communication would best be suited as a non-critical or backup method for continuous monitoring systems until channel prediction and equalisation techniques are further refined...|$|R
