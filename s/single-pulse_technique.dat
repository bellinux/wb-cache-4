40|$|A potentiostatic <b>single-pulse</b> <b>technique</b> was {{employed}} to prepare silver nanoclusters deposited on glassy carbon (GC) from CH 3 CN+ 0. 1 M LiCO 4 plating solutions containing 1 – 2 mM AgClO 4. The morphology of the particles, obtained at a constant voltage pulse of variable duration, was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Clusters with particle diameter of 100 – 400 nm, which are uniformly distributed over the GC surface, can be prepared on a time-scale of 30 – 90 s. The Ag clusters exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of benzyl chloride. The supported Ag nanoclusters and bulk Ag metal have comparable electrocatalytic activities, both anticipating the reduction potential of PhCH 2 Cl by ca. 0. 5 V with respect to bare GC. The Ag-modiﬁed electrode was used in preparative scale electrocatalytic reduction of benzyl chloride in diﬀerent experimental conditions. Good yields of toluene or phenylacetic acid were obtained, depending on experimental conditions, whereas no loss of catalytic activity could be observed, even when the electrode was repeatedly used {{over a period of}} several days...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the progress of}} technology development of a laser ignition system at NASA Marshall Spac Flight Center (MSFC). Initial hot-fire tests in a small-scale rocket chamber at MSFC have demonstrated the dual pulse laser-induced spark (DPLIS) technique, which has an advantage over existing <b>single-pulse</b> laser ignition <b>techniques</b> in {{that it can be}} optimized in its laser pulse format to maximize the initial plasma volume, the plasm: lifetime, as well as the flame kernel growth rate. The distribution of the total laser energy into two separate pulse also lowers the peak power that would need to be sent through fiber optics to the combustion chamber, making the implementation of this technique more practical than other <b>single-pulse</b> <b>techniques.</b> A first generation prototype of an optic fiber-coupled laser ignition system will be tested a rocket chamber with RP- 1 /GOX and GH 2 /GOX propellants systems. Other relevant technology, such as optical windows, flight-qualified laser system etc. will be discussed in this paper...|$|R

However, HfO 2 films besides their recently discovered ferroelectric behavior are also prone to undesired charge trapping effects. Therefore, {{the scope of}} this paper is to verify the possibility of the charge trapping during standard operation of the HfO 2 -based FeFET memories. The kinetics of the charge trapping and its interplay with the ferroelectric polarization switching are analyzed in detail using the <b>single-pulse</b> ID-VG <b>technique.</b> Furthermore, the impact of the charge trapping on the important memory characteristics such as retention and endurance is investigated...|$|R

The distribution of nearest neighbours is determined {{as a function of}} time and also the first to fifth nearest-neighbour distributions are examined at specific times. The distribution of nucleus areas is found and a simple stochastic model of nucleation and growth developed in order to understand qualitatively the nearest neighbour and nucleus area results. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|According to literature, MIMO radars {{often use}} {{orthogonal}} waveforms on their different channels {{to achieve a}} wide angular beam and so-called colored transmission. The generation of orthogonal signals is very difficult and true orthogonality cannot be achieved in practice. The Circulating Codes provide a simplified alternative to orthogonal signals, by transmitting the same waveform, but slightly shifted in time from channel to channel. By applying digital beamforming on transmit through signal processing on receive, a performance similar to orthogonal signals can be achieved. The Circulating Codes {{can also be used}} with a spatial code along the antenna elements, to improve the auto-correlation properties of the signal and thus the range resolution of the radar. These codes are called Hybrid or Delft Codes. In this thesis, the Circulating Codes, as well as Hybrid Codes are revisited and analyzed again. An implementation for simulations has been created in Matlab to examine their behavior in more detail. To improve the range resolution of the Hybrid Codes, this thesis proposes the use of so-called Golay pairs as spatial codes. Each Golay pair consists of two codes, which have the property that the sum of their auto-correlation functions produces one strong peak and zero sidelobes. Since the application of these codes requires the transmission of two pulses, the phase shift due to the displacement of a moving target in between of the pulses has an impact on the result. This thesis focuses on the mitigation or correction of this phase shift, by the use of different methods and presents two possible solutions which perform well in simulations. Finally, some of the techniques are applied in practical measurements with an available radar system. The results of these measurements show that the <b>single-pulse</b> <b>techniques</b> of the Circulating and Hybrid Codes perform well with the system, while the multi-pulse techniques with Golay pairs suffer from much higher sidelobes than expected from the simulations. First of all, this shows that the system has certain issues that need to be improved. Secondly, it shows that Hybrid Codes with Golay pairs are sensitive to disturbances and phase shifts. Therefore, very clean signals are required that might be difficult to generate in practice. Microwave Sensing, Signals & System...|$|R
40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) {{provides a}} non-invasive method of induction of focal currents {{in the brain}} as well as transient modulation of {{the function of the}} targeted cortex. TMS is now widely used as a diagnostic tool in adults. In children, its application to date has been limited, even though TMS offers unique opportunities to gain insights into the neurophysiology of a child's brain. Using the <b>single-pulse</b> TMS <b>technique,</b> investigators can measure motor thresholds, motor evoked potentials, silent periods, central conduction times, and the paired-pulse curve to study central nervous system development and central motor reorganization after a cerebral lesion. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is a novel treatment for psy-chiatric illness that is undergoing trials for a range of disorders in adults. Although there are rare published data on rTMS as a treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases in young persons, the benefits from TMS are nevertheless encouraging. Two important issues of pediatric TMS are safety considerations and methodology. In the future, rTMS may play an impor-tant role in the study and possibly in the therapy of children's diseases after more safety studies are completed.

40|$|The main {{thrust of}} this thesis is {{the search for}} radio pulsars using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). LOFAR {{is part of a}} new {{generation}} of radio telescopes leading up to the building of the Square Kilometer Array. LOFAR uses a multitude of inexpensive antennas whose signals are combined digitally to create many sensitive, fully steerable, beams on the sky. As part of LOFAR's commissioning we performed two radio pulsar surveys, the LOFAR Pilot Pulsar Survey (LPPS) and the LOFAR Tied-Array Survey (LOTAS). The former survey put a limit on the fast radio transient rate and re-detected 65 pulsars, while the latter re-detected 27 pulsars and discovered 2 new ones. These discoveries bode well for future, more sensitive, pulsar surveys using LOFAR. We also describe extensions to standard <b>single-pulse</b> search <b>techniques.</b> This thesis furthermore describes two smaller projects; attempts to detect pulsars as binary companions to subdwarf-B stars and an attempt to detect pulsed radio emission from the nearby pulsar Geminga. We were able to exclude pulsed radio emission from the sdB binary companions to a high degree of certainty. Our very sensitive observation of Geminga failed to detect pulsed radio emission, despite earlier claims. We conclude that those earlier detections were likely spurious, but leave open the possibility that Geminga is an intermittent radio source that turned off...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe local {{structure}} of carbon spheres obtained via the hydrothermal carbonization process {{is characterized by}} {{using a combination of}} advanced solid-state 13 C NMR techniques. Glucose was chosen as the starting product because it offers the possibility of 13 C isotopic enrichment and is regarded as a model compound for more complex polysaccharides and biomass, as reported in recent studies. A number of 13 C solid-state MAS NMR <b>techniques</b> (<b>single-pulse,</b> cross-polarization, inversion recovery cross-polarization, INEPT, 13 C− 13 C proton-driven magnetization exchange, and 13 C− 13 C double-quantum−single-quantum correlation experiments) were combined to retrieve information about binding motifs and C−C closest neighbor relations. We found that the core of the carbonaceous scaffold is composed of furan rings cross-linked by domains containing short keto-aliphatic chains instead of otherwise expected graphene-type sheets, as mainly reported either for hydrothermal carbon spheres or for biomass-related carbons obtained by low-temperature (< 350 °C) pyrolysis treatment...|$|R

In contrast, perception of effort did not change significantly following 10 minutes of tDCS. The major findings of this thesis suggest the 0 – 10 NRS is a valid and reliable scale for rating perception of effort in healthy individuals.

40|$|Plasma-polymerized organosilicone {{coatings}} {{can be used}} {{to impart}} abrasion resistance and barrier properties to plastic substrates such as polycarbonate. Coating rates suitable for industrial-scale deposition, up to 100 nm/s, can be achieved through the use of microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), with optimal process vapors such as tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) and oxygen. However, it has been found that under certain deposition conditions, such coatings are subject to post-plasma changes; crazing or cracking can occur anytime from days to months after deposition. To understand the cause of the crazing and its dependence on processing plasma parameters, the effects of post-plasma reactions on the chemical bonding structure of coatings deposited with varying TMDSO-to-O 2 ratios was studied with 29 Si and 13 C solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) using both <b>single-pulse</b> and cross-polarization <b>techniques.</b> The coatings showed complex chemical compositions significantly altered from the parent monomer. 29 Si MAS NMR spectra revealed four main groups of resonance lines, which correspond to four siloxane moieties (i. e., mono (M), di (D), tri (T), and quaternary (Q)) and how they are bound to oxygen. Quantitative measurements showed that the ratio of TMDSO to oxygen could shift the chemical structure of the coating from 39 % to 55 % in Q-type bonds and from 28 % to 16 % for D-type bonds. Post-plasma reactions were found to produce changes in relative intensities of 29 Si resonance lines. The NMR data were complemented by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Together, these techniques have shown that the bonding environment of Si is drastically altered by varying the TMDSO-to-O 2 ratio during PECVD, and that post-plasma reactions increase the cross-link density of the silicon–oxygen network. It appears that Si–H and Si–OH chemical groups are the most susceptible to post-plasma reactions. Coatings produced at a low TMDSO-to-oxygen ratio had little to no singly substituted moieties, displayed a highly cross-linked structure, and showed less post-plasma reactions. However, these chemically more stable coatings are less compatible mechanically with plastic substrates, because of their high stiffness...|$|R
