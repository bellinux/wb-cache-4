2500|$|... 1935: Film {{director}} King Vidor {{was born}} in Galveston and survived the great Galveston Hurricane of 1900. [...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. [...] I felt as if the sea was going to break {{over the edge of the}} bowl and come puring down upon us.|$|E
60|$|And as I <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{darkness}} I {{could almost}} fancy that I heard it crack.|$|E
60|$|Margaret Maynard {{knew she}} <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flesh, yet the shimmering white satin, the flowing veil, covered some {{one who was}} a {{stranger}} to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dick, I don't {{like you}} to <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wet. And you mustn't sit down. Go home and change your things. Don't stay another minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I can't even promise that; {{it depends}} upon the weather," [...] he replied. [...] "But you mustn't <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spray. You're getting wet through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{fortunate}} that I {{gave you the}} key!" [...] she declared. [...] "I don't suppose I should ever have heard you. Now please <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light and {{let me look at}} you." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{door swung}} quickly {{open and he}} <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{streaming}} sunlight of the morning--so tall he was he seemed to fill the doorway--and he smiled and extended his hands.|$|E
60|$|James {{approached}} Miss Forrester with {{a beating}} heart. She made a charming picture as she <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight, {{one hand on}} her hip, the other swaying a tennis racket.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can see you}} {{are angry}} at something," [...] Verena said to Olive, as the two <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starlight. [...] "I hope it isn't me. What have I done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning, Emil Sachs," [...] he said. [...] "I am {{glad that}} you have shown discretion. <b>Stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light, please, and fold your arms. Thanks. Do not think that I am afraid of you, but I like to talk comfortably." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{beginning}} to depress me," [...] he announced. [...] "I {{think that you can}} go away. No, stop for just one moment. <b>Stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light. Dear me, how unfortunate! Who would have thought that so beautiful a mother could have so plain a daughter!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{and if you}} <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glow of {{the fire}} they can creep up under cover of the shadows to {{one side or the}} other, and shoot you down. We've done all we can here, Sue, and the {{remainder}} of our fight must be made from the house." ...|$|R
60|$|Falkenberg {{walked to}} the window and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full glare of the light. The man {{opposite}} was still sipping his eternal coffee. He glanced casually at Falkenberg and back at his paper.|$|E
60|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunset, his rough {{felt hat}} in his hand, the {{slanting}} rays playing through his fair hair, watching {{her until she}} and her horse coalesced with the blue shadows of the hillside.|$|E
60|$|He {{wondered}} if she would speak to him, but she only {{looked at him with}} sad eyes; and he <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow of the rocks without moving, and she passed on into the twilight.|$|E
60|$|But I {{think what}} Jeff liked {{best of it}} all {{was the sort of}} public {{recognition}} that it meant. He'd <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shop, hardly bothering to shave, and explain to <b>the</b> men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arm-chairs how he held her, and they shoved her, and he clung to her, and what he'd said to himself--a perfect Iliad--while he was clinging to her.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2008 Spanish general {{election}} {{it failed to}} win a seat <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> senate or congress. It received 19,042 votes for the Congress of Deputies, which represented 0.08% of the total. Of those votes, 4,047 came from Andalucía (although <b>the</b> party didn't <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autonomous elections) and 3,309 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Valencian Community. The party failed to stand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Basque Country, and in Melilla.|$|R
60|$|He {{reached it}} almost {{simultaneously}} with Mr. Quest, {{and together they}} turned the body over. But still Belle <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> enveloped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavy smoke.|$|R
60|$|She looked divinely {{pretty as}} she <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight, with the fur-cloak sliding off her {{beautiful}} shoulders, the gold embroidery on her dress shimmering around her, her childlike blue eyes turned up fully at him.|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas backed to the mantelpiece, and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{attitude}} {{which for}} generations has been sacred {{to the elderly}} Briton, feet well apart, hands clasped beneath his coat-tails. His stare raked Lord Dreever like a searchlight.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{was taken}} by surprise. She had not thought he would ever come again, and was off her guard. He had come around the porch corner {{abruptly}} as she <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dusk, and she started very perceptibly.|$|E
60|$|And {{whether the}} {{tortoise}} ate him, I know not; for {{some say that}} earth and sea both disdained to take his body, so foul it was with sin. So the sea cast it out upon the shore, and the shore cast {{it back into the}} sea, and at last the waves hurled it high into <b>the</b> air <b>in</b> anger; and it hung there long without a grave, till it was changed into a desolate rock, which <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surge until this day.|$|R
60|$|Whenever I went {{in or out}} of the hut, {{for three}} long months, that hideous thing <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> staring me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face with mute indignation. At night, when I tried to sleep, the murdered man <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{darkness}} beside me. O God! I dared not say a word to anybody: but I trembled every time I passed it, and I knew what {{it was to be a}} murderer.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gereth <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> {{glory of}} a great stroke. [...] "I've settled you." [...] She filled the room, to Fleda's scared vision, with the glare of her magnificence. [...] "I've sent {{everything}} back." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was Adrea--Adrea herself! She <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{shadow of}} the doorway, with her lips {{slightly}} parted, and her great eyes, soft and brilliant, flashing in the ruddy firelight. It was no vision; it was she beyond a doubt! ...|$|E
60|$|A little after, {{the captain}} came (as was agreed) {{to one of}} the windows, and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rain, with his arm in a sling, and looking stern and pale, and so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him.|$|E
60|$|Aaron <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{dark outside}} the big gates, and wished himself somewhere else. However, he rang the bell. There {{was a huge}} barking of dogs on the other side. Presently a light {{switched}} on, and a woman, followed by a man, appeared cautiously, in the half-opened doorway.|$|E
60|$|He heaved {{himself up}} and <b>stood</b> towering <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{intensity}} of a passion that was entirely simulated. He must bluster here, and crush down suspicion with whorling periods and broad, fierce gesture.|$|R
5000|$|... "Sugar Nobody Wants," [...] <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> protagonist {{suggests}} {{breaking into}} an office supply store for the night, [...] "endorses petty thievery and vandalism {{at a variety of}} unloved Jersey locations as a sort of what-the-hell morale booster for all concerned," [...] <b>in</b> what <b>the</b> lyrics called [...] "candy-assed forms of civil disobedience." [...] McCall stated that the song was about [...] "finding <b>the</b> cracks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city that aren't mapped, or that used to be mapped and have fallen away as the legend has been rewritten, and making your <b>stand</b> <b>there....</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> invisible spaces where the authorities don’t bother to look." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{took part}} in {{selections}} {{of women and children}} to the gas chambers as well as physically abusing prisoners, including children, as Andreas Larinciakos, a nine-year-old boy from Cles, Italy, recalled: [...] "While <b>in</b> <b>the</b> camp, Doctor Mengele took my blood many times. In November 1944, all children were transferred to Camp A, the gypsy camp. When they counted us, one was found missing, so Mandl, manageress of the women’s camp and her assistant, Brandl, drove us out into the street at one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and made us <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frost until noon the next day." ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{that smell}} of hot coffee. Ever {{after it was}} {{associated}} in Armand's mind with this awful morning in the guard-house of the Rue Ste. Anne, when the rain and snow beat against the windows, and he <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low guard-room shivering and half-numbed with cold.|$|E
60|$|As I rose, Victory had risen, too, {{and started}} toward me. But {{when she saw}} that I was uninjured she stopped, and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the {{demolished}} apartment looking at me. Her expression was inscrutable--I could not guess whether {{she was glad to}} see me, or not.|$|E
6000|$|All {{through the}} night the {{exquisite}} little house <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Figs taking care of Maimie, and she never knew. She slept until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg, and then she almost fell asleep again, and then she called out, ...|$|E
60|$|The {{residence}} selected was a {{house of}} four rooms, close upon the city wall. The place was called the Kirk of Field, from a kirk, or church, which formerly <b>stood</b> near <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields.|$|R
50|$|Lexington, Leading sire in North America 16 times, <b>stood</b> at stud <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s and 1870s.|$|R
60|$|Thus speaking, the Darties entered {{their habitat}} <b>in</b> Green Street, <b>the</b> rent {{of which was}} paid by James, and sought a well-earned rest. The hour was midnight, and no Forsytes {{remained}} abroad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets to spy out Bosinney's wanderings; to see him return and stand against the rails of the Square garden, back from {{the glow of the}} street lamp; to see him <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow of trees, watching <b>the</b> house where <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark was hidden she whom he would have given the world to see for a single minute--she who was now to him the breath of the lime-trees, the meaning of the light and the darkness, the very beating of his own heart.|$|R
