5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The rings are extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings' particles does not exceed 2%. They are probably composed of water ice {{with the addition of}} <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> shit.|$|E
5|$|The toad {{has long}} been {{considered}} to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to a spirit world. This may have its origins in {{the fact that it is}} at home both on land and in the water. It may cause repugnance because of its blackish, wart-like skin, its slow movements and the way it emerges from <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> hole. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the toad was associated with the Devil, for whom a coat-of-arms was invented emblazoned with three toads. It was known that the toad could poison people and, as the witch's familiar, it was thought to possess magical powers. Even ordinary people made use of dried toads, their bile, faeces and blood. In some areas, the finding of a toad in a house was considered evidence that a witch was present. In the Basque Country, the familiars were believed to be toads wearing elegant robes. These were herded by children who were being trained as witches. Between 1610 and 1612, the Spanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías investigated witchcraft in the region and searched the houses of suspected witches for dressed toads. He found none. These witches were reputed to use undomesticated toads as ingredients in their liniments and brews.|$|E

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, although John Latham had made notes on the species in 1781, from a specimen obtained in February 1780 at Princes Island off the westernmost cape of Java during Captain Cook's last voyage. Its specific name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek leuko- 'white', and gaster 'belly'. Its closest relative is the little-known Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands. These form a superspecies, and as is usual in other sea eagle superspecies, one (the white-bellied sea eagle) has a white head, as opposed to the other species' dark head. The bill and eyes are dark, and the talons are dark yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere sea eagles. Both these species have at least <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> colouration in their tails, though this may not always be clearly visible in the white-bellied sea eagle. The nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b gene of the two sea eagles were among those analysed in a 1996 study. Although they differ greatly in appearance and ecology, their genetic divergence of 0.3% indicates that the ancestors of the two forms might have diverged as recently as 150,000 years ago. The study authors conclude that although the genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies, the distinctness in appearance and behaviour warrants the two being retained as separate species. Mitochondrial sequence of the cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of Sanford's sea eagle suggesting a relatively recent divergence after New Guinea-based white-bellied sea eagles colonised the Solomon Islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} opinion among most astrophysicists {{is that while}} modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must still be <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> matter.|$|E
25|$|Because of his {{educational}} background and early interests, Pangborn's works often deal with musical themes. Music plays {{a prominent role}} both in Davy and A Mirror For Observers. Pangborn's works are also known for being humane and poignant {{in a way that}} nevertheless allows for <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> themes and raunchy humor.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings whitish grey, with <b>some</b> <b>darker</b> grey irroration towards the dorsum and termen. The hindwings are whitish.|$|R

25|$|Foods {{contribute}} {{virtually all}} of the copper consumed by humans. The best dietary sources include seafood (especially shellfish), organ meats (e.g., liver), whole grains, legumes (e.g., beans and lentils) and chocolate. Nuts, including peanuts and pecans, are especially rich in copper, as are grains such as wheat and rye, and several fruits including lemons and raisins. Other food sources that contain copper include cereals, potatoes, peas, red meat, mushrooms, <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> green leafy vegetables (such as kale), and fruits (coconuts, papaya and apples). Tea, rice and chicken are relatively low in copper, but can provide a reasonable amount of copper when they are consumed in significant amounts.|$|E
25|$|In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake {{looks more}} like the hen; it is more uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, {{somewhat}} darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks {{on the head and}} neck, and scaly spots {{on the rest of the}} body; overall they look much like a tiny mallard (A. platyrhynchos) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> streaking.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{populate}} the film with many characters, {{as in his}} previous films, here the story focuses on the compelling relationship at its center: the actress and her kidnapper literally struggling for power and desperate for love. The film's title line Tie Me Up! is unexpectedly uttered by the actress as a genuine request. She does not know if she will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, she prefers not {{to be given a}} chance. In spite of <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> elements, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Artemisia campestris. They {{create a}} light {{coloured}} silken tube with <b>some</b> <b>darker</b> length lines caused by detritus particles. Full-grown larvae {{can be found}} in March and May.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 22 - 23 mm for males. The forewings are brown, mottled {{with yellow}} brown and <b>some</b> <b>darker</b> scales. The hindwings are grey. Adults {{have been recorded}} in mid September.|$|R
25|$|Adults have a pale buff head, {{changeable}} {{between a}} more brownish {{and an almost}} white hue according to feather wear and individual variation. The broad black face mask stretches across the neck as a narrow collar, bordered with white. On the crown, the feather shafts are dark, producing a somewhat streaked effect. The upper wings and back are blackish brown. The uppertail coverts are whitish buff again, and the rectrices are barred black and whitish, ending in white. The underside is uniformly pale buff; {{there may be a}} bit of dark speckling on the thighs, however. The underside of the wing is pale rufous-buff, sometimes with <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> spotting on the underwing coverts. The tips of the primary remiges are barred with pale grey below, their bases are quite rufous. The iris is dark brown, the bill is black with a pale yellow cere; the feet are also pale yellow.|$|E
500|$|Whence, in {{the name}} of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E
500|$|According to Haggard's {{daughter}} Lilias, {{the phrase}} [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed" [...] originated {{from his childhood}} and [...] "the particularly hideous aspect" [...] of one rag-doll: [...] "This doll {{was something of a}} fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember". Haggard wrote that [...] "the title She" [...] was taken [...] "from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who were in her charge." ...|$|E

500|$|Bryant {{worked as}} a welder while in Texas, until {{increasing}} blindness forced him to give up this employment. At some point, he and Carolyn divorced; he remarried in 1980. He opened a store in Ruleville, Mississippi. He was convicted in 1984 and 1988 of food stamp fraud. In a 1985 interview, he denied that he had killed Till, but said: [...] "if Emmett Till hadn't got out of line, it probably wouldn't have happened to him." [...] Fearing economic boycotts and retaliation, Bryant lived a private life and refused to be photographed or reveal {{the exact location of}} his store, explaining: [...] "this new generation is different and I don't want to worry about a bullet <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> night". He died of cancer in 1994, at the age of 63.|$|E
500|$|Walter Jackson Bate {{states that}} the poem has [...] "always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far better. If we had hope to use them as keys, we {{discover}} they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Bruce had {{the largest}} {{transfer}} budget in the division made available to him, Birmingham made a slow start to the 2006–07 season in the Championship and, after a 1–0 defeat at home to Norwich City, the team's fifth consecutive match without a win, there were calls from fans and local journalists for the manager to be sacked. Bruce publicly accepted responsibility for the team's poor run and admitted that he feared for his job, but the team responded with a 1–0 victory over Derby County, and then recorded a further five consecutive league victories to be joint leaders of the league table by late November. On 29 April 2007, Birmingham secured promotion to the Premier League, with one match to play, by virtue of Derby County's 2–0 defeat at Crystal Palace. Chairman David Gold told the press [...] "There have been <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> days but Steve has been outstanding. He was determined to bounce back. He has rebuilt the team {{and now we are}} all back where we want to be." ...|$|E

500|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is a {{medium-sized}} rice rat, smaller than O.couesi, with thick, glossy fur and velvety underfur. The {{hairs on the}} back are about 6mm in length. The upperparts are gray-brown with <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> hairs, appearing darker overall than in O.couesi; [...] the color becomes more yellowish towards the sides. According to Thomas, a faint [...] line extends from the sides to the inner sides of the hindlegs. The underparts are grayish, contrasting with the buffy underparts of O.couesi. The snout is short and the well-haired ears are partly hidden by the fur. The hands and feet are off-white or brownish above, not white as in O.couesi. The hindfeet show small interdigital webs, but they lack long tufts of hair on the digits {{and some of the}} pads are reduced or absent. The tail is about as long as the head and body and contains about 15 rings per centimeter. It is slightly darker (grayish) above than below (whitish), but the difference in color is much less pronounced than in O.couesi.|$|E
500|$|Pearce {{reported}} that the guerrillas numbered about 50, and followed them eastwards during 28 July. Flight Lieutenant Petter-Bowyer led a detail of four Alouette IIIs providing air support. Petter-Bowyer's helicopters spotted the insurgents encamped by a stream beneath <b>some</b> <b>dark,</b> shady trees, leading Strong's 12 Troop, 3 Commando to be brought forward to contact them the following morning. Strong's fresh men were sent into the trees while Pearce was reluctantly forced to withdraw and provide back-up. Strong called back almost immediately after entering, [...] " [...] left about one minute ago – in a hurry. There is abandoned equipment—no time to collect—moving east on tracks." [...] 12 Troop pursued the guerrillas and trackers found that they numbered only about 20, meaning that the majority had gone in another direction. Pearce, who had been sent into the camp after Strong, found tracks from {{the remainder of the}} cadres that headed south. He followed them while 12 Troop continued to head east and reached the Mozambican border at nightfall on 30 July. At this time they were able to confirm from bootprints at the road crossing that the exact number of ZIPRA they were pursuing was 15.|$|E
500|$|In February 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Arkham Knight had received a [...] "Mature" [...] rating from the ESRB, rather than the [...] "Teen" [...] ratings previous installments in the franchise held. Sefton Hill and the Rocksteady team were caught off guard by the rating; Hill explained that they did not create the game with a specific rating in mind, but that [...] "It's unavoidable that some bad stuff is going to happen. But that doesn't mean we changed our approach. We're not including gratuitous blood or swearing. We want to deliver a true end with no compromises, and it takes us to <b>some</b> <b>dark</b> places."
