40|$|One of the {{limiting}} factors {{for improving the}} sensitivity towards single spin detection using Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy is the working temperature. A component limiting this working temperature is the radio frequent (RF) source. The use of a superconducting NbTiN instead of a copper RF-source improves this working temperature and theory suggests that the dissipation of such a NbTiN RF-source is geometry dependent. The dissipation of 9 NbTiN RF-sources with different geometries was measured using two different methods. First a four-point measurement was used that returned inductive effects obscuring the dissipation of the RF-source. Secondly a calorimetric measurement was tried that returned dissipation originating in the <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> overshadowing the dissipation of the RF-source. The dissipation of these <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> corresponds very well with the dissipation attributed to the RF-source by our predecessors. The dissipation of the RF-source is thus found to be much lower than previously thought...|$|R

50|$|In 1882 the world's first {{coal-fired}} public power station, the Edison Electric Light Station, {{was built}} in London, a project of Thomas Edison organized by Edward Johnson. A Babcock & Wilcox boiler powered a 125-horsepower steam engine that drove a 27-ton generator. This supplied electricity to premises {{in the area that}} could be reached through the culverts of the viaduct without digging up the road, which was the monopoly of the gas companies. The customers included the City Temple and the Old Bailey. Another important customer was the Telegraph Office of the General Post Office, but this could not be reached though the culverts. Johnson arranged for the <b>supply</b> <b>cable</b> to be run overhead, via Holborn Tavern and Newgate.|$|E
50|$|In 2000 the Jersey Electricity Company {{installed}} a second submarine electricity <b>supply</b> <b>cable</b> to Surville in France {{and also from}} Jersey to the Guernsey Electricity Company at Barkers Quarry forming the Channel Islands Electric Grid.

Irrefutable Rights of Use have since been purchased from the CIEG by Newtel Solutions, Cable and Wireless and JT Group Limited (JT) to enable use as telecommunications circuits. In December 2002 JT was granted licences by the Office of Utility Regulation to operate fixed and mobile telecommunications services to, from and within the Bailiwick of Guernsey and was known as Wave Telecom.|$|E
