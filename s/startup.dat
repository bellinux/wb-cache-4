What is the incumbents’ perspective on collaboration with <b>startups?</b> Today these are issues of high interest for the energy sector in Sweden and for other <b>startups</b> in similar industries. This thesis considers the changing dynamics within the Energy sector in Sweden, the potential of innovation through <b>startups,</b> the market potential and barriers that these actors within the industry are facing. It also considers how collaborations and networks serve to seize opportunities and to overcome challenges and barriers faced by the industry today. Opportunity areas identified were: the trends within the industry concerning decentralized generation, the founders’ dedication for their <b>startups,</b> <b>startup’s</b> ability to act fast and flexibly, their technology contribution, and incumbents differentiating themselves through <b>startups</b> in a highly competitive market. Entry barriers identified were a traditional and slow market, dominative national champions, financial, regulatory, lead times, lack of experience, high risk, lack of system context and credibility. Finally strategic networks and collaboration prove to be an essential part for <b>startups</b> to overcome their liabilities and barriers to entry...|$|R

40|$|<b>Startups,</b> {{especially}} technology <b>startups,</b> {{have been}} {{emerging as a}} "hot" topic given its important contribution to the economic development. However, not all <b>startups</b> can successfully evolve into bigger and sustainable companies, {{a great number of}} them have failed and ceased to exist. One of the key causes leading to the failure of technology <b>startups</b> is their inability to commercialize their products or services due to the mismatch between what they offer and the real market or customer's needs. This problem indicates that market orientation is crucial to technology <b>startups.</b> However, there has been mixed conclusions regarding the impact of market orientation on innovation, the key mindset of tech-startup founders and one of key success determinants of tech-startups. Hence, this study is interested in investigating how technology <b>startups</b> incorporate market orientation into their businesses. By using multi-case study of five Finnish technology <b>startups,</b> in which semi-structured interviews were carried out with the CEOs/Founders of these <b>startups</b> to understand how these <b>startups</b> bring the market orientation concept into practice. The result shows that these CEOs/founders have a very good awareness and understanding of market orientation as well as its role to the businesses. And they build up market orientation through the activities centering around the three constructs that were established in previous research, including: (1) generation of market intelligence, (2) dissemination of market intelligence, and (3) responsiveness to market intelligence. However, the characteristics and mechanisms under each construct are different from the previous findings for big and mature firms. Moreover, whether these activities can really lead to market orientation depends on the <b>startup's</b> ability to balance between the "disruptive innovative idea" and the "market orientation" notion, which was found as a facilitating factor for the creation of market orientation at technology <b>startups.</b> The study confirms the importance of market orientation to technology <b>startups,</b> and also sheds light on the topic by suggesting the activities or procedures that technology <b>startups</b> can employ to efficiently build up market orientation for their businesses...|$|R
40|$|Context. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the software industry, innovative software products become the mainstream of the software market. Because software <b>startups</b> can use a few resources to quickly produce and publish innovative software products, more and more software <b>startups</b> are launched. Software testing is important {{to ensure the quality}} of product in software companies. Software testing is costly in software development, but if software testing is avoided, it could be costlier. Many different regular software companies spend up to 40 - 50 % of development efforts on software testing [1] [2]. Compared with other regular software companies, time and money are finite and need to be allocated reasonably in software <b>startups.</b> Unreasonable allocation of time and money could lead to the failure of software <b>startups.</b> We don’t know how much software <b>startups</b> spend for testing, and few research studies have investigated the testing practices in software <b>startups.</b> Therefore, we decided to conduct an exploratory study to know about the testing practices in software <b>startups.</b> Objectives. The aim of the research is to investigate testing practices in software <b>startups.</b> In this study, we investigate software startups’ structure and how to manage their test team. The test processes and test techniques used in software <b>startups</b> have been researched. And the main testing challenges in software <b>startups</b> have been investigated as well. Methods. We mainly conducted a qualitative research for the study. We selected literature review and survey as the research method. The literature review method is used to get in-depth understanding of software testing practices in software companies. Survey is used to answer our research questions. We used interview as our data collection method. And in order to analyze data from interviews, we selected descriptive statistics method. Results. A total of 13 responses were obtained through interviews from 9 software <b>startups.</b> We got results from 9 investigated software <b>startups</b> to structure and manage their test teams. We analyzed the common steps of test processes and classified the techniques they used in the 9 software <b>startups.</b> At last, we analyzed and listed the main testing challenges that are occurred in the 9 software <b>startups.</b> Conclusions. The research objectives are fulfilled. The research questions have been answered. We got the conclusion based on 9 software <b>startups.</b> The 9 companies cannot represent all software <b>startups,</b> but we can know about test practices in software <b>startups</b> initially through the 13 interviews. We also found some differences about testing practice between 9 software <b>startups</b> and regular software companies. Our study is a primary research to explore testing practices in 9 software <b>startups,</b> we provided some data and analysis results of the 9 companies to the researchers who want to research some related area. In addition, our research could help someone who plans to set up a software company. They can use the data we collected to think about the testing practice in their own company. Then find out the best way to prevent and resolve the problem in testing. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{essential}} for <b>startups</b> to quickly experiment business ideas by building tangible prototypes and collecting user feedback on them. As prototyping is an inevitable part of learning for early stage software <b>startups,</b> how fast <b>startups</b> can learn depends on how fast they can prototype. Despite of the importance, {{there is a lack}} of research about prototyping in software <b>startups.</b> In this study, we aimed at understanding what are factors influencing different types of prototyping activities. We conducted a multiple case study on twenty European software <b>startups.</b> The results are two folds, firstly we propose a prototype-centric learning model in early stage software <b>startups.</b> Secondly, we identify factors occur as barriers but also facilitators for prototyping in early stage software <b>startups.</b> The factors are grouped into (1) artifacts, (2) team competence, (3) collaboration, (4) customer and (5) process dimensions. To speed up a <b>startups</b> progress at the early stage, it is important to incorporate the learning objective into a well-defined collaborative approach of prototypingComment: This is the author's version of the work.
