40|$|Summary. In the {{beginning}} of the article is defined a rational sequence of the consideration of the nature <b>of</b> the <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> a company development, included into an integrated structure. Further the article describes the following items separately: "a strategy", "a development of a company", and "an integrational structure", applying them to companies included to the integrated structure; separating them from a <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> development of an autonomous company. The article defines functions which such strategy must define, taking into consideration the nature <b>of</b> the <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> the company development, included into an integrated structure. Next, the article defines six steps which describe a sequence of development <b>of</b> the <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> the company development, included into an integrated structure. The analysis which is defined in the article allows determining a complete definition of essence <b>of</b> the <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> the company development, included into an integrated structure. The article also defines a place <b>of</b> the <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> development into the hierarchical structure <b>of</b> the <b>strategies.</b> The <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> the company development, included into an integrated structure (as well as the <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> development of an autonomous company) [...] is a competition strategy, and it separates "strategy of leadership for costs", “differentiation strategy”, and “strategy of focusing for costs”. Also authors are analyzed the <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> the cost optimization. According to the complex definition <b>of</b> the <b>strategy,</b> and the strategy's place inside the hierarchical structure, the article defines functions which corporate, competitive, and functional strategies execute during the management of companies inside an integrational structure. The article presents characteristics of applied strategic decisions at different levels of all three types <b>of</b> <b>strategies.</b> The article's researches allow companies included to the integrated structure define their place inside the integration structure, and a character of communication with the direction of this structure during the process development and implementation <b>of</b> their own <b>strategy...</b>|$|R

Semelparity is also known to occur in some eels and smelts. The majority of teleost species have iteroparity, where mature individuals can breed multiple times during their lives.|$|E
