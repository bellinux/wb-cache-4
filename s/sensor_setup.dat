40|$|Recent {{advances}} in robotics and mechatronics enable {{the design of}} robotic devices with an increasing market potential, but the introduction to man’s everyday environment {{is still a long}} way to go. Following this path, currently an anthropomorphic Hand-Arm system is developed at DLR. Its desired small size and the mechatronic integration result in little designed space, preventing the application of “classical” sensor systems such as 6 DoF load cells. Following the anthropomorphic design approach pursued in the design of the Hand-Arm system, a bio-inspired <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> is desired. Therefore this study aims at the development of a suitable <b>sensor</b> <b>setup.</b> As a result of the literature research on dextrous manipulation, robotic handhardware and tactile sensors, piezoresistivity has been chosen as transduction principle. For the derivation of the bio-inspired <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> the general requirements for valuable tactile sensors and the special requirements resulting form the anthropomorphic design approach are assessed. Hence a consistency matrix is applied to evaluate the requirements and to identify possible conflicts of goals between the requirements. To solve the conflicts of goals, the following bionic method is applied: First the the technical challenge is abstracted, secondly the equivalent functionality in human tactile perception is analyzed and the functional principle, i. e., nature’s strategy is abstracted. Where applicable, the functional principle is propagated to a technical system. Following possible technical approaches are derived. Finally, the proposed approaches are assessed using a rating matrix. Thus the the most promising approaches are identified and combined to a bioinspired <b>sensor</b> <b>setup.</b> The proposed bio-inspired <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> consists of a “dermal” and a superficial sensor which are arranged in different layers of an artificial skin. While the “dermal” sensor is based on metal readout wires cast into a compliant piezoresisitive material, the superficial sensor is designed as a strain sensitive layer covering the “dermal” sensor. For the investigation of the proposed sensor principles a modular testbed has been designed and realized within this study. In its current version the testbed allows for automated testing of a testpatch under a pre-set force or indentation depth. For the evaluation of different sensor materials, testpatches have been manufactured and examined on the testbed and with a tensile testing machine. Based on the results of these tests, a particularly suitable piezoresistive silicone has been selected for the further development of the tactile sensor. During the development of the “dermal” sensor the conducted tests revealed an optimization challenge concerning good piezoresistive behavior, high compliance, and good adhesion to the cast-in metal wires. As the means of optimization are in conflict the proposed principle for the “dermal” sensor could not be proven. Although the combination with metal wires is not applicable, the evaluated silicone shows very promising properties, being well-suited for the superficial sensor. Based on the results of the experiments for the “dermal” sensor, a new transduction principle for the superficial strain sensor was developed and patented. Applying the afore investigated materials, a prototype of the superficial sensor could be realized. In a first set of tests the sensor prototype showed an exponential correlation between the applied force and the measurable resistance, and could easily be linearized with a logarithmic amplifier. As the sensor principle for the superficial strain sensor could be proven, continuative studies will deal with the redesign of the “dermal” sensor and the propagation of the bio-inspired <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> to the anthropomorphic fingertip...|$|E

40|$|In {{the elderly}} population, falls {{are one of}} the major causes of injuries. Fall {{detection}} algorithms for wearable devices in the literature were found to focus on differentiating Activities of Daily Living (ADL) from falls, rather than on early fall detection and prevention before impact. This thesis work was aimed at providing accurate estimates of human motion parameters like translational velocities of the center of mass, so as to aid early fall detection algorithms in the future. An algorithm which fuses visual and inertial data obtained from a <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> consisting of a pair of cameras and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was developed. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework was used for sensor data fusion. A neural network was trained to map motions of interesting points or features obtained from image processing, to actual motion of the <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> attached to the hip of a person. This neural network provided the correction term to the EKF in the form of 3 dimensional(3 D) translational velocities which is an important motion parameter for the detection of falls. First, this algorithm was trained and tested for hand-held <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> motions. Acceptable velocity tracking was observed for slow motions. Then the algorithm was trained and tested on motions of a test subject. The accuracy of estimation of 3 D translation velocities and in particular the vertical component of the 3 D velocity was studied for two distinct sets of activities or motions namely the walking motion and the sitting down/standing up motion. It is shown that the combination of the EKF and the neural network is capable of reacting and tracking the velocities for the sitting down/standing up motion.

40|$|Abstract. Optical {{metrology}} {{has been}} widely used in quality inspection. However, the <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> during part inspection is often done in an ad hoc way. This leads to unnecessarily high signal dynamic range. Consequently, optical sensors do not have sufficient light dynamic range capabilities especially for shiny surface measurement. We present a computational approach for optimal <b>sensor</b> <b>setup</b> {{that takes into account}} the sensor/part interaction to decrease signal dynamic range and to increase model coverage for structured light or similar optical inspection systems. First, we transform the signal dynamic range issue into a distance problem in a spherical map. We then present novel algorithms on the spherical map to search a near-optimal sensor orientation. Based on this nearoptimal orientation, we use a gradient method to obtain the free-optimal solution that gives the lowest possible dynamic range. Experimental results demonstrated that under the optimal orientation, there is lower signal dynamic range and better model coverage. Future work on extending this method to multiple sensor planning, sensor design, and stage design for large part inspection is also discussed. © 2003 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

For a widespread use of activity recognition systems, such an opportunistic approach is better suited than a fixed and application-specific deployment of sensor systems, as it unburdens the user from placing specific sensors at predefined locations on his body. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of an interaction model for the self-organization of sensor nodes, which enables a cooperative recognition of activities according to the demands of a user’s mobile device. We implemented it with an embedded system platform, and conducted an evaluation showing the feasibility and performance of our approach. ...|$|R
