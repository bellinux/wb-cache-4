50|$|Conventional SiC, or {{sometimes}} the less expensive SiSiC, {{have been used}} successfully for more than 25 years in slide or journal bearings of pumps. The pumped liquid itself provides the lubricant for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low friction coefficients are {{the basis of this}} success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, <b>shrink-fitted</b> in its metallic environment, and a rotating shaft sleeve, mounted on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC shaft sleeve does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100-350 mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance - for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as a shaft sleeve material has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with a shaft sleeve made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80 °C as lubricant.The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in W/mm2 and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.|$|E
40|$|First, back-up rolls {{for rolling}} require toughness, {{particularly}} in the shaft portion, and high-hardness in the sleeve portion. The back-up rolls are classified into two types; one is a single-solid type, {{and the other is}} a <b>shrink-fitted</b> construction type consisting of a sleeve and an arbor. The shrink- fitted back up roll has several advantages, for example, different materials can be chosen and the arbor can be reused by replacing the damaged sleeve. Therefore, the <b>shrink-fitted</b> back-up rolls are economical. However, residual deflection becomes a major problem for the <b>shrink-fitted</b> back-up roll. Elucidating the mechanism of the occurrence of residual deflection and devising countermeasures are important issues. Unfortunately conducting a real experiment is difficult because of much time and huge cost. In this paper, we reproduce this phenomenon by elastic FEM analysis, establish a simulation method, and elucidate the mechanism behind underlying residual deflection...|$|E

Analysis of combined effect of autofrettage and <b>shrink-fit</b> in multi-layeredvessel is carried out. Possible sequences of assembly of autofrettage and <b>shrink-fit</b> in multilayered vessel have been discussed and effective sequence has been sorted out.

Optimization of thickness of each vessel for 3 -layered vessel, percentage of autofrettage and amount of radial <b>shrink-fit</b> is carried out for all the possible sequences {{with the help of}} Genetic Algorithm. While performing optimization, thickness of each layers, autofrettage percentage and radial interference for <b>shrink-fit</b> is considered as design variables, whereas hoop stress throughout the thickness isobjective function.

40|$|Leafs of bascule bridges are {{constructed}} by fitting a trunnion and hub {{into the main}} girder (Figure 1). There are two distinct ways the trunnion-hub-girder (THG) assembly can be fabricated: · The trunnion is first <b>shrink-fit</b> into the hub and then the trunnion-hub assembly is <b>shrink-fit</b> into the main girder. · The hub is first <b>shrink-fit</b> into the main girder and then the trunnion is <b>shrink-fit</b> into the hub-girder assembly. Each of these methods has been used throughout the United States {{on the construction of}} Bascule Bridges. Using the first method mentioned above, cracking failure of the hubs of trunnion assemblies occurred during the assembly of three bridges in the state of Florida.

The results from the finite element simulations demonstrated that modifications to the deep hole drilling method were required to account for plastic relaxation during the measurement process.

40|$|Fretting {{tests are}} usually {{performed}} on flat specimens with lateral contacting pads. The <b>shrink-fitted</b> connection, which experiences fretting {{at the edge}} of the contact, prompted the alternative use of a round-shaped specimen. This simplified the equipment and provided an accurate alignment between the fretting specimen and the external hub which plays the role of the pad. The deep rolling treatment can also be efficiently applied to a round shape, which would otherwise be difficult on the flat specimen geometry. After introducing this solution for fretting testing, the paper shows an experimental campaign on three <b>shrink-fitted</b> connections with different sizes and material combinations. There was a significant improvement in fretting fatigue strength, induced by the deep rolling, for all three specimen types. Finally, scanning electron microscopic analyses provided insights into the fretting fatigue nucleation mechanisms both for untreated and deep-rolled specimens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—RTL design {{complexity}} discouraged {{adoption of}} reconfigurable logic in general purpose systems, impeding opportunities for performance and energy improvements [1]. Recent improvements to HLS compilers simplify RTL design and are easing this barrier. A new challenge will emerge: managing reconfigurable resources between multiple applications with custom hardware designs. In this paper, we propose {{a method to}} “shrink-fit ” accelerators within widely varying fabric budgets. <b>Shrink-fit</b> automatically shrinks existing accelerator designs within small fabric budgets and grows designs to increase performance when larger budgets are available. Our method takes advantage of current accelerator design techniques and introduces a novel architectural approach based on fine-grained virtualization. We evaluate <b>shrink-fit</b> using a synthesized implementation of an IDCT for decoding JPEGs and show the IDCT accelerator can shrink {{by a factor of}} 16 x with minimal performance and area overheads.

40|$|When {{components}} such as bearings or gears are pressed onto a shaft, {{the resulting}} interference induces a pressure at the interface. The {{size of this}} pressure is important as many components fail because fatigue initiates from press-fit stress concentrations. The aim of the present work was to develop ultrasound {{as a tool for}} non-destructive determination of press-fit contact pressures. An interference fit interface behaves like a spring. If the pressure is high, there are few air gaps, so it is very stiff and allows transmission of an ultrasonic wave. If the pressure is low, then interface stiffness is lower and most ultrasound is reflected. A spring model was used to determine maps of contact stiffness from interference-fit ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure was then used to determine the pressure. The interface contact pressure has been determined for a number of different press- and <b>shrink-fit</b> cases. The results show a central region of approximately uniform pressure with edge stress at the contact sides. The magnitude of the pressure in the central region agrees well with the elastic Lamé analysis. In the more severe press-fit cases, the surfaces scuffed which led to anomalies in the reflected ultrasound. These anomalies were associated with regions of surface damage at the interface. The average contact pressure in a <b>shrink-fit</b> and press-fit joint were similar. However, in the <b>shrink-fit</b> joint more uneven contact pressure was observed with regions of poor conformity. This could be because the action of pressing on a sleeve plastically smooths out long wavelength roughness, leading to a more conforming surface...|$|R

At deep interior points the classical plane strain (Lamé) solution obtains, and the transition to the free surface state is found. It is found that a residual interfacial axial shear develops and the coefficient of friction needed to ensure adhesion along the interface is found.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{work has}} {{examined}} the mechanical behaviour of <b>shrink-fitted</b> shafts. It was postulated that a zone of slip develops at {{the surface of the}} socket/substrate interface and advances monotonically with increasing torque. It was also suggested that under cyclic loading conditions, frictional shakedown could occur. This means the assembly can support more torque before slip takes place at the surface than originally thought due to the generation of beneficial residual stresses. This was all considered in a half-space formulation. In this paper, calculations are extended to a finite sized shrink-fit, whose dimensions are prescribed by ISO standards, by using a hybrid dislocation/boundary element formulation. Comparisons are then made with a series of experiments which recorded both the torque-angular displacement response of the assemblies and the failure torque for repeated load cycles...|$|E

In this paper, optimization of thickness of each layer in multilayer vessel is carried out by Genetic Algorithm and then stressdistribution is analyzed under optimum <b>shrink-fit</b> condition.

40|$|Abstract — Internal fluid {{pressure}} when {{approaches to the}} yield stress of the material used for cylinder, it leads to the infinite thickness of the cylinder.

40|$|A {{bascule bridge}} {{is a type}} of movable bridge that can be opened or closed to {{facilitate}} the movement of water-borne traffic such as ships and yachts. Trunnion-Hub-Girder (THG) assembly plays a role as a fulcrum in the bascule bridge. To make the fulcrum, the trunnion is <b>shrink-fitted</b> into the hub, and then the trunnion-hub assembly is <b>shrink-fitted</b> into the girder. Hundreds of thousands of dollars could be lost due to failures during this step. Crack formations in the hubs of various Florida bascule bridges during assembly led the Florida Department of Transportation to commission a project with USF professors to investigate. Finite elements method (ANSYS package) is employed to model the THG assembly procedure and solve for the critical crack length and critical stress in this transient thermal structural problem. Design of experiments (DOE) is used with different cooling processes and the geometrical dimensions of the THG assembly to find the sensitivity of these parameters on the outputs. The influence of the hub outer diameter and the radial interference (between the trunnion and hub) is at different levels on the critical crack length and the stress ratio as it is dependent on fulcrum geometry. If we include four staged cooling methods as follow Type 1 : liquid nitrogen Type 2 : dry-ice/ alcohol bath followed by liquid nitrogen Type 3 : refrigerated air chamber followed by liquid nitrogen Type 4 : refrigerated air chamber followed by dry-ice/alcohol bath and then by liquid nitrogenthe cooling type factor contributes the most to both critical crack length (up to 79 %) and the stress ratio (up to 84 %) in the TH assembling procedures in all three considered bascule bridges. The staged cooling procedure type 2, which is, immersing the TH assembly into the dry ice medium, followed by immersing the TH set into the liquid nitrogen, give larger critical crack length (up to 400 %) and stress ratio (up to 87 %) compared to the case that used only liquid nitrogen...|$|E

A Hertzian cylinder-on-flat contact geometry is commonly assumed for this groove-nub contact due to the ready availability of the contact (normal and tangential) analytical solutions for this geometry.

Comparative experiments showed a notable strength improvement, induced by deep rolling, along with the beneficial effect of friction reduction due to lubrication.

40|$|At many {{drilling}} {{sites for}} oil production {{the use of}} high strength aluminum alloy for the drill string can be preferable than steel, due to its better strength to weight ratio, lower stiffness and higher corrosion resistance.

Moreover, influence of mechanical and heat surface treatment (shot peening and induction hardening) on {{the endurance}} limit is investigated experimentally. By means of the FE-Analyses the influence of static pre-stress in circumferential groove due to interference fit on fatigue limit is determinated.

30|$|Glued {{mortise and tenon}} joints {{are often}} used in joints for {{furniture}} such as chairs. However, such joints are not sufficiently resistant to withdrawal forces {{because of the difficulty}} of applying a clamping pressure to the surfaces being glued. Therefore, some reinforcement, {{such as the use of}} dowel-type fasteners, is necessary. In this study, we discussed the applicability of the shrink-fit method used in green woodworking to strengthen glued round mortise and tenon joints. The test specimens were assembled using wet mortise members and air-dried tenon members with polyvinyl acetate resin emulsion adhesive. Withdrawal tests on joint specimens of four hardwood species were conducted to study the reinforcing effects of the shrink fit on the withdrawal performance of the mortise and tenon joints. The proposed <b>shrink-fitted</b> glued round mortise and tenon joint exhibited sufficient withdrawal strength equivalent to that of the joint glued with epoxy resin adhesive. After applying four humidity cycles to simulate seasonal variations in moisture content, withdrawal strength did not decrease significantly.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the optimum design for minimization of thickness of three-layer <b>shrink-fitted</b> compound cylinder to get equal maximum hoop stresses {{in all the}} cylinders. In the shrink-fitting problems, considering long hollow cylinders, the plane strain hypothesis {{can be regarded as}} more natural. Generally, hoop stress distribution across the wall of thick cylinder is non-linear in nature from inner to outer radius of the cylinder. The stresses reduce sharply towards the outer radius. Material is not utilized properly giving unnecessary more thickness. Hence two or more cylinders can be compounded by shrinkage process where outer cylinder is heated until it will slide freely over inner cylinder thus exerting the required contact pressure on cooling. As a result of shrinking, stress redistribution occurs across the wall of the compound cylinder and reduces the hoop stress and makes it more or less uniform over the thickness. In this paper effort is made to find optimum minimum thicknesses of three cylinders so that material volume is reduced and hoop stress is equal in all the cylinders. The analytical results of optimum design calculated with computer programming are validated in comparison with Finite Element Analysis in ANSYS Workbench. Both the results agree with each other. Hence this methodology can be applied for real-world mechanical applications of multi-layer compound cylinders...|$|E
40|$|To model {{shrink-fitting}} {{in metal}} components, an analytical model for two long compound cylinders with temperature dependent material properties and interference {{between them is}} developed for calculating transient temperatures and stresses. A finite element model is developed for the same geometry which incorporated the temperature dependent material properties. A convergence study is performed on the finite element and analytical model. The finite element model is validated by comparing the approximations of finite element model with the analytical solution. In an assembly procedure of fulcrums for bascule bridges, called AP 1, the trunnion is <b>shrink-fitted</b> into a hub, followed by shrink fitting the trunnion-hub assembly into the girder of the bridge. In another assembly procedure called AP 2, the hub is <b>shrink-fitted</b> into the girder, followed by shrink-fitting the trunnion in the hub-girder assembly. A formal design of experiments (DOE) study is conducted on both AP 1 and AP 2 using the finite element model to find the influence of geometrical parameters such as radial thickness of the hub, radial interference, and various shrink-fitting methods on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length (OMCCL) - a measure of likelihood of failure by cracking. Using the results of DOE study conducted on both the assembly procedures, AP 1 and AP 2 are quantitatively compared for the likelihood of fracture during assembly. For single-staged shrink-fitting methods, for high and low hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio, assembly procedure AP 1 and AP 2 are recommended, respectively. For fulcra with low hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, for AP 2, cooling the trunnion in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder, and for AP 1, cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen is recommended. For fulcra with high hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, cooling the components in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder is recommended for both AP 1 and AP 2. Due to the limitations of AP 2, assembly procedures by heating the girder with heating coils instead of dipping an already stressed trunnion-hub assembly in liquid nitrogen are studied for decreasing the likelihood of failure by cracking and yielding. In an assembly procedure called AP 3 -A, only the girder is heated to shrink-fit the trunnion-hub assembly in the girder. This assembly procedure AP 3 -A {{is found to be}} infeasible because the girder fails by yielding if heating is expected to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An alternative assembly procedure called AP 3 -B is suggested for shrink-fitting where the heating of the girder is combined with cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture. This assembly procedure AP 3 -B is found to be feasible. A complete DOE study is conducted on AP 3 -B to find the influence of parameters like hub radial thickness and radial interference at trunnion-hub interface on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length. The design parameter, OMCCL values during the assembly procedure AP 3 -B are quantitatively compared with the widely used assembly procedures (AP 1 single-stage shrink-fitting and AP 1 multi-staged shrink fitting). The results of this work suggest that increasing the hub radial thickness decreases the likelihood of fracture significantly. For hubs with large radial thickness, heating the girder combined with cooling the trunnion-hub in dry-ice/alcohol mixture (AP 3 -B) is recommended but for hubs with low radial thickness, multistage cooling of the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture followed by dipping in liquid nitrogen (AP 1 - multistage cooling) is recommended...|$|E
