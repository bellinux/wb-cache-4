5|$|Following {{the eighth}} season of The X-Files, David Duchovny {{announced}} that he would be completely leaving the show. As such, the future of the show was up in the air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season.

Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter.

Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002; she specifically stated that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the show following the conclusion of the season.

On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so {{that she had the}} opportunity to receive an education.

While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton.
