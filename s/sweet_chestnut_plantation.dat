40|$|During suweys made in {{the main}} <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> growing regions in Hungary we {{observed}} {{that one of the}} most serious "adversaries" of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees is chestnut blight caused by Cryphonectria parasitica. Our main goals were to survey the plant health status of the Hungarian <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> stands, with special attention lo chestnut blight, and to implement a biological control method against chestnut blight based on hypovirulent strains of C. parasitica. The virulence of the strains was characterised by different laboratory tests: morphological examination, virulence test, phenol oxidase test, dsRNA exhaction, VCG test and artificial inoculation were performed on experimental plot...|$|R

40|$|In Britain, where <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> is {{classified}} as an archaeophyte of Roman introduction, there are many ancient <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees and woodlands significant for conservation, yet no dendrochronological assessment {{has been made of}} them. This paper describes an attempt to assess the dendrochronological potential of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood. Eight <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees (veteran trees in parkland and mature trees and coppice-grown stems in woodland) from five sites in western England were sampled by coring living wood and by cutting sections in fallen dead wood, to enable microscopic analysis of growth ring parameters. Four trees from three sites were cross-matched to form a 295 -year chronology from AD 1716 to AD 2011. The annual resolution of the chronology was confirmed by regional cross-dating with oak reference chronologies. The ages for these chestnut trees range from circa AD 1668 to AD 1940. It is concluded that oak reference chronologies can be used to date <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood, with benefits for archaeological, historic building and palaeoenvironmental assessments. The extraction of sawn sections from dead veteran trees and their dendrochronological analysis indicates a more reliable and benign approach to dating ancient trees in historic landscapes compared with coring...|$|R

50|$|The Romans brought {{familiar}} {{species of}} tree {{with them to}} Germania from the Mediterranean region; these included <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> (Castanea sativa), horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) and walnut (Juglans regia).

40|$|In the {{establishment}} of mixed plantations, {{it is necessary to}} examine previously the relations of the principal and the admixed species and the most significant pests. This paper presents {{the results of the study}} of the gypsy moth caterpillar preference and performance on <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> and four oak species. Preference index is the highest for Hungarian oak (0. 83) and Turkey oak (0. 77), for sessile oak it is significantly lower (0. 33), and for common oak it is equal to 0. In combination with <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut,</b> the gypsy moth second-instar caterpillars prefer Hungarian oak, i. e. Turkey oak leaves. In combination with sessile oak or common oak, the gypsy moth caterpillars prefer <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> leaves. The analyzed parameters which characterise the performance of the gypsy moth fourth-instar caterpillars are lower for all study oak species compared to <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut,</b> except in the case of Turkey oak. Based on the study results and the adopted principle that the mixture should be composed of the most favourable species, which will serve as the 'trap plant' during the gypsy moth outbreak, it can be concluded that Turkey oak is more favourable for the mixture with <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> than the other analyzed oak species...|$|R
