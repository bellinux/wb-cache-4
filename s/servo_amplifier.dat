40|$|ABSTRACT- Forward {{converter}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied topologies due to its lower ripple, lower parts count and hence high reliability.

The converter for DTG <b>servo</b> power <b>amplifier</b> had to supply the current demanded by the sensor electronics which is dynamic.

This is when distributed controls were introduced by the company. The idea of having the amplifier and servo controls in the base of the robot was named AIB (Amplifier in Base).

These navigational computations are performed with carefully designed electronic circuits {{in harmony with}} precision electromechanical components. The electronic parts are the Accelerometer Restoring Amplifier which give a voltage that {{is proportional to the}} acceleration. Ranging from micro-G's to units of G they span a very impressive dynamic range. Also the <b>Servo</b> <b>Amplifiers,</b> picking off the tiny Gyro signals and amplifying this to control the platform gimbal motors, have tight specifications. The actual integration of the accelerometer signal to a velocity signal is performed by an electronic amplifier which controls a velocity-motor which drives a capacitance tachometer. This cap-tach feedback provides the basic integrator signal since the speed of the cap-tach is proportional to acceleration input. The feedback nulls the acceleration input to stop the motor. The motor positions the velocity shaft to pick off the appropriate potentiometer signal which represents velocity. A dead zone network drives the velocity motor in steps which are smoothed to provide the integrated acceleration (= velocity) signal.The velocity integrators operate in a similar manner to the acceleration integrators, except that the output signal is not smoothed because the so-called M-transmitters are step-function devices. The M-transmitters send the integrated velocity (= distance) signal to the Position and Homing System PHI-4.|$|R

40|$|Summary- Suppression of the low-frequency (lf) {{components}} of the modulated data stream is a system requirement in optical recording which facilitates the usage of servo systems for reading the optical disc. Insufficient suppression of the lf {{components of}} the coded spectrum will lead to improper functioning of the servo systems, and/or acoustical noise generated by the servo systems, and/or additional power dissipation in the <b>servo</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Low-frequency components are avoided in {{state of the art}} systems such as CD and DVD by using codes, called dc-free codes, which suppress the energy in the lf range. Clearly, the more lf suppression, the more overhead in coding rate must be spent, and a sound trade-off has to be sought between proper lf suppression and coding efficiency. It has been found that lf suppression can also be improved by coding methods, which use a look-ahead (LA) algorithm that looks ahead p codewords, and evaluates, based on a suitable metric, the full search tree of 2 p possible choices of codewords in the tree. Recently, coding schemes, which use Guided Scrambling (GS) have been proposed for suppressing the lf content. It has been shown that GS schemes can achieve a lf suppression which is very close to the theoretical maximum. In this paper, we will report on a performance comparison of coding schemes based on Look-Ahead and Guided Scrambling techniques...|$|R

40|$|Filament winding is {{a process}} for the {{placement}} of reinforcement fibres on to a rotating surface in a specified geometric pattern. A conventional straight line interpolation controller is not very appropriate for filament winding because the fibre pay-out-eye is at some distance away from the mandrel surface and its movement from one point to another may disturb the position of previously laid fibre on the mandrel. Filament winding demands a controller which can produce fast and smooth carriage movements, and have a path-anticipation capability so that while moving around curves the effect of pay-out-eye movement on previous fibre positions is minimised. This problem can be overcome by using an interpolation technique which determines the pay-out-eye path by considering more than two data points, and whose profile is continuous in nature up to its second derivative. In this project an IDM PC based filament winding controller, using B-spline interpolation technique, is developed. To test {{the performance of the}} controller a 3 -axis CNC filament winding machine was designed and manufactured. For optimum performance, emphasis was given to the low inertia of the machine carriage, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the system's structural stiffness. To reduce the machine carriage weight, the DC servomotors were installed on the machine's frame, instead of the carriage, and a timing belt arrangement was used for power transmission. The controller's electronic hardware was assembled using <b>servo</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> DAC cards, and a purpose built optical encoder interface card. The controller software was developed using TURBO C++ as the main programming language, whereas the hardware interface routines were written in Assembly Language. Problems of winding path deviation as a result of B-spline approximation were tackled using knowledge based programming techniques. The results showed a considerable improvement in winding speed and less fibre slippage in the case of non-geodesic winding patterns, resulting in higher accuracy of fibre placement on the mandrel...|$|R

Increasing maintenance demands for the original analog position control system (the antenna feed, <b>servo</b> power <b>amplifiers,</b> and position compensation) coupled {{with the potential for}} substantial tracking system performance improvement and self-diagnostic capability offered by current technology led to the establishment of a new instrumentation development task at WSMR whose objective was {{the development of a new}}, almost totally digital prototype tracking system to replace the aging analog control system in one of the TTAS’s. A modern conical scan feed has replaced the original monopulse feed, pulse-width-modulated power amplifiers have replaced the originals using SCR’s, and a VMEbus-based computer using a real-time operating system has replaced the analog compensation and overall control of the system. In this paper, following an overview of the prototype tracking system, the results of the development of a new position control algorithm for the prototype tracking system are described using root loci, computer simulation, and from the actual tracking system using servo test software developed for the computer controller. The results of the study of the old analog control system using computer simulation are presented for comparison.

40|$|Industrial {{applications}} increasingly require actuators {{that offer}} a combination of high force output, large stroke and high accuracy. The ElectroHydraulic Actuator (EHA) was designed by Drs. Habibi and Goldenberg originally as a high-performance actuator for use in robotics. However, {{it was determined that}} the EHA had the potential to achieve high positional accuracy. Little research has been performed in the area of high-accuracy hydraulic positioning systems. Therefore, the objective of this study to achieve nano-scale positional accuracy with the EHA while maintaining large stroke and high force output. It was planned to achieve this objective through modification of the prototype EHA and the use of fuzzy control. During this research project, both hardware and control system modifications to the EHA were performed. A high-precision optical encoder position sensor with a 50 nm resolution was mounted on the inertial load to directly measure the position of the load. A number of device drivers were written to interface the MATLAB real-time control environment with the optical encoder and <b>servo</b> motor <b>amplifier.</b> A Sugeno-inference fuzzy controller was designed and implemented in MATLAB. For comparison purposes, a switched-gain controller and a proportional controller were also implemented in the control environment. The performance of the fuzzy controller was compared to the switched-gain controller and the proportional controller in a number of tests. First, the regulatory and tracking performance of the EHA with an inertial load of 20 kg was examined. It was determined in the regulatory tests that the positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was excellent, achieving a steady state error of 50 ± 25 nm or less for step inputs in the range 5 cm to 200 nm. The positional accuracy during the tracking tests was found to be reduced compared to the regulatory tests since the actuator did not have sufficient time to settle to final accuracy due to the timevarying input signals. In all cases, {{it was found that the}} positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was significantly greater than with the switched-gain and proportional controllers for both regulatory and tracking signals. Testing with the inertial load eliminated or changed was not performed because the position sensor was mounted to the load, making it unfeasible to alter the load during the time frame of this study. The regulatory and tracking performance of the EHA with an inertial load of 20 kg plus external resistive loads of 90 to 280 N were investigated. It was found that the positional accuracy of the EHA decreased with the application of an external load to 3. 10 ± 0. 835 µm for a 1 cm step input (90 N load) and 8. 45 ± 0. 400 µm for a 3 cm step input (280 N load). Again, the positional accuracy of the EHA decreased during the tracking tests relative to the regulatory tests, for the reason stated above. This implies that the positional accuracy of the EHA with a resistive load is in the microscale, rather than the nano-scale as was put forth as the objective of this study. Nevertheless, the positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was found to be significantly greater than with the switched-gain and proportional controllers. It is postulated that the increase in positional error observed during the external load tests was due to an increase in cross-port leakage, relative to the inertial load tests, caused by the pressure differential induced across the actuator by the external load. Methods of reducing the increase in positional error caused by external loads on the EHA remains an area for future study...|$|R
