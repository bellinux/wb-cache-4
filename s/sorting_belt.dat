40|$|This {{research}} was to establish sorting machine for melon fruit to replace the traditional manpower grading operations to decrease {{the costs of the}} production. It was to achieve the fast and accurate grading operation so as to increase the melon purchasing price and raise the farmer's income. This research first applied the image processing technique to investigate the basic physical characteristics of the melon. The results studied showed that the correlation with the shape size and weight of the melon was not high. Therefore, a shape sorting mechanism was designed for the farmer. The multi-plane hole <b>belt</b> <b>sorting</b> machine was combined together with the parts of the cargo desk, the choosing fruit desk, the washing and supplying unit, and the sorting mechanism. The clean ratio of the multi-plane hole <b>belt</b> <b>sorting</b> machine by this {{research was}} well and the average grading accuracy then obtained of the whole testing cases could be raised up to 98. 7 %. The processing capacity of the system was reached up to about 4219. 3 kg per hour which was 1. 99, 1. 8 and 2. 48 times, respectively as compared to the system obtained with the single-rail weight sorting mechanism, drum hole sorting mechanism and single-row hole <b>belt</b> <b>sorting</b> machine. Moreover, the newly developed multi-plane hole <b>belt</b> <b>sorting</b> machine also held the lower operation cost than the single-rail weight sorting mechanism, drum hole sorting mechanism and single-row hole <b>belt</b> <b>sorting</b> machine. It could save tremendous labor power and processing cost as required in the grading operation of the melon. 本研究之主要目的為設計製造一台香瓜分級機，期能取代傳統人工分級作業，降低生產成本，並能精確且快速完成分級作業，提高香瓜之收購價格，以增加果農收益。 本研究先行以影像處理等方式來進行香瓜基礎物性調查，結果顯示香瓜外形與重量之相關性不高，因應果農需求故設計一套以外形為選別機制之分級機，平面多排圓孔皮帶式分級機係由包含集貨臺、選果臺、進料清洗機構、分級機構等所組成。 本研究所研發之平面多排圓孔皮帶式分級機其清潔率效果良好，損傷試驗無明顯損傷，平均分級準確率可達 92. 3 %，分級作業量每小時約 4219. 3 公斤，為單排側放式重量分級機、圓孔轉筒式分級機、單排圓孔皮帶式分級機 1. 99 、 1. 8 及 2. 48 倍；且平面多排圓孔皮帶式分級機分級作業成本，亦低於單排側放式重量分級機、圓孔轉筒式分級機、單排圓孔皮帶式分級機，故使用平面多排圓孔皮帶式分級機可節省相當之人力與成本。誌謝辭	i 摘要	ii Abstract	iii 目錄	iv 表目錄	vii 圖目錄	viii 符號表	ix 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻探討	 4 2 - 1 分級目的	 4 2 - 2 基本物性量測	 6 2 - 3 影像處理	 9 2 - 3 - 1 數位影像	 9 2 - 3 - 2 二值化	 9 2 - 3 - 3 斷開與閉合	 11 2 - 3 - 4 消除雜訊	 11 2 - 3 - 5 影像處理應用	 12 2 - 4 現有之清洗機構	 15 2 - 5 現有分級機及分級方式	 16 2 - 5 - 1 按尺寸分級的分級機	 16 2 - 5 - 2 按重量分級的分級機	 17 2 - 5 - 3 按色澤分級(光電選別) 的分級機	 18 第三章 材料與方法	 20 3 - 1 實驗材料	 20 3 - 2 實驗設備	 21 3 - 2 - 1 影像處理系統實驗設備	 21 3 - 2 - 2 香瓜分級機實驗設備	 23 3 - 3 實驗方法	 28 3 - 3 - 1 影像處理分析	 28 3 - 3 - 2 香瓜基礎物性量測試驗	 30 3 - 3 - 3 分級清潔率試驗	 30 3 - 3 - 4 分級準確率試驗	 31 3 - 3 - 5 分級損傷試驗	 33 3 - 3 - 6 分級機耐久性試驗	 34 3 - 3 - 7 分級作業能力試驗	 34 3 - 3 - 8 成本效益分析	 34 3 - 3 - 9 一貫化香瓜分級機作業測試	 34 第四章 結果與討論	 35 4 - 1 影像處理分析	 35 4 - 2 物性分析	 37 4 - 3 分級清潔率試驗	 40 4 - 4 分級準確率試驗	 42 4 - 5 分級損傷試驗	 48 4 - 6 分級耐久性試驗	 50 4 - 7 分級作業能力試驗	 51 4 - 8 成本效益分析	 53 4 - 9 一貫化香瓜分級機作業測試	 55 第五章 結論與建議	 56 5 - 1 結論	 56 5 - 2 建議	 59 第六章 參考文獻	 6...|$|R

Belt sorters stabilize product on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect product on the belt from the top only while others also launch product off the belt for in-air inspection from the bottom. Belt sorters can be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or can be equipped with two ejector systems and three outfeed streams to achieve three-way sorting.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays the {{composting}} process has shown itself to be an alternative {{in the treatment of}} municipal solid wastes by composting plants. However, although more than 50 % of the waste generated by the Brazilian population is composed of matter susceptible to organic composting, this process is, still today, insufficiently developed in Brazil, due to low compost quality and lack of investments in the sector. The objective of this work was to use physical analyses to evaluate the quality of the compost produced at 14 operative composting plants in the Sao Paulo State in Brazil. For this purpose, size distribution and total inert content tests were done. The results were analyzed by grouping the plants according to their productive processes: plants with a rotating drum, plants with shredders or mills, and plants without treatment after the <b>sorting</b> conveyor <b>belt.</b> Compost quality was analyzed considering the limits imposed by the Brazilian Legislation and the European standards for inert contents. The size distribution tests showed the influence of the machinery after the sorting conveyer on the granule sizes as well as the inert content, which contributes to the presence of materials that reduce the quality of the final produc...|$|R
50|$|The miner's apron (Arschleder, Bergleder or Fahrleder) {{is part of}} the {{clothing}} worn, especially historically, by miners in the mining industries of German-speaking Europe. Variously called in English a miner's apron, a miner's after-apron, breech leather or miner's leather apron, it was a leather apron that served to keep the seat of the trousers from wearing out when working or moving around the mine (Fahrung) as well as keeping out the cold and moisture when sitting. It also provided protection especially when entering inclined mineshafts. Another advantage was that it stabilised the internal organs from mechanical shock and vibration by acting as a <b>sort</b> of kidney <b>belt.</b> The miner's apron was a triangular or, more rarely, semi-circular piece of leather and was supported by the body belt. In Germany the design of the modern miner's apron is governed by DIN standard 23307 Gesäßleder für den Bergbau (Arschleder).|$|R

40|$|The {{main problem}} on {{sorting out the}} wood logs in {{traditional}} wood industry was that the process should be done manually. Hence, it required an automated system to perform sorting process with a higher precision level. The purpose {{of this research was}} to create a simulation of automated wood log sorting process based on specified length and thickness.  The sorting system consisted of AT 89 C 51 microcontroller system, keypad (in order to enter the required value of length and thickness), LCD (in order to display the result of <b>sorting</b> process), conveyor <b>belt,</b> two pairs of light sensor (consisting of photodiode and LED, each), and three DC motors which were driven by five relay circuits.  At the beginning of sorting process, an operator was to type the selection range (i. e. the minimum and maximum value of required length and thickness) via the keypad provided. The wood log mounted on conveyor belt would be measured by light sensors to determine the value of length and thickness. Based on the values, AT 89 C 51 microcontroller system would then compare them to the selection range. If the log being sorted out fulfilled the requirements, it would be directed to "Accepted" compartment, or else to "Rejected" one.  From the test performed, it was concluded that the length measurement was more precise for short logs.  While the error rate was much higher for thin logs on thickness measurement. The process of sorting out and counting the wood logs was performed successfully.  The system could use the narrowing mechanism at the mounting part of conveyor belt and better supporting ace on thickness sensor, in order to minimize the error rate on length and thickness measurement, respectively. In addition, the system could be developed to measure the volume of an object, providing that the object being measured was having a square or full-circle cross-sectional area...|$|R
40|$|Introduction What {{is local}} content? According to Abdul Waheed Khan, in his paper {{presented}} in a UNESCO and World Summit on the Information Society, 2 ̆ 2 Local content is an expression and communication of a community 2 ̆ 7 s locally generated, owned and adapted knowledge and experience that is relevant to the community 2 ̆ 7 s situation 2 ̆ 2. Bhattacharjee (2001) says that local content is generally defined as a work which is produced under the creative control of nationals of the country. Meanwhile, the economist definition of local content {{is that it is}} the proportion of input which comes from the country itself, as opposed to those imported. Observing that the term 2 ̆ 2 local content 2 ̆ 2 simply refers to indigenous production of anything, the objectives of this paper are; 1. To review the importance of local content in the context of knowledge. 2. To suggest the role to be played by Nigerian university libraries in developing local content emanating from the university communities. 3. To suggest roles to be played by university libraries in the attempt to publish local content originating from Nigerian university communities to the global world. Literature Review Local content is important for national development. It is a product that nations, countries and communities should seize before the end of next decade. The educational, social, economic, political, and religious despondence of today 2 ̆ 7 s society is highly related to the reliance of man on non-local content, leaving the often rich, compactable and prized native produce to die slowly without reference to it. This was the ugly observation of several world organizations and scholars around the globe, which resulted in the copious summons to all countries of the world, especially the African countries that are yet to discover the value of their locally generated information, to ensure organization, dissemination and application of the same information in all facets of life 2 ̆ 7 s activities. On Thursday, April 22, 2010, the Nigerian local content bill was signed into law by President Goodluck Jonathan while in acting capacity. Since then, Nigeria 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of the gains and future of the law is barely narrowed to the economic sector, largely concerned with the empowerment of Nigerian nationals in the country 2 ̆ 7 s oil and gas industry, arousing little or no consciousness in other sectors like information, which is the power of western nations. The strength, extremes and all-sector importance of the law is not yet understood by Nigerians. Maybe, that President Jonathan and Nigerians, judging by few comments, are happy that this new law will help provide domestic jobs to Nigeria 2 ̆ 7 s 140 million citizens, is a representation of how narrowed they have placed the importance of the law. It is no doubt however, that Nigerians may be happier when they shall see and comprehend the benefits of the law in the information milieu (Edemhanria, 2010). Local content also sharpen government and private enterprises. The studies of Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz (2001); Duran-Romero (2003); Ondategui (2001) and European Union Reports (2002, 2006) reveal the positive result of employing university content (thesis, dissertations, etc.) to production by government and private enterprises in Europe. The application of local research knowledge to manufacturing, engineering, business and other services can be of immense advantage to a community 2 ̆ 7 s economic growth. Universities furnish qualified and mobile human resources, researchers and/or students, whose services can be enlisted by the corporate world, with appropriate information. Moreso, local content provision {{is an integral part of}} the development process of local communities. A library with content of local relevance will encourage communities to make use of the library services, especially if they are empowered to participate in development of the content. Greyling and Zulu (2010) opines that low local content on the Web inhibits buy-in from local communities into digital resources and thereby inhibit development of digital skills. According to the 1998 / 99 World Development Report, knowledge, not capital, is the key to sustainable social and economic development. Building on local knowledge, the basic component of any country 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge system, is the first step to mobilize such capital. Moreover, there is a growing consensus that knowledge exchange must be a two way street. Stiglitz (1998) opines that the vision of knowledge transfer as a <b>sort</b> of conveyor <b>belt</b> moving in one direction from the rich, industrialized countries, to the poor and developing ones, is likely to lead to failure and resentment. Therefore, development activities, especially those that aim to benefit the local communities directly, need to consider local knowledge in the design and implementation stages of the process. In addition, local contents are not only very important to a country 2 ̆ 7 s national development, growth and global relevance alone, but also contribute to open access actualization. UNESCO (n. d) maintains that access to knowledge would only be possible if information is available and accessible. If UNESCO 2 ̆ 7 s mandate on the Promotion of free flow of ideas by word and image, and the maintenance, increase and spread of knowledge must be met, local content development is vital. But this copious call may not be achieved only by enhancing information flows and providing infrastructure, until it involves encouraging knowledge creation, ensuring knowledge preservation, promoting knowledge dissemination, and enhancing knowledge utilization (UNESCO, n. d). The library and information centres should not slumber. No wonder the big question came up in the UNESCO and World Submit on Information Society, asking: 2 ̆ 2 [...] . information or knowledge societies? 2 ̆ 2 These arouse the need to create repositories in Nigerian universities and advocate for digitization of libraries if they must take their place in today 2 ̆ 7 s information, but more importantly, knowledge society. Libraries should be a good means of enhancing local content creation and, above all, ensuring its availability and accessibility. Although the importance of local content has often been raised in many international meetings and by numerous donors and cooperation agencies, concrete initiatives and expertise in this area seem to be scarce. A UNESCO paper titled the need for local content (n. d) records that, 2 ̆ 2 …content initiatives using ICTs tend to 2 ̆ 7 push 2 ̆ 7 external content towards local communities 2 ̆ 2. Comparatively, content initiatives using libraries as channels of communication should not thrust external content towards local communities, rather should provide local content for the community members 2 ̆ 7 use, wider public access and global view. Rowlee 2 ̆ 7 s (2010) study reveals that there is great importance attached to local content on the internet. Her report in business news reveals that consumers spend over forty percent of their time online, searching contents ranging from emails, community sites, commerce and other information packages on the internet. This implies that our local content can as well attract consumers who spend more money online. In addition, Robins (2002) conclude that local content creation in a community creates room for social navigation. Munro, et al. (1999) defines social navigation as: 2 ̆ 2 The creation of social settings and places in information space and behaviour in them, the sociality of information creation, people as members of groups and [the] nature of information itself, its location, evaluation and use 2 ̆ 2. Dourish (1999) deduced that the availability of local content on the web brings online researchers into a common community, where they are 2 ̆ 2 guided and instructed by the activities of others on the cyberspace 2 ̆ 2. This implies that the electronic success of libraries and information centres is related to the amount of locally generated knowledge or information emanating from the community it serves, which is available online through its server...|$|R
