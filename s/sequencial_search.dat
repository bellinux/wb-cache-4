40|$|Search {{process is}} one of {{important}} activity in data processing. Searching can take more time if conducted in the huge search space. Therefore, it is needed an efficient search technique. One technique {{that can be used}} is parallel computing. This article discusses the search process in parallel using the Boyer-Moore algorithm. Parallel scope is emulated with PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) software. From the research results, it can be concluded that the performance of parallel computing will increase the word searching compared to the computing performance for its word <b>sequencial</b> <b>search</b> consisting of one letter, and will drop to the word search consisting of two letters or more...|$|E

The productive process is described with special emphasis on online data collection and treatment. Feature selection is a two step process. The first step uses the <b>sequencial</b> forward <b>search</b> strategy with a KNN classifier as the feature quality measure and the second step uses a neural network to asses the first step selected features relevance. The feedforward neural network has one hidden layer and uses the backpropagation learning rule. The neural network topology is determined using the error rate on a validation dataset. Analysis and results from a particular die cast real data are presented. Keywords: Die Casting, On-line classification, Neural network, Feature selectio...|$|R
