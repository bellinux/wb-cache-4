An intermediate ferromagnetic pole [...] "stator" [...] is usually held stationary and used to effect the concentration of the magnetic lines of force between the high speed rotor and the low speed rotor.The ratio of High <b>speed</b> <b>to</b> <b>Low</b> Speed is the number of magnetic pole pairs on the high speed rotor to the number of magnetic pole pairs on the low speed rotor.

40|$|In this paper, {{the novel}} “tapered-Vth” {{approach}} to design energy-efficient CMOS buffers is introduced. In this approach, the substantial energy consumption due to leakage {{is reduced by}} tapering the threshold voltage throughout the buffer stages, other than tapering the transistor size. More specifically, the threshold voltage is progressively reduced when going from the last to the first stage. This enables a considerable leakage reduction in the last stages (which contribute most to the overall leakage) {{at the price of}} a higher delay. The resulting delay penalty is then compensated by reducing the transistor threshold voltage in the first stages, with an insignificant leakage increase (they contribute very little to the overall buffer leakage). Simulation results based on a commercial 45 -nm 1 -V CMOS technology show that the proposed “tapered-V_TH“ approach can considerably improve the energy efficiency of CMOS buffers over the entire spectrum of possible energy-delay tradeoffs, from high <b>speed</b> <b>to</b> <b>low</b> power...|$|E

The design methodology encompasses all aspects of circuit design; it optimizes transistor size, logic style, layout style, cell topology, and circuit design for low power operation. The cell library is implemented within the framework of the LagerIV CAD suite for rapid logic synthesis and layout generation. Several chips designed with the low power library demonstrate the power reduction that can be achieved. The entire cell library is characterized to determine typical delay, average power consumption, and area for each cell so the IC designer can make reasonable speed, area, and power estimations while still in the architecture design stage.

40|$|Mixing layers {{composed}} {{of fuel and}} oxidizer streams passing through straight channels are studied by performing two-dimensional numerical simulations. Both nonaccelerating and accelerating mixing layers are studied. In the nonaccelerating cases, the flow remains at low subsonic speed throughout the channel. In the accelerating cases, the flow accelerates from low subsonic <b>speed</b> <b>to</b> <b>low</b> supersonic speed through the channel. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} development of the mixing layers from laminar flow to the transition regime. The full Navier–Stokes equations coupled with multiple-species equations and the energy equations with chemical reactions are solved using a finite difference numerical scheme. Both forced and unforced instabilities are considered, but the use of forced disturbances is found to be not essential to this study. The reacting mixing layers with or without acceleration are more unstable than the corresponding nonreacting mixing layers in terms of the fluctuations of kinetic energy. For the reacting cases, both positive and negative vortices are produced. The positive vorticity is generated by the baroclinic effect associated with the large density gradient and is more pronounced in the reacting and accelerating case, inwhich a large pressure gradient exists. The acceleratingmixing layers show stabilizing effects, and the overall chemical conversion rate reduces due to the acceleration. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{trend in}} VLSI and system design is {{moving away from}} high <b>speed</b> <b>to</b> <b>low</b> power due to the rapid growth in the {{portable}} consumer electronics market. The technology evolution of deep submicron (DSM) {{will be able to}} manage the needs and demands of future computing world. A rapid growth of future computing have led to challenges of very deep submicron (DSM) regime. Here, the leakage power plays a major contributor to the total power dissipation involved in the circuit as the threshold voltage becomes small while we reduce the operating supply voltage. We present some techniques to reduce the power dissipation involved while interconnecting logic blocks in the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The interconnections or connectivity among logic blocks are done by routing switches. We use pass-transistor logic, transmission logic and multiplexers for the construction of these routing switches. We present a technique which has both sleep mode in which the leakage power is reduced and low-power mode in which the dynamic power is reduced. These models are built by using Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools like DSCH (Digital Schematic) and Microwind layout tools using BSIM 4 MOSFET model in 60 nm technology. Results show that the pass-transistor approach is having low power consumption. The leakage and dynamic power are also reduced by the circuit which has the programmability option to change sleep mode and low-power mode...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} theoretically the Landau-Levich problem of dip coating {{in the presence}} of a strong interaction potential normal to the substrate. This study is motivated by dip coating at very low capillary numbers when the deposited film thickness is less than 1 µm and such interaction forces become important. The objective of this work is to demonstrate that {{in the presence of}} an extra body force the solution procedure differs significantly from the classical one and leads to substantial deviations from the Landau-Levich law for the entrained film thickness. In particular, attractive potentials produce film thickening and the resulting film thickness is independent of <b>speed</b> <b>to</b> <b>lowest</b> order. Repulsive potentials bring about more complicated behavior and lead either to films whose thickness is also independent of <b>speed,</b> or <b>to</b> a modification of the leading order constant in the classical Ca^(2 / 3) law. Demonstration of these effects is given for a model potential. The analysis is generally applicable to many physical situations when there is an interaction between a coating liquid and a substrate, e. g., dip coating of ferromagnetic liquids on magnetic substrates, or dip coating of liquids carrying charges...|$|R

Because of the turning, the flow profiles are significantly altered, and the instability mechanisms are modified. Inmost cases, themixing layers with the faster and lighter air stream on the outside aremore unstable than themixing layers with the heavier and slower fuel stream on the outside. The reactingmixing layers are alwaysmore unstable than the corresponding nonreacting cases in terms of the turbulent kinetic energy. Positive and negative vorticities are generated in the reacting case by the baroclinic effect associated with the large density gradient across the combustion zone.
