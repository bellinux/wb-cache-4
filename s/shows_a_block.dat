5000|$|The {{asymptotic}} gain model (also {{known as}} the Rosenstark method) is {{a representation of the}} gain of negative feedback amplifiers given by the asymptotic gain relation:where [...] is the return ratio with the input source disabled (equal to the negative of the loop gain {{in the case of a}} single-loop system composed of unilateral blocks), G∞ is the asymptotic gain and G0 is the direct transmission term. This form for the gain can provide intuitive insight into the circuit and often is easier to derive than a direct attack on the gain.Figure 1 <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> diagram that leads to the asymptotic gain expression.

In the diagram, the “working body” (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat Q can be introduced or transmitted to produce work. Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, or air, etc. Although, in these early years, engines came {{in a number of}} configurations, typically QH was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; QC was typically supplied by a stream of cold flowing water {{in the form of a}} condenser located on a separate part of the engine. The output work W here is the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which was then typically used to turn a pulley so to lift water out of flooded salt mines. Carnot defined work as “weight lifted through a height”.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main and}} {{axis of the}} temple is set to an azimuth of about 116½° and is aligned to the winter {{solstice}} sunrise, which in our modern era occurs around the 21st or 22 December each year. The sunlight penetrates through to the rear wall of the chapel, {{before moving to the}} right to highlight one of the Osiris statutes that stand {{on either side of the}} doorway to the 2nd chamber.

5000|$|Completion of the L&Y railway in 1850 also signalled {{the start}} of a boom in the {{building}} of working class houses in Broomfields. There were at that time in Bradford no building regulations or planning control. By 1855 about 500 houses plus about 65 [...] "cellar dwellings" [...] had been built in the area north of Mill Lane between Hall Lane and the railway. Another 200 were built to the East of Hall Lane so that by 1855 a total of about 700 working class houses had been built - virtually all of them [...] "back to back". Nearly all the houses were [...] "one up and one down" [...] with shared privies. Where the slope permitted the houses had cellar dwellings built beneath them. Fig 5 <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> of this sort in Sturges Street, numbered 9-59. There were 22 one up/one down back to backs with 11 cellar dwellings underneath them The 33 dwellings shared 12 privies. Each cellar dwelling had only one room of about 115sq ft. The 1861 census reports that most of these subterranean dwellings were occupied by a family - some with a lodger. Despite many attempts by the council officials to clear out and close cellar dwellings all those in Sturges Street were still occupied {{at the time of the}} 1911 census[...]In 1854 Bradford council introduced its first Building Bylaw. All building plans had to be submitted for approval to the Building and Improvement Committee. Minimum space, ventilation and sanitary standards had to be met. Cellar dwellings were banned. The next stage of working class house building had to conform to the bylaw. About 65 such houses were built in Berry Street, Maw Street and Hall Lane. In 1859 Mr Hird completed a group of another 60 houses in Hall Lane, Hird Street and Lavinia street: They were back to back one up/one downs but each house had a garden containing a privy and an internal water supply.|$|E

40|$|AP- 1 {{transcriptional}} {{activity is}} {{stimulated by the}} transformation promoters phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (" 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate," TPA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in promotion-sensitive (P+) but not in promotion-resistant (P-) JB 6 mouse epidermal cell lines. Although TPA stimulates expression of the jun and fos family genes, only c-jun expression shows higher elevation in P+ cells than in P- cells. The present study tests the hypothesis that induced AP- 1 activity is required for tumor promoter-induced transformation in JB 6 P+ cells. Both retinoic acid and the glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide inhibited basal and TPA-induced AP- 1 activities that were tested with a stromelysin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in P+ cells. Since both retinoic acid and fluocinolone acetonide are active in inhibiting TPA-induced anchorage-independent transformation of P+ cells in the dose range that blocks TPA-induced AP- 1 activity, their antipromoting effects may occur through inhibition of AP- 1 activity. To test the hypothesis with a more specific inhibitor, stable clonal transfectants of P+ cells expressing dominant negative c-jun mutant encoding a transcriptionally inactive product were analyzed. All transfectants <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> in TPA and EGF induction of AP- 1 activity. All transfectants also showed inhibition of TPA-induced transformation, and most transfectants <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> in EGF-induced transformation.
