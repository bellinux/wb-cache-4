5000|$|The Quantitative Easing by {{the central}} banks with the effect of an {{increased}} money supply in an economy often helps to increase or moderate inflationary targets. There is a puzzle formation between low-rate of inflation and a high growth of money supply. When {{the current rate of}} inflation is low, a high worth of money supply warrants the tightening of liquidity and an increased interest rate for a moderate aggregate demand and the avoidance of any potential problems. Further, in case of a low output a tightened monetary policy would affect the production in a much more severe manner.The supply shocks have known to play a dominant role in the regard of monetary policy. The bumper harvest in 1998-99 with a buffer yield in wheat, sugarcane, and pulses had led to an early <b>supply</b> <b>condition</b> further driving their prices from what were they in the last year. The increased import competition since 1991 with the trade liberalization in place have widely contributed to the reduced manufacturing competition with a cheaper agricultural raw materials and the fabric industry. These cost-saving driven technologies have often helped to drive a low-inflation rate. The normal growth cycles accompanied with the international price pressures has several times being characterized by domestic uncertainties.|$|E

A simulated probability distribution of the territory-wide car ownership is also established to assess {{the reliability of the}} estimated car ownership. From the road network <b>supply</b> <b>conditions,</b> the maximum number of cars by zone is determined in view of the capacity of the road network and the number of available parking spaces by a bilevel programming model. The proposed bilevel programming model is aimed at examining whether existing road network <b>supply</b> <b>conditions</b> are capable for accommodating future zonal car ownership growth. A case study in a Hong Kong urban area is presented to integrate the results of user demand and network <b>supply</b> <b>conditions</b> to obtain the balance of territory-wide car ownership.

To carry out this study the hydrodynamic pressure distribution inside the bearing has been determined using a mass conserving cavitation model with realistic <b>supply</b> <b>conditions.</b> The energy equation and the heat conduction equation have been used for the determination of oil film and bush temperature distributions. The agreement observed between theoretical predictions and experimental published data is acceptable. Quantitative information shows that the oil <b>supply</b> <b>conditions</b> affect bearing performance parameters in different ways. Oil flowrate was markedly affected by all supply parameters studied. Power loss, maximum bush temperature and minimum film thickness were mainly dependent on oil supply temperature. The effect of supply pressure on minimum film thickness was dependent on groove location. An axial groove located at 90 degrees to the load line gave rise to more favourable bearing performance characteristics.

Our principal findings are that the program had a substantial effect on grade progression and that these increased over time, even after the original intervention group stopped receiving demand-side transfers. Half of the estimated program effect on progression is accounted for by a reduction in the dropout and repetition rates of beneficiary children who were already in school when the program began. <b>Supply</b> side <b>conditions</b> were important and several of them led to heterogeneous program impacts.

40|$|There {{are three}} sets of {{conditions}} for a process of regional integration to develop: demand, <b>supply</b> and inertial <b>conditions.</b> Demand conditions grow out of higher levels of regional interdependence, as transnational transactors perceive that cross-border activities are too costly and request national or supranational authorities to lower transactions costs through cooperation, coordination and, eventually, integration. <b>Supply</b> <b>conditions</b> refer to regional leadership, understood as the capacity and will {{of one or more}} actors either to pay a disproportionate share of the costs required by the regional undertaking (usually member states) or to provide monitoring, enforcement and regional coordination (usual-ly supranational agencies).

40|$|Understanding {{causes of}} dune irregularity, {{especially}} dune trough scour, {{is important for}} the modeling of vertical sorting of sediment mixtures in morphological models of rivers with sediment mixtures. Sediment in dunes is generally sorted in a fining-upward manner, which affects the sediment transport composition depending on the scour depth distribution of the dunes. Why dunes become more irregular and develop deep scour holes in some conditions is only partially understood. Moreover, there is a feedback between vertical sorting and dune irregularity. In gravelly sands, erosion-resistant coarse layers may form that decrease or inhibit dune trough scour. The causes of dune irregularity and the feedback by coarse sediment layers are explored in experiments and are demonstrated to be related partly to the upstream sediment boundary condition determined by the experimental setup: sediment feeding or recirculating. Sediment recirculation flumes promote fining of the transported sediment and formation of a less or immobile gravel lag layer in the dune troughs. Sediment feed flumes may force the transported sediment at the flume entry to be equal to the bed sediment (equal mobility condition) and hence allow no lag layer formation. Experiments show that the dune trough scour in recirculation is less deep than in feed flumes, and the vertical sorting and transport sediment composition are different. The experiments also indicate that dune irregularity in feed flumes is related to dimensionless shear stress similarly as in uniform sediments. Interpretation of experiments of dune dynamics in sediment mixtures should therefore account for differences in the upstream sediment <b>supply</b> <b>condition.</b> More in general, it is hypothesized that the upstream sediment <b>supply</b> <b>condition</b> (resembling either recirculation or feed flumes) in rivers may affect dune and vertical sorting dynamic...|$|E

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of an irrigation development proposal should include {{an analysis of}} the effects of water <b>supply</b> <b>conditions</b> on the degree to which development objectives are expected to be realised. A method of making this analysis was developed based on procedures for solving two problems. These were; (a) optimally allocating a property's available supply of water among competing crops, and, (b) optimally controlling an open channel distribution system to meet temporally and spatially varying water demand. The procedure developed for solving (a) was applied. A stochastic dynamic programming procedure was developed to optimally schedule the irrigation of a single crop, subject to constraints on the timing of water availability and total application depth. A second procedure was developed, employing a constrained differential dynamic programming algorithm, for determining optimal irrigation schedules for use with variable application depth systems, and when several crops compete for an intra-seasonally limited supply of water. This procedure was called, as frequently as water <b>supply</b> <b>conditions</b> allowed, to provide short-term irrigation schedules in a computer simulation of the optimal irrigation of several crops. An application system model was included in these procedures to transform a crop water-use production function into the required irrigation water-use production function. This transformation was a function of the application device type and the mean application depth. From {{an analysis of the}} on-property effects of water <b>supply</b> <b>conditions,</b> it was concluded that in order to achieve high economic and irrigation efficiencies, water <b>supply</b> <b>conditions</b> must be sufficiently flexible to allow the application system operator to vary the mean application depth but not necessarily the time periods of water availability.
