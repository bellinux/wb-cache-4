50|$|The {{selection}} of {{conditions for the}} process allows for control of pore sizes, particle diameter, and their distributions, {{as in the case}} of the one-step approach. Porosity in the modified process is controllable through the introduction of a <b>swelling</b> <b>agent,</b> the choice of temperature, and the quantity of sodium fluoride catalyst added. A <b>swelling</b> <b>agent</b> (such as mesitylene) causes increases in volume and hence in pore size, often by solvent absorption, but is limited by the solubility of the agent in the system. Pore size varies directly with temperature, bound by the lower out of the surfactant cloud point and the boiling point of water. Sodium fluoride concentration produces direct but non-linear changes in porosity, with the effect decreasing as the added fluoride concentration tends to an upper limit.|$|E
40|$|Cellulase and <b>swelling</b> <b>agents</b> {{are known}} to be {{effective}} in improving the colour strength of cotton. Nowadays, the handloom fabrics are much preferred due to development of innovative designs and their comfort in wearing Due to increased environmental awareness the use of natural dyes are much preferred in dyeing of handloom fabrics. But, khadi cotton has some major shortcomings like less dyeability. Keeping in view that the pretreatment of khadi cotton with cellulases, <b>swelling</b> <b>agents</b> and combination of cellulases and <b>swelling</b> <b>agents</b> before dyeing improves the colour strength properties, the present study was planned. The khadi cotton samples were treated with optimized conditions of enzymes and <b>swelling</b> <b>agents.</b> The optimum pH, concentration, treatment time and temperature selected for the acid cellulase enzyme treatment were 5. 5, 1. 5 % (owf), 45 minutes and 50 °C, respectively whereas in case of neutral cellulase enzyme, it was 7. 5, 2. 0 % (owf), 70 minutes and 70 °C respectively. The optimum concentration, treatment time and temperature selected for sodium hydroxide treatment were 20 % w/v, 60 minutes and 60 °C, respectively. In case of ethylenediamine, 80 % w/v, 60 minutes and 70 °C were selected as optimum concentration, treatment time and temperature, respectively. In case of zinc chloride treatment, the optimum concentration, treatment time and temperature were selected as 80 % w/v, 60 minutes and 70 °C. 5 g Butea frondosa dye extracted for 75 minutes gave best results on khadi cotton when dyeing was carried out for 90 minutes It was observed that out of various concentrations of mordants used with Butea frondosa dye, best shades of colour were obtained by using 0. 04 g of Alum, 0. 01 g of Copper sulphate, 5 g each of Babool bark. On optimizing the method of mordanting, best results were obtained with Butea frondosa dye when samples were simultaneous mordanted and dyed with Alum, Babool bark and Alum. Pre-mordanting was selected for Copper sulphate.. It was found that for all the enzyme treated (acid and neutral cellulase) as well as <b>swelling</b> <b>agents</b> treated (Sodium hydroxide, Ethylenediamine and Zinc chloride) samples, the colour strength and colourfastness was increased in comparison to the untreated samples...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{graft copolymerization}} of styreneor methyl methacrylate (MMA) onto poly(vinyl alcohol) films {{was carried out}} in the presence of <b>swelling</b> <b>agents</b> such as methanol and water.

It wasfound that methanol has several effects on the heterogeneous grafting other than to accelerate the diffusion of monomers into the substrate matrix. In the grafting of styrene methanol caused an appreciablegel effect, while it behaved as a simple diluent in the grafting of MMA. The chain transfer agents reduced the yield as well as the length of the polymer molecules formed in the film, the chain transfer constant being in agreement with that in the conventional catalytic homopolymerization.

50|$|Stimuli-responsive gels (hydrogels, {{when the}} <b>swelling</b> <b>agent</b> is an aqueous solution) are {{a special kind}} of {{swellable}} polymer networks with volume phase transition behaviour.
