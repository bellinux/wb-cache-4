50|$|The Hainich Forest {{features}} {{a wide range}} of beech forest communities, with populations of ash trees, hornbeams, maples, lindens, and occasional checker trees. Many fungi can be found there, along with stands of flowers such as <b>summer</b> <b>snowflakes</b> and anemones. Animals in the park include wildcats, 15 species of bats, 7 species of woodpeckers, and over 500 types of wood beetles.|$|R
6000|$|Time rolled on, {{and with}} it the sunbeams of <b>summer</b> went--the <b>snowflakes</b> of winter came. Needles of ice began to shoot across the surface of Red River, and {{gradually}} narrowed its bed. Crystalline trees formed upon the window-panes. Icicles depended from the eaves of the houses. Snow fell in abundance on the plains; liquid nature began rapidly to solidify, and not many weeks after the first frost made its appearance everything was (as the settlers expressed it) [...] "hard and fast." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the reserve}} grows some {{particular}} plants as the <b>Summer</b> <b>Snowflake</b> (Leucojum aestivum), the 'Four Leaf Clover' (Marsilea quadrifolia). The rarest {{one is the}} Utricularia vulgaris, a rootless aquatic carnivorous plant who capture small insects and in summer shows beautiful yellow flowers sprouting from water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two species}} of Leucojum have been {{described}} as [...] "tough garden plants for damp soils". L. aestivum, the <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake,</b> grows particularly well on clay soils. L. vernum, the spring snowflake, is easy to grow in moist sunny or semi-shady places and flowers along with snowdrops.|$|E
50|$|The site is wet willow and alder {{woodland}} {{close to}} the River Thames, fed by a ditch from neighbouring water meadows. The understorey has blackthorn, hawthorn and guelder rose. There is a diverse flora, including the nationally rare <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake.</b> There is a varied bird population and rich invertebrate fauna.|$|E
40|$|EnThe studied {{region is}} characterised by its rich flora,vegetation,and {{diversity}} of habitats,from constantly submerged areas,moving on to areas subject to tidal movements,and ending {{in areas that}} are always above water level. In many cases the relations between these various types of habitat are of great ecological importance. All of these areas are specific to the area ’s rivers and cannot be found anywhere else. The relatively modest density of the vegetation is due to human pressure exerted on the area:cementing,building embankments,and poplar fields have greatly changed the original landscape. Where human influence has been reduced,thickets of common reed (Phragmites australis) can often be found,as well as populations of floating species such as the duckweed (of the Lemna species),the giant duckweed (Salvinia natans) and the water chestnut (Trapa natans). On the edges,in other words in transitional areas between aquatic and terrestrial habitats,there are varieties of sedge (Carex elata,C. riparia) water lilies (Iris pseudoacorus),purple-loosestrifes (Lythrum salicaria),and sometimes <b>summer</b> <b>snowflakes</b> (Leucojum aestivum). Mesophyte woods,characterised less by Mediterranean and more by continental features,grow in less protruding areas, where conditions are cooler and more humid. The dominant species of these woods are:Alnus glutinosa,Fraxinus angustifolia,the bay-oak (Quercus robur) and the elm (Ulmus minor). In the low areas close to the water table,and in the floodplains not given over to the growing of poplars,there are small hygrophilous woods whose main species are the willow (Salix alba) and the white poplar (Populus alba) ...|$|R

50|$|The flora in {{the commune}} is mainly xerophytic and Mediterranean Phytochorion. The {{botanist}} Bernard Girerd counted 800 plant species in 1992. Apart from the olive tree, {{characteristic of a}} maussanais landscape, there are also hackberries, small sized Kermes oak, and Shadbush. Protected plant species, such as the <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> (Leucojum aestivum) and Hélianthème (Helianthemum lavandulaefolium), are found {{at the bottom of}} the valleys.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 400 {{vascular}} {{plants have}} been recorded at the Reserve, which is around 25% of the species found in Britain. There are also a number of rare plants found at the Reserve, including elongated sedge, six-stamened waterwort, cowbane, <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> and mudwort. More details about {{the flora and fauna}} of Loch Lomond NNR can be found in SNH's Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve Story.|$|E
50|$|Leucojum aestivum, {{commonly}} called <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> or Loddon Lily is a plant species widely cultivated as an ornamental. It {{is native to}} most of Europe from Spain and Ireland to Ukraine, {{with the exception of}} Scandinavia, Russia, Belarus and the Baltic Republics. It is also considered native to Turkey, Iran and the Caucasus. It is naturalized in Denmark, South Australia, New South Wales, Nova Scotia and much of the eastern United States.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{composed}} of several wet meadows, which are grazed by sheep. They are seasonally flooded and waterlogged and have a diverse flora and fauna. Plants include the nationally rare <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> and marsh and early marsh orchids, which are found in locations {{with a long history}} of undisturbed grassland management. There are invertebrates such as the endangered marsh fly Dicheptophora findlandica and the rare dragonfly Gomphus vulgatissimus. There are also areas of wet woodland, and the diverse habitats attract a variety of breeding birds.|$|E
50|$|Leucojum aestivum (<b>summer</b> <b>snowflake)</b> has a wider natural range, {{taking in}} Europe (including the British Isles), {{southwest}} Asia and northern Iran, and growing in wetter habitats including damp woodland, riversides and swamps. Despite its common name it flowers from April to May, though {{later than the}} Spring Snowflake. It is a taller plant than Leucojum vernum, growing to around 60 cm (2 ft), but its flowers are smaller and are carried in an umbel of between three and seven. Its fleshy seed pods are inflated, allowing them to be dispersed by flood water. Leucojum aestivum subsp. pulchellum (Salisb.) Briq., native to the western Mediterranean Basin, is smaller: 20 cm (8 in), and flowers 2 weeks earlier, i.e., from mid-March.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} the mouth is {{remarkable}} for its variety - frequently flooded, old growth forests of a riverine type, up to 450 m-wide beaches with up to 19 m-high, forested or grass-covered sand dunes, freshwater marshes and marshy remnants of old riverbeds, cutting deep into the forest. The unusual coexistence of ash, oak, elm, alder and maple trees sometimes rising up to 40-50 m with lianas climbing between the branches creates {{the impression of a}} tropical forest, a real tangle of woods. The <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> (Leucojum aestivum) and several buttercup species (Scilla sp.), as well as ferns, grow in the delta. One can see otter, deer, wild boar and wild cat, among 26 mammal species, sea hawks, eagles, and up to 200 other bird species, including 56 protected ones, and 25 fish species, among others.|$|E
5000|$|The Račna Karst Field {{has several}} habitats, {{some of which}} are {{significant}} at the European level. The land is predominantly grassland, with patches of woods and brush here and there. Brush is especially present along the river channels, along with areas covered in sedge or rushes. Spring flowers include the bog violet (Viola uliginosa), snake's head fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris), <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> (Leucojum aestivum), spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza spp.), and marsh orchid (Orchis palustris). Specimens of marsh lousewort (Pedicularis palustris) and march gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe) are still present but in decline, and due to fertilizer use the oblong-leaved sundew (Drosera intermedia) and white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba) have disappeared in the last decade. The area is also a habitat for the swamp cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris) and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), and in some drier areas there are also less hygrophilous plants.|$|E
50|$|Tourism in the Municipality is {{somewhat}} underdeveloped but growing, with new hotels opening {{such as the}} 'Tzargrad' in Debar south of Parvomay town and 'Finest' in the centre. Local attractions include thermal mineral springs in Dragoinovo, Biala Reka and Lenovo. The surroundings of Vinitsa village is almost unique place in Bulgaria as it is where the rare <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> can be found, Latin name Leucojum aestivum. It has been spotted {{in the village of}} Iskra which is the home in August to the фестивал Искра (Iskra Festival), which is a celebration of Folk Music, dancing, food and wine drawing as many as 2000 from afar a field as Plovdiv. A dam of the river Kajalijka between Iskra and Bryagovo forms Briagovo Lake. Briagovo Lake is the site for local hunting clubs pre hunting season with a clay pigeon shooting competition every September close to a Hotel overlooking the lake. There as been recent development of water-motor sports and fishing tourism at this lake and others nearby and on Mechka River. A second dam of the Kajlijka river at Ezerovo forms a sizable lake which is a popular summer spot for local visitors and fishing. Growing from vine-cultivation and wine production in Iskra and Tatarevo villages there has been the development of business tourism related to production and tasting of local wines.|$|E

40|$|Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae {{alkaloid}} used {{to treat}} the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil (Narcissus spp.), snowdrop (Galanthus spp.), and <b>summer</b> <b>snowflake</b> (Leucojum aestivum). Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor {{in the development of}} synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant O-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 49 -O-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 49 -O-methyltransferase (NpN 4 OMT) of th...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A living {{collection}} of Leucojum aestivum L. (Amaryllidaceae) was {{established at the}} Institute of Botany, Sofia, in 2001. In vitro cultures originating from a single mother bulb have been maintained since 2003 on MS-based agar-solidified medium supplemented with 30 g L- 1 sucrose, 2 mg L- 1 BAP and 0. 15 mg L- 1 NAA under equal temperature and light conditions in plastic containers. Part of the regenerated plantlets were successfully adapted ex vitro and planted in open-air trenches in 2007. Uniform shoot clumps were selected and grown for seven weeks during the vegetation peirod in spring 2009 on solid and in a liquid medium with the same compostion. Main physiological characteristics of the field cultivated plants and plantlets from long-term in vitro cultures were compared. Leaves were taken from field grown and field adapted plants, and in vitro obtained plantlets on solid and in liquid media, all genetically identical. The photosynthetic rate of field grown plants was twice {{higher than that of}} in vitro plantlets. Moreover, the results for the plants adapted to open-air conditions were similar to those initially planted on the field, whereas the photosynthesis and the biomass accumulation were more expressed by the in vitro plantlets cultured in a liquid medium compared to those grown on agar-solidified one. The liquid shoot-clump culture of L. aestivum was determined as a suitable system for in vitro alkaloid production.
