50|$|Petersburg Courthouse is a {{historic}} courthouse building located at Petersburg, Virginia. It was designed by New York architect Calvin Pollard and built between 1838 and 1840. It is a two-story, Classical Revival style brick building. It rests on a granite foundation and measures 57 feet wide and 93 feet deep. It features a pedimented hexastyle front portico and a double-tiered bell and clock tower modeled after the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens. Major work {{was performed on the}} structure until 1877 when extensive repairs and interior alterations were carried out. A 30-foot addition was constructed in 1965. During the Siege of Petersburg, Union troops used the tower for a <b>sighting</b> <b>mark</b> and spared the structure from the bombardment.|$|E
5000|$|To {{fire the}} grenade, first, a special blank {{cartridge}} is {{loaded into the}} weapon. There is often some sort of cutoff device on gas operated rifles that can be engaged to disable the gas piston, both to eliminate {{the possibility of a}} live round chambering itself, and to prevent any of the gas being tapped off, which might affect the accuracy and range of the grenade). The tail of the grenade is slipped over the muzzle attachment, where it indexes itself so the aiming mark is on the top. The rifle is lined up with the target, butt to the ground (as shown in the photograph above), and held to the proper angle to ensure the correct ballistic trajectory, a skill which must be learned in training. This can be done by eye, as in the photograph, but some rifles, such as the Yugoslavian M59/66 (SKS) & Zastava M70, have built in flip-up ladder sights that allow for accurate ranging of the shots, by giving a graduated series of [...] "rungs" [...] which correspond with various ranges. The rifle is aligned with the target, and the user looks through the ladder sight, adjusting the angle until the <b>sighting</b> <b>mark</b> on the tip of the grenade matches the proper range on the sight. Then the trigger is pulled, and the high-velocity gases rush down the barrel, when they are slowed by the obstructing grenade fitted over the end, the low-pressure, high-velocity gas transforms into low-velocity, high-pressure gas very rapidly, forcing the grenade off the launcher at a relatively high rate of speed, whereupon it follows a ballistic arc to the target. A rifle grenade cannot be easily or safely fired directly at a target, and must always be fired in a ballistic arc; the closer the target, the higher the angle the rifle must be held, much like a mortar.|$|E
50|$|Mk.1s {{featured}} a front blade sight with adjustable rifle-type <b>sights,</b> <b>marked</b> between 100 and 600 yards. Mk.1* {{featured a}} much simplified flip-up <b>sight</b> <b>marked</b> 100 or 200 yards.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} issue of Fate, Palmer {{published}} Kenneth Arnold's report of [...] "flying discs." [...] Arnold's <b>sighting</b> <b>marked</b> the beginning of the modern UFO era, and his story propelled the fledgling Fate to national recognition. Through Fate, Palmer was instrumental in popularizing belief in flying saucers. This interest led him to establish the magazine Flying Saucers.|$|R
50|$|The Welrod was {{provided}} with <b>sights</b> <b>marked</b> with fluorescent paint {{for use in}} low light conditions. Although it had a maximum suggested range of 25 yards (22.86 meters) it was intended for use far closer - up to point-blank range. The muzzle end of the gun was cut away {{so that it could}} be fired in direct contact with the target. This would reduce the sound levels even further and remove the chance of missing.|$|R
50|$|Established in 1948 by Clark Publishing Company, {{the first}} edition of Fate hit world newsstands in the spring. Co-founded by Ray Palmer, editor of the Amazing Stories magazine, and Curtis Fuller, an {{accomplished}} editor in his own right, the magazines inaugural edition featured an article by Kenneth Arnold who recounted in it his UFO encounter in 1947. Arnolds <b>sighting</b> <b>marked</b> the beginning of the modern UFO era, and his story propelled the magazine to national recognition. The headquarters is in Lakeville, Minnesota.|$|R

25|$|Mechanical {{devices were}} also used to aid the {{accuracy}} of aerial bombing. Drift Sight was the first such aid, developed by Harry Wimperis in 1916 for the Royal Naval Air Service; it measured the wind speed from the air, and used that measurement to calculate the wind's effects on the trajectory of the bombs. The system was later improved with the Course Setting Bomb Sight, and reached a climax with World War II bomb <b>sights,</b> <b>Mark</b> XIV bomb <b>sight</b> (RAF Bomber Command) and the Norden (United States Army Air Forces).|$|R

5000|$|The Lux is {{equipped}} with a 24.8" [...] (630 mm) barrel in the [...]22 caliber model, walnut European-style stock with an arched (curved) comb sometimes referred to as a Bavarian or [...] "hogback" [...] stock. The lower drop and arched cheekpiece of the Bavarian stock is intended to aid shooting with iron sights. All Lux models come with a tangent <b>sight</b> <b>marked</b> in 25 meter increments and adjustable for windage and elevation, along with a hooded front sight. The elevation can also be fine-tune adjusted on the front sight blade by loosening a setscrew and sliding the blade up or down. A left hand version is also manufactured.|$|R
60|$|The weather, however on this {{his first}} experiment, did not {{encourage}} him to remain out the whole night. On the contrary, {{by the time the}} crater was in <b>sight,</b> <b>Mark</b> thought he had not seen a more portentous-looking sky since he had been on the Reef. There was a fiery redness in the atmosphere that alarmed him, and he would have rejoiced to be at home, in order to secure his stock within the crater. From the appearances, he anticipated another tempest with its flood. It is true, it was not the season when the last occurred, but the climate might admit of these changes. The difference between summer and winter was very trifling on that reef, and a hurricane, or a gale, was as likely to occur in the one as in the other.|$|R
60|$|Hypatia watched breathless. The boy {{had just}} arrived at the altar in {{the centre of the}} orchestra, when he saw a gladiator close upon him. The ruffian's arm was raised to strike, when, to the astonishment of the whole theatre, boy and dog turned valiantly to bay, and leaping on the gladiator, dragged him between them to the ground. The triumph was momentary. The uplifted hands, the shout of 'Spare him!' came too late. The man, as he lay, buried his sword in the slender body of the child, and then rising, walked coolly back to the side passages, while the poor cur stood over the little corpse, licking its hands and face, and making the whole {{building}} ring with his doleful cries. The attendants entered, and striking their hooks into corpse after corpse, dragged them out of <b>sight,</b> <b>marking</b> their path by long red furrows in the sand; while the dog followed, until his inauspicious howlings died away down distant passages.|$|R

5000|$|On November 5, 2007, {{a strike}} began between the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE), Writers Guild of America, west (WGAw) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The strike was speculated to force {{television}} shows {{to end their}} seasons early, because {{there would be no}} future scripts until a settlement was reached. Due to the writers strike, only twelve out of the twenty-two episodes ordered were thought to be produced. With the end in <b>sight,</b> <b>Mark</b> Schwahn stated, [...] "Although we have six new episodes left, no one is more excited {{about the end of the}} strike than we are at One Tree Hill." [...] On the February 5, 2008 episode, One Tree Hills ratings were second only to Smallville for scripted dramas at the CW. Schwahn went on to say that [...] "wed love the opportunity to continue season five, and if the WGAs new contract is ratified, hopefully well be able to do just that. If not, well see you for season six." [...] On February 15, the CW announced that six additional episodes would be produced to wrap up the season due to the conclusion of the strike.|$|R
50|$|The gunner's {{station is}} located {{to the left}} of the main gun. The gunner has a dual mode (day/night) 1PN22M1 6x/6.7x {{magnification}} image intensifying monocular periscope sight, four day-use periscope vision blocks, an optical rangefinder and an OU-3GK removable infrared or white-light searchlight. The 1PN22M1 sight has a maximum range of 400 m at night, 900 m with the use of the infra-red searchlight. The <b>sight</b> is <b>marked</b> stadiametricly with the apparent size of a 2.7 m tall tank at various ranges.|$|R
50|$|Unmarked {{vehicles}} are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting {{them to their}} presence. Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement, since drivers slow down at the <b>sight</b> of <b>marked</b> police vehicles and unmarked vehicles {{make it easier for}} officers to catch speeders and traffic violators. This practice is controversial, with for example, New York State banning this practice in 1996 {{on the grounds that it}} endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers.|$|R
6000|$|Everything had changed--changed {{extraordinarily}} {{with the}} mere turning of that gentleman's back, the treacherous aspect of which its owner couldn't surely have suspected. If {{the question was}} of the pitch of their sensibility, at all events, it wouldn't be Mark's that should vibrate to least purpose. Visibly {{it had come to}} his host that something had within the few instants remarkably happened, but there glimmered on him an induction that still made him keep his own manner. Newton himself might now resort to any manner he liked. His eyes had raked the floor to recover the position of something dropped or misplaced, and something, above all, awkward or compromising; and he had wanted his companion not to command this scene from the hearth-rug, the hearthrug where he had been just before holding him, hypnotising him to blindness, because the object in question would there be most exposed to <b>sight</b> <b>Mark</b> embraced this with a further drop--while the apprehension penetrated--of his power to go on, and with an immense desire {{at the same time that}} his eyes should seem only to look at his friend; who broke out now, for that matter, with a fresh appeal.

5000|$|At the dance, {{the band}} Dio plays their song [...] "Holy Diver". The boys {{of the school}} hatch a plan to duct tape Mark to the {{flagpole}} while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in <b>sight,</b> <b>Mark</b> is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister [...] "into a slut." [...] The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; Randy Marsh breaks up the fight, with Mark warning Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) {{about the benefits of}} public schools - [...] "...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves." [...] Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion. Dio restarts and plays [...] "Holy Diver" [...] over the end credits, with Phonics Monkey joining in on drums.|$|R

25|$|During reentry, {{there was}} a great deal of concern over whether Carpenter had {{actually}} survived, since he splashed down 250 miles off course. There are two accounts of the Aurora 7 recovery, the first being that forty minutes after splashdown, Carpenter was located in his life raft, safe and in good health by Maj. Fred Brown under the command of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard, and recovered three hours later by the , and the second being that a P-2 Neptune from Patrol Squadron 18 flying out of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads was the first to <b>sight</b> and <b>mark</b> Carpenter's position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front sight}} has a hooded post. The rear sight {{is an open}} notch type which is {{adjustable}} for elevation from 100 to 1000 m. There is also an all-purpose [...] "battle" [...] setting on the <b>sight</b> ladder (<b>marked</b> [...] "П", for [...] "Прямой выстрел", meaning [...] "Straight shot"), set for 300 m. This is attained by moving the elevation slide {{to the rear of}} the ladder as far as it will go. The Yugoslav M59/66A1 has folddown luminous sights for use when firing under poor light conditions, while the older M59 and M59/66 do not.|$|R

40|$|At first <b>sight</b> a <b>marked</b> {{difference}} {{turns out}} among the Italian governments of early Renaissance: the means of financing their deficit. There are, on the one hand, communal cities and republics, raising money from citizens through the system of forced or voluntary loans; there are, on the other, princes and lords who exploit services of bankers and merchants. These two different systems of borrowing bring about significant financial and political aspects. In this paper I will examine the main features characterizing the two mechanisms of indebtedness and the implications concerning {{the emergence of a}} true financial market connected with state bonds. Public debts; Renaissance Italy; financial markets; financial institutions...|$|R

The second boy has a dagger handy at his side, and violence is not far away.|$|R
60|$|At first <b>sight,</b> <b>Mark</b> had a {{good deal}} of {{difficulty}} in understanding the predominant nature of the very many bodies of water that were to be seen on every side of him. On the whole, there still remained almost as much of one element as of the other, in the view; which of itself, however, was a vast change from what had previously been the condition of the shoals. There were large bodies of water, little lakes in extent, which it was obvious enough must disappear under the process of evaporation, no communication existing between them and the open ocean. But, on the other hand, many of these sheets were sounds, or arms of the sea, that must always continue, since they might be traced, far as eye could reach, towards the mighty Pacific. Such, Mark was induced to believe, was the fact with the belt of water that still surrounded, or nearly surrounded the Reef; for, placed where he was, the young man was unable to ascertain whether the latter had, or had not, at a particular point, any land communication with an extensive range of naked rock, sand, mud, and deposit, that stretched away to the westward, for leagues. In obvious connection with this broad reach of what might be termed bare ground, were Guano and Loam Islands; neither of which was an island any longer, except as it {{was a part of the}} whole formation around it. Nevertheless, our young man was not sorry to see that the channel around the Reef still washed the bases of both those important places of deposit, leaving it in his power to transport their valuable manures by means of the raft, or boat.|$|R
50|$|The forward Mk 38 Director (pictured) was {{situated}} {{on top of}} the fire control tower. The director was equipped with optical <b>sights,</b> optical <b>Mark</b> 45 Rangefinder (the long thin boxes sticking out of each side), and a Mark 13 Fire Control Radar antenna (the rectangular shape sitting on top). The purpose of the director was to track the target's present bearing and range. This could be done optically by the men inside using the sights and Rangefinder, or electronically with the radar. (The FC radar was the preferred method.) The present position of the target was called the Line-Of-Sight (LOS), and it was continuously sent down to the Mk 8 Rangekeeper in the plotting room by Synchro transmitters. Also, when not using the radar's display to determine Spots, the director was the optical spotting station.|$|R
