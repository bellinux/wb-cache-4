50|$|Typically a {{claimant}} will {{be outside}} {{the jurisdiction of}} the court: the law of <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs</b> recognises that orders of the court relating to payment of a party's legal costs can be very difficult to enforce in non-common law jurisdictions, and so will order security to be provided. Security can also be ordered where a claimant is insolvent, or prone to vexatious litigation.|$|E

5000|$|Gideon Benaim, {{former partner}} at Schillings, acted {{defendant}} Joanne Murrayand {{otherwise known as}} JK Rowling in a widely publicised case involving her fourth novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It was alleged that her novel plagiarised Adrian Jacob’s novel Willy the Wizard. The estate of late author Adrian Jacobs had claimed Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire plagiarised parts of his book, The Adventures of Willy the Wizard, however the claim was dismissed after the claimant failed to meet a deadline for paying {{the first stage of}} £1.5 million into court as <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs.</b> It was alleged Rowling copied elements of Jacobs 1987 book, among them a wizard contest and the notion of wizards travelling on trains. Rowling has described the claim that her book was copied from Willy the Wizard as not only unfounded but absurd, and said she had never even seen the book until Allens claim was launched in 2004. Interviewed outside High Court in London, Benaim commented [...] "An enormous amount of time has been spent having to defend against this claim, when it was quite obvious to us from the outset that it had no chance of success.

The reasons for the large price for both summits were questioned by some politicians and local groups. Members of Parliament Olivia Chow and Mark Holland labelled the initially claimed budget of $1.1-billion for hosting the summits as [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "insane" [...] while others argued that the money {{could have been used}} for long-pending municipal projects in Canada, such as Transit City. The <b>security</b> <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> the two summits was believed to be more expensive than the combined security costs of the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia, which were $878 million.

40|$|The Article {{is about}} <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs</b> in {{international}} arbitration under the ICC and ICSID Rules. It explains who {{is entitled to}} submit such a request, what kind of costs are secured, whether the tribunal has authority to order such measure, and the basis of such authority. This {{is followed by the}} discussion of the conditions for ordering the measure and the reasons that speak against it. Among various exceptional circumstances justifying the measure that are mentioned in arbitral case law, the following are discussed in more detail: manifest insolvency or bankruptcy of the claimant, SPV as claimant, third party financing of the claim, change of circumstances, respondent is not a signatory to the arbitration agreement, and probability that respondent will be awarded costs. Reasons speaking against the measure mentioned in the cases are the following: consent to the risk of insolvent claimant, access to arbitral justice, equity, respondent's bad faith, and untimeliness of the request. Finally, certain questions of procedure are discussed such as burden of proof and consequences of claimant's non-compliance with the order to pay security. The author concludes that in ICC and ICSID arbitration arbitrators are reluctant to order <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs</b> although such requests by respondents have become more frequent in recent times. The threshold respondent must pass to convince the tribunal that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the measure is high. The fact that claimant is insolvent alone does not suffice for the success of such request...|$|E
40|$|The {{national}} statutes {{on international}} commercial arbitration, the leges arbitri, do, as a rule, not contain provisions on costs. In the final award, an arbitrator has {{to determine the}} costs of the arbitration (the fees of the arbitral tribunals, of expert witnesses mandated by the arbitral tribunal etc.), which cost incurred by the parties during the arbitration are recoverable and which party has to bear what share of the costs. A decision on these issues forms part of the ordinary course of an arbitration. Further cost-related issues may arise due to the peculiarities of the case, such as a refusal of one of the parties to contribute to the financing of the arbitration. Resorting to agreements may provide a satisfactory means for certain decisions on costs in arbitration proceedings; this is by making use of the contractual nature of these agreements; by asking whether these agreements can be interpreted in a way that gives an answer to the issue at stake or - {{as in the case of}} <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs</b> - whether the contract may be amended to grant a motion for <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs.</b> It is submitted that the reasoning so achieved is at least as convincing and consistent as other approaches solicited by doctrine. Therefore, it is further submitted that this approach should be considered when an issue arises that is not addressed in the lex arbitri or the institutional arbitration rules...|$|E

40|$|An {{appeal is}} a {{substantive}} right created by statute enabling {{a party to}} seek to set aside or vary an order. The conferring statute determines the nature of an appeal, which typically falls into one of three types: appeals by way of rehearing, appeals by way of hearing de novo and strict appeals (stricto sensu). Australian court systems have multiple levels of jurisdiction. Each level, {{with the exception of}} the High Court, generally has an avenue of appeal. The scope and nature of the appeal depends upon the terms of the statute creating the right of appeal. Appellate courts have wide powers to affirm, vary, or reverse judgments under appeal. Other powers include sending a case back for a retrial, setting aside jury verdicts, and granting a retrial. Appeals are commenced by a notice of appeal, which briefly states the grounds of the appeal. In some cases leave to appeal is required. The appeal court will require the appellant to prepare an appeal book or record, including pleadings, affidavits, orders and transcripts of evidence. Appeals may also have related applications. Examples include seeking a stay of execution pending an appeal, <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs,</b> leave to appeal and an application for an extension of time in which to file or serve a notice of appeal. There are many substantive bases upon which appeals are brought. The most common include errors of law, errors in the exercise of a discretion, incorrect findings of fact, incorrect inferences drawn from facts, excessive or insufficient assessments of damages and misdirection of a jury by a trial judge. Considerable difficulty arises in relation to the admission of fresh evidence available at trial, and to a lesser extent where a new point arises after judgment. New points and objections may also arise before judgment. Appellate courts have the power to grant a new trial where there has been a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. New trials tend to be avoided due to the duplication of costs incurred in rehearing the evidence. Appeals are an essential process for ensuring consistency and maintaining the high quality of the Australian judicial system...|$|E
40|$|Jordan v. State {{rules on}} two {{separate}} appeals {{that address the}} same issue of first impression regarding guidelines Nevada state courts must follow in order to restrict court access to in proper person litigants with in forma pauperis status. This case also reconfirms {{the process by which}} in forma applications are reviewed. In the first case, respondent Officer Jimmie W. Jones arrested proper person appellant James Jacob Jordan for trespassing on state property 2 after Jordan did not heed Officer Jones’s warning to leave the premises. After the trespass charge was dropped the following day, Jordan sued Officer Jones along with the Nevada State Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Safety for six different torts. Jordan filed this action with the First Judicial District Court, Carson City. After being granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, Jordan filed various papers that the district court found incomprehensible and procedurally improper. For that reason, the court ordered that Jordan be prohibited from proceeding without a waiver of fees in any new actions unless he obtained leave of the court prior to filing any new action. A few months later, a joint case conference report regarding Jordan’s cause of action was filed. The court granted the State’s motion for summary judgment because the court was unable to interpret the meaning of Jordan’s claims. Jordan timely appealed his suit. In the second case, proper person appellant John Luckett sued respondent Edward Doumani, owner of respondent La Concha Motel, for various torts in connection with a financial scam that Luckett claimed Doumani conspired in. Luckett filed this action with the Eighth Judicial District Court, Las Vegas. After Luckett was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, Doumani served Luckett with a demand for security costs under Nevada Revised Statute 18. 130, which requires an out-of-state plaintiff to post security for any future adverse award of costs and charges. 3 Doumani also moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. After the allotted time to pay the costs expired, the court notified Luckett that he had thirty days to pay or the case would be dismissed. The court then conducted a hearing on Doumani’s motion to dismiss for failure to pay and declared its intent to issue a restrictive order calling Luckett a vexatious litigant. Luckett was then given three weeks to file an opposition before the next hearing. After Luckett failed to attend that hearing, the court declared Luckett a vexatious litigant and noted that he had a history of filing unmeritorious pleadings, of claiming in forma pauperis status, and of traveling and gambling—thereby undercutting his claim of indigence. Accordingly, the court granted Doumani’s motion to dismiss for failure to post <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>costs</b> and barred Luckett from proceeding in his action against Doumani without paying appropriate costs; the court also barred Luckett from filing any new litigation in Nevada state courts in forma pauperis unless he first obtains leave of the presiding judge in the court. Luckett timely appealed his suit. In reviewing whether it was proper for the district courts to restrict Jordan’s and Luckett’s court access, respectively, the Nevada Supreme Court used an abuse of discretion standard {{and for the first time}} expressly adopted the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s four-part analysis for restricting court access, 4 with some caveats. 5 The Nevada Supreme Court found that the restrictive order levied against Jordan did not comply with the Ninth Circuit’s guidelines and ordered it vacated. First, Jordan was not given proper notice or opportunity to respond before the court restricted his court access. Second, the district court did not include an adequate record of filings and rulings in similar cases that led the court to order the restriction. Third, even though Jordan’s filings were difficult to understand, they were not without merit and should have at least warranted a preliminary evidentiary hearing as espoused by Spears v. McCotter. 6 Finally, the restrictive order against Jordan was unconstitutionally broad and seemed to bar him from filing any new actions in forma pauperis, regardless of whether the future action concerns a fundamental right. (In addition, based on a de novo review, the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the district court’s grant of summary judgment because two of Jordan’s six tort claims were legally viable.) The Nevada Supreme Court found that the restrictive order levied against Luckett followed the Ninth Circuit’s guidelines more closely and was warranted. First, Luckett was afforded notice and opportunity to be heard before the order was given. Second, the record substantiated the court’s findings (however, some of the suits the court cited to were pending and therefore should not have been referenced). Third, the court made substantive findings as to the frivolity of Luckett’s filings. Finally, the court narrowly drew the restrictive order that required Luckett to obtain a presiding judge’s permission to make new filings. However, the court should have explicated 1) a standard against which the presiding judge should evaluate any new filings from Luckett, and 2) which specific jurisdiction the restrictive order applied to—in this case, only the Eighth Judicial District Court. Therefore, even though the Nevada Supreme Court found the restrictive order to be proper, it remanded the order for modification because it lacked a complaintreview standard and wrongly attempted to apply to all Nevada jurisdictions rather than just the Eighth Judicial District. In addition, the Nevada Supreme Court did find that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Luckett’s action based on his failure to post security because the record contains no order expressly vacating the in forma pauperis order and no order was entered at a time early enough in the proceedings to give Luckett any opportunity to respond by posting security; instead, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Luckett’s action for failure to state a claim...|$|E
