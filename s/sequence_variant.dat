It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e. has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation.

Czech medical geneticist Eva Machácková writes: [...] "In some cases it is difficult to distinguish if the detected <b>sequence</b> <b>variant</b> is a causal mutation or a neutral (polymorphic) variation without any effect on phenotype. The interpretation of rare sequence variants of unknown significance detected in disease-causing genes becomes an increasingly important problem."

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{categorize}} a mutation as such, the [...] "normal" [...] sequence must {{be obtained from}} the DNA of a [...] "normal" [...] or [...] "healthy" [...] organism (as opposed to a [...] "mutant" [...] or [...] "sick" [...] one), it should be identified and reported; ideally, it should be made publicly available for a straightforward nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison, and agreed upon by the scientific community or by a group of expert geneticists and biologists, who have the responsibility of establishing the standard or so-called [...] "consensus" [...] sequence. This step requires a tremendous scientific effort. Once the consensus sequence is known, the mutations in a genome can be pinpointed, described, and classified. The committee of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) has developed the standard human <b>sequence</b> <b>variant</b> nomenclature, which should be used by researchers and DNA diagnostic centers to generate unambiguous mutation descriptions.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{national}} effort to identify biomarkers for the early detection of cancer, we developed a rapid and high-throughput sequencing protocol for the detection of <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> in mitochondrial DNA. Here, we describe {{the development and implementation of}} this protocol for clinical samples. Heteroplasmic and homoplasmic <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> occur in the mitochondrial genome in patient tumors. We identified these changes by sequencing mitochondrial DNA obtained from tumors and blood from the same individual. We confirmed previously identified primary lung tumor changes and extended these findings in a small patient cohort. Eight <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> were identified in stage I to stage IV tumor samples. Two of the <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> identified (22 %) were found in the D-loop region, which accounts for 6. 8 % of the mitochondrial genome. The other <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> were distributed throughout the coding region. In the forensic community, the sequence variations used for identification are localized to the D-loop region because this region appears to have a higher rate of mutation. However, in lung tumors the majority of sequence variation occurred in the coding region. Hence, incomplete mitochondrial genome sequencing, designed to scan discrete portions of the genome, misses potentially important <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> associated with cancer or other diseases...|$|R

Unfortunately, preparation of samples for {{a large number of}} individuals is still very cost- and labor intensive. Thus, recently, screens for rare <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> were carried out in samples of pooled DNA, in which equimolar amounts of DNA from multiple individuals are mixed prior to sequencing with HTS. The resulting sequence data, however, poses a bioinformatics challenge: the discrimination of sequencing errors from real <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> present at a low frequency in the DNA pool...|$|R
2500|$|The {{large extent}} of {{variability}} in HLA genes poses significant challenges in investigating {{the role of}} HLA genetic variations in diseases. Disease association studies typically treat each HLA allele as a single complete unit, which does not illuminate {{the parts of the}} molecule associated with disease. Karp D. R. et al. describes a novel sequence feature variant type (SFVT) approach for HLA genetic analysis that categorizes HLA proteins into biologically relevant smaller sequence features (SFs), and their variant types (VTs). Sequence features are combinations of amino acid sites defined based on structural information (e.g., beta-sheet 1), functional information (e.g., peptide antigen-binding), and polymorphism. These sequence features can be overlapping and continuous or discontinuous in the linear <b>sequence.</b> <b>Variant</b> types for each sequence feature are defined based upon all known polymorphisms in the HLA locus being described. SFVT categorization of HLA is applied in genetic association analysis so that the effects and roles of the epitopes shared by several HLA alleles can be identified. Sequence features and their variant types have been described for all classical HLA proteins; the international repository of HLA SFVTs will be maintained at IMGT/HLA database.

40|$|We {{examined}} the population structure and genetic variation of four genomic regions {{within and between}} 30 Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) isolates from Spain and California.

Four isolates showed two major <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> in some genomic regions. The two major variants of three of these isolates showed very low nucleotide identity to each other but were {{very similar to those}} of other isolates, suggesting the possibility of mixed infections with two divergent isolates. Incongruencies of phylogenetic relationships in the different genomic regions and statistical analyses suggested that the genomes of some CTV <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> originated by recombination events between diverged <b>sequence</b> <b>variants.</b> No correlation was observed between geographic origin and nucleotide distance, and thus from a genetic view, the Spanish and Californian isolates analyzed here could be considered members of the same population...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sequence</b> <b>variants</b> in {{recombinant}} biopharmaceuticals {{may have}} a relevant and unpredictable impact on clinical safety and efficacy. Hence, their sensitive analysis is important throughout bioprocess development. The two stage analytical approach presented here provides a quick multi clone comparison of candidate production cell lines as a first stage, followed by an in-depth analysis including identification and quantitation of aberrant <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> of selected clones as a second stage. We show that the differential analysis is a suitable tool for sensitive and fast batch to batch comparison of recombinant proteins. The optimized approach allows for detection of not only single amino acid substitutions in unmodified peptides, but also substitutions in posttranslational modified peptides such as glycopeptides, for detection of truncated or elongated <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> as well as double amino acid substitutions or substitution with amino acid structural isomers within one peptide. In two case studies {{we were able to}} detect <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> of different origin down to a sub percentage level.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThe {{availability}} of dense genotypes and whole-genome <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> {{from various sources}} offers the opportunity to compile large datasets consisting {{of tens of thousands}} of individuals with genotypes at millions of polymorphic sites that may enhance the power of genomic analyses. The imputation of missing genotypes ensures that all individuals have genotypes for a shared set of variants. ResultsWe evaluated the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to whole-genome <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> in 249 Fleckvieh and 450 Holstein cattle using Minimac and FImpute. The <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> of a subset of the animals were reduced to the variants that were included on the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array and subsequently inferred in silico using either within- or multi-breed reference populations. The accuracy of imputation varied considerably across chromosomes and dropped at regions where the bovine genome contains segmental duplications. Depending on the imputation strategy, the correlation between imputed and true genotypes ranged from 0. 898 to 0. 952. The accuracy of imputation was higher with Minimac than FImpute particularly for variants with a low minor allele frequency. Using a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of imputation, particularly when FImpute was used to infer genotypes. When the <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> were imputed using Minimac, the true genotypes were more correlated to predicted allele dosages than best-guess genotypes. The computing costs to impute 23, 256, 743 <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> in 6958 animals were ten-fold higher with Minimac than FImpute. Association studies with imputed <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> revealed seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for milk fat percentage. Two causal mutations in the DGAT 1 and GHR genes were the most significantly associated variants at two QTL on chromosomes 14 and 20 when Minimac was used to infer genotypes. ConclusionsThe population-based imputation of millions of <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> in large cohorts is computationally feasible and provides accurate genotypes. However, the accuracy of imputation is low in regions where the genome contains large segmental duplications or the coverage with array-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms is poor. Using a reference population that includes individuals from many breeds increases the accuracy of imputation particularly at low-frequency variants. Considering allele dosages rather than best-guess genotypes as explanatory variables is advantageous to detect causal mutations in association studies with imputed <b>sequence</b> <b>variants...</b>|$|R

50|$|Genetic {{testing is}} {{generally}} performed in families with hereditary disease. Any <b>sequence</b> <b>variant</b> identified in a gene {{can be described}} in test reports using the position of the change and the nucleotide or amino acid involved. With this simple rule, a deletion of the nucleotide guanine (G) in a stretch of 4 G nucleotides might be described in 4 different ways, when each of the G positions is used. Although different descriptions do not affect the functional consequences of the change, they may obfuscate the fact that two persons share the same variant or the real frequency of a variant in the population. The standard human <b>sequence</b> <b>variant</b> nomenclature proposed by the Human Genome Variation Society was developed to solve this problem.

40|$|Resequencing {{genes in}} {{individuals}} at extremes {{of the population}} distribution constitutes a powerful and efficient strategy to identify <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> associated with complex traits. An excess of <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> at one extreme relative to the other that is not due to chance or to population stratification constitutes evidence for genetic association and implies the presence of functionally significant <b>sequence</b> <b>variants.</b> Recently, we reported that non-synonymous <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> in Niemann–Pick type C 1 -like 1 (NPC 1 L 1), an intestinal cholesterol transporter, were significantly more common among individuals with low cholesterol absorption than in those with high cholesterol absorption. To determine whether sequence variations identified in individuals with low cholesterol absorption affect protein function, we performed studies in cultured cells and in families. Expression of the mutant proteins in Chinese hamster ovarian-K 1 cells revealed that a majority (14 of 20) of the variants identified in low absorbers were associated with very low levels of NPC 1 L 1 protein. In two extended families, mean cholesterol absorption levels, as measured using stable isotopes, were significantly lower in family members with the <b>sequence</b> <b>variants</b> than in those without the variant. These data indicate that the excess of sequence variations in individuals with extreme phenotypes reflects an enrichment of functionally significant variants.
