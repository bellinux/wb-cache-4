5000|$|On 11 October 1970, {{during a}} {{session of the}} Union des démocrates pour la république (UDR) (Union of democrats for the Republic), André Fanton, {{secretary}} of state for defence, gave the first hint that the base would need to be extended. Le Monde of 6 March 1971 quoted Deputy Delmas, then campaigning for election to UDR, as saying [...] "The extension of the military base is doubtless the last chance for survival of the town of Millau." [...] Millau ( [...] ,) at the Northern edge of the Larzac plateau, is today world-famous for its spectacular viaduct over the river Tarn. In 1971 it was chiefly known to French families for its <b>sheepskin</b> <b>glove</b> industry in decline and its infuriating traffic jams. Popular resistance to the proposal for the military base was immediately evident.On 28 October 1971, Defence Minister Michel Debré made the formal announcement in a televised interview. The base was to be extended from 3,000 to 17,000 hectares (30 to 170 square kilometers). Land would be expropriated from 107 farms in 12 communes centred on the small town of La Cavalerie. The extended base would form one sixth of the total area (100,000 hectares) of the Larzac itself. In subsequent commentary, Debré pointed out that the project would be [...] "not only vital to the national defence", but would have [...] "a positive impact" [...] on the region. He cited improvement of the rural electrical distribution system, water supply, and roadways [...] He stated that the extension was necessitated by saturation of French military bases in general, and the need to maintain a military force in proximity to the Plateau d'Albion, launch site of ground-ground ballistic nuclear missiles which formed an important element of the French nuclear deterrent.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify the quatity of bating agent used in tanning rabbit skins to be glove leather, to make use rabbit skins which can not be tanned to fur rabbit skin leather. The materials used in this research were of 40 pieces of lokal salt preservated rabbit skins originated from Yogyakarta having quality III and IV. They were grouped into four and the groups consisted of ten pieces each were tanned to be fashion glove leather using 4 % formaline as pretanning agent and followed by chrome tanning agent as the retanning agent. Before carrying out both tanning processes bating was done on them using Pancreol Bate as bating agent. The quantity of bating agent added was varried as 0, 65 %, 1, 2 %, 1, 8 % and 2, 4 %. The process used was of usually carried - out by IRDLAI. The leather produced were tested on their sotfness, with <b>sheepskin</b> <b>glove</b> leather was used as the measuring- rod; their tensile strength resistance and flexibility with SII. 0061 – 74 (Quality and test method for goatsheep skin glove and garment leather) as the standard of comparison. The test results were statistically evaluated. A conclusion can be down from this research that by using 0, 6 % Pancreol Bate on bating process, soft glove leathers having good tensile strength and flexibility which fulfill the requirements of SII. 0061 - 74 can be produced...|$|E
6000|$|Nobody {{came near}} them, and their {{movements}} showed a mechanical regularity; their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian [...] "wroppers"-- sleeved brown pinafores, tied behind to the bottom, {{to keep their}} gowns from blowing about--scant skirts revealing boots that reached high up the ankles, and yellow <b>sheepskin</b> <b>gloves</b> with gauntlets. The pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of the two Marys.|$|R
5000|$|The city is {{the seat}} of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of South Aveyron Millau. The {{municipality}} operates the airfield of Millau-Larzac. Having been recognized for over a century as the [...] "capital of leather and glove" [...] Millau is renowned for its activity tannery (leather gloves). The town is best known for its <b>sheepskin</b> <b>gloves,</b> for which it led the French fashion industry for two centuries. It gained the title of [...] "City and Art Professions" [...] in 2000.|$|R
5000|$|Nugent {{dresses in}} {{numerous}} layers {{to deliver his}} commentary, with The Irish Times once encountering him [...] "wrapped {{in the sort of}} attire more accustomed to Johnny Fortycoats or an Arctic explorer, and with his <b>sheepskin</b> <b>gloves</b> holding onto his microphone for dear life". His delivery is one of [...] "screeching anticipation" [...] and, even when events are relatively calm, he has been known to [...] "send dogs scurrying for cover". Nugent prepares for this delivery by arriving at the match ground two hours before kick-off to perform a sound check. He typically engages in conversation with the team doctor or other members of the backroom staff to ensure there is nothing new he has not been familiarised with regarding the players.|$|R
