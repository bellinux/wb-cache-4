This operational style was effective against fixed targets in slow-moving operations, but was more difficult in fast-moving operations such as Bustard Hunt. The advance meant Richthofen had to keep moving forward. He complained bitterly about the inability of his signals teams to set up new telephone and radio communications quickly enough.|$|E

50|$|Its {{function}} was to oversee various Australian government programs {{relating to the}} broadcasting of ABC and SBS television and radio programs within Australia and of ABC Radio Australia on shortwave internationally. This was done primarily through administering maintenance and equipment supply contracts.

It {{had to do this}} while maintaining the integrity and reliability of the transmission facilities themselves. During the life of the NTA, it moved from exclusive reliance on Broadcast Communications and Telstra towards a process of competitive tendering to provide its broadcasting services. A significant source of extra funding to the NTA was 'site-sharing' of transmission facilities with commercial broadcasters, telecommunications companies and emergency <b>service</b> <b>communication</b> networks. This 'site-sharing' meant that NTA facilities were made available in return for payment.|$|E

30|$|To {{understand}} CR from a customer’s {{point of}} view, we drew on Walsh and Beatty’s (2007) definition of customer-based CR, or “the customer’s overall {{evaluation of a}} company based {{on his or her}} reactions to the company’s goods, <b>services,</b> <b>communication</b> activities, interactions with the company and/or its representatives or constituencies (such as employees, management, or other customers) and/or known corporate activities” (p. 129). Corporate reputations are perceived as the attributes that differentiate one firm from another (Barnett et al. 2006) or as reactions to the company’s <b>services,</b> <b>communication</b> activities, and interactions with the company and/or its representatives (Walsh and Beatty 2007). When confronted with a lack of personal experience regarding a product or the company’s civic action plan, individuals rely on the CR to judge its products as well as its intentions (Schnietz and Epstein 2005).|$|R
