5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's <b>skills</b> <b>have</b> fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

His size, power and boxing <b>skills</b> <b>have</b> caused him to be considered the last of the great heavyweights, while he is currently the last heavyweight to hold the undisputed championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} this study show that the {{earliest}} age at which children can discriminate well-formed from ill-formed sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years. During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, there is {{a significant increase in the}} accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since metalinguistic skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the psycholinguistic ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute whether it can or cannot generate the target sentence. This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic grammar <b>skills</b> <b>have</b> been established, and is related to early reading acquisition—acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of syntactic awareness.|$|E
25|$|Communication {{interventions}} {{fall into}} two major categories. First, many autistic children do not speak, or have little speech, or have difficulties in effective use of language. Social <b>skills</b> <b>have</b> {{been shown to be}} effective in treating children with autism. Interventions that attempt to improve communication are commonly conducted by speech and language therapists, and work on joint attention, communicative intent, and alternative or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods such as visual methods, for example visual schedules. AAC methods do not appear to impede speech and may result in modest gains. A 2006 study reported benefits both for joint attention intervention and for symbolic play intervention, and a 2007 study found that joint attention intervention is more likely than symbolic play intervention to cause children to engage later in shared interactions.|$|E
