Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a <b>slow</b> <b>cooker</b> or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2It.com {{praised the}} writing of the episode, as well as the acting of Mindy Kaling and Jenna Fischer. [...] Porter also praised the final scene of the episode, when Jan and Michael drive home after the day. [...] Porter stated [...] "I don't know whether to laugh or turn away in shame from that final scene, though, as they bicker about what to eat while they're driving home. It was like {{watching}} two friends fight – fascinating and incredibly uncomfortable at the same time." [...] Christine Fenno, of Entertainment Weekly, stated The Deposition' was a simmering <b>slow</b> <b>cooker</b> of corporate intrigue, flavored by Michael Scott's ridiculousness, with spicy smack talk on the side." [...] Fenno, like Porter, also praised the acting of Jenna Fischer, saying that she [...] "stole the low-key opening scenes". [...] Travis Fickett, of IGN, stated that [...] "this happens to be the best episode of the season {{and one of the best}} episodes of the series. It's almost as if the writers planned it this way – to emphasize their importance and remind us how much we'll miss them when they're gone." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting between Steve Carell (Michael) and Paul Lieberstein (Toby). [...] BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl stated that the episode was an oddity among the series, saying [...] "The Deposition" [...] was an atypical episode of The Office, one that basically put the character of Michael Scott on trial and humiliated him over and over again." ...|$|E

It is usually simmered overnight for 12 hours or more, and eaten for lunch on Shabbat (the Sabbath).

2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Popmatters called Betty Davis [...] "funk like no other. Its closest musical relation is Sly Stone's early '70s molasses" [...] and praising her {{performance on the}} album as [...] "a <b>slow</b> <b>cooker</b> of unbridled lust that teases and passes each beat, and flicks and licks each chord." [...] The magazine noted Davis' [...] "frequent reversing of gender roles and expectations to demonstrate control and strength" [...] Likewise, John Bush of Allmusic called it [...] "an outstanding funk record, driven by her [...] aggressive, no-nonsense songs". In his 1990 biography Miles Davis said of his former wife's musical legacy: [...] "If Betty were singing today she'd be something like Madonna, something like Prince, only as a woman. She {{was the beginning of}} all that when she was singing as Betty Davis." [...] Liner notes from the 2007 re-issue of the album also include the following statement by Carlos Santana: [...] "She was the first Madonna, but Madonna is more like Marie Osmond compared to Betty Davis. Betty was a real ferocious Black Panther woman. You couldn't tame Betty Davis." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, jokingly referring to the music as the [...] "most overstated comic-book sex since Angelfood McSpade". In spite of its flair for rhythm and Davis' concept—"autonomous black woman forges metal funk"—Christgau said the album was marred by her [...] "forced, narrow voice and a complete absence of riff sense or melodic gift".|$|E

50|$|<b>Slow</b> <b>cookers</b> {{are less}} {{dangerous}} than ovens or stove tops {{due to their}} lower operating temperatures and closed lids. However, they still contain {{a large amount of}} foods and liquids at temperatures close to boiling, and they can cause serious scalds if spilled.|$|R
50|$|Recipes {{intended}} for other cooking methods must be modified for <b>slow</b> <b>cookers.</b> Quantities of liquids may need adjustment, {{as there is}} a little evaporation, but there should be enough liquid to cover the food. Many published recipes for <b>slow</b> <b>cookers</b> are designed primarily for convenience and use few ingredients, and often use prepared sauces or seasonings. The long, moist cooking is particularly suitable for tough and cheap cuts of meat including pork shoulder, beef chuck and brisket. For many slow-cooked dishes, these cuts give better results than more expensive ones. They are also often used to cook while no one is there to care for it, meaning the cook can fill the pot with its ingredients and come back several hours later to a ready meal.|$|R

A <b>slow</b> <b>cooker</b> allows any desired cooking time; the more energy-efficient vacuum flask must cook within the time taken for the food to cool below cooking temperature.|$|E

50|$|A basic <b>slow</b> <b>cooker</b> {{consists}} of a lidded round or oval cooking pot made of glazed ceramic or porcelain, surrounded by a housing, usually metal, containing an electric heating element. The lid itself is often made of glass, and seated in a groove in the pot edge; condensed vapor collects in the groove and provides a low-pressure seal to the atmosphere. The contents of a crock pot are effectively at atmospheric pressure, despite the water vapor generated inside the pot. A <b>slow</b> <b>cooker</b> {{is quite different from}} a pressure cooker and presents no danger of an abrupt pressure release.|$|E
