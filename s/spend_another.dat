5|$|The SAR {{task force}} mission leader, Capt. Fred Boli in Sandy 01, called the rescue {{off for the}} time being because it was too dangerous. The {{remaining}} aircraft exited to the south across the Song Meiu Giang. The area was just too hot. Hambleton and Clark would have to <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> night behind the front lines. The North Vietnamese, alerted by the American's intense efforts to find the navigator, increased their efforts to find Hambleton.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> five weeks in Europe, {{and hoped that}} Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the other}} types of supernovae, TypeIa supernovae {{generally}} occur in all types of galaxies, including ellipticals. They show no preference for regions of current stellar formation. As white dwarf stars form {{at the end of}} a star's main sequence evolutionary period, such a long-lived star system may have wandered far from the region where it originally formed. Thereafter a close binary system may <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> million years in the mass transfer stage (possibly forming persistent nova outbursts) before the conditions are ripe for a TypeIa supernova to occur.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> {{two to three weeks}} discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took {{a month and a half}} to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E

50|$|USS Cape Gloucester (CVE-109) was a Commencement Bay-class escort {{carrier of}} the United States Navy, in service from 5 March 1945 to 5 November 1946. After <b>spending</b> <b>another</b> 25 {{years in the}} reserve fleet, the ship was {{scrapped}} in 1971.|$|R
5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.|$|E
5|$|Figard {{spent the}} summer of 1995 working {{at a hotel in}} Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the {{opportunity}} to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes lorry. Bouvier had reservations about the driver, but let her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.|$|E

25|$|On July 27, 1927, {{they closed}} the dam's sluice gates and allowed Dell Creek {{to fill up}} the lake basin that had been {{excavated}} and graded behind the dam. This resulted in a large pooling {{of water from the}} flow of Dell Creek, which was named Lake Delton. Newman had spent $600,000 on the construction by that date and expected to <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> $400,000 to build the resort. They built a lock between the lake and the Wisconsin River to allow small boats and canoes to travel between the bodies of water.|$|E
25|$|In Pakistan in 2007, {{opposition}} was violent to vaccinations in the Northwest Frontier Province, where {{a doctor and}} a health worker in the polio eradication program were killed. Since then, the Taliban has blocked all vaccinations in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. As a result, Pakistan was {{the only country in}} 2010 to record an increase in cases of polio, according to the WHO, along with having the highest incidence of polio in the world. Meanwhile, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has spent $1.5 billion, plans to <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> $1.8 billion through 2018 to help eradicate the virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} challenge changes each year, and {{the teams}} can only reuse certain components from previous years. The robots weigh at most , without batteries and bumpers. The kit issued to each team contains a base set of parts. Registration and the {{kit of parts}} together cost about US$6,000. In addition to that, teams are allowed to <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> $3,500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. Details of the game have been released on the first Saturday in January (except when that Saturday falls on January 1 or 2), and the teams have been given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks.|$|E

At this time, it was estimated that the building could be completed if another $500,000 was raised in 1929. The Grand Lodge of the state of Virginia announced at the meeting that it had agreed to fund the construction of bronze doors for the memorial at a cost of $10,000. At the close of the meeting, the GWMNMA established a formal dedication date of 1932 for the memorial.|$|E

It was then announced in April, prior to the Thruxton round that {{he would return to}} the BTCC, replacing Gordon Shedden. He collected a double win at Donington Park, and added a third win at Oulton Park. After the round at Knockhill, Thompson was replaced by ex-Formula One driver Johnny Herbert due to clashes with his commitments in the WTCC and V8 Supercars.|$|E

25|$|Following the restart of {{organised}} football, Parma {{spent three}} years in Serie B, then split into two regional divisions, before again being relegated in 1948–49 to Serie C. The side would <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> five seasons in Serie C before an eleven-year spell in Serie B that included the achievement of ninth position in 1954–55, a club record at that time. This was {{an era in which}} the club's players generally held down other jobs or were still in education and where the town's amateur rugby union and volleyball sides, Rugby Parma F.C. 1931 and Ferrovieri Parma, proved more popular among the more privileged. Parma made its debut in European competition during the 1960–61 season, defeating Swiss side AC Bellinzona in the Coppa delle Alpi, but relegation to Serie C followed in 1964–65 season. Parma spent just one season in Serie C before a second successive relegation, this time to Serie D, in 1966.|$|E
25|$|The R179s were {{originally}} intended to replace all the R44s, but due to structural integrity issues found on New York City Transit's R44s in early 2010, those cars' retirement was facilitated by an option order of R160s. Additionally, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority later dropped the plan to order R179s for the Staten Island Railway, instead opting to overhaul some R46s to replace the existing R44s there (which has also since been cancelled). The R179s were then intended to retire all remaining R42s (50 cars) and R32s (222 cars). However, some R32s {{are expected to be}} retained due to delays in the delivery of the R179s and potential need of extra rolling stock to provide additional service. As a result, the MTA plans to <b>spend</b> <b>another</b> $49.2 million to refurbish and maintain 132 to 164 R32 cars through 2018 and then 110 R32 cars through 2019, before finally replacing the remaining cars with the R211As. In addition, the MTA plans to deliver most, if not all R179s before the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown in 2019.|$|E
