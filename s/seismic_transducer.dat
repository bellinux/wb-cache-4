40|$|This paper {{presents}} both simulation {{and experimental}} {{results on the}} principal characteristics of vibration energy harvesting with electromagnetic and piezoelectric seismic transducers. The electromagnetic <b>seismic</b> <b>transducer</b> is formed by coil-magnet components connected via soft springs. The piezoelectric <b>seismic</b> <b>transducer</b> is made by a thin cantilever beam with piezoelectric patches bonded {{on the top and}} bottom sides and a block mass fixed at the free end. The two transducers are design and built {{in such a way as}} they have the same weights of the base and suspended masses and the same fundamental natural frequency. A unified lumped parameter model based on the frequency response functions of the electro-mechanical transduction coefficients and mechanical and electrical impedances is derived and validated experimentally. A formulation is thus introduced for the energy harvested with the two transducers. The spectra of the power harvested per unit base vibration of the two harvesters are simulated and validated experimentally...|$|E
40|$|A <b>seismic</b> <b>transducer,</b> {{known as}} an orbital vibrator, {{consists}} of a rotating imbalance driven by an electric motor. When suspended in a liquid-filled wellbore, vibrations of the device are coupled to the surrounding geologic media. In this mode, an orbital vibrator {{can be used as}} an efficient rotating dipole source for seismic imaging. Alternately, the motion of an orbital vibrator is affected by the physical properties of the surrounding media. From this point of view, an orbital vibrator {{can be used as a}} stand-alone sensor. The reaction to the surroundings can be sensed and recorded by geophones inside the orbital vibrator. These reactions are a function of the media’s physical properties such as modulus, damping, and density, thereby identifying the rock type. This presentation shows how the orbital vibrator and surroundings were modeled with an ABAQUS acoustic FEM. The FEM is found to compare favorably with theoretical predictions. A 2 D FEM and analytical model are compared to an experimental data set. Each model compares favorably with the data set...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new flywheel coil–magnet proof mass transducer for vibration energy harvesting. The <b>seismic</b> <b>transducer</b> {{presented in this}} paper includes an additional flywheel element that produces three effects on the elastically suspended proof mass: firstly, it lowers the fundamental resonance frequency, secondly it lowers the static displacement and thirdly it lowers the mechanical damping effect. The combination of all three effects is beneficial for vibration energy harvesting applications. In fact, having a low resonance frequency transducer facilitates the tuning of the harvester to a low frequency band where ambient vibration energy is normally higher. Also, having a low static displacement of the proof mass element allows the construction of a device robust to shocks and fast movements despite it has a low fundamental resonance frequency. Finally, having a low internal mechanical damping leaves more energy for the conversion to electrical energy. The paper presents both simulations and experimental results that contrast the principal electro-mechanical properties and the energy harvesting effects of classical and proposed flywheel coil–magnet proof mass transducers connected to a purely resistive load...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} the relative advantages and complementary aspects of acoustic and seismic ground sensors. A {{detailed description of}} both acoustic and seismic ground sensing methods has been provided. Acoustic and seismic phenomenology including source mechanisms, propagation paths, attenuation, and sensing have been discussed in detail. The effects of seismo-acoustic and acousto-seismic interactions as well as recommendations for minimizing seismic/acoustic cross talk have been highlighted. We have shown representative acoustic and seismic ground sensor data to illustrate the advantages and complementary aspects of the two modalities. The data illustrate that <b>seismic</b> <b>transducers</b> often respond to acoustic excitation through acousto-seismic coupling. Based on these results, we discussed {{the implications of this}} phenomenology on the detection, identification, and localization objectives of unattended ground sensors. We have concluded with a methodology for selecting the preferred modality (acoustic and/or seismic) for a particular application...|$|R
40|$|Batch-fabricated silicon <b>seismic</b> <b>transducers</b> could {{revolutionize}} {{the discipline of}} seismic monitoring by providing inexpensive, easily deployable sensor arrays. Our {{ultimate goal is to}} fabricate seismic sensors with sensitivity and noise performance comparable to short-period seismometers in common use. We expect several phases of development will be required to accomplish that level of performance. Traditional silicon micromachining techniques are not ideally suited to the simultaneous fabrication of a large proof mass and soft suspension, such as one needs to achieve the extreme sensitivities required for seismic measurements. We have therefore developed a novel {open_quotes}mold{close_quotes} micromachining technology that promises to make larger proof masses (in the 1 - 10 mg range) possible. We have successfully integrated this micromolding capability with our surface-micromachining process, which enables the formation of soft suspension springs. Our calculations indicate that devices made in this new integrated technology will resolve down to at least sub-{mu}G signals, and may even approach the 10 {sup - 10 } G/{radical}Hz acceleration levels found in the low-earth-noise model...|$|R
40|$|This note {{describes}} an experimental study aimed at evaluate the vibration properties of a limestone rock vault, {{subjected to the}} forcing action produced by an intense vehicular traffic. The site of study occupies an area of about 3, 000 m 2. The subsoil of the site is characterised by shallow underground cavities due to the past quarry activities. Ambient vibration measurements were done by means of seismometer stations placed on the ground surface. Microtremor stations were arranged above the cavity and in the surrounding area. An innovative coherent radar sensor was installed inside the underground cavity {{in order to measure}} time series of displacement related to different reflector points located on the internal surface of the vault. The experimental vibration properties were derived by means of frequency analyses of both seismic and interferometric data in order to compare the results achieved by using the <b>seismic</b> <b>transducers</b> and the unconventional microwave sensor. Furthermore the preliminary results of numerical simulations were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Batch-fabricated silicon <b>seismic</b> <b>transducers</b> could {{revolutionize}} {{the discipline of}} CTBT monitoring by providing inexpensive, easily deployable sensor arrays. Although {{our goal is to}} fabricate seismic sensors that provide the same performance level as the current state-of-the-art "macro " systems, if necessary one could deploy a larger number of these small sensors at closer proximity to the location being monitored in order to compensate for lower performance. We have chosen a modified pendulum design and are manufacturing prototypes in two different silicon micromachining fabrication technologies. The first set of prototypes, fabricated in our advanced surface-micromachining technology, are currently being packaged for testing in servo circuits- we anticipate that these devices, which have masses in the 1 - 10 pg range, will resolve sub-mG signals. Concurrently, we are developing a novel "mold " micromachining technology that promises to make proof masses in the 1 - 10 mg range possible- our calculations indicate that devices made in this new technology will resolve down to at least sub-gG signals, and may even approach the 10 - 10 G/ýIHz acceleration levels found in the low-earth-noise model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContrary {{to present}} {{external}} microphones, the proposed middle ear microphone does not measure the sound pressure but the acoustic deflection {{of a middle}} ear bone caused by an incoming pressure wave at the ear drum. By means of a <b>seismic</b> inertial <b>transducer,</b> minute vibrations {{in the range from}} 0. 1 to 10 kHz should be measured. The innovation of our new capacitive sensor design is the consideration of the physiology of the ear and hearing characteristics enabling the detection of the ossicle’s vibration more than one decade below the eigenfrequency of the transducer. Additionally, the output dynamic is reduced. Hence, the demands on the signal processing unit are lowered. Finally, this approach leads to lower susceptibility to gravity and instability caused by electrostatic forces...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of a {{lightweight}} piezoelectric transducer is proposed for selective excitation of horizontal polarized shear (SH) waves. Based on piezoelectric fibers the transducers are flexible, i. e. show structure conformity. The novel approach allows to introduce significant surface tractions by a transducer with double layer crossed fiber arrangement without the need of heavy <b>seismic</b> masses. The <b>transducer</b> operating principles are explained {{and the performance of}} a first transducer version is demonstrated by laser vibrometric measuring of the waves emitted into a plate. Numerical modeling of the identical arrangement shows nearly perfect agreement with measurements for the main features while differences in some details helps to understand how the first transducer version can be improved. The transducer exhibits, depending on its aspect ratio, a rather high directivity and a strong mode selectivity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{collects}} {{the results}} of the researches carried out during the Ph. D. course in “Technologies for the Conservation of Architectural and Environmental Heritage” into the School of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the University of Cagliari. The main topics of this research are focused on the experimental dynamic analysis of the structures with prevalent, but not exclusive, interest for the analyses of historic structures. The research deals with several issues concerning both the experimental measurements and the relationships between vibration properties and structural features and materials. The study starts with an introduction, developed into the first chapter, where the general principles of the experimental dynamic analysis methods of structures are presented and summarised, especially for the passive techniques based only on ambient vibrations records. The next chapter presents and describes the main features of the Ground-based Radar Interferometry to perform remote measurements of vibrations, using the phase difference between reflected signals coming {{from the surface of the}} same object inside the radar scenario. This technique has been developed in relatively recent years and has seen a considerable spread thanks to the short time need for the measurements and for the capability to retrieve reliable time series of displacement without any contact sensors above the structures. Furthermore the vibration data, acquired with both conventional systems (such as seismic sensors, velocimeters, accelerometers, etc.) and the microwave interferometer IBIS-S (Image By Intereferometry Survey), have been compared. Different case studies have been examined and critically discussed in the following chapters. In particular, chapter three is focused on the analysis of the vibration properties of an earthquake damaged bell tower located near the epicenter of the Emilia earthquake. Both ex ante and ex post conditions respect to the seismic induced damage have been compared. For this purpose a non-contact dynamic survey has been carried out by means of the radar interferometry method. The campaign of measurements has been conducted after the earthquake to describe the dynamic behaviour of the structure with open fractures pattern and with significant structural damages. Finally, a Finite Element model of the structure has been done in order to compare the actual dynamic response of the tower with that one of the undamaged structure. Chapter four looks at the influence of the vibration artificially induced by the coordinated movement of twenty people to improve main dynamic properties identification of the structure. In this case, the measurements have been carried out using the radar sensor by means of four stations located around the examined structure, the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The measurements have been performed in both operational mode using only wind induced vibrations and also with the artificial human forcing, applied at the top floor of the tower. Chapter five describes both the experimental measurements and the numerical modelling carried out in order to derive the dynamic features of two similar bell towers. The comparison between the dynamic behaviour of the towers is aimed at studying the influence of the mechanical properties of different construction materials. In fact, the towers are symmetrically built on both sides of the main façade of a church but the two structures are made using different materials and with different construction techniques. The oldest tower is a stone masonry building and the second one is a Reinforced Concrete structure. In this case, the analyses have been carried out using vibration data acquired by means of both available systems, i. e. the IBIS-S radar interferometer for the 2 measurements related to the upper parts of the structure (not easily accessible) and some <b>seismic</b> <b>transducers</b> for the stations located inside of the building. Chapter six finally presents the vibration measurements performed on a double curvature arch dam with different reservoir water level in order to analyse the variation of the linear dynamic response of the structure related to the water level height on the upstream side of the dam. The experimental surveys are described and the comparison with a numerical modelling is shown...|$|R
