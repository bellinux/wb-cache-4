5|$|Peckinpah's {{first two}} {{choices for the}} role of Deke Thornton were Richard Harris (who had co-starred in Major Dundee) and Brian Keith (who had worked with Peckinpah on The Westerner (1960) and The Deadly Companions (1961)). Harris was never {{formally}} approached, but Keith was, and turned the part down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World War II action movie The Dirty Dozen (1967). Other actors considered for the role were Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Ben Johnson (later cast as Tector Gorch), and Arthur Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives of serial killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince {{in mind when he}} <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E

500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Losts {{ensemble}} of characters who, {{according to the}} writers, each have good and bad intentions, the writers have said that Keamy is evil and knows it. [...] Durand was contacted for the role after one of Losts show runners <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2007 film [...] [...] Like other Lost actors, Durand was not informed of his character's arc {{when he won the}} role. [...] Throughout Durand's nine-episode stint as a guest star in the fourth season, little was revealed regarding Keamy's life prior to his arrival on the island and Durand cited this as a reason why the audience [...] "loved to hate" [...] his villainous character. [...] Critics praised the writers for breaking Lost tradition and creating a seemingly heartless character, while Durand's performance and appearance were also reviewed positively. [...] Keamy returned in the final season for a tenth and eleventh appearance.|$|E

500|$|In 1978, Rajinikanth {{went on to}} star in 20 {{different}} {{films in}} Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. His first film {{of the year was}} P. Madhavan's Shankar Salim Simon. Following that he was seen in the Kannada film Kiladi Kittu, co-starring Vishnuvardhan, who was then a leading actor in Kannada. His next release, Annadammula Savaal, saw him playing the second lead with Krishna. Rajinikanth reprised his role in the Kannada original. He then {{played an important role in}} Aayiram Jenmangal, which was touted as a supernatural thriller. Next, he played a prime antagonist in Maathu Tappada Maga, his 25th release. Bairavi, directed by M.Bhaskar and released in the same year, was the first Tamil film to cast Rajinikanth as a main hero. It was for this film that he earned the sobriquet [...] "Superstar". S. Thanu, one of the film's distributors, set up a cut-out of Rajinikanth over [...] high. His next appearance Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu, a quadrangular love story written by C. V. Sridhar, <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of a man who sacrifices his love for his friend, played by Kamal Haasan. The film's success prompted Sridhar to remake the film in Telugu, directing Vayasu Pilichindi, which retained the original cast of the Tamil film.|$|E
500|$|J. D. B. was a 13-year-old student {{attending}} Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he {{was taken}} out of class by a uniformed police officer and questioned. J. D. B. had been questioned previously by the police when they <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood where two home break-ins had occurred. [...] After questioning J. D. B. the first time, police learned that a digital camera matching the description of a stolen item had been seen in the possession of J. D. B. This prompted the juvenile investigator assigned to the case to go to the school to question J. D. B. Upon arriving at the school, the investigator informed the uniformed police officer on detail at the school and members of the school's administration. The uniformed officer interrupted the class J. D. B. was in and escorted him to a school conference room, where J. D. B. was subsequently questioned by the investigator, police officer, and members of the schools administration for 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the questioning, J. D. B. was neither given Miranda warnings nor an opportunity to speak to his legal guardian, nor was he informed that he was free to leave the room.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, an 11-year-old British orphan {{raised by}} his unwelcoming aunt and uncle, who learns of his own fame as a wizard known to have survived his parents' murder {{at the hands of}} the psychopathic dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant when he is {{accepted}} to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Columbus had wanted Radcliffe for the role since he <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BBC's production of David Copperfield, before the open casting sessions had taken place, but had been told by Figgis that Radcliffe's protective parents would not allow their son to take the part. Columbus explained that his persistence in giving Radcliffe the role was responsible for Figgis' resignation. Radcliffe was asked to audition in 2000, when Heyman and Kloves met him and his parents at a production of Stones in His Pockets in London. Heyman and Columbus successfully managed to convince Radcliffe's parents that their son would be protected from media intrusion, and they agreed to let him play Harry. Rowling approved of Radcliffe's casting, stating that [...] "having seen [...] screen test I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry." [...] Radcliffe was reportedly paid £1 million for the film, although he felt the fee was [...] "not that important". William Moseley, who was later cast as Peter Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia series, also auditioned for the role.|$|E

2500|$|Director Henry Cornelius {{approached}} More {{during the}} run of The Deep Blue Sea and offered him £3,500 to play {{one of the four}} leads in a comedy, Genevieve (1953) (a part turned down by Guy Middleton). More said Cornelius never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play but cast him {{on the basis of his}} work in The Galloping Major.

2500|$|These three traits—the {{founding}} of a metaphysic {{on the concept}} of the soul and {{on the concept of}} the nation, and the assignment to the latter of reformative-soteriological tasks—distinguished the Polish metaphysicians. [...] Some, such as Hoene-Wroński, saw the Messiah in philosophy itself; others, such as the poet Mickiewicz, <b>saw</b> <b>Him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Polish nation. [...] Hence Hoene-Wroński, and later Mickiewicz, adopted for their doctrines the name, [...] "Messianism". [...] It came to apply generically to Polish metaphysics of the nineteenth century, much as the term [...] "Idealism" [...] does to German metaphysics.|$|E

And in our film you get to see him for real." [...] He {{went on to say that}} his Godzilla remains true to the original in all aspects. Edwards also stressed that, [...] "It was important to me that this felt like a Toho Godzilla" [...] and concluded by wishing, [...] "I'd love ours (Godzilla) to be considered as part of the Toho group." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{a series}} of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets {{a job as a}} {{department}} store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole, where the real Santa Claus has sold out to Hydra. [...] Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. [...] This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp. [...] While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. [...] Although we last <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. [...] The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous. [...] Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead. He then encountered Namor, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains {{that he would not be}} lugging his friend's body if that were the case. [...] Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor. [...] Once he sees that Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says he is returning to Cleveland.|$|E
