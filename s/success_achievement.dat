5000|$|In {{the context}} {{of health care and}} access, power is the ability to exert one's {{influence}} to effect change on the behalf of oneself or others. Prestige is the [...] "reputation or influence arising from <b>success,</b> <b>achievement,</b> rank, or other favorable attributes." [...] Power and prestige are factors in determining a person's place in the social hierarchy, and they manifest themselves in multiple ways. One is power and prestige in the workplace. Those with power in their jobs are able to take days off of work for leisure or to access medical care. According to the Whitehall Studies, a gradient was observed across all levels of employment, with those wielding the greatest amount of power in their jobs having the lowest mortality levels. Another example of the use of power and prestige is the ability to exert political power. Specifically, [...] "electoral engagement is positively correlated with income at the individual level." [...] This demonstrates that those who are of lower socio-economic status are at a disadvantage in terms of the political clout that they possess. Because lower-income individuals are less likely to vote for representatives and for other ballot measures, the policies and laws put into place may not serve their interests.|$|E

Results showed that none of the four distinct types of historical American ethics could gain sole dominance, but a specific blend of success ethics characterizes the national public thinking, with the vast majority of respondents belonging to a cluster best described by strong belief in immoral <b>success</b> <b>achievement</b> and low confidence in hard work-based goal attainment. At the same time, a relatively slow movement towards a more proactive approach to success perception was detected by comparing the results of two earlier researches in Hungary, but having powerful social capital and well-functioning connections still holds the first place on the list of success factors...|$|E

30|$|The most {{significant}} finding {{of this research}} is the important role that achieving subjective success plays in employees' attitudes. The ability to achieve subjective success is substantially more important to attitudes than objective <b>success.</b> <b>Achievement</b> of subjective success criteria accounted for between   81 % and 95 % of the variance explained by our regression models (24 % to 40 % of total variance), despite the prior inclusion of objective success measures. This is a  strong indicator of the role that achieving subjective success plays in the attitudes of employees. As one of the first studies to explore the potential attitudinal outcomes of subjective success, these findings lend support to Abele and Spurk's (2009 a) call for greater research focus on the impact of subjective success. These results also have important implications for organizations. Identifying ways to enhance subjective success experiences will help to enhance job attitudes (job satisfaction, commitment, intention to stay at the organization) which in turn are related to job performance and voluntary turnover as meta-analyses demonstrate (Judge et  al. 2001; Steel and Ovalle 1984; Tett and Meyer 1993).|$|E
