40|$|An {{experimental}} {{procedure for}} obtaining reproducible patina with high leaded tin bronze, B 66 (Cu- 8 Sn- 14 Pb in wt-%) has been devised, followed by its isolation form the substrate and {{examination of the}} electrochemical behaviour in a solution of 0. 2 g. L- 1 Na 2 SO 4 + 0. 2 g. L- 1 NaHCO 3 acidified to pH 3. This test medium <b>simulates</b> strongly <b>acidic</b> <b>rain</b> in urban environment. The patina scraped off from the bronze substrate was filled into a cavity microelectrode. The cyclic voltammetry in the test solution showed one large cathodic peak and one sharp anodic one. The addition of bi-triazole (BiTA) in this test solution showed a marked decrease of the anodic peak current. This compound therefore stabilises the patina covering the bronze artefact. The impedance spectra obtained with cavity microelectrode were interpreted by an equivalent circuit comprising the charge transfer resistance, the double layer capacitance, the resistance and capacitance representing the reversible process taking place at the electrode surface, and the spherical diffusion of the dissolved oxygen. The charge transfer resistance evaluated from a non-linear regression calculation corroborated the inhibiting effect of BiTA suggested form cyclic voltammograms...|$|R

40|$|Unusual strong <b>acidic</b> <b>rain</b> {{recorded}} {{during the}} Iraq War in Japan Sea side 8000 km away from Iraq. In order {{to monitor the}} seasonal change of pH, the rainwater was collected {{during the period from}} March 24 th to September 24 th, 2003 at Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. For comparison, the rainwater at Wakayama (the Pacific Ocean side) was collected, during the period from March 24 th to April 30 th, 2003. The pH, Eh, EC, and DO of the rainwater were measured in laboratory periodically. Filtered rain dusts were investigated by scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX), electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (ED-XRF), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses. In this study, the fluctuation of pH values and electrical conductivity (EC) of rainwater during this half-year period were measured to find abnormal events, such as the Iraq War effects. Since March 21 st, 2003, Iraq plunged into the war. The more than 30 oil field fires in Rumaylah, Basrah, Mosul, and other oil fields near the borderline of Kuwait and Iran were reported in March and in April, 2003 in Japan. The first precipitation during the Iraq War was caught on March 24 th, 2003. In the period from March 24 th to April 5 th, the notable low pH value of 3. 4 - 4. 4 and high EC value of 20 - 360 ƒﾊS/cm were detected in Kanazawa. The <b>acidic</b> <b>rain</b> associated with WNW wind (2. 7 - 4. 1 m/s) has continued to the first 10 days of April in Kanazawa, during the 9 oil fields were burning in Rumaylah, Iraq. In the same time, the upper current of air maps confirmed that the 5520 - 5700 m lines cross over and spread on both Iraq and Japanese Honshu Island. It is considered that westerly wind crossed over both Iraq and Japan. The high EC values from March 24 th to April 5 th, 2003, suggest that high concentrations of water-soluble carbon particles and soot contained in the rainwater. In addition, the black powdery dusts were detected from the strong acidic rainwater on April 1 st. The powdery dusts and carbon-bearing particles contained in the rainwater have characteristics {{different from that of the}} Asian aerosol particles (Kosa). The results suggest that both powdery dusts and carbon-bearing particles of rainwater have been produced by combustion of oil field in Iraq. Simulation data support the directly cycling by westerly wind indicating the influence of the Iraq War. Possible evidences provided in this paper, such as strong <b>acidic</b> <b>rain</b> and high EC values with nm-sized carbon soot at lapan Sea side, was the influence of the Iraq War. It was suggested that local events affect the global atmospheric environments. Smoke from oil field fires around Baghdad and other wartime pollution could create long-term health hazards...|$|R

Under these conditions, framework grains and cement are again subjected to dissolution and in turn increasing porosity. On the other hand, telogenesis can also change framework grains to clays, thus reducing porosity.
