5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E

5|$|Titanics down angle altered fairly rapidly {{from zero}} degrees to about {{four and a}} half degrees during the first hour after the collision, but {{the rate at which the}} ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, {{worsening}} only to about five degrees.

By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E
5|$|The league {{approached}} the 1996 Grey Cup in dire financial straits: the American expansion {{had been a}} failure, the 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise ceased operations {{at the conclusion of}} the regular season, and out of the eight remaining teams, seven had lost money and two required direct assistance from the league to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> The Edmonton Eskimos could not afford to bring their players' families to the championship game. The Toronto Star echoed fears spoken by fans and media across the country when it asked if the 1996 championship, won by Toronto over Edmonton, would be the final Grey Cup.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E

5|$|Luton Town's {{first ground}} was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton train line, and players {{regularly}} claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E
5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} this decline was the club's ongoing {{financial}} problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then {{on the outskirts of}} urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. To <b>stay</b> <b>afloat,</b> Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By {{the end of the decade}} the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris, who was also the chairman of Fulham.|$|E
5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E
5|$|In central Bristol, {{where the}} river is tidal, it is {{diverted}} from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as the Floating Harbour. The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately entwined with Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the Floating Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|E
