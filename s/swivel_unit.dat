40|$|Disclosed is a {{new idea}} for a {{submarine}} craft and its applications. The most significant feature of the submarine craft is its annular shaped hull through which water can easily pass through {{with or without the}} aid of a pump. The internal profile of the annular passage resembles to that of a convergent-divergent duct to help speed up the flow in the duct. The usefulness of the peculiar idea of the submarine craft allows it to operate as a surface skimmer as well as a submerged craft to allow purification of both surface and underwater contaminations. Its principle of operation is based either on a main wing providing the neutral buoyancy (e. g. the lifting force) or small positive buoyancy that can be adjusted with the addition/removal of small weights or the use of pressurized tanks for positive/negative buoyancy, an elevator for longitudinal and depth control, a rudder for directional control and a propeller or a ribbon-drive based propulsion system. The ribbon-drive propulsion system, if used, can also act as an effective pump to help increase the water flow rate through the annular shaped hull. Moreover, the ribbon-drive propulsion system can be attached to a <b>swivel</b> <b>unit</b> for longitudinal and directional control with/without the traditional use of rudders and elevators. The operation of the ribbon-drive based propulsion system can either be remotely controlled or programmed for the desired operation, e. g. a desired sweep of a body of water in length, breadth and depth. The novel idea of the submarine craft can be effectively utilized, for example, for purification or filtration of contaminated water in pools, ponds, fresh-water lakes, seas, and water reservoirs, among other uses. For example, use of a series of filters within the annular shaped hull can help remove contaminants from the water. Appropriate filters associated with different contaminants, for example, filters constituting of hydrophobic membrane can be used to filter sun tan or bathing oils, or filters constituting of granular activated carbon (GAC) can be used to filter methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), etc. The filtration rate can be increased by the use of a screw-propeller type pump within the annular shaped hull to pump the water through a series of filters. Moreover, filters of varying degrees {{can be used to make}} the filtration process more efficient. In addition to water purification or filtration, the submarine craft can also be used for remote water quality or environment monitoring or observation through the installation of lighting, camera, guidance and monitoring devices in the fore part of the hull. Another application for the submarine can be related to underwater environment study or search and surveillance. The submarine craft can be configured for any one or a combination of the above or related applications. In addition to the above, underwater environmental studies and quality monitoring are some of the more recent concerns related to a pollution-free environment. The submarine craft idea is based on use of batteries and electric motors which in itself provides a pollution-free operation of the craf...|$|E

50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, 0-6-0+0-6-0 represents the wheel arrangement of an articulated locomotive with two separate <b>swivelling</b> engine <b>units,</b> each unit with no leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels. The arrangement is effectively two 0-6-0 locomotives operating back-to-back and was used on Garratt, Double Fairlie, Meyer and Kitson-Meyer articulated locomotives. A similar arrangement exists for Mallet steam locomotives on which only the front engine <b>unit</b> <b>swivels,</b> but these {{are referred to as}} 0-6-6-0.|$|R

50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, 2-6-0+0-6-2 represents the wheel arrangement of an articulated locomotive with two separate <b>swivelling</b> engine <b>units,</b> arranged back to back with the boiler and cab suspended between them. Each engine unit has two leading wheels in a leading truck, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels.|$|R
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, the 4-6-0+0-6-4 is a Garratt articulated locomotive. The wheel arrangement is effectively two 4-6-0 ten-wheeler locomotives operating back to back, with the boiler and cab suspended between the two <b>swivelling</b> power <b>units.</b> Each power unit has two pairs of leading wheels in a leading bogie, followed by three coupled pairs of driving wheels and no trailing wheels.|$|R
50|$|A similar wheel {{arrangement}} {{exists for}} Mallet type locomotives, but {{is referred to}} as 4-6-6-4. On a Mallet locomotive, only the front engine <b>unit</b> <b>swivels</b> while the rear unit is rigid in relation to the main frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver was}} {{seated on a}} Brooks bicycle saddle, which in {{recognition}} of the lack of vehicle suspension, was carried {{on the end of a}} cantilevered bar that acted as a leaf spring. A wide handlebar on the engine group was used for steering. A squeeze bar the width of this handlebar engaged the clutch. Controls included a hand throttle, a gear lever with two forward and one reverse gears, and a large handbrake lever. The engine unit rotated freely for a full 360° rotation. When used in reverse, the Auto-Truck could either be driven from the saddle, looking backwards over the driver's shoulder; or they could dismount, <b>swivel</b> the engine <b>unit</b> around and control it as a pedestrian-controlled truck from behind.|$|R
50|$|The {{front engine}} <b>unit</b> <b>swivelled</b> under the boiler and smokestack, {{in a similar}} manner to a Meyer and looking {{somewhat}} like a Mallet; in contrast a Garratt had its front bogie in front of the boiler. The rear engine unit was placed underneath the tender, {{in a manner similar to}} a Garratt; however a Garratt carried its coal and water directly on the rear bogie, while the Golwé carried them on the central frame. The rear bogie cylinders were placed under the cab, at the front of the rear unit. A float-controlled automatic device reduced the cut-off of the rear cylinders to prevent slipping when the water tank was running low. The firebox hung low between the two engine units, and so could be of generous size.|$|R
40|$|Simplicity of {{formation}} of the monolithic reinforced concrete and benefits of its use in the restrained conditions of the terrain make its application lucrative. Retaining walls and stairs are the most widely spread monolithic concrete elements used in the landscaping of private allotment gardens on the terrain. In the article, the authors propose their design solutions for reinforced concrete elements integrated into the landscaping of allotment gardens on the terrain: a sheet-pile retaining wall with stairs and a monolithic reinforced concrete arch bridge. The authors provide their sample analysis of a monolithic sheet-pile retaining wall with a stairs. Its steps and stair-head were analyzed as flexural elements tightly coupled with the retaining wall, with a platform on three sides and steps on two sides. There are formwork drawings and reinforcement drawings of a monolithic sheet-pile retaining wall with a stairs in the article. Analysis of a monolithic reinforced concrete arch bridge was performed using LIRA software. To reduce the temperature and shrinkage stresses in an arch bridge, as well as stresses that arise in it in case of installation of supports, a two-hinged arch {{was chosen as the}} design bridge model. There are dimensions of the formwork, pattern of the steel frame of the reinforced concrete arch bridge and the design solution of a <b>swivel</b> support <b>unit</b> in the article.
