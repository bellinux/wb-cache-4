The plots were laid out along the topography of the Xiaoshegou catchment area, {{at a distance of}} 3  km west of the research station. Five soil samples at 20  cm depth were taken using a 4 -cm diameter soil auger to assess the soil condition of each forest plot in late August; these samples were then mixed and combined into a single sample after passing through a 2  cm <b>sieve</b> <b>screen</b> to separate rocks and debris. Each composite soil sample was separated into two sub-samples. One sub-sampled was transported in an ice-cooled container to the Key Laboratory for Forest Resources & Ecosystem Processes of the Beijing Forestry University. Soil physicochemical properties were analyzed with air-dried soil of 20  g being ground and passed through a 0.18 -mm <b>sieve</b> <b>screen.</b> SOC content was analyzed via the standard Mebius method (Nelson and Sommers 1982). TN content was analyzed following the Kjeldahl digestion procedure and ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 - N) was colorimetrically measured by the alkali method with a Tector KJeltec 1025 Distilling system (Gallaher et al. 1976). The soil pH was measured in deionized H 2 O with a water to soil ratio of 2.5 : 1 using the Sartorius AG method (PB- 10, Sartorius, Germany). The water holding capacity (WHC) was determined by saturating 20  g fresh soil above a filter paper in a 10 -cm glass funnel, and then permitting the water to drain for 4 – 6  h before being weighed (n[*]=[*] 5). The saturated soils were then oven-dried at 105  °C to a constant mass, until the WHC was equal to the percentage of water retained after several hours’ drainage (for 100 % WHC). Soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen contents were measured using the chloroform-fumigation method with a mean calibration factor kC of 0.38 (Vance et al. 1987 a, 1987 b).

The mean weight percentage of each particle size is shown in Table  2. For each type of particle, the largest mass fraction was collected in the 10 -mesh sieve, which had an opening of 2.0  mm. M-board type particles were mainly distributed in three fractions: 15  % in the 5 (+) sieve, 64  % in the 10 (+) sieve, and 16  % in the 20 (+) sieve. These three fractions constituted 95  % of M-board type particles screened. Approximately 90  % of Dk-board particles were in two fractions, the 5 (+) and 10 (+) sieves. There were no large differences in the ratios between M- and Mt-board particles, which originated from the same source. Among the seven particle types, Ms-board particles were distributed more widely in these fractions. About 5  % was collected on the 40 -mesh screen and 6  % passed through the 40 mesh.

Two types of cereals (barley and sorghum) were ground, {{and the resulting}} grounds separated by size using sieving, with sizes ranging from similar to 0. 1 to similar to 3 mm. In vitro enzymatic digestion was performed, using pancreatic alpha-amylase, amyloglucosidase and protease, to determine fractional-digestion rates over 24 h. The resulting glucose production rate data were well fitted by simple first-order kinetics. For each <b>sieve</b> <b>screen</b> size, the digestion rate of barley was always {{higher than that of}} sorghum. The rate coefficients for digestion showed a decrease with increasing size, and could be well fitted by an inverse square relationship. This is consistent with the supposition that starch digestion in these systems is controlled by diffusion of enzyme through the grain fragment.

30|$|As {{discussed}} before, the sieve {{method is}} {{not suitable for}} analyzing the particle size distribution in the respirable range. Since the proposed dust control approach is targeted to the reduction of respirable dust, characterization of the particle size distribution of the drilling dust in the respirable range is of high importance. In this step, a newly acquired CILAS 1190 Laser particle size analyzer is used to perform the more detailed size distribution analysis. This laser based particle analyzer can provide a measurement range between 0.04 and 2500  μm via the volume distribution. Measurement were made in liquid mode using water as the medium. The amount of sample placed into the particle size analyzer for analysis should be appropriate since “too much” sample in the system would result in high obscurations and erroneous measurement. Trial tests indicate that a rock dust sample amounting between 300 and 1000  mg is proper considering the particle size range. It is also found that too much coarser particles in the sample would cause inaccurate measurement as it settles quickly in water medium. Attempts were made to use the particle size analyzer to test on the dust samples up to 2500  μm in size {{but it is hard}} to obtain representative small sample in such a wide size range.

40|$|Conventional size {{segregation}} or screening in batch mode, using stacked vibrated screens, {{is often a}} time-consuming process. Utilization of centrifugal force instead of gravity as the primary body force can significantly shorten the time to segregate feedstock into a set of different-sized fractions. Likewise, under reduced gravity or microgravity, a centrifugal sieve system would function {{as well as it}} does terrestrially. When vibratory and mechanical blade <b>sieving</b> <b>screens</b> designed for terrestrial conditions were tested under lunar gravity conditions, they did not function well. The centrifugal sieving design of this technology overcomes the issues that prevented sieves designed for terrestrial conditions from functioning under reduced gravity. These sieves feature a rotating outer (cylindrical or conical) screen wall, rotating fast enough for the centrifugal forces near the wall to hold granular material against the rotating <b>screen.</b> Conventional centrifugal <b>sieves</b> have a stationary screen and rapidly rotating blades that shear the granular solid near the stationary screen, and effect the sieving process assisted by the airflow inside the unit. The centrifugal sieves of this new design may (or may not) have an inner blade or blades, moving relative to the rotating wall screen. Some continuous flow embodiments would have no inner auger or blades, but achieve axial motion through vibration. In all cases, the shearing action is gentler than conventional centrifugal sieves, which have very high velocity differences between the stationary outer screen and the rapidly rotating blades. The new design does not depend on airflow in the sieving unit, so it will function just as well in vacuum as in air. One advantage of the innovation for batch sieving is that a batch-mode centrifugal sieve may accomplish the same sieving operation in much less time than a conventional stacked set of vibrated screens (which utilize gravity as the primary driving force for size separation). In continuous mode, the centrifugal sieves can provide steady streams of fine and coarse material separated from a mixed feedstock flow stream. The centrifugal sieves can be scaled to any desired size and/or mass flow rate. Thus, they could be made in sizes suitable for small robotic exploratory missions, or for semi-permanent processing of regolith for extraction of volatiles of minerals. An advantage of the continuous-mode system is that it can be made with absolutely no gravity flow components for feeding material into, or for extracting the separated size streams from, the centrifugal sieve. Thus, the system is capable of functioning in a true microgravity environment. Another advantage of the continuous-mode system is that some embodiments of the innovation have no internal blades or vanes, and thus, can be designed to handle a very wide range of feedstock sizes, including occasional very large oversized pieces, without jamming or seizing up...|$|R
