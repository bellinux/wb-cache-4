Then two maiden aunts with a maid named Carmela move into the long-vacant apartment, and so Leon and Basil pretend to accost Carmela while Pero comes to her [...] "rescue" [...] to secure a date in the hope of stealing her keys.

50|$|During his sixteenth summer, Gunnar aids in his friends' {{stealing}} a department <b>store</b> <b>safe</b> during {{the turmoil of}} the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. We learn that Psycho Loco has planned to steal the safe for nine years in retribution for the department store's having moved a race-car set the young Psycho intended to steal {{on the day he}} was to steal it. As Gunnar and his friends attempt to load the safe into a car, Gunnar's father and other policemen arrive. Gunnar's father beats him with a nightstick, and Gunnar is hospitalized. When he is released from the hospital, he learns that his friends have been unable to open the safe. Gunnar turns the safe over, finding the combination on the bottom, and opens it. Gunnar refuses to take any of the money, gold, and precious stones inside. In the last two weeks of summer, Gunnar attends a program for the top 100 high school basketball talents in the country, of which Gunnar is number 100. From camp, he sends his friends and family several e-mails, which are documented in the novel. From these e-mails, we learn that both of Gunnar's sisters are pregnant and have moved in with their father. We also learn that Gunnar, despite his basketball talent, is not incredibly interested in the game itself. He is constantly frustrated by his roommates' insistence on constantly talking about the game. Gunnar notes that his roommates even use basketball terms to talk about women.|$|E

40|$|We present SAFE, an {{integrated}} system for managing trust using a logic-based declarative language. Logical trust systems authorize each request by constructing a proof from a context [...] -a set of authenticated logic statements representing credentials and policies issued by various principals in a networked system. A key barrier to practical use of logical trust systems {{is the problem}} of managing proof contexts: identifying, validating, and assembling the credentials and policies that are relevant to each trust decision. This paper describes a new approach to managing proof contexts using context linking and caching. Credentials and policies are stored as certified logic sets named by secure identifiers in a shared key-value <b>store.</b> <b>SAFE</b> offers language constructs to build and modify logic sets, link sets to form unions, pass them by reference, and add them to proof contexts. SAFE fetches and validates credential sets on demand and caches them in the authorizer. We evaluate and discuss our experience using SAFE to build secure services based on case studies drawn from practice: a secure name service resolver, a secure proxy shim for a key value store, and an authorization module for a networked infrastructure-as-a-service system with a federated trust structure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the management structure, organizational profile, and technical focus of Institute for High Performance Computing Applications (HPC) in Air Armament (IHAAA). Formed in 2005 as a six year program, the institute {{is intended to}} address a series of technically complex issues associated with the certification of air armament weapons systems on modern air and rotorcraft. The inherent nature of these technical issues spans multiple disciplines, including flutter, weapon and <b>store</b> <b>safe</b> separation, aerodynamic loads, stability & control, and electromagnetic compatibility. These technical areas also encompass the weapon certification and air worthiness processes of all three services, making a DoD-level effort a well-motivated joint initiative. Now in the fifth fiscal year, the institute has produced a variety of technically enabling and cost-saving tools applicable within the air armament community. Numerous examples and success stories are provided that exhibit and highlight these tools. The institute also maintains a close and vital association with the HPC CREATE AV and Kestrel in particular, {{as many of the}} institute projects directly relate to the development approach of Kestrel.

40|$|Abstract- Exceptionally leaky {{transistors}} {{are increasingly}} more frequent in nano-scale technologies due to lower threshold voltage and its increased variation. Such leaky transistors may even change position {{with changes in}} the operating voltage and temperature, and hence, redundancy at circuit-level {{is not sufficient to}} tolerate such threats to yield. We show that in SRAM cells this leakage depends on the cell value and propose a first software-based runtime technique that suppresses such abnormal leakages by <b>storing</b> <b>safe</b> values in the corresponding cache lines before going to standby mode. Analysis shows the performance penalty is, in the worst case, linearly dependent to the number of so-cured cache lines while the energy saving linearly increases by the time spent in standby mode. Analysis and experimental results on commercial processors confirm that the technique is viable if the standby duration is more than a small fraction of a second. ...|$|R
