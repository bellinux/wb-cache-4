40|$|We study {{sourcing}} {{decisions in}} {{a supply chain}} with three levels: Tier 2 <b>suppliers</b> that sell to Tier 1 <b>suppliers,</b> Tier 1 <b>suppliers</b> that sell to a manufacturer, and a manufacturer that sells finished goods to the market. The <b>suppliers</b> in Tier 2 are prone to independent disruption risk due to, e. g., natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods. The manufacturer may not directly dictate which Tier 2 <b>suppliers</b> are used, but may influence the sourcing decisions of Tier 1 <b>suppliers</b> via the contract parameters it offers to Tier 1 <b>suppliers.</b> We show that the manufacturer’s optimal sourcing strategy depends critically {{on the degree of}} overlap in the upper levels of the supply chain: generally speaking, as overlap in Tier 2 increases (i. e., as Tier 1 <b>suppliers</b> have more Tier 2 <b>suppliers</b> in common), the manufacturer should rely less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multi-sourcing in Tier 1) and rely more on indirect mitigation (increasing the price offered to Tier 1 <b>suppliers</b> to induce them to procure excess inventory and multi-source). We demonstrate that, predictably, a supply chain with no overlap (Tier 1 <b>suppliers</b> share no Tier 2 <b>suppliers)</b> yields the greatest profit for the manufacturer; surprisingly, however, a supply chain in which Tier 1 <b>suppliers</b> share their most reliable (but still prone to disruption) Tier 2 <b>suppliers</b> performs equally well in many cases, implying that it is most important for a manufacturer to ensure its Tier 1 <b>suppliers</b> are diversified amongst their riskiest Tier 2 <b>suppliers.</b> Lastly, we consider the manufacturer’s sourcing problem if it does not know the structure o...|$|R

40|$|Developments in {{environmental}} {{issues in the}} last few years have been forcing manufacturing companies to improve their environmental performances. Many firms developed integrated relationships with their <b>suppliers</b> to increase their environmental performance and to decrease their hazardous effects on the environment. Then, selecting suitable and green <b>suppliers</b> in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. A performance evaluation system for green <b>suppliers</b> is necessary to determine the suitability of <b>suppliers</b> to cooperate with the firm. Therefore, in this study, a model for evaluating green performance of <b>suppliers</b> is proposed, and a hybrid multicriteria decision making model is developed in order to evaluate green performance of the <b>suppliers.</b> The analytical network process technique is applied to handle the relationships and dependence of selection criteria and subcriteria and determine weights of the criteria. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is used to sequence the <b>suppliers</b> for ideal solution of the suppliers’ green performance evaluation problem. After a comprehensive literature survey, evaluation criteria of green performance for <b>suppliers</b> are determined. Finally, green performance of 18 <b>suppliers</b> of an automobile company was evaluated by this model. These 18 <b>suppliers</b> manufacture chassis and its components...|$|R
40|$|I present novel direct {{evidence}} on the static and dynamic impact of producer firms on local <b>suppliers</b> based on several firm level surveys that I conducted among producer firms and <b>suppliers</b> in Nuevo León, Mexico. I find {{that the level of}} use of <b>suppliers</b> does not differ between foreign direct investment (FDI) and Mexican producer firms. Next, I find substantial evidence that FDI firms generate a larger local dynamic impact; foreign-owned firms apply more pressure on their <b>suppliers</b> to improve and are also significantly more involved in the provision of several types of technological and organisational support. In extension of these findings, I use multivariate analysis to identify characteristics of <b>suppliers</b> and supply linkages that influence the dynamic impact among <b>suppliers.</b> I find that the level of absorptive capacity of <b>suppliers,</b> the size of the technology gap between producer firms and <b>suppliers,</b> and the provision of support by producer firms all enhance the likelihood that <b>suppliers</b> experience a large positive dynamic impact. Importantly, even when I control for the effects of these factors, <b>suppliers</b> of FDI firms are still significantly more likely to experience a large positive impact. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} purchasing {{transactions and}} ownership ties between 11 Japanese automakers and 237 <b>suppliers.</b> Although automakers' equity stakes in <b>suppliers</b> are highly symbolic, they play an economic role as well. Automakers hold shares of <b>suppliers</b> that dedicate {{to them a}} large percentage of output, <b>suppliers</b> from which they purchase many different parts, <b>suppliers</b> of difficult to manufacture parts, and small <b>suppliers,</b> indicating that ownership stakes in <b>suppliers</b> are credible commitments facilitating relationship-specific investments. Consistent with a transaction cost interpretation but in contrast to predictions of resource dependence theory, the total number of <b>suppliers</b> and the degree of an automaker's internal production of a part are not related to ownership stakes. I conclude that embeddedness and transaction cost explanations are complementary: embedded ties can serve as a transaction-cost minimizing governance structure. I further conclude that buyer-supplier relationships in the Japanese automotive industry reflect a logic of commitment rather than a logic of control and exploitation...|$|R
