5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> collective clan crest, just as there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> clan coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} part of his book is {{about the nature of}} genius. Weininger argues that there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.|$|E
25|$|The popular {{mind was}} taken with Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique. This was {{accompanied}} by other feminist philosophers, such as Alicia Ostriker and Adrienne Rich. These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values like objectivity and what {{they believe to be}} masculine approaches to ethics, such as rights-based political theories. They maintained there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> value-neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues.|$|E

25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E
25|$|Newton's {{theories}} {{assumed that}} motion takes place {{against the backdrop}} of a rigid Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout all space and all time. Gravity is mediated by a mysterious force, acting instantaneously across a distance, whose actions are independent of the intervening space. In contrast, Einstein denied that there is any background Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout space. Nor is there any <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> force of gravitation, only the structure of spacetime itself.|$|E
25|$|By {{reporting}} {{ongoing and}} often unfinished scientific work that may otherwise {{have not been}} reported, the journal had a central function of being a scientific news service. At the time of Philosophical Transactions foundation, print was heavily regulated, {{and there was no}} <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> free press. In fact, the first English newspaper, The London Gazette (which was an official organ of Government and therefore seen as sanitised), did not appear until after Philosophical Transactions in the same year.|$|E

25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield. Those innocents {{who were}} murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We {{need to be very}} clear about this. On the streets of London there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.|$|E
25|$|According to Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organisation, all Post-Soviet {{states that}} buy gas from Gazprom should pay market prices {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of their economies. Lamy stated {{that it would have}} been easier to resolve the conflict if both Russia and Ukraine had been WTO members. Moreover, he added that the problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient energy uses amongst the states. He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect that there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E
25|$|Stilwell’s home, {{built in}} 1933–1934 on Carmel Point, Carmel, California, remains a private home. A number of streets, buildings, and areas {{across the country}} have been named for Stilwell over the years, {{including}} Joseph Stilwell Middle School in Jacksonville, Florida. The Soldiers’ Club he envisioned in 1940 (a time when there was no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> soldiers’ club in the Army) was completed in 1943 at Fort Ord on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay. Many years later the building was renamed “Stilwell Hall” in his honor, but because of the erosion of the bluffs over the decades, the building was taken down in 2003. Stilwell's former residence in Chongqing – a city along the Yangtze River to which Chiang's government retreated after being forced from Nanjing by Japanese troops – has now been converted to the General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum in his honor.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} some {{languages}} {{are superior to}} others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread in the early 20th century. American linguist William Dwight Whitney, for example, actively strove to eradicate Native American languages, arguing that their speakers were savages and {{would be better off}} learning English and adopting a civilized way of life. The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this view was Franz Boas. While undertaking geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the Inuit people and decided to become an ethnographer. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that there was no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he {{was among the first to}} require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture under study and to document verbal culture such as myths and legends in the original language.|$|E
25|$|Check hook : A check hook is {{employed}} to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part {{consists of a}} regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking {{it has been said}} that there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. Floyd Mayweather, Jr. employed the use of a check hook against Ricky Hatton, which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.|$|E
25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, oh God, that my foot is reluctant"). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E
