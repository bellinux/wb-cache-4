By 1971, some 194,600 lived within the area which would become Knowsley. However, {{over the next two decades}} general economic decline - particularly in manufacturing - contributed to a significant fall in population to around 154,600 by 1994. Subsequently, a population <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategy</b> helped to stem this decline. The strategy was focused on house building and marketing the borough to secure inward investment. Record house building and strong growth in inward investment yielded the borough's first small rise in population in over 25 years in 1995. The population stabilised at over 154,000 for most of the rest of the nineties.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{multilayer}} networks {{is in its}} early stages, and its development provides vital methods for understanding complex systems. Multilayer networks, in their multiplex form, have been introduced within {{the last three years}} to analysing the structure of financial systems, and existing studies have modelled and evaluated interdependencies of different type among financial institutions. These studies, however, have considered the structure as a non-interconnected multiplex - an ensemble of single layer networks comprising the same nodes - rather than as an interconnected multiplex network. No mechanism of multichannel contagion has been modelled and empirically evaluated, and no multichannel <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies</b> for pre-emptive contagion containment have been designed. This paper formulates an interconnected multiplex structure, and a contagion mechanism among financial institutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions activity within different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial market. We introduce structural measures of absolute systemic risk and resilience, and relative systemic-risk indexes. Based on the contagion mechanism and systemic-risk quantification, this study designs minimum-cost <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies</b> that act simultaneously on different markets and their interconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion progressing through the overall structure. The <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies</b> subtly affect the emergence process of structure to adaptively build in structural resilience and achieve pre-emptive stabilisation at a minimum cost for each institution and at no cost for the system as a whole. We empirically evaluate the new approach using large granular databases, maintained by the Prudential Regulatory Authority of the Bank of England. The capabilities of multichannel stabilisation are confirmed empirically. Comment: 35 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 35 equation...|$|R

A small island economy has limited exportable and hence highly depends on imports for both consumption and production purposes. A devaluation, therefore, inflates domestic price and appreciates the real exchange immediately by raising importable consumption and discouraging imports used in domestic production. The paper applies various econometric models for empirical investigation of its impact and transmission mechanism. Strong long-run relationship found between real exchange rate and trade balance explains that appreciation of currency {{has been responsible for}} the rising trade deficit in the economy. Moreover, the devaluation did not demonstrate J-curve phenomenon.

30|$|Currently in CSG wells {{drilled in}} the Surat Basin the typical clay <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategy</b> {{is to use}} {{drilling}} fluids containing 4  wt% KCl. This approach has been demonstrated {{for many years in}} different reservoir types. However, there are some limitations associated with these stabilisers either because their effectiveness typically only lasts for a short period once the CSG well is in production and being continuously flushed with fresh water, or because the treatments are sensitive to pH and temperature changes (Anderson et al. 2010). Several research teams (Baird and Walz 2006; Jung et al. 2011; Pham and Nguyen 2014) have proposed the use of nanoparticles in drilling muds or injected into reservoirs to control swelling clay and fines generation in sandstone formations, but the mechanisms by which nanoparticles control clay swelling are obscure and nanoparticle technology is currently too costly for widespread application in onshore CSG fields.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{emergency}} pollution management measures were enacted after the accidental release of caustic bauxite processing residue {{that occurred in}} Ajka, western Hungary in October, 2010. These centred on acid and gypsum dosing to reduce pH and minimise mobility of oxyanion contaminants mobile at high pH. This study assessed the effectiveness of gypsum dosing on contaminant mobility and carbon sequestration through assessment of red mud and gypsum-affected fluvial sediments via elemental analysis and stable isotope analysis. There was a modest uptake of contaminants (notably As, Cr, and Mn) on secondary carbonate-dominated deposits in reaches subjected to gypsum dosing. C and O stable isotope ratios of carbonate precipitates formed {{as a result of}} gypsum dosing were used to quantify the importance of the neutralisation process in sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide. This process was particularly pronounced at sites most affected by gypsum addition, where up to 36 % of carbonate-C appears to be derived from atmospheric in-gassing of CO 2. The site is discussed as a large scale analogue for potential remedial approaches and carbon sequestration technologies that could be applied to red mud slurries and other hyperalkaline wastes. The results of this work have substantial implications for the aluminium production industry in which 3 - 4 % of the direct CO 2 emissions may be offset by carbonate precipitation. Furthermore, carbonation by gypsum addition may be important for contaminant remediation, also providing a physical <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategy</b> for the numerous historic stockpiles of red mud...|$|E

Applications are considered that range from the hydro-elasticity of hull panels of high-speed ships to the aero-elasticity of glass panels in the curtain walls of high-rise buildings in very strong winds. A two-dimensional linear analysis is conducted using a hybrid of theoretical and computational methods that calculates the system eigen-states but {{can also be used to}} capture the transient behaviour that precedes these. We show that localised stiffening is a very effective means to increase the divergence-onset flow speed in both hydro- and aero-elastic applications. It is most effective when located at the mid-chord of the panel and there exists an optimum value of added stiffness beyond which further increases to the divergence-onset flow speed do not occur. For aero-elastic applications, localised stiffening can be used to replace the more destructive flutter instability that follows divergence at higher flow speeds by an extended range of divergence. The difference in eigen-solution morphology between aero- and hydro-elastic applications is highlighted, showing that for the former coalescence of two non-oscillatory divergence modes is the mechanism for flutter onset. This variation in solution morphology is mapped out in terms of a non-dimensional mass ratio. Finally, we present a short discussion of the applicability of the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategy</b> in a full three-dimensional system...|$|E

Identification of plasma protease derived metabolites of glucagon and their formation under typical laboratory sample handling conditions. Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 29 (2), pp. 171 - 181., which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-ArchivingCopyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. RATIONALE Glucagon modulates glucose production, and it is also a biomarker for several pathologies. It is known to be unstable in human plasma, and consequently stabilisers are often added to samples, although these are not particularly effective. Despite this, there have not been any studies to identify in vitro plasma protease derived metabolites; such a study is described here. Knowledge of metabolism should allow the development of more effective sample <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies.</b> METHODS Several novel metabolites resulting from the incubation of glucagon in human plasma were identified using high-resolution mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionisation. Tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) scans were acquired for additional confirmation using a QTRAP. Separation was performed using reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. The formation of these metabolites was investigated during a time-course experiment and under specific stress conditions representative of typical laboratory handling conditions. Clinical samples were also screened for metabolites. RESULTS Glucagon 3 - 29 and [pGlu] 3 glucagon 3 - 29 were the major metabolites detected, both of which were also present in clinical samples. We also identified two oxidised forms of [pGlu] 3 glucagon 3 - 29 as well as glucagon 19 - 29, or 'miniglucagon', along with the novel metabolites glucagon 20 - 29 and glucagon 21 - 29. The relative levels of these metabolites varied throughout the time-course experiment, and under the application of the different sample handling conditions. Aprotinin stabilisation of samples had negligible effect on metabolite formation. CONCLUSIONS Novel plasma protease metabolites of glucagon have been confirmed, and their formation characterised over a time-course experiment and under typical laboratory handling conditions. These metabolites could be monitored to assess the effectiveness of new sample <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies,</b> and further investigations into their formation could suggest specific enzyme inhibitors to use to increase sample stability. In addition the potential of the metabolites to affect immunochemistry-based assays as a result of cross-reactivity could be investigated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{attempts}} {{to clarify the}} between-subjects variability exhibited in both segmental <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies</b> and their subordinated or associated sensory contribution. Previous data have emphasised close relationships between the interindividual variability in both the visual control of posture and the spatial visual perception. In this study, we focused on the possible relationships that might link perceptual visual field dependence-independence and the visual contribution to segmental <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies.</b> Visual field dependent (FD) and field independent (FI) subjects were {{selected on the basis}} of their extreme score in a static rod and frame test where an estimation of the subjective vertical was required. In the postural test, the subjects stood in the sharpened Romberg position in darkness or under normal or stroboscopic illumination, in front of either a vertical or a tilted frame. <b>Strategies</b> of segmental <b>stabilisation</b> of the head, shoulders and hip in the roll plane were analysed by means of their anchoring index (AI). Our hypothesis was that FD subjects might use mainly visual cues for calibrating not only their spatial perception but also their <b>strategies</b> of segmental <b>stabilisation.</b> In the case of visual cue disturbances, a greater visual dependency to the <b>strategies</b> of segmental <b>stabilisation</b> in FD subjects should be validated by observing more systematic "en bloc" functioning (i. e. negative AI) between two adjacent segments. The main results are the following: 1. <b>Strategies</b> of segmental <b>stabilisation</b> differed between both groups and differences were amplified with the deprivation of either total vision and/or static visual cues. 2. In the absence of total vision and/or static visual cues, FD subjects have shown an increased efficiency of the hip <b>stabilisation</b> in space <b>strategy</b> and an "en bloc" operation of the shoulder-hip unit (whole trunk). The last "en bloc" operation was extended to the whole head-trunk unit in darkness, associated with a hip stabilisation in space. 3. The FI subjects have adopted neither a <b>strategy</b> of segmental <b>stabilisation</b> in space nor on the underlying segment, whatever the body segment considered and the visual condition. Thus, in this group, head, shoulder and hip moved independently from each other during stance control, roughly without taking into account the visual condition. The results, emphasising a differential weighting of sensory input involved in both perceptual and postural control, are discussed in terms of the differential choice and/or ability to select the adequate frame of reference common to both cognitive and motor spatial activities. We assumed that a motor-somesthetics "neglect" or a lack of mastering of these inputs/outputs rather than a mere visual dependence in FD subjects would generate these interindividual differences in both spatial perception and postural balance. This proprioceptive "neglect" is assumed to lead FD subjects to sensory reweighting, whereas proprioceptive dominance would lead FI subjects to a greater ability in selecting the adequate frame of reference in the case of intersensory disturbances. Finally, this study also provides evidence for a new interpretation of the visual field dependence-independence dimension in both spatial perception and postural control...|$|R

Conversely, 'pesification' of financial contracts (deposits, credits, bonds, etc.) proved a disaster : State intervention into private contracts, which was justified by the presence of a valuable public good - money -, opened the way for a large-scale, opaque redistribution of private wealth.

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} test how {{gravitational}} information {{would affect the}} choice of stable reference frame used to control posture and voluntary movement, we have analysed the forearm stabilisation during sit to stand movement under microgravity condition obtained during parabolic flights. In this study, we hypothesised that {{in response to the}} transient loss of graviceptive information, the postural adaptation might involve the use of several <b>strategies</b> of segmental <b>stabilisation,</b> depending on the subject’s perceptual typology (dependence- independence with respect to the visual field). More precisely, we expected a continuum of postural strategies across subjects with 1) at one extreme the maintaining of an egocentric reference frame and 2) at the other the re-activation of childhood strategies consisting in adopting an egocentric reference frame. Methodology/Principal Findings: To check this point, a forearm stabilisation task combined with a sit to stand movement was performed with eyes closed by 11 subjects during parabolic flight campaigns. Kinematic data were collected during 1 -g and 0 -g periods. The postural adaptation to microgravity’s constraint may be described as a continuum of strategies ranging from the use of an exo- to an egocentric reference frame for segmental stabilisation.

Cross-sectional study of three-dimensional angular and translational motion of the innominates relative to the sacrum in two subject groups. Background. Comparative in vivo analysis of the 3 D patterning of pelvic motion in subjects with posterior pelvic pain and controls is limited. Methods. Fourteen males with posterior pelvic pain and healthy age and height matched controls were studied. A 6 -camera motion analysis system {{was used to determine}} 3 D angular and translational motion of pelvic skin markers during standing hip flexion. Results. Posterior rotation of the innominate occurred with hip flexion in control subjects and pelvic pain subjects as previously reported in the literature. On the supporting leg, the innominate rotated posteriorly in controls and anteriorly in symptomatic subjects. Conclusion. Posterior rotation of the innominate, as measured using skin markers during weight bearing in controls may reflect activation of optimal lumbo-pelvic <b>stabilisation</b> <b>strategies</b> for load transfer. Anterior rotation occurred in symptomatic subjects, suggesting failure to stabilise intra-pelvic motion for load transfer. Relevance This study found that posterior rotation of the innominate occurred during weight bearing in controls.

40|$|Vaccines {{and other}} biomolecules {{need to be}} {{maintained}} at specified storage temperatures from manufacture through to their end user. To satisfy this requirement an enormous network of fridges and freezers called the "cold chain" throughout the world must exist. This network may account for up to 80 % of {{the total cost of}} vaccination and is susceptible to failure causing loss of vaccines. <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>strategies</b> for vaccines available in the literature have been limited to a few techniques for a few vaccines. To address this problem a novel, cost-efficient, and simple sugar-membrane technology has been developed. Sugar-membrane technology involves desiccation of biomolecules formulated in stabilising sugars in a fibrous matrix and has previously been demonstrated to thermostabilise live viral vectored vaccines exposed to extremes of temperature for prolonged periods of time. The thesis investigates the applicability of the technology in stabilising a wide range of vaccines. The data reported demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology in thermostabilising the vaccines irrespective of the intrinsic complexities and thermo-sensitivity of the initial product. In addition, the thesis also studies the applicability of the technology in thermostabilisation of vaccines of veterinary importance. An accelerated stability study of sugar-membrane thermostabilised veterinary vaccines also demonstrated that the data are superior to those reported previously for the corresponding vaccines. However, the nature of the current matrix is not suitable for translation to human medicine. This thesis therefore investigates a range of new potentially GMP-compatible fibrous matrices to identify alternative membranes for use clinically. The data indicate that an alternative hydrophobic membrane after physical or chemical surface modification could be considered as an alternative support matrix for the technology. Finally, to understand the reasons for outstanding thermostability delivered by the current membrane in more detail, the physical and chemical properties of the matrix were investigated. Results from this systematic study identified inherent properties of the matrix which could be linked to the superior thermostabilising property of the membrane. These findings will be used for further optimisation of the technology and development towards a more GMP compatible support matrix. </p...|$|R

By examining neuromuscular adaptations using our weight-bearing target match protocol, the main objective of this research is to establish sex differences in adaptations of neuromuscular control that are associated with older males and females with and without OA. 66 participants completed the protocol while EMG, ground reaction forces (GRF), and kinematics were recorded. Muscle activation patterns were presented in polar plots with an EMG vector representing normalised muscle activation in twelve directions, each representing a GRF vector scaled to 30 % maximal effort. Asymmetry about the polar plot (activation occurring in one direction more than another) was determined and specificity index (SI) and mean direction of activation were calculated when appropriate. Healthy females demonstrated greater rectus femoris (RF) mean muscle magnitude (XEMG) (p= 0. 067) and less biceps femoris (BF) XEMG than healthy males (p= 0. 084) and females with OA (p= 0. 041), and males and females with OA demonstrated greater RF XEMG than healthy controls of the same sex (p= 0. 016, 0. 072, respectively). Females with OA had significantly greater medial gastrocnemius XEMG than healthy females (p= 0. 031) and males with OA (p= 0. 020). Females with OA have less specificity in all muscles compared to males with OA and OA participants generally had less specificity compared to healthy controls of the same sex. Healthy males had the largest SI for lateral gastrocnemius with an asymmetrical activation pattern contrasting the more symmetrical activation pattern of all other groups. In conclusion, we suggest OA-affected adults and healthy females use a quadriceps dominant strategy to stabilise the joint, and that this strategy may be a compensatory mechanism for reduced quadriceps function. We suggest RF, BF, MG, and LG should be targeted for prophylactic intervention as they displayed altered activation strategies in participants with OA and healthy females...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} {{an application}} of the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to model metal forming processes. The X-FEM is used to account for material interfaces and reduce the meshing constraints due {{to the shape of}} the tools and the evolving configuration of the structures. Large deformations and non-linear behaviors are also accounted for, but this contribution focuses in the modeling of frictional conditions on the interface. In X-FEM simulations, the constraint of impenetrability is usually imposed using Lagrange multiplier methods. For such <b>strategies,</b> <b>stabilisation</b> algorithms are needed to prevent the apparition of instabilities due to the introduction of dual unknowns. The strategy presented here proposes to manage the contact using the penalty approach. As it requires no additional variables, it is not submitted to the same kind of instabilities. The contact problem is modeled using integration sub-elements, defined on the boundary of the structure, on which the contact constraints have to be enforced...|$|R
40|$|The 2007 - 2009 {{financial}} crisis {{was caused by}} financial markets? greed and instability {{and led to a}} strong rise public debts and deficits in advanced economies. Financial markets and international institutions advocate a ?fiscal exit strategy? through rapid cuts in public deficits and debts under large public spending cuts. However the state of public finances was generally satisfactory before the crisis; the rise in deficits was needed for macroeconomic <b>stabilisation</b> purposes. Exit <b>strategies</b> should maintain interest rates at low levels and government deficits {{as long as they are}} needed to support activity. Strengthening the SGP would be dangerous if it deprived EU Member States of policy tools that were helpful in the crisis. In the euro area public debts should be collectively guaranteed by the ECB and the Member States to avoid speculation. World economic stability is not threatened by public finance imbalances, but by growing financial speculation.

40|$|Light metal borohydrides {{have been}} {{extensively}} investigated as potential hydrogen storage candidates {{due to their}} high gravimetric capacities, but they are irreversible. However, a nanosizing approach may provide unprecedented opportunities to change this. This thesis aims to establish a nanosizing strategy for LiBH 4 and NaBH 4 so that practical reversible hydrogen capacities may be reached under moderate conditions. Previous nanosizing methods have relied {{on the use of}} bulky supports, which severely limit the gravimetric capacity, as confirmed in the present work. In order to overcome this, a range of techniques for the preparation of isolated borohydride nanoparticles were investigated. These resulted in some improvements in hydrogen storage properties over the bulk materials, but despite extensive optimisation the resulting nanoparticles were not sufficiently stabilised. To improve the <b>stabilisation,</b> a core-shell <b>strategy</b> was developed, where a NaBH 4 nanoparticle core was contained within a Ni shell (NaBH 4 @Ni). This novel strategy led to exceptional hydrogen storage properties. NaBH 4 became fully reversible {{for the first time with}} 5 mass % hydrogen desorption/absorption occurring at only 4 MPa hydrogen pressure and 350 °C with fast kinetics. The technique was further extended to other systems, using a variety of shell metals and different core materials. LiBH 4 @Fe in particular has the potential to reach even higher reversible capacities than NaBH 4 @Ni under even milder conditions. This unique approach challenges the way hydrogen is conventionally stored, and provides a highly promising avenue for practical developments in energy in the future...|$|R
40|$|Chemoimmunotherapy for {{patients}} with metastatic melanoma is associated with high toxicity, and only a subset of patients will benefit. This randomised phase II study was performed with the primary objective of exploring whether two cycles of dacarbazine monotherapy could select the subset of patients that would benefit most from more intensive chemoimmunotherapy. Patients with metastatic melanoma were randomised to either receive chemoimmunotherapy with dacarbazine, cisplatin, interferon-alpha and interleukin- 2 (arm A) or initial treatment with two cycles of dacarbazine monotherapy followed irrespective of response by the same 4 -drug regimen of chemoimmunotherapy (arm B). Chemoimmunotherapy was continued {{in the absence of}} disease progression for a maximum of four cycles. Primary end-point was the disease stabilisation rate. A total of 93 patients were randomised, and 89 patients were eligible. Disease stabilisation (complete/partial response or stable disease) was achieved in 19 patients (42. 2 %) in arm A and 9 patients (20. 5 %) in arm B. In arm B 32 of the 44 patients continued chemoimmunotherapy after two cycles of dacarbazine. Of 20 patients with progressive disease (PD) after two cycles of dacarbazine in arm B, only 2 patients achieved an objective response. Median overall survival (OS) in arms A and B was 10. 5 months and 9. 5 months, respectively. Despite a lower initial <b>stabilisation</b> rate, the <b>strategy</b> of starting with 2 courses of DTIC prior to a 4 -drug regimen led to comparable median overall survival. Only few transient responses were achieved with the 4 -drug regimen in patients with disease progression on DTIC, suggesting frequent cross resistance. Two cycles of dacarbazine monotherapy cannot be recommended to select patients for more intensive chemoimmunotherap...|$|R
