5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ruins}} of homeworld of the Daleks, the Doctor is {{approached}} by a woman, who requests his help in freeing her daughter from a Dalek prison.

5|$|The 56th Academy Award {{nominations}} {{were announced}} about ten months after Tender Mercies was released. Little {{had been done}} to promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; all of them appeared in the trade journal Variety, and Duvall had declined to campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio executives were <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed by some to be a strong contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Iraqis {{captured}} Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
25|$|The Weather Bureau {{released}} a balloon at Laverton at 8:30 am and the westerly wind blowing {{at the time}} could have moved it into {{the area where the}} sighting was reported".

25|$|In January 1730, the French {{attempted}} to besiege the main fort of the Natchez, {{but they were}} driven off. Two days later a force of about 500 Choctaw attacked and captured the fort, killing at least 100 Natchez, and recovered about 50 French captives and 50-100 African slaves. French leaders were delighted, but <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Choctaw demanded ransoms for the captives.|$|E

25|$|Tupper {{was pleasantly}} <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Premier of the Province of Canada, John A. Macdonald, {{asked to be}} allowed to attend the Charlottetown Conference. The Conference, which was co-chaired by Tupper and New Brunswick Premier Samuel Leonard Tilley, welcomed the Canadian {{delegation}} and asked them to join the conference.

25|$|Miguel Gatins and Robert Rivard {{questioned}} whether the Mexican justice system worked. While Gatins originally supported the two Huichol men, he argued that Mexican justice did work when it freed them, while Rivard {{made the case that}} justice would not be served if guilty parties were freed. Martha True said she had been disappointed by the closed process and was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> 2001 release. By the end of 2003, Gatins had switched his support to Rivard and True's position.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, anti-Spanish sentiments {{in several}} South American {{countries}} (including Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador) increased. It {{was obvious to}} most observers that Spain {{had no intention of}} retaking its former colonies. However, Peru and its neighbors still remained wary of any moves that might foreshadow an attempt to reestablish the Spanish Empire. Given the climate of suspicion, no one was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Spanish gunboat Vencedora stopped at a Chilean port for coal and President José Joaquín Pérez declared that coal was a war supply that could not be sold to a belligerent nation.|$|E
25|$|Although Tupper {{had given}} up much at the Quebec Conference, he thought {{that he would be}} able to {{convince}} Nova Scotians that the deal he negotiated was in some good for Nova Scotia. He was therefore <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> deal he had negotiated at Quebec was roundly criticized by Nova Scotians: the Opposition Leader Adams George Archibald was the only member of the Liberal caucus to support Confederation. Former premier Joseph Howe now organized an Anti-Confederation Party and anti-Confederation sentiments were so strong that Tupper decided to postpone a vote of the legislature on the question of Confederation for a full year. Tupper now organized supporters of Confederation into a Confederation Party to push for the union.|$|E

25|$|Kröd, however, {{refuses to}} kiss his Succubus because he still misses Aneka. Kröd is {{attacked}} by the demons and his possessed friends, but he fights his way loose and kills the Succubi and Incubus, freeing Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce. They find the tower, but Kröd realizes he has lost the key Grimshank gave him, so he instead lights it by firing a flaming arrow at the pyre. Once it is lit, however, the group is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tower explodes and collapses. Grimshank, who watched the scene from a telescope, informs Aneka that Kröd has been killed, causing her to weep on his tunic. He leaves and places the tears in a vial. Meanwhile, Dongalor is told by Barnabus that Grimshank, actually a double agent, has succeeded in killing Kröd and retrieving the Pagan tears needed to activate the weapon.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{guilty plea}} on {{misdemeanor}} weapons charges during the 2009 offseason, Lynch met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for a disciplinary hearing. Lynch {{had been arrested}} in Culver City, California, for having {{a gun in his}} backpack in the trunk of a car he was occupying, a crime in California. On April 9, the NFL announced that Lynch would be suspended for the Bills' first three games for violations of the NFL's personal conduct policy. Lynch appealed the league's suspension on May 14 in an attempt to have it reduced or nullified, only to have it upheld by Goodell later on August 3. When interviewed on the topic, Lynch has said that he was not <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> suspension was upheld and that he loves playing too much and will try to keep himself out of situations {{in which there is a}} risk of being suspended.|$|E
25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E

[...] At the 2005 World Championships, he finished second overall, winning the 1000m and 3000m races.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1988 season, the Seahawks offered Easley {{to several}} clubs {{in an attempt}} to get a quarterback in return. [...] Easley's declining play, which was {{partially}} blamed on his work during the strike and the blossoming of Easley's backup Paul Moyer, had made Easley expendable. On April 22, 1988, the Seahawks traded Easley to the Phoenix Cardinals for quarterback Kelly Stouffer. During the mandatory team physical, Easley was diagnosed with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, a severe kidney disease that voided the trade. Easley had told Moyer that he thought his days with the Seahawks were numbered because of his involvement in the player's strike. He was not <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> trade happened but the kidney diagnosis had [...] "shocked" [...] him. [...] The Seahawks offered several draft picks as compensation to the Cardinals to complete the trade and Easley announced his retirement a few months later.|$|E
