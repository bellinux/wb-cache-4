To establish guidelines for electrostatic separation, well-defined charging and separation experiments of model mixtures prepared from wheat gluten and starch were carried out. For this a custom-built bench-scale electrostatic separator was developed. Charging behavior of mixtures improved with decreasing particle concentration and increasing gas flow rate, which was similar compared to charging behavior of <b>single</b> <b>materials.</b> However, the charge of mixtures was not simply {{the sum of the}} charge of <b>single</b> <b>materials</b> because particle–particle interactions also largely influence the charging. Separation efficiencies for mixtures were found lower than could be expected on the basis of behavior of <b>single</b> <b>materials</b> in the equipment. This was attributed to formation of agglomerates by particles having opposite charge, which was further confirmed by the observation that dispersibility of the mixtures was poorer than for the <b>single</b> <b>materials.</b> Agglomeration of particles during electrostatic separation can be minimized by using high gas flow velocity, low feed dosing and higher field strength...|$|R

60|$|Here then we {{have the}} second great respect in which The Ring and the Book is the great epic of the age. It is the great epic of the age, because it is the {{expression}} of the belief, it might almost be said, of the discovery, that no man ever lived upon this earth without possessing a point of view. No one ever lived who had not a little more to say for himself than any formal system of justice was likely to say for him. It is scarcely necessary to point out how entirely the application of this principle would revolutionise the old heroic epic, in which the poet decided absolutely the moral relations and moral value of the characters. Suppose, for example, that Homer had written the Odyssey on the principle of The Ring and the Book, how disturbing, how weird an experience it would be to read the story {{from the point of view}} of Antinous! Without contradicting a <b>single</b> <b>material</b> fact, without telling a single deliberate lie, the narrative would so change the whole world around us, that we should scarcely know we were dealing with the same place and people. The calm face of Penelope would, it may be, begin to grow meaner before our eyes, like a face changing in a dream. She would begin to appear as a fickle and selfish woman, passing falsely as a widow, and playing a double game between the attentions of foolish but honourable young men, and the fitful appearances of a wandering and good-for-nothing sailor-husband; a man prepared to act that most well-worn of melodramatic rôles, the conjugal bully and blackmailer, the man who uses marital rights as an instrument for the worse kind of wrongs. Or, again, if we had the story of the fall of King Arthur told from the stand-point of Mordred, it would only be a matter of a word or two; in a turn, in the twinkling of an eye, we should find ourselves sympathising with the efforts of an earnest young man to frustrate the profligacies of high-placed paladins like Lancelot and Tristram, and ultimately discovering, with deep regret but unshaken moral courage, that there was no way to frustrate them, except by overthrowing the cold and priggish and incapable egotist who ruled the country, and the whole artificial and bombastic schemes which bred these moral evils. It might be that in spite of this new view of the case, it would ultimately appear that Ulysses was really right and Arthur was really right, just as Browning makes it ultimately appear that Pompilia was really right. But any one can see the enormous difference in scope and difficulty between the old epic which told the whole story from one man's point of view, and the new epic which cannot come to its conclusion, until it has digested and assimilated views as paradoxical and disturbing as our imaginary defence of Antinous and apologia of Mordred.|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} bilayer {{composite}} YSZ-CGO (yttria-stabilized zirconia-gadolinia-doped ceria) electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide {{fuel cells}} (SOFCs) is still problematic, due to solid-state reaction and interdiffusion phenomena occurring between YSZ and CGO. To overcome this problem, a gradation in the microstructure between the <b>single</b> <b>materials</b> is proposed. To optimize {{the composition of the}} interlayer with respect to conductivity, different compositions of the system CGO(x) YSZ(1 -x) were prepared and characterized in order to study their transport properties. Conductivity was found to reach a minimum for solid solutions where Zr and Ce are present in equimolar quantities. The latter are, however, the most appropriate candidates to be applied as interlayers between the two <b>single</b> <b>materials.</b> Keeping the Ce/Zr atomic ratio approximately equal to one, different solid solutions were prepared and characterized by varying the concentration of the trivalent cations present, in order to clarify their role in the transport properties of the material.
