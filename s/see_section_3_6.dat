40|$|The context which {{occasions}} {{this study}} is the established multicultural reality of India and the developing multicultural spectrum of Scotland (see Sections 3. 2, 3. 3, 3. 4). The aims, objectives and/ or policies of the two governments (see Section 3. 5) - and the respective boards of education in the two countries (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>3.</b> <b>6)</b> - provide the high idealistic foundations that such institutions stand for. The study uses the discourse analysis method (see Section 4. 2 for definition) to evaluate how far the texts used by schools in India and Scotland reflect such high ideals – how far the texts contain multicultural markers (see Section 5. 4 for definition) and how these markers are exploited through the exercises. The study takes into account even the materials containing multicultural markers that may not {{have anything to do with}} social injustice. It is a case study because, due to lack of time and space, the study takes into account only one representative book each from India and Scotland. The study is an endeavour to incorporate two features influenced by Norman Fairclough’s ideas (see Section 5. 2 and Section 1. 5, respectively) : one, a selective discourse analysis approach; and two, an interdisciplinary approach – interdisciplinary in the sense that it integrates discourse analysis, cultural studies and history. As part of the second approach, this study includes the following: first, critical discourse analysis (see Section 4. 3 for definition) of a representative text – one out of the 108 texts from the two books; and second, two chapters – Chapters 2 and 3 – which elucidate on the following ideas and issues: multiculturalism; ethnicity, nation and state; ethnic compositions of the two states; history of multiculturalism in India and Scotland; the policies towards multiculturalism in India and Scotland; and objectives of the two respective boards of education. My research question is answered (see Section 5. 1 for research question; see Section 7. 2 for its answer) and my hypothesis is tested (see Section 5. 1 for hypothesis; see Section 7. 2 for its test) on the basis of the evaluation of the texts by using the discourse analysis method. The study incorporates critical discourse analysis of a representative text in order to complement the findings of the discourse analysis method and to demonstrate how various aspects of a text can be exploited to raise the awareness of learners about cultures and related social issues. The discussion that follows the results incorporates ethics, analysis of the findings, limitations of this study, scope for further research in the area and implications of the research...|$|E
40|$|The {{cost of an}} {{algorithm}} {{includes both}} arithmetic and communication. We use "communication" in a general sense to mean data movement,either between levels of a memory hierarchy ("sequential") orbetween processors ("parallel"). Communication costs include bothbandwidth terms, which are proportional {{to the number of}} words sent,and latency terms, which are proportional to the number of messages inwhich the data is sent. Communication costs are much higher thanarithmetic costs, and the gap is increasing rapidly for technologicalreasons. This suggests that for best performance, algorithms shouldminimize communication, even if that may require some redundantarithmetic operations. We call such algorithms"communication-avoiding. "Krylov subspace methods (KSMs) are iterative algorithms for solvinglarge, sparse linear systems and eigenvalue problems. Current KSMsrely on sparse matrix-vector multiply (SpMV) and vector-vectoroperations (like dot products and vector sums). All of theseoperations are communication-bound. Furthermore, data dependenciesbetween them mean that only a small amount of that communication canbe hidden. Many important scientific and engineering computationsspend much of their time in Krylov methods, so the performance of manycodes could be improved by introducing KSMs that communicate less. Our goal is to take s steps of a KSM for the same communication costas 1 step, which would be optimal. We call the resulting KSMs"communication-avoiding Krylov methods. " We can do this under certainassumptions on the matrix, and for certain KSMs, both in theory (formany KSMs) and in practice (for some KSMs). Our algorithms are basedon the so-called "s-step" Krylov methods, which break up the datadependency between the sparse matrix-vector multiply and the dotproducts in standard Krylov methods. This idea has been around for awhile, but in contrast to prior work (discussed in detail in Section 1. 5), this thesis makes the following contributions:We have fast kernels replacing SpMV, that can compute theresults of s calls to SpMV for the same communication cost as onecall (Section 2. 1). We have fast dense kernels as well, such as Tall Skinny QR (TSQR [...] Section 2. 3) and Block Gram-Schmidt (BGS [...] Section 2. 4), which can do the work of Modified Gram-Schmidt applied to s vectors for a factor of Theta(s^ 2) fewer messages in parallel, and a factor of Theta(s/W) fewer words transferred between levels of the memory hierarchy (where W is the fast memory capacity in words). We have new communication-avoiding Block Gram-Schmidt algorithmsfor orthogonalization in more general inner products (Section 2. 5). We have new communication-avoiding versions of the followingKrylov subspace methods for solving linear systems: the GeneralizedMinimum Residual method (GMRES [...] Section 3. 4), bothunpreconditioned and preconditioned, and the Method of ConjugateGradients (CG), both unpreconditioned (Section 5. 4) andleft-preconditioned (Section 5. 5). We have new communication-avoiding versions of the following Krylovsubspace methods for solving eigenvalue problems, both standard (Ax =&lambda x, for a nonsingular matrix A) and "generalized" (Ax =&lambda Mx, for nonsingular matrices A and M) : Arnoldi iteration(Section 3. 3), and Lanczos iteration, both for Ax = &lambda x (Section 4. 2) and Ax = &lambda M x (Section 4. 3). We propose techniques for developing communication-avoiding versionsof nonsymmetric Lanczos iteration (for solving nonsymmetric eigenvalueproblems Ax = &lambda x) and the Method of Biconjugate Gradients(BiCG) for solving linear systems. See Chapter 6 for details. We can combine more stable numerical formulations that use differentbases of Krylov subspaces with our techniques for avoidingcommunication. For a discussion of different bases, see Chapter 7. To see an example of how the choice of basis affects the formulationof the Krylov method, see Section 3. 2. 2. We have faster numerical formulations. For example, in ourcommunication-avoiding version of GMRES, CA-GMRES (see Section 3. 4),we can pick the restart length r independently of the s-step basislength s. Experiments in Section 3. 5. 5 show that this abilityimproves numerical stability. We show in Section 3. 6. 3 that it alsoimproves performance in practice, resulting in a 2. 23 × speedupin the CA-GMRES implementation described below. We combine all of these numerical and performance techniques in ashared-memory parallel implementation of our communication-avoidingversion of GMRES, CA-GMRES. Compared to a similarly highly optimizedversion of standard GMRES, when both are running in parallel on 8 cores of an Intel Clovertown (see Appendix A), CA-GMRES achieves 4. 3 × speedups over standard GMRES on standard sparse test matrices(described in Appendix B. 5). When both are running in parallel on 8 cores of an Intel Nehalem (see Appendix A), CA-GMRES achieves 4. 1 × speedups. <b>See</b> <b>Section</b> <b>3.</b> <b>6</b> for performance results and Section 3. 5 for corresponding numerical experiments. We first reportedperformance results for this implementation on the Intel Clovertownplatform in Demmel et al. [78]. We have incorporated preconditioning into our methods. Notethat we have not yet developed practical communication-avoidingpreconditioners; this is future work. We have accomplished the following:* We show (in Sections 2. 2 and 4. 3) what the s-step basis shouldcompute in the preconditioned case for many different types of Krylovmethods and s-step bases. We explain why this is hard in Section 4. 3. * We have identified two different structures that a preconditionermay have, in order to achieve the desired optimal reduction ofcommunication by a factor of s. See Section 2. 2 for details. We present a detailed survey of related work, including s-step KSMs(Section 1. 5, especially Table 1. 1) and other techniques for reducingthe amount of communication in iterative methods (Section 1. 6) ...|$|E

40|$|Policies for the {{remediation}} {{of contaminated}} sites emerged relatively late as a subfield of environmental protection. The policy area is adjacent to other policies, such as waste policy, which often includes provisions {{on how to}} deal with waste dumps, as well as soil and groundwater protection policies, which deal with the prevention of contamination. Nevertheless, most countries introduced policies for the clean-up of contaminated sites in the course of the 1990 s while only a handful already tackled this issue in the 1980 s. The policies on contaminated land developed initially at the domestic level. Although in a few cases contaminated sites gained international attention, such as the Love Canal in the USA and Lekkerkerk in the Netherlands, contaminated soil was considered a local problem and the responsibility of national (or subnational) governments. At the EU level up to today, national insistence on the subsidiarity principle prevented agreement on common regulations. Similarly, at the wider international level, we find no binding or non-binding international law or agreements on the {{remediation of contaminated sites}}. However, several transnational networks have emerged that have played a role in the international convergence process of contaminated sites policy (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>6.</b> <b>3)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Following a loss-of-coolant {{accident}} in a {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) plant, the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) will supply water to the reactor vessel to reflood, and thereby cool the reactor core. The core flooding rate is governed by the capability of the ECCS water to displace the steam generated in the reactor vessel during the core reflooding period. For PWR plants, {{there is a direct}} depend-ence of core flooding rate on containment pressure; i. e., the core flooding rate will increase with increasing containment pressure. Therefore, as part of the overall evaluation of ECCS performance, the CSB reviews analyses of the minimum containment pressure that could exist during the period of time until the core is reflooded following a loss-of-coolant accident to confirm the validity of the containment pressure used in ECCS performance capability studies. The CSB reviews the assumptions made regarding the operation of engineered safety feature heat removal systems; the effectiveness of Structural heat sinks within the containment to remove energy from the containment atmosphere, and other heat removal processes, such as steam in the containment mixing with ECCS water spilling from the break in the reactor coolant system; {{and in the case of}} ice condenser containments, mixing with water from melted ice that drains into the lower containment volume. The review is done for all PWR containment types, i. e., dry, subatmospheric, and ice condenser containments.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to argue that automated deduction systems can be usefully applied in practice, but it is necessary to have available a variety of deduction methods, to understand their properties and their computational power in order to tailor them for the application under consideration. In the early days of automated deduction, research concentrated on the development of general purpose deduction systems. “Applications ” were toy examples, which did not scale up to realistically sized problems. Nowadays, the theorem prover community discovers applications again. The key to success quite often is the specific knowledge of the application domain which is used to optimise the deduction systems, i. e. the knowledge is used to guide the search for a proof or a model. Indeed, there are some recent impressive results which show that such deductive systems are even able to handle realistic problems.

40|$|Classically, {{the study}} of knots and links has {{proceeded}} topologically looking for features of knotted curves which depend only on their knot class. Recently {{there has been an}} increased interest in geometric knot theory, which attempts to measure geometric properties of a particular knotted curve and relate these to its knot type. Questions about the geometry of knots not only have intrinsic mathematical interest, but arise naturally from the physical sciences. For example biologists are interested in knotted strands of DNA, whose electrophoresis gel velocities seem related to notions of knot complexity, and in particular to ropelength. My research in geometric knot theory has several intertwined components. To date, I have looked at two topological features of knots, alternating quadrisecants and essential secants (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> 2. 1, Section 2. 2).
