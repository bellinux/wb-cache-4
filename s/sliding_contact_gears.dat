40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a new gear surface roughness induced noise source model while taking into ac-count the <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> between meshing <b>gear</b> teeth. The surface asperities on tooth surfaces are modeled as compact structural beam elements that radiate {{sound in the}} off-line of action after sliding impacts, against asperities of the meshing surface, occur. A linear time-varying (LTV) model of a spur gear pair (with slid-ing friction) is employed to calculate the instantaneous sliding velocity between pinion and gear teeth, which is then applied to the asperities as the initial condition. The transient sound field from the flexural motions of surface asperities (acoustically baffled along their axes), which are released from the cylindrical Hertzian <b>contact</b> zone in <b>gear</b> teeth, is computed. The modal superposition method is used for far and free field calcu-lations given the surface roughness and its (assumed) asperity distribution on the tooth profile. Typical sound pressure predictions show that the noise levels increase with operating speeds and surface roughness.

This method focuses on mechanisms in which loading {{is possible in}} many degrees of freedom, but only few of them are simultaneously loaded at a given moment in time (e. g. <b>sliding</b> elements, <b>gear</b> <b>contact,</b> etc.). The methodology adapts during simulation the mode set used to represent component flexibility, by judiciously choosing only those static modes that are contributing actively to the body deformation. First, the general methodology is presented, then the current work and its original contributions are discussed; namely SMS is tested on a 3 D mechanism including multiple flexible bodies on which sliding elements are present. Moreover, as opposed to previous studies, the locations where external excitation is acting is not known a priori. Finally, some limitations of the proposed methodology are treated with focus on the numerical discontinuities introduced by the switching of the modal base and their propagation to neighbouring bodies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Wind turbine gearbox {{operates}} under a {{wide array}} of highly fluctuating and dynamic load conditions caused by the stochastic nature of wind and operational wind turbine controls. Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates gear micropitting of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear micropitting by determining the <b>contact</b> stress, <b>sliding</b> parameter, local <b>contact</b> temperature and lubricant film thickness along the line of action of <b>gear</b> tooth <b>contact.</b> The non-uniform distributions of temperature and lubricant film thickness over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> along the <b>gear</b> tooth flanks. The lubricant film thickness varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The lubricant film thickness increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the addendum of driving gear and the dedendum of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact. At the low-torque condition, the varying rotational speed condition may cause a considerable variation of lubricant film thickness thus interrupting the lubrication which may result in micropitting...|$|R

While {{there has been some}} success in generating near-native compressive properties, the tensile properties of cell-seeded constructs remain poor, and key features of cartilage, including inhomogeneity and anisotropy, are generally absent in these engineered constructs. Therefore, in an attempt to instill these hallmark properties of cartilage in engineered cell-seeded constructs, we designed and characterized a novel <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> bioreactor to recapitulate the mechanical stimuli arising from physiologic joint loading (two contacting cartilage layers). Finite element modeling of this bioreactor system showed that tensile strains were direction-dependent, while both tensile strains and fluid motion were depth-dependent and highest in the region closest to the <b>contact</b> surface. Short-term <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) -seeded agarose improved chondrogenic gene expression in a manner dependent on both the axial strain applied and transforming growth factor-β supplementation.

We report some peculiarities {{in the behavior of}} these packings that have not yet been addressed. The number of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> is not necessarily related to stability: first the number of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> rises linearly and smoothly with the applied stress. Then, at approximately half the peak stress, the increase slows down, a plateau develops, and a decrease follows. The spatial organization of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> also changes: {{during the first half of}} the simulation, <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> are uniformly distributed throughout the packing, but in the second half, they become concentrated in certain regions. This suggests that the loss of homogeneity occurs well before the appearance of shear bands. During the second half events appear where the number of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> drops suddenly, and then rapidly recovers. We show that these events are in fact local instabilities in the packing. These events become more frequent as failure is approached.

The influence of indentation depth, texture shape, texture spacing, and tip radius on the average friction forces and the running-in stages is studied.

How to enhance the computational {{efficiency and}} keep accuracy at the same time is concerned by each corresponding researcher. However, most of the current studies focus on MD algorithms, and if the scale of MD model could be reduced, the algorithms would be more meaningful. A local region molecular dynamics (LRMD) simulation method which can meet these two factors concurrently in nanoscale <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> is developed in this paper. Full MD simulation is used to simulate indentation process before sliding. A criterion called contribution of displacement is presented, which is used to determine the effective local region in the MD model after indentation. By using the local region, nanoscale <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> between a rigid cylindrical tip and an elastic substrate is investigated. Two two-dimensional MD models are presented, and the friction forces from LRMD simulations agree well with that from full MD simulations, which testifies the effectiveness of the LRMD simulation method for two-dimensional cases. A three-dimensional MD model for <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> is developed then to show the validity of the LRMD simulation method further. Finally, a discussion is carried out by the principles of tribology. In the discussion, two two-dimensional full MD models are used to simulate the nanoscale <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> problems. The results indicate that original smaller model will induce higher equivalent scratching depth, and then results in higher friction forces, which will help to explain the mechanism how the LRMD simulation method works. This method can be used to reduce the scale of MD model in large scale simulations, and it will enhance the computational efficiency without losing accuracy during the simulation of nanoscale <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|R
