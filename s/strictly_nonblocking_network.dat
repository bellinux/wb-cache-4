In this paper, we explore the possibility of us-ing a nonblocking network with O (N log N) edges (crosspoints) to interconnect the processors of an N processor system. We combine Bassalygo and Pinsker's implicit design of strictly non-blocking networks with an explicit construction of expanders to obtain a <b>strictly</b> <b>nonblocking</b> <b>network</b> with- 765. 18 N + 352. 8 N log N edges and 2 + log(N/ 5) depth. We present an efficient parallel algorithm for routing connection requests on this network and implement it on three parallel processor topologies. The implementation on a parallel processor whose processing elements are interconnected as in the Bassalyg-Pinsker network requires O (N log N) processing elements, O (N log N) interpro-cessor links and it takes O(1 ogN) steps to route any single connection request where each step involves a small number (~ 7 2) of bit-level operations. A contracted or folded version of the same implementation reduces the processing element count to O (N) without increasing the link count or the routing time. Finally, we establish that the same algorithm takes O(10 g 3 N) steps on a perfect shuffle processor with O (N) processing ele-ments. These results improve the crosspoint, depth and routing time complexities of the previously reported strictly nonblocking networks.
