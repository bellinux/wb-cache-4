40|$|When rough grains in <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> {{conditions}} are discharged from a silo, a conical depression {{with a single}} slope is formed at the surface. We observed that the increase of the volume fraction generates a more complex depression characterized by two angles of discharge: a lower angle close to the one measured for <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> and a considerably larger upper angle. The change in slope appears at the boundary between a densely packed stagnant region at the periphery and the central flowing channel formed over the aperture. Since the material in the latter zone is always fluidized, the flow rate is unaffected by the initial packing of the bed. On the other hand, the contrast between both angles is markedly smaller when smooth particles {{of the same size}} and density are used, which reveals that high volume fraction and friction must combine to produce the observed geometry. Our results show that the surface profile helps to identify by simple visual inspection the packing conditions of a granular bed, and this can be useful to prevent undesirable collapses during silo discharge in industry.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This study {{originated}} with industry recognition of inadequate flexibility in currently used procedures for grading, sizing, and packaging fresh apples in North Central Washington. Field-run apples are {{introduced into the}} process, and {{nearly all of the}} product must be placed in a marketing package in the process. Portions of the output products are stored for a 12 -month marketing period. Frequently during this marketing period there are changes in the types of packaging demanded. In recognition of this problem, research has developed prototype equipment for performing a presorting and presizing function. Presorted and presized apples could be returned to bulk bin storage for later selective market preparation. This study provides cost information on the application of this new procedure that should be useful to managers of packing plants. The principal objective of the study is to determine how the application of the new procedure would affect the production-point marketing margins. An intermediate objective is to establish industry structure and trends that might relate to the application of the new procedure. Cost analysis is limited to those operating input costs that would likely be affected by the application of the new procedure. An economic-engineering method of analysis is used to measure the relative efficiency of the old and new techniques. A sample of four representative apple packing lines was analyzed for rate of output in standard operating periods (eight-hour shifts) and for average costs per unit of output in these periods. Cost per unit of output associated with integrating the presorting and presizing function into the process was estimated. Operating and cost models were developed for both the <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> line and the new method. From analysis of <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> line operation, it was concluded that presorting and presizing the 50 per cent of the total seasonal volume with the lowest quality would improve the rate of product output on <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> lines. This is the basis for estimating operating and cost models of the new technique. Models are based on annual seasonal output volumes of 210, 000, 28 O, 000 and 350, 000 boxes (42 pounds of apples per box). These volumes represent a majority of the larger packing plants in North Central Washington. Average operating input costs per unit of output increase due to the application of presorting and presizing. The increase was approximately. 025 per unit of output. This is one per cent of the average production-point marketing margin. Application of the new method would not increase the economic efficiency of this specific phase of grading, sizing, and packing fresh apples. The application of presorting and presizing and integration with the current packing line procedures in apple packing plants in North Central Washington could result in total cost savings in individual plants through the more efficient use of storage facilities. Approximately 20 per cent more product can be stored in refrigerated storage or modified atmosphere refrigerated storage in bulk form in bins as compared to finished product storage. Presorting and presizing 50 per cent of the field-nm product would also result in greatly improved flexibility in adapting to the market. The relatively small additional cost of application of this presorting and presizing function would improve the efficiency of many larger apple packing plants. The economic value would vary with each plant. Individual plant variables that should be analyzed are total seasonal volume and trends, storage capacity, current packing line efficiency, and marketing program...|$|E

40|$|The packing {{quality of}} a High Performance Liquid Chromatography column has {{significant}} impact on the resulting separations. In practice, problems in a packing occur through normal usage of a column. Resulting chromatograms from inhomogeneities exhibit varying problems such as extreme tailing and double peaks. Early detection of such problems is critical to fixing problems before their effect harms efficiency, but a fully developed theory of how inhomogeneities affect separations does not exist. The purpose of this work was to experimentally characterize HPLC column inhomogeneities and to begin preliminary simulations of HPLC columns with the computer simulation package STAR-CD. To do this, columns were first packed with a <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> recommended by the manufacturer of the column. Later, two types of inhomogeneity were individually packed into columns: cavities and balls. The resulting chromatograms were analyzed and compared. The results show that as was expected, introducing inhomogeneities reduced separation quality. A simulation was created to model a one- dimensional column and a chromatogram was produced from this simulated column. From the simulated column, one can see that producing chromatograms entirely from a simulation produces an accurate, adjustable, and quick method for studying the column. Recommended further research includes more experiments involving inhomogeneities and simulations incorporating inhomogeneities. A further outlook includes research into pattern recognition with the goal of being able to analyze a series of chromatograms produced by the same column and notice small changes that indicate a specific inhomogeneity is forming...|$|E

Packing steps followed the established <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> method for live transportation of marron. Each treatment group consisted of six polystyrene boxes (65 ?? 30 ?? 40 cm 3), and each box contained 30 marron from each feeding group. The sealed boxes were placed on a trolley at room temperature to give the effect of transportation.

40|$|Hyperuniformity characterizes a {{state of}} matter that is poised at a {{critical}} point at which density or volume-fraction fluctuations are anomalously suppressed at infinite wavelengths. Recently, much {{attention has been given}} to the link between strict jamming and hyperuniformity in frictionless hard-particle packings. Doing so requires one to study very large packings, which can be difficult to jam properly. We modify the rigorous linear programming method of Donev et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 197, 139 (2004) ] in order to test for jamming in putatively jammed packings of hard-disks in two dimensions. We find that various <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> protocols struggle to reliably create packings that are jammed for even modest system sizes; importantly, these packings appear to be jammed by conventional tests. We present evidence that suggests that deviations from hyperuniformity in putative maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings can in part be explained by a shortcoming in generating exactly-jammed configurations due to a type of "critical slowing down" as the necessary rearrangements become difficult to realize by numerical protocols. Additionally, various protocols are able to produce packings exhibiting hyperuniformity to different extents, but this is because certain protocols are better able to approach exactly-jammed configurations. Nonetheless, while one should not generally expect exact hyperuniformity for disordered packings with rattlers, we find that when jamming is ensured, our packings are very nearly hyperuniform, and deviations from hyperuniformity correlate with an inability to ensure jamming, suggesting that strict jamming and hyperuniformity are indeed linked. This raises the possibility that the ideal MRJ packings have no rattlers. Our work provides the impetus for the development of packing algorithms that produce large disordered strictly jammed packings that are rattler-free. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{structured}} packings {{have become more}} widely used in the process industries because of their improved volumetric efficiency. Most structured packings consist of corrugated sheets placed in the vertical plane The corrugations provide a regular network of channels for vapour liquid contact. Until recently it has been necessary to develop new packings by trial and error, testing new shapes in the laboratory. The orderly repetitive nature of the channel network produced by a structured packing suggests {{it may be possible}} to develop improved structured packings by the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to calculate the packing performance and evaluate changes in shape so as to reduce the need for laboratory testing. In this work the CFD package PHOENICS has been used to predict the flow patterns produced in the vapour phase as it passes through the channel network. A particular novelty of the approach is to set up a method of solving the Navier Stokes equations for any particular intersection of channels. The flow pattern of the streams leaving the intersection is then made the input to the downstream intersection. In this way the flow pattern within a section of packing can be calculated. The resulting heat or mass transfer performance can be calculated by other standard CFD procedures. The CFD predictions revealed a circulation developing within the channels which produce a loss in mass transfer efficiency The calculations explained and predicted a change in mass transfer efficiency with depth of the sheets. This effect was also shown experimentally. New shapes of packing were proposed to remove the circulation and these were evaluated using CFD. A new shape was chosen and manufactured. This was tested experimentally and found to have a higher mass transfer efficiency than the <b>standard</b> <b>packing...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} analysis has been performed to establish {{when it is}} advantageous to use structured packing in air separation plant. A model of a low pressure cycle was developed to calculate the power saved when packing is used, and cost models were developed for the columns and cold box. The rate of return was calculated on the extra investment required for a packed plant based on the annual power saving. Structured packing {{was found to be}} economic only in larger plants, where economies of scale mean that the increased capital cost becomes less significant compared with the power saved. It was also found that different sized plants favour different packings. The analysis identified that the packing variable with the biggest impact on the economic balance was the efficiency and that increasing the efficiency of current packings could enhance their balance in air distillation. A new packing was therefore developed to have a higher efficiency than conventional ones. The vapour phase resistance was targeted for reduction, since most packing models predict this to be dominant. The final shape was chosen as the easiest and most economic to make. It has converging and diverging channels and was manufactured in two specific areas and with two block heights by Tianjin University Packing Factory. A 0. 3 m diameter distillation column test rig was designed, built and commissioned with the standard Sulzer Mellapak 500 YW. It was then used to test the new packing alongside some standard ones. Because the packings had different specific areas, correlations of published results were developed to allow a true comparison to be made. The test results show that, unexpectedly, the packings with 0. 1 m high blocks have an efficiency about 8 % greater than the standard 0. 2 m blocks. The new shape as implemented in the 350 Y packing shows an additional 7 % greater efficiency, so it is 15 % better than a <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> with the same area.

Two {{of the most important}} diseases on mangoes of major concern in South Africa are anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. and Sacc. in Penz) and stem-end rot (SR) [Botryosphaeria parva, previously known as Dothiorella dominicana (Petrak and Cif) ]. Limited post-harvest control may be achieved with pre-harvest applications of copper-based fungicides. However, {{reduction in the number of}} fungicides re-registered due to stricter requirements, pathogen resistance, negative effects on the environment and on human health has left most of the smaller industries, such as the mango producers, in search for alternative control measures. In light of the above, there was increased scientific interest in biological control. The antagonist (Bacillus licheniformis) used in this study was previously isolated from the mango phylloplane and shown to have some potential as a biological control agent. The aim of this study was therefore to use B. licheniformis as a model system to obtain a better understanding of biological control systems in the post-harvest arena. The objectives of this study were; 1) to elucidate the mode of action of B. licheniformis, 2) to evaluate attachment, colonisation and survival of B. licheniformis on the fructoplane and 3) to further assess the antagonist’s performance in terms of consistency of efficacy in a commercial environment, alone or in combination with other products. Results from this study confirmed the in vitro antagonism of B. licheniformis. In addition the antagonist inhibited in vitro growth of C. gloeosporioides and B. parva by means of antibiosis, production of volatiles and competition. A bioactive compound was produced after ten days incubation. Competition was confirmed when the antagonist was able to produce extracellular enzymes, such as chitinase, to hydrolyse complex compounds, while restricting the pathogens ability to hydrolyse these compounds. Iron-uptake from an iron-rich medium was achieved by the antagonist and gave B. licheniformis an in vitro growth advantage. In vivo, the minimum concentration of the antagonist that was effective at inhibiting the pathogens was 107 cells/ml. Antagonist applications integrated with chemicals gave most effective post-harvest control that was equal to or more effective than the commercial chemical used. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that the antagonist attaches to the fruit surface. The recovery of the antagonist from treated fruit was high proving increased survival on the fructoplane. Temperature studies in vitro and in vivo revealed that the antagonist was most effective in inhibiting growth of the pathogens under cold storage conditions (10 ºC). This was significant as results from commercial trials confirmed those obtained in the laboratory. Calcium carbonate added in vitro and in vivo enhanced the activity of the antagonist. In this study, B. licheniformis was effective against the pathogens with in vitro assays, on the fructoplane and lastly in a commercial set up. As it is feasible to incorporate this commercial formulation into the <b>standard</b> <b>packing</b> line, further work should focus on testing this antagonist efficiency throughout the mango season and on all cultivars. An ideal biological control agent must be compatible with other systems used. It should have combined action, either not be affected by the other organisms on the fructoplane and also be able to function in an integrated system. There should be high efficacy as well as consistency of efficacy. A biological control agent should function over a broad spectrum of organisms. If a biological control agent if efficient over a long period of time, then large scale production should be tested. Dissertation (MSc (Microbiology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
