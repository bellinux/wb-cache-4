25|$|The miniSD {{form was}} {{introduced}} at March 2003 CeBIT by SanDisk Corporation which announced and demonstrated it. The SDA adopted the miniSD card in 2003 as a <b>small</b> <b>form</b> <b>factor</b> extension to the SD card standard. While the new cards were designed especially for mobile phones, {{they are usually}} packaged with a miniSD adapter that provides compatibility with a standard SD memory card slot.|$|E
25|$|For {{reasons of}} space, many devices, {{especially}} in DIN rail format, use flying leads rather than screw terminals, {{especially for the}} neutral input and FE connections. Additionally, because of the <b>small</b> <b>form</b> <b>factor,</b> the output cables of some models (Eaton/MEM) are used to form the primary winding of the RCD part, and the outgoing circuit cables must be led through a specially dimensioned terminal tunnel with the current transformer part around it. This can lead to incorrect failed trip results when testing with meter probes from the screw heads of the terminals, {{rather than from the}} final circuit wiring.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the similar}} <b>small</b> <b>form</b> <b>factor,</b> HDMI port, remote control IR receiver, and media browser {{interface}}, some users see the Mac Mini as an Apple TV alternative. It has both iTunes for media rental, purchase, and management, and a native user interface with Front Row, {{based on the}} user interface of the original Apple TV. The Apple TV is limited to video in the MP4 format, whereas Mac Mini users employing the appropriate QuickTime codecs can watch other video formats like Divx, Xvid, and the Matroska (Mkv) container, or almost all other formats using an open source player such as VLC, without resorting to hacks. The current Intel models of Mac Mini can display video via the HDMI port at a maximum resolution of 1920x1200 and up to 2560x1600 via the Mini DisplayPort with a compatible monitor.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>small</b> <b>form</b> <b>factor</b> {{computer}} {{had been}} widely speculated and requested {{long before the}} release of the Mac Mini. Rumors predicted that the [...] "headless iMac" [...] would be extremely small, include no display, and would be positioned as Apple's entry-level desktop computer. On January 10, 2005, the Mac Mini was announced alongside the iPod shuffle at the Macworld Conference & Expo and was described by Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the time as [...] "the cheapest, most affordable Mac ever".|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} and relatively recent development relating coarse WDM {{is the creation}} of GBIC and <b>small</b> <b>form</b> <b>factor</b> pluggable (SFP) transceivers utilizing standardized CWDM wavelengths. GBIC and SFP optics allow for something very close to a seamless upgrade in even legacy systems that support SFP interfaces. Thus, a legacy switch system can be easily [...] "converted" [...] to allow wavelength multiplexed transport over a fiber simply by judicious choice of transceiver wavelengths, combined with an inexpensive passive optical multiplexing device.|$|E

2500|$|Projection {{keyboards}} project {{an image}} of keys, usually with a laser, onto a flat surface. The device then uses a camera or infrared sensor to [...] "watch" [...] where the user's fingers move, and will count a key as being pressed when it [...] "sees" [...] the user's finger touch the projected image. Projection keyboards can simulate a full size keyboard from a very small projector. Because the [...] "keys" [...] are simply projected images, they cannot be felt when pressed. Users of projected keyboards often experience increased discomfort in their fingertips {{because of the lack}} of [...] "give" [...] when typing. A flat, non-reflective surface is also required for the keys to be projected. Most projection keyboards are made for use with PDAs and smartphones due to their <b>small</b> <b>form</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By 2002, major {{software}} developments also facilitated media management, hardware integration, {{and content}} presentation. [...] MythTV provided {{a free and}} open source solution using Linux. [...] The concept was to combine a digital tuner with digital video recording, program guides, and computer capabilities with a 10-foot (3 m) user interface. [...] XBMC was another free and open software project started with re-purposing the Xbox as a home theater PC but has since been ported to Windows and Macintosh operating systems in various forms including Boxee and Plex. Mainstream commercial software packages included Microsoft's XP Media Center Edition (2002) that was bundled with Windows XP and Apple's Front Row (2005) software bundled with Mac OS X. By early 2006, commercial examples of this integration included the Mac mini which had the Apple Remote, 5.1 digital audio, and an updated Front Row interface that would play shared media. [...] Because of these features and the Mini's <b>small</b> <b>form</b> <b>factor,</b> consumers began using the Mini as a Mac-based home theater PC.|$|E
