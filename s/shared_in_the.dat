5|$|The {{alternating}} {{succession of}} {{the northern and southern}} Uí Néill to the kingship of Tara would finally break down in time of Brian Boru. It was already under strain before Flann Sinna's lifetime. Two branches of the Uí Néill—the northern Cenél Conaill and the southern Síl nÁedo Sláine— had already been excluded from the succession by the Cenél nEógain and Clann Cholmáin.

5|$|Although {{only a small}} affray, it {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> profits of York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices.|$|E

Sergeant Mabbet was mortally wounded but made a wheels-up landing near St Omer. Impressed with his skilful flying while badly wounded, the Germans buried him with full honours. On 23 July, Johnson damaged another Bf 109. During this battle Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG 26 was wounded; {{his life was}} saved by a recently installed armour plate behind his head.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez's {{squadron}} {{remained at}} {{large in the}} Atlantic until July 1806, when a hurricane scattered the vessels along the American Seaboard where British patrols were waiting to intercept them. Of the 11 ships that set out in December 1805, just four eventually returned to France. The crews of the British squadron were decorated for their success, {{with the exception of}} Duckworth, who <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general thanks but was otherwise unrewarded. By leaving his post off Cadiz he had provoked the anger of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, commander in the Mediterranean; only his victory enabled Duckworth to escape a court martial.|$|E

Thomas Pope, a member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men who died in 1603, had also possessed a <b>share</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Curtain and had listed it in his will. As far as is known, Henry Lanman, who built <b>the</b> Curtain <b>in</b> 1577, had originally run that theatre as his private business; yet sometime before 1603 the Curtain had clearly been re-organized into a shareholders' enterprise. The fact that two men of Shakespeare's troupe owned <b>shares</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Curtain suggests that this re-organization occurred around the time the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting at <b>the</b> Curtain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1597 - 99 period.

5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield resumed {{her work}} for NUGMW and was re-elected to the TUC Council. In 1926 she {{supported}} the TUC's decision {{to hold a}} General Strike, and also the decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party or the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became {{the basis of the}} Unemployment Insurance Act 1927. Bondfield's association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.|$|E
5|$|By August 1942, {{preparations}} were begun {{for a major}} operation, Jubilee, at Dieppe. The Dieppe raid {{took place}} on 19 August 1942. Johnson took off at 07:40 in Spitfire VB. EP254, DW-B. Running into around 50 Bf 109s and Fw 190s in fours, pairs and singly. In a climbing attack Johnson shot down one Fw 190 which crashed into the sea and <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> destruction of a Bf 109F. While heading back to base, Johnson attacked an alert Fw 190 which met his attack head on. The dogfight descended from 8,000 to zero feet. Flying over Dieppe, Johnson dived towards a destroyer in the hope its fire would drive off the Fw 190, now on his tail. The move worked and Johnson landed back at RAF West Malling at 09:20. For {{the remainder of the}} year, the squadron was moved to RAF Castletown in September 1942 to protect the Royal Navy fleet at Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|Peter Stark Lumsden {{was born}} at Belhelvie Lodge, Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, on 9 November 1829. He was trained at Addiscombe Military Seminary {{from the age of}} 20, and entered the East India Company's Bengal Army in 1847 as an ensign in the 60th Bengal Native Infantry. Between 1852 and 1857 he served on the North-West Frontier in five expeditions against native tribes: the Mohmunds, the Ootman Khel, the Bori Afridis and the Miranzais. He was {{mentioned}} in despatches five times and awarded the special thanks of the Local and supreme Governments. From 1857 to 1858 he accompanied a special peace-finding mission to Kandahar with his brother Harry Lumsden. He received thanks from the Government for his work, but returned to India {{to take part in the}} suppression of the Indian Mutiny. Lumsden next joined the Central India Field Force at Gwalior under General Sir Robert Napier, and, as assistant quartermaster general under Major-General Hugh Rose, <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pursuit and capture of Tantya Tope in 1859, when he was again mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|Squadron Leader Michael Crossley {{was back}} in action with No. 32 Squadron. With No. 501, Crossley's units {{attempted}} to engage KG 2 while over Herne Bay. The 15-strong Hurricanes were blocked by escorting Bf 109s. No. 501 came under attack from II./JG 51. One was shot down and its pilot, George E.B. Stoney was killed. His victor was Hauptmann Josef Foezoe, an Austrian pilot. No. 501 quickly counter-attacked, destroying two Bf 109s. One of them was flown by Horst Tietzen, an ace with 20 victories and the fourth highest claimant in the Luftwaffe at that time. The other victim was Hans-Otto Lessing. Both German pilots were killed. Another Bf 109 fell to Peter Brothers. The Bf 109s 22-year-old pilot, Gerhard Mueller was killed. Meanwhile, Crossley, Karol Pniak and Alan Ackford <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> destruction of another Bf 109. The pilot, Walter Blume was severely injured and taken prisoner. Within a short time, the Germans turned the tables, and three Hurricanes (Crossley, Pilot Officer de Grunne and Pilot Officer Pearce) were shot down. All three survived, though Pearce and de Grunne suffered burns. But while the RAF fighters were kept busy by the escort, the Dorniers continued without interception.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} adjacent to Muhammad's house; he settled there after his Hijra (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE. He <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavy work of construction.

The mosque is {{under the control of the}} Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The mosque is located in what was traditionally the center of Medina, with many hotels and old markets nearby. It is a major pilgrimage site. Many pilgrims who perform the Hajj go on to Medina to visit the mosque due to its connections to the life of Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|This crisis had {{its roots}} in the Great Powers' {{competition}} for colonies in the last decades of the 19th century. The German Empire, invigorated by its victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War and by its unification under the Prussian monarchy, had newfound imperial ambitions that stretched beyond Europe. It had <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> division of Africa, and in the 1880s looked to the Pacific as well. Ships of its Imperial Navy were sent to Apia in Samoa, where German agents had fomented rebellion against the indigenous government. They were countered there by the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy. The United States had nearly completed establishing control over its territories on the North American continent, leading American ambitions to stretch beyond its shores. The squadron was at Samoa to assert US interests in the Pacific and to watch the Germans.|$|E
