5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. <b>So</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E

25|$|Fluctuations in {{exchange}} rates are usually caused by actual monetary flows {{as well as}} by expectations of changes in monetary flows. These are caused by changes in gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation (purchasing power parity theory), interest rates (interest rate parity, Domestic Fisher effect, International Fisher effect), budget and trade deficits or surpluses, large cross-border M deals and other macroeconomic conditions. Major news is released publicly, often on scheduled dates, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> access to the same news at the same time. However, the large banks have an important advantage; they can see their customers' order flow.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1992 movie Wayne's World, Wayne (played by Mike Myers) takes {{a guitar}} and plays several {{notes of the}} song in the {{original}} theatrical release. In the scene, Wayne is almost immediately stopped by a store employee who points to a [...] "No Stairway" [...] sign. This alluded {{to the fact that}} <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> attempted the song on guitar while at music stores, employees became sick of hearing it and banned patrons from playing [...] "Stairway", threatening them with removal. In the video releases and television airings of the movie, however, the notes are changed to a generic guitar riff due to licensing restrictions imposed by WMG and the band.|$|E
25|$|In {{the great}} upsurge of sport after the Restoration in 1660, cricket flourished because <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{encountered}} it as children, especially at school.

2500|$|Osbourne has abused {{alcohol and}} other drugs {{for most of his}} adult life.

[...] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that, while all the band were involved with {{alcohol and other}} drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were [...] "out for the count". Keyboardist Don Airey said that Osbourne's substance-abuse issues were what caused him to leave the band.|$|E
2500|$|Merkerson {{has often}} been reticent about {{revealing}} what her first name really was (Sharon). On the June 11, 2005, episode of NPR's Wait Wait...

She has legally changed her first name to S.

[...] She further went on to clarify that she prefers to be addressed as [...] "Epatha" [...] as opposed to [...] "S. Epatha."

2500|$|Duterte's {{constant}} cursing had {{local officials}} {{worried that the}} Philippines would lose foreign aid from the United States and European Union. [...] He responded that “If {{you think it is}} high time for you guys to withdraw your assistance, go ahead. [...] We will not beg for it. We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" [...] he said. [...] The President continued that he would “be the first to go hungry. I will {{be the first one to}} die of hunger". [...] Local actress Agot Isidro responded in Tagalog [...] "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. <b>So</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> nothing to eat, and yet you'll starve us even further". Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that [...] "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well".|$|E

60|$|Her {{anger and}} humiliation {{had been very}} great, and she had battled very {{persistently}} and very ably to regain the prize which she had lost. She knew quite well that, but {{for the fact that}} she belonged to the alien and despised race, Erös Béla would have been only too happy to marry her. His vanity alone had made him choose Kapus Elsa. He wanted the noted beauty for himself, because the noted beauty had been courted by <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> and where <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> failed he was proud to succeed.|$|R
25|$|Police {{were met}} with silence in many areas as they asked for {{witnesses}} to come forward, receiving few tips despite <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>having</b> been witnesses to, or victims of, the events.

Officers built relationships with residents of these communities, helping them overcome a historic distrust of police and fears of gang retaliation.|$|R
2500|$|In 2006, MacCorkindale {{experienced}} stomach cramps whilst filming Casualty and {{was diagnosed}} with bowel cancer. He had a section of his colon removed, and despite recommendation from doctors that he allow ten to twelve weeks for recovery, MacCorkindale scheduled the operation to coincide with a two-week break in Casualty filming schedule. He took a sixth-month sabbatical from the show, during which time he toured with a theatrical production of Agatha Christie's The Unexpected Guest. In May 2007, MacCorkindale learned that the cancer had spread to his lungs, and was told he had five years to live. He returned to film his final series of Casualty in late 2007. He did not disclose his illness to his colleagues, and found it surreal when scripts required Harry to inform patients that they had cancer or an incurable disease. MacCorkindale departed from Casualty {{at the end of}} 2007, having appeared in 229 episodes. He died on 14 October 2010, aged 58. John Yorke, Controller of BBC Drama, praised the actor, stating: [...] "As the star and male lead of Casualty for over six years we owe Simon a massive debt. Not only was he a fabulously iconic consultant, he was also an inspirational team leader. One of the reasons <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> loved working with him on Casualty is because of the tone he established on the shop floor—always welcoming, always disciplined, always quietly the leader." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{made up my}} mind {{to amuse}} myself now. I was sick of being grave and serious. When one thinks how short a while youth lasts it is foolish not to take the best {{advantage}} of it; the time man has at his disposal is not long enough for tragedy and moaning; he has only room for a little laughter, and then his hair gets grey and his knees shaky, and he is left repenting that he did not make more of his opportunities. <b>So</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> told me that they have never regretted their vices, but often their virtues!
