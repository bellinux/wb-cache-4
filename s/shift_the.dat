Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.|$|E
5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E

To move units, players can <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> mouse to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E

5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

With Wikipedia a drain on the company's resources, Wales and Sanger decided to fund the project on a non-profit basis. Bomis laid off most of its employees to continue operating, since Wikipedia was not generating revenue. The company owned Wikipedia from its creation through 2003, and Wales used about $100,000 of Bomis' revenue to fund Wikipedia before the decision to <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> encyclopedia to non-profit status.|$|E
5|$|During the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868, {{the delegates}} paid {{attention}} to northeastern portion of the state, especially the increasing need {{for the creation of}} new counties in the region. At the time, there were a total of twenty counties located in the region, compared to twenty-three presently. The convention originally met to write a new state constitution, but members quickly tried to <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> focus to other issues. During the convention, the Committee on Counties and County Boundaries presented proposals for the creation of three new counties in the region. They were to be called Delta, Webster, and Richland. Delta County was established on July 29, 1870, by the Twelfth State Legislature. The proposals for Webster and Richland counties, however, were not passed.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey {{generally}} adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over foreign trade, flow of foreign currency, foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields (such as broadcasting, telecommunications, energy, mining, etc.). However, in 1983, Prime Minister Turgut Özal initiated a series of reforms designed to <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, market-based model.|$|E
5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying {{the best of these}} early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the German night fighter intruders began {{achieving}} substantial successes. British ground defences, {{which had}} taken their toll on the German units in 1940, were now side-stepped by a decision to <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> area of operations to the North Sea, by the English coast. In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 over the sea. In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes. German losses amounted to 27 destroyed and 31 damaged to all causes.|$|E

In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E

Archer and Tucker then suggest the colonists <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> entire colony to the south 50 meters. When the Klingon marauders arrive, the colony appears deserted and silent. Finally the {{defenders}} show themselves, and in the ensuing fight the Klingons are lured into an area surrounded by the capped-off deuterium well heads. On cue, the wells are ignited, surrounding the Klingons with flames. Tessic then tells the Klingons to leave and never come back. After they depart, Archer is rewarded with 2,000 liters of deuterium by the grateful miners.|$|E

In May 2014 Metro announced plans to retrofit more than 500 fare vending machines throughout the system to dispense SmarTrip cards, rather than paper fare cards, and eventually eliminate magnetic fare cards entirely. This was completed in early December 2015 when the last paper farecard was sold. The faregates stopped accepting paper farecards on March 6, 2016, and the last day for trading in farecards to transfer the value to SmarTrip was June 30, 2016.|$|E
