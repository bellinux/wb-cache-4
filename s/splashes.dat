5|$|Gunnery {{developments}} in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners {{to wait for the}} shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related problem was that the shell <b>splashes</b> from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the <b>splashes</b> from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire to wait for the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns' faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or <b>splashes</b> out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSplash is an {{important}} process in interrill erosion because it produces movement of soil fragments. However, this process is technically difficult to measure and {{little is known about}} its size selectivity. In this study, a <b>splash</b> ring device was used to characterise the spatial variation of the quantity and the aggregate size distribution of <b>splashed</b> soil fragments. Soil aggregates were placed at the centre of an experimental device subjected to a 29 mm h− 1 simulated rainfall with a kinetic energy of 17 J mm− 1. <b>Splashed</b> soil fragments were collected in concentric rings and analysed for masses and fragment size distributions. Four different soils, with various textures, were tested. Soils fragments were <b>splashed</b> across the whole <b>splash</b> device up to 45 cm from the source, and the quantity of <b>splashed</b> fragments decreased exponentially with the distance. For the four tested soils, the <b>splash</b> parameters were significantly correlated to the results of aggregate stability measurements with r=− 0. 96 and r= 0. 95, respectively, for the total <b>splashed</b> mass and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of the whole <b>splashed</b> fragments. The measurement of the <b>splashed</b> fragment size distributions showed that fragments up to 2000 μm were transported by raindrop impacts. The mass percentage of the coarsest fractions of <b>splashed</b> soil fragments exponentially decreased with the distance from the source. The extent of this decrease depends on the soil type. The size distributions of <b>splashed</b> soil fragments were compared with those of soil fragments produced by breakdown. Comparison of <b>splash</b> data to aggregate breakdown data showed an enrichment of the 200 – 1000 μm size fraction in the <b>splashed</b> fragments.

The results could be used for helping fire investigators distinguishing the shaping reasons of <b>splashing</b> melted beads from fire scenes. This method can be the supplement for the existing appraisal method (ep. Metallographic analysis).
