2500|$|Bilingual lexical {{access is}} an area in {{psycholinguistics}} research that studies the activation or retrieval process of the mental lexicon for people who can speak two languages. Bilingual lexical access {{can be understood as}} all aspects of word processing, including all the mental activity from the perception of the word from one language until all its lexical knowledge from the target language is available. Research in this field seeks to fully understand these mental processes. Bilingual individuals have two mental lexical representations for an item or concept and are able to successfully select words from one language without significant interference from the other language. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} whether these dual representations interact or affect one another. Bilingual lexical access researchers focus on the control mechanisms bilinguals use to suppress the language not in use when in a monolingual mode and the degree to which the related representations within the language not in use are activated. [...] For example, when a Dutch-English bilingual is asked to name a picture of a dog in English, he or she will come up with the English word dog. Bilingual lexical access is the mental process that underlies this seemingly simple task: the process that makes the connection between the [...] "idea" [...] dog and the word dog in the target language. While activating the English word dog, the Dutch word hond (its equivalent in Dutch), is most likely also in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Kv {{channels}} {{are the main}} targets of Ts15. While {{other members of the}} α-family generally target both Kv channels and sodium channels (Nav channels), Ts15 only targets Kv channels. It mainly targets Kv1.2 and Kv1.3: it blocks the channel’s current by 73% and 50% respectively. When all targeted {{channels are}} compared, Ts15 has the highest affinity for Kv1.2 channels. Besides these channels, Ts15 also targets Shaker IR channels, Kv1.6 channels [...] and the Kv2.1 channels. The effects of Ts15 are voltage-independent, meaning it can bind to a channel in any <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation,</b> and they also are reversible.|$|E

The system is vacuumed and the balance is zeroed before starting experiments. Buoyancy is measured by introducing helium and pressurizing up to the highest pressure of the experiment.

The factor(s) secreted by fully activated macrophages that inhibited LPL secretion was shown to be thermolabile and distinct from tumor necrosis factor.

This population included CD 5 -positive B cells that secreted predominantly IgA. Cells from the large bowel consistently revealed higher numbers of IgA secreting cells than cells from the small bowel.

40|$|N alpha-Toysl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (Tos-LysCH 2 Cl) {{was found}} to inhibit irreversibly {{the onset of the}} hormone-induced {{refractory}} state in intact thymocytes. When thymocytes (approximately 2 X 10 (7) cells per ml) are treated with Tos-LysCH 2 Cl(10 (- 4) M, for 90 min at pH 7 and 37 degrees C) the cells retain their viability, including a full capacity to recognize and respond to hormonal stimuli, yet they selectively lose their ability to become desensitized to persistent triggering by a hormone, as reflected in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> of intracellular cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 1. 37). Whereas upon hormonal stimulation of untreated cells the immediate rise in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> of this enzyme (up to an activity ratio of > 0. 85) is followed by an exponential decline to basal values within approximately 60 min, in TosLysCH 2 Cl-treated cells the hormone-triggered elevation in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> of the enzyme is maintained for > 60 min. Evidence is presented to suggest that in thymocytes TosLysCH 2 Cl inhibits the regulatory process that normally uncouples the adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] system without interfering with previous or subsequent molecular events connected with the transfer of hormonal signals across the cell membrane. This technique allows, therefore, the preparation of viable thymocytes with a limited and distinct regulatory defect introduced by chemical (covalent) means. As such, it is most useful for studies aimed at the elucidation of the mechanism of cell desensitization and for further characterization and localization of key components responsible for cellular refractoriness...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 20  years, it has emerged that many {{molecular}} chaperones and protein-folding catalysts are secreted from cells and function, somewhat {{in the manner}} of cytokines, as pleiotropic signals for a variety of cells, with much attention being focused on the macrophage. During the last decade, it has become clear that macrophages respond to bacterial, protozoal, parasitic and host signals to generate phenotypically distinct <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation.</b> These <b>activation</b> <b>states</b> have been termed ‘classical’ and ‘alternative’ and represent not a simple bifurcation in response to external signals but a range of cellular phenotypes.

40|$|The dorsal {{cochlear}} nucleus (DCN) {{has been}} modeled in numerous studies {{as a possible}} source of tinnitus-generating signals. This hypothesis was originally developed {{on the basis of}} evidence that the DCN becomes hyperactive following exposure to intense noise. Since these early observations, evidence that the DCN is an important contributor to tinnitus has grown considerably. In this paper, the available evidence to date will be summarized. In addition, the DCN hypothesis of tinnitus can now be expanded to include possible involvement in other, non-auditory components of tinnitus. It will be shown by way of literature review that the DCN has direct connec-tions with non-auditory brainstem structures, such as the locus coeruleus, reticular formation and raphe nuclei, that are implicated in the control of attention and emotional responses. The hypothesis will be presented that attentional and emotional disorders, such as anxiety and depression, which are commonly associated with tinnitus, may result from an interplay between these non-auditory brainstem struc-tures and the DCN. Implicit in this hypothesis is that attempts to develop eVective anti-tinnitus therapies are likely to beneWt from a greater understanding of how the levels of activity in the DCN are inXuenced by diVerent <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> these non-auditory brain-stem structures and vice versa...|$|R
40|$|When {{subjects}} {{switch between}} {{a pair of}} stimulusresponse tasks, reaction time is slower on trial N if a different task was performed on trial N- 1. We present a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model that simulates this effect when subjects switch between word reading and color naming in response to Stroop stimuli. Reaction time on switch trials can be slowed by an extended response selection process which results from (a) persisting, inappropriate <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> and inhibition <b>of</b> task-controlling representations; and (b) associative learning, which allows stimuli to evoke tasks sets with which they have recently been associated (as proposed by Allport & Wylie, 2000).

40|$|Introduction The integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron {{has become}} popular as a {{simplified}} neural element in modeling {{the dynamics of}} large-scale networks of spiking neurons. A simple version of an IF neuron integrates the input current as an RC circuit (with a leakage current proportional to the depolarization) and emits a spike when the depolarization crosses a threshold. We will {{refer to it as}} the RC neuron. Networks of neurons schematized in this way exhibit a wide variety of characteristics observed in single and multiple neuron recordings in cortex in vivo. With biologically plausible time constants and synaptic efficacies, they can maintain spontaneous activity, and when the network is subjected to Hebbian learning (subsets of cells are repeatedly activated by the external stimuli), it shows many stable <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation,</b> each corresponding to a different attractor of the network dynamics, in coexistence with spontaneous activity (Amit & Brunel, 1997 a).

30|$|Achievement {{emotions}} can {{be categorized}} as either related to the activity itself or to task outcomes (Pekrun 2006). Activity-related emotions, such as excitement or boredom, {{are those that are}} experienced during task engagement. Outcome-related emotions, such as hope or anxiety, depend on the nature of task outcomes as perceived by students. Our study focused on activity-related emotions because we are interested in examining achievement emotions students experienced during the makerspace course. Valence and activation are two additional dimensions of classification (Linnenbrink-Garcia and Pekrun 2011). Valence ranges along an axis of positive to negative emotional states. Emotions such as excitement are positive emotions, whereas those such as frustration are negative emotions. <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> refer to whether the emotion tended to spur or suppress cognitive activity. For example, activation states for positive emotions range from excitement as an activating emotion to relaxation as a deactivating emotion.|$|R

METHODS: Consecutive tissue sections from 31 specimens of rheumatoid synovial tissue and cartilage-pannus junction were stained for eosinophils, mast cells, and macrophages with monoclonal antibodies and immunolocalisation techniques. RESULTS: Eosinophils were absent in 28 of the 31 specimens; the remaining three showed only the occasional eosinophil. By contrast the mean values for mast cell and macrophage (CD 68 /KP 1 marker) distributions were 24 (SD 22) and 104 (SD 66) per mm 2, respectively.
