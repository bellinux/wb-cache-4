5|$|By {{utilizing}} {{a place called}} the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual; Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity, to strengthen their party. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four <b>skills</b> which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command <b>Skills,</b> which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive <b>Skills,</b> which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session <b>Skills,</b> which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six <b>skills</b> of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories; or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in battle to grant them Radiant <b>Skills,</b> permanent <b>skills</b> separate from those inherited from weapons. These include passive effects, such as increased health or extended Session Attacks, as well as <b>skills</b> that can be performed in battle.|$|E
