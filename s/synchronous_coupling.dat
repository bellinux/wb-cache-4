50|$|Resonant {{inductive}} coupling or magnetic phase <b>synchronous</b> <b>coupling</b> is the phenomenon that the coupling is enhanced when the secondary {{side of the}} loosely coupled coil resonates. The most basic resonant {{inductive coupling}} consists of one drive coil on the primary side and one resonance circuit on the secondary side. In this case, when the resonant state on the secondary side is observed from the primary side, two resonances as a pair are observed. One of them is called the antiresonant frequency (parallel resonant frequency 1), {{and the other is}} called the resonant frequency (serial resonant frequency 1'). The short-circuit inductance and resonant capacitor of the secondary coil are combined into a resonant circuit. When the primary coil is driven with a resonant frequency (serial resonant frequency) of the secondary side, the phases of the magnetic fields of the primary coil and the secondary coil are synchronized. As a result, the maximum voltage is generated on the secondary coil due to the increase of the mutual flux, and the copper loss of the primary coil is reduced, the heat generation is reduced, and the efficiency is relatively improved. The resonant inductive coupling is the near field wireless transmission of electrical energy between magnetically coupled coils, which is part of a resonant circuit tuned to resonate at the same frequency as the driving frequency. This process occurs in a resonant transformer, an electrical component which consists of high Q coil wound on the same core with capacitors connected across the coils to make coupled LC circuit. Resonant transformers are widely used in radio circuits as bandpass filters, and in switching power supplies. Resonant inductive coupling is also being used in wireless power systems. Here the LC circuit is in different devices; a transmitter coil in one device transmits electric power across an intervening space to a resonant receiver coil in another device. This technology is being developed for powering and charging portable devices such as cellphones and tablet computers at a distance, without being tethered to an outlet. The WiTricity type magnetic resonance is that the primary side resonant is added to the basic resonant inductive coupling system in order to increase the power transmission intensity of the resonance. Thus, the WiTricity type magnetic resonance is characterized in that the resonant coils on the primary side and the resonant coils on the secondary side are paired.|$|E

40|$|The rise of dual-earner couples reshapes the {{relations}} families {{used to have}} with work. The consequences for family time of this dual participation to the labor market have not {{received a lot of}} attention yet. The family time is derived from the `with whom' variable of the last two French time-use surveys (1985 - 86 and 1998 - 99) : the three kinds of family time taken into account (conjugal time, father and mother time, and couple-children time) have considerably increased during the period studied. A classification of the family workdays is built using Matching Analysis. The shape of the family workday is highly correlated with the social position of spouses: the higher the social position of the spouses, the higher their synchronicity. Desynchronized work schedules are most of the time not chosen by couples but arise from the temporal requirements of their employers. In other words, desynchronization is a negative temporal externality affecting unequally dual-earner couples. The lack of synchronicity affects differently the different categories of family time: the more <b>synchronous</b> <b>couples</b> are, the more symmetrical family time is but the less are father and mother times.

40|$|In this, {{the first}} of three papers, the nature of, and {{motivation}} for, neuronal transients is described in relation to characterizing brain dynamics. This paper deals with some basic aspects of neuronal dynamics, interactions, coupling and implicit neuronal codes. The second paper develops neuronal transients and nonlinear coupling in the context of dynamic instability and complexity, and suggests that instability or lability is necessary for adaptive self-organization. The final paper addresses the role of neuronal transients through information theory and the emergence of spatio-temporal receptive fields and functional specialization. By considering the brain as an ensemble of connected dynamic systems one can show that a sufficient description of neuronal dynamics comprises neuronal activity at a particular time and its recent history This history constitutes a neuronal transient. As such, transients represent a fundamental metric of neuronal interactions and, implicitly, a code employed in the functional integration of brain systems. The nature of transients, expressed conjointly in distinct neuronal populations, reflects the underlying coupling among populations. This coupling may be synchronous (and possibly oscillatory) or asynchronous. A critical distinction between synchronous and asynchronous coupling is that the former is essentially linear and the latter is nonlinear. The nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions. The distinction between linear and nonlinear coupling has fundamental implications for the analysis and characterization of neuronal interactions, most of which are predicated on linear (<b>synchronous)</b> <b>coupling</b> (e. g. cross-correlograms and coherence). Using neuromagnetic data it is shown that nonlinear (asynchronous) coupling is, in fact, more abundant and can be more significant than <b>synchronous</b> <b>coupling...</b>|$|E

It yields contractions in a particular Wasserstein distance, and it provides rather precise bounds for convergence to equilibrium at the borderline between the overdamped and the underdamped regime. In particular, we are able to recover kinetic behavior in terms of explicit lower bounds for the contraction rate. For example, for a rescaled double-well potential with local minima at distance a, we obtain a lower bound for the contraction rate of order Ω (a^- 1) provided the friction coefficient is of order Θ (a^- 1) ...|$|E

30|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulation is {{an effective}} method to study complex flows at the nanoscale (Li et al. 2010). In MD simulations, the fluid behaviour is described by {{the motion of the}} individual particles interacting with each other via intermolecular potentials (Koplik and Banavar 1995). As a result, it is only suitable to simulate fluid behaviours at the nanoscale owing to the limitation of computation cost (Zhao et al. 2016). LBM, as an intermediate method between continuum and atomistic simulations, is considered to have tremendous potential for simulating the fluid flow at the meso-scale, and detailed information on it has been presented in Sect.  2.2. However, the interaction force between the fluid and rock is assumed to be directly proportional to the density of the fluid in conventional LB models, which has no theory to support it and does not represent the real physical phenomena in certain situations (Liu et al. 2015 a, b). To combine the advantages of the two described methods, coupling the LBM and MD is proposed to simulate fluid flows. MD describes the atomistic recognition of the fluid flow process near the walls of the porous media, while LBM is responsible {{for the rest of the}} simulation process and decreases the computational cost (Marsh et al. 2010). Combinations of the LB and MD methods can be divided into two categories. The first type is the <b>synchronous</b> <b>coupling</b> of the two methods performed by Ahlrichs and Dünweg (1998, 1999) and Fyta et al. (2006). In their studies, the simulation of the motion of DNA, polymers and other macromolecules in water was performed by the method. However, such a synchronous calculation method is very time-consuming for the simulation of fluid flow in porous media owing to the large computation cost of parameter passing between MD and LBM. The second type is the coupling of MD and LB in tandem to settle a problem, rather than simultaneous coupling (Marsh et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015 a, b; Pereira et al. 2016). MD provides the atomistic recognition of the flow physics near the walls, while LBM describes the rest of the simulation domain (including the Knudsen flow and absorption/dissolution-induced pore structure changes) and substantially reduces the computational cost.|$|E

Energy simulation tools can support this process. In order to reach high performance level, e. g. primary energy consumption below 50 kWh. m- 2 per year (including heating, cooling, domestic hot water, lighting and ventilation), various studies and real cases show that, appropriate architecture, high insulation, free cooling {{and the use of}} a heat recovery exchanger for ventilation are needed. This last technology will be particularly affected by airflows across the building envelope caused by a low airtightness. Moreover, free cooling ventilation rate will highly depend on temperature difference between outside and inside. Thermal modelling tools need therefore to deal with those two issues precisely. A multizone model has been developed to compute building airflows in order to evaluate them with a higher degree of precision in the frame of a simplified simulation tool {{that can be used in}} early phases of a project. This model is based on well-mixed zones and mass conservation principles. The air flow rate between two zones is expressed as a function of the pressure drop between those two zones. Wind pressure and buoyancy effects are the causes of pressure drops. Several types of connection are implemented: cracks, ventilation inlets, large openings. More types of connection will be added. This model has been implemented in the thermal building simulation tool COMFIE [1].
