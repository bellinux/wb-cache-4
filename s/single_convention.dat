5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{started in}} mid-1986 with parties at popular science fiction conventions, such as Westercon and BayCon in the San Francisco Bay Area. Over time, these parties split off into conventions of their own, starting with ConFurence 0 in 1989. Attendance at furry conventions has been growing, {{with the number}} of conventions, total attendance of all conventions and maximum size of a <b>single</b> <b>convention</b> all doubling over the period 2000–2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the city of}} Bellevue began {{studying}} a possible civic center with a new city hall, courthouses, a jail, a museum and a basketball arena for the Seattle SuperSonics. The civic center plan was scaled back to a <b>single</b> <b>convention</b> center in downtown Bellevue, Meydenbauer Center, and a new downtown library, both of which opened in 1993; the plan for a city hall was seen as controversial and unnecessary at the time. In 1990, the city hall area was proposed {{as the site of}} a county jail and courthouse to serve the Eastside. The proposed site, located north of city hall, was seen as undesirable because of its existing wetlands and was rejected in favor of a site near Overlake Hospital Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} coca remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving the growers {{of an international}} market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia withdrew from the UN 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised Bolivia, asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.|$|E

25|$|The {{legality}} of psychoactive drugs has been controversial {{through most of}} recent history; the Second Opium War and Prohibition are two historical examples of legal controversy surrounding psychoactive drugs. However, in recent years, the most influential document regarding the {{legality of}} psychoactive drugs is the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs, an international treaty signed in 1961 as an Act of the United Nations. Signed by 73 nations including the United States, the USSR, India, and the United Kingdom, the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs established Schedules for the legality of each drug and laid out an international agreement to fight addiction to recreational drugs by combatting the sale, trafficking, and use of scheduled drugs. All countries that signed the treaty passed laws to implement these rules within their borders. However, some countries that signed the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs, such as the Netherlands, are more lenient with their enforcement of these laws.|$|E

India is a party of the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971), the Protocol Amending the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs (1972) and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988). An Indo-Pakistani committee {{was set up in}} 1986 to prevent trafficking in narcotic drugs. India signed a convention with the United Arab Emirates in 1994 to control drug trafficking.

5000|$|Two word spaces (English Spacing). It is {{sometimes}} {{claimed that the}} two-space convention stems {{from the use of}} the monospaced font on typewriters, but in fact that convention replicates much earlier typography — the intent was to provide a clear break between sentences. [...] This spacing method was gradually replaced by the <b>single</b> space <b>convention</b> in published print, where space is at a premium, and continues in much digital media.|$|R
5000|$|The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, {{also known}} as APA style, is a widely used style guide that is favored by the social {{sciences}} in the United States. Although 2009 saw a number of changes and reversals for certain aspects of its style recommendations, the current guidance from the American Psychological Association (APA) as of July 2009 is a recommendation to use two spaces for draft manuscripts and work. This recommendation does not apply [...] "to the published, or final version, of a work", where the spacing convention {{is determined by the}} publication designer. Since U.S. publishers of print media typically use the <b>single</b> space <b>convention,</b> this means that drafts prepared with the double-space convention would be converted to the <b>single</b> space <b>convention</b> for final publication. The APA also notes, [...] "the usual convention for published works remains one space after each period", and that the practice of publishers removing extra spaces from a manuscript prior to publication [...] "is a routine part of the manuscript preparation process here at the APA".|$|R

In Austria, {{the drug is}} listed under the Suchtmittelgesetz in categories corresponding to their classification under the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs. Dispensing of products containing codeine and similar drugs (dihydrocodeine, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, ethylmorphine etc.), in general, requires a prescription order from a doctor or {{the discretion of the}} pharmacist.|$|E
25|$|Legal opium {{production}} is allowed under the United Nations <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs {{and other international}} drug treaties, subject to strict supervision by the law enforcement agencies of individual countries. The leading legal production method is the Gregory process, whereby the entire poppy, excluding roots and leaves, is mashed and stewed in dilute acid solutions. The alkaloids are then recovered via acid-base extraction and purified. This process {{was developed in the}} UK during World War II, when wartime shortages of many essential drugs encouraged innovation in pharmaceutical processing.|$|E
25|$|THC, {{along with}} its double bond isomers and their stereoisomers, {{is one of only}} three cannabinoids {{scheduled}} by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances (the other two are dimethylheptylpyran and parahexyl). It was listed under Schedule I in 1971, but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the WHO. Based on subsequent studies, the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III. Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV). It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law under the Controlled Substances Act passed by the US Congress in 1970.|$|E
50|$|The PowerPC {{architecture}} has a {{large number}} of registers so most functions can pass all arguments in registers for single level calls. Additional arguments are passed on the stack, and space for register-based arguments is also always allocated on the stack as a convenience to the called function in case multi-level calls are used (recursive or otherwise) and the registers must be saved. This is also of use in variadic functions, such as , where the function's arguments need to be accessed as an array. A <b>single</b> calling <b>convention</b> is used for all procedural languages.|$|R

Arms 1 and 2 are sometimes called the side or collinear arms. Port 3 is called the H-plane port, and is also called the Σ port, sum port or the P-port (for [...] "parallel"). Port 4 is the E-plane port, and is also called the Δ port, difference port, or S-port (for [...] "series"). There is no one <b>single</b> established <b>convention</b> regarding the numbering of the ports.|$|R
25|$|Dextromethorphan was {{excluded}} from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 and was specifically {{excluded from the}} <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs. As of 2010, Dextromethorphan was still excluded from U.S. scheduling of controlled substances; however, officials have warned that it could still be added if increased abuse warrants its scheduling. The motivation behind its exclusion from the CSA was that, under the CSA, all optical isomers of listed Schedule II opiates are automatically Schedule II substances. Since dextromethorphan is an optical isomer of the Schedule II opiate levomethorphan (but does not act like an opiate), an exemption was necessary {{to keep it a}} non-controlled substance. The Federal Analog Act does not apply to dextromethorphan because a new drug application has been filed for it.|$|E
25|$|Morphine {{and other}} poppy-based {{medicines}} {{have been identified}} by the World Health Organization as essential {{in the treatment of}} severe pain. As of 2002, seven countries (USA, UK, Italy, Australia, France, Spain and Japan) use 77% of the world's morphine supplies, leaving many emerging countries lacking in pain relief medication. The current system of supply of raw poppy materials to make poppy-based medicines is regulated by the International Narcotics Control Board under the provision of the 1961 <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs. The amount of raw poppy materials that each country can demand annually based on these provisions must correspond to an estimate of the country's needs taken from the national consumption within the preceding two years. In many countries, underprescription of morphine is rampant because of the high prices and the lack of training in the prescription of poppy-based drugs. The World Health Organization is now working with administrations from various countries to train healthworkers and to develop national regulations regarding drug prescription to facilitate a greater prescription of poppy-based medicines.|$|E

5000|$|In {{dramatic}} {{contrast to}} Article VII-whose unanimity rule that no state can bind another confirms {{the sovereignty of}} each state prior to 1787 - Article V does not permit a <b>single</b> state <b>convention</b> to modify the federal Constitution for itself. Moreover, it makes clear that a state may be bound by a federal constitutional amendment even if that state votes against the amendment in a properly convened state convention. And this rule is flatly inconsistent {{with the idea that}} states remain sovereign after joining the Constitution, even if they were sovereign before joining it. Thus, ratification of the Constitution itself marked the moment when previously sovereign states gave up their sovereignty and legal independence.|$|R
40|$|Mr. McBride's {{comments}} are appreciated. Most {{of the points}} made are accepted, however, {{the suggestion that the}} six zone convention be replaced by a <b>single</b> zone <b>convention</b> is not attractive. The six zone convention was adopted because it yields smooth, well behaved, yet uniformly sensitive relationships between the measured pressure ratios and the parameters sought. Single zone correlations could not cover the same range of probe orientations without possessing singularities, since there is no single pressure difference available as a denominator, which does not go to zero somewhere in the operating range. An attempt was made to fit the entire correlation surfaces with splined polynomials, however, better accuracy and speed were achieved with a bi-cubic interpolation in the region of the operating point...|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has {{authority}} over all drugs, including psychoactive drugs.

The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 regulates the recreational drugs outlined in the <b>Single</b> <b>Convention</b> on Narcotic Drugs. Alcohol is regulated by state governments, but the federal National Minimum Drinking Age Act penalizes states for not following a national drinking age.

40|$|In {{the guiding}} center theory, smooth unit vectors {{perpendicular}} to the magnetic field are required to define the gyrophase. The question of global existence of these vectors is addressed using a general result from the theory of characteristic classes. It is found that there is, in certain cases, an obstruction to global existence. In these cases, the gyrophase cannot be defined globally. The implications of this fact on {{the basic structure of}} the guiding center theory are discussed. In particular it is demonstrated that the guiding center asymptotic expansion of the equations of motion can still be performed in a globally consistent manner when a <b>single</b> global <b>convention</b> for measuring gyrophase is unavailable. The latter fact is demonstrated directly by deriving a new expression for the guiding-center Poincaré-Cartan form exhibiting no dependence on the choice of perpendicular unit vectors.
