5|$|Admiral Scheer sailed in October 1940 on {{her first}} combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her B-Dienst radio {{intercept}} equipment identified the convoy HX-84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Admiral Scheers Arado seaplanes located the convoy on 5 November 1940, The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for the convoy, issued {{a report of the}} German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking the convoy. The convoy was ordered to scatter under cover of a smoke screen. Admiral Scheers first salvo scored hits on Jervis Bay, disabling her wireless equipment and steering gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen VC. Admiral Scheer quickly sank Jervis Bay, but the delay allowed the majority of the convoy to escape. The Admiral Scheer sank only five of the convoy's 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy's dispersal.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, MacDonald left {{again for}} Europe and while there, signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first MGM film was The Cat and the Fiddle (1934), {{based on the}} Jerome Kern Broadway hit. Her co-star was Ramón Novarro. The plot about {{unmarried}} lovers shacking up just barely <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> new Production Code guidelines that took effect July 1, 1934. Despite a Technicolor finale—the first use of the new three-color Technicolor process other than Disney cartoons—the film was not a huge success.|$|E

At Martinsville, he led 79 laps and was leading with ten laps to go when a caution came out for a wreck between Kyle Larson and Marcos Ambrose. On the resulting restart, Earnhardt was running 5th. During the restart, he <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> pack and overtook Tony Stewart for the lead in turn 4. He continued to hold the lead to win the race ahead of Jeff Gordon. It was Earnhardt's first career win at Martinsville.|$|E
25|$|Halsey, {{in command}} of the naval forces {{covering}} the invasion, fell for the ruse, and convinced that Northern Force constituted the main Japanese threat, proceeded northward in pursuit with the carriers of 3rd Fleet and a powerful force of battleships, designated Task Force 34. This left the landing beaches covered only by sixteen escort carriers with about 450 aircraft from the 7th Fleet. On the morning of the 25th a strong Japanese force of battleships <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> San Bernardino Strait headed toward the American landing forces, prompting their commander, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, to send a desperate plaintext message asking for support.|$|E
25|$|In July 1771, {{one hundred}} men under Captains Butler and Stewart {{returned}} to the Wyoming Valley to lay siege to Fort Wyoming. Captain Ogden <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lines at night to raise a relief column in Philadelphia. The relief force was ambushed by the Yankees and lost their baggage and supplies. After a month-long siege, Fort Wyoming capitulated on August 15, 1771, {{and there would be}} peace in the Wyoming Valley for the next four years, in which Stewart and his militiamen could enjoy the cultivation of the lands granted them for their military services. He and his wife, Martha Espy raised a family of seven children here.|$|E

25|$|Hood and Stuart {{agreed that}} they would not permit Calvi to hold beyond 10 August, but on the evening of 28 July four small vessels {{carrying}} supplies <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> meagre British blockade, to cheers from the defenders. The offer of surrender was withdrawn, and firing resumed once more on both sides at 17:00, but these ships brought no ammunition, for which Calvi was desperately short, and on 31 July a new offer of a truce was made and accepted by Stuart, to last six days. On 10 August, after 51 days of siege, Casabianca capitulated as arranged, his men marching from the town and laying their arms down before the commander signed terms with Stuart that guaranteed his repatriation to France with his surviving garrison.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} his funeral, his village was raided by New Zealand {{military}} police; they ransacked houses, {{including those of the}} Tamasese's mourning widow and children. Colonel Allen requested reinforcements from New Zealand after he claimed 2000 Mau had caused a riot. On 12 January 1930 the Royal New Zealand Navy flagship Dunedin brought marines to hunt down members of The Mau. The Mau, who were fully committed to Passive Resistance, easily <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> jungle; the marines were slow because they were carrying too much weaponry and didn't know the bush like The Mau. The Mau no longer trusted New Zealand police, and this fear only got worse after a 16-year-old un-armed Samoan was shot and killed while running away from a marine, whose excuse he thought the boy was going to throw a stone was accepted as an adequate defence and no charges were laid.|$|E
25|$|Having ravaged Apulia without {{provoking}} Fabius into a battle, Hannibal {{decided to}} march through Samnium to Campania, {{one of the}} richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. The latter was aware that there were excellent opportunities to trap the Carthaginian force on the Campanian plain and to force Hannibal to fight in the surrounding mountains on ground of his own choice. As the year wore on, Hannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated plains of Campania but Fabius had ensured that all the mountain passes offering an exit were blocked. This situation led to the night battle of Ager Falernus in which the Carthaginians made good their escape by tricking the Romans into believing that they were heading to the heights above them. The Romans were thus decoyed and the Carthaginians <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> undefended pass with all their baggage train. This was a severe blow to Fabius’ prestige.|$|E

25|$|Horn {{allegedly}} {{killed his}} first {{man in a}} duel— a second lieutenant in the Mexican Army, whom he killed {{as a result of}} a dispute with a prostitute. At sixteen, Horn headed to the American Southwest, where he was hired by the U.S. Cavalry as a civilian scout, packer and interpreter under Al Sieber during the Apache Wars. Horn did a great job in his work for the army, and soon he rose through the ranks. In one instance, as Sieber, Horn, and the army were crossing the Cibicue Creek, they were ambushed by Apaches warriors positioned on high ground. The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, Mickey Free, to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Tom Horn and Al Sieber participated during the Battle of Big Dry Wash, and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> banks opposite of the Apache line, and provided covering fire for the cavalry as well as killing a number of Apaches warriors.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{was often}} the case with the Polish electoral monarchy, the outcome was {{strongly}} contested by the greedy and stubborn Polish nobility who backed and supported the Archduke Maximilian III of Austria for King of Poland. Upon hearing of his election King Sigismund <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> clutches of the Protestants in Sweden and landed in Poland on 7 October, immediately agreeing to give up several royal privileges to the parliament (Sejm) in the hope of winning over some of his enemies and settling the disputed election. He was proclaimed by the Lesser Prussian Treasurer Jan Dulski as king on behalf of Crown Marshal Andrzej Opaliński, and after arriving in the Royal Capital City of Kraków he was crowned on 27 December at Wawel Cathedral. It seemed that the issue of who would be King of Poland had been settled when Maximilian III invaded Poland to claim the crown. Hetman Jan Zamoyski defeated Maximilian at the Battle of Byczyna and took him prisoner. However, at the request of Pope Sixtus V, King Sigismund III released Maximilian, who surrendered his claim to Poland in 1589. King Sigismund also tried to maintain peace with his powerful neighbor by marrying Archduchess Anne Habsburg in 1592. It was always his intention to maintain an alliance with Catholic Austria against the Protestant forces.|$|E

By 2300, the attack by the 9th SS Panzer had been stopped.

500|$|On 16 October 1917 the Admiralty {{received}} word of German ship movements, possibly indicating {{some sort of}} raid. Admiral Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea {{in an effort to}} locate the enemy ships. Courageous and Glorious were not initially ordered to sea, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling {{the central part of the}} North Sea later that day. Two German [...] light cruisers <b>slipped</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy bound for Norway during the morning of 17 October, but the British warships received no word of the engagement until that afternoon.

She only captured four small British merchant ships during this period {{and returned to the}} Portsmouth Navy Yard for repairs in late 1813. By this time of the war, materials and personnel were being diverted to the Great Lakes, which created a shortage of resources necessary to repair her. Due to the amount of repairs she needed, it was decided instead to place her in ordinary, where she stayed {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
