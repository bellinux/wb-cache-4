50|$|Water gel {{explosives}} {{tend to be}} less toxic and {{are less}} hazardous than dynamite to manufacture, transport, and store. Water gels are also less expensive than conventional explosives. Because they are relatively safe and easy to use, they are often used in the mining industry. There are many different types of water gel explosives for use in different situations. One type, a small diameter <b>slurry</b> <b>explosive,</b> can be used specifically for blasting in coal undercut, midcut, and depillaring areas. They are preferable to nitroglycerin-based explosives like dynamite because they produce less noxious fumes. Detagel, which is very high in strength, is a specific example of a small diameter water gel explosive that is used for mining activities.|$|E
5000|$|His 50+ year {{career in}} {{theoretical}} and practical explosives spans some remarkable achievements. As an expert in explosives, Melvin was an investigator of the 1947 fertilizer explosion in Texas City, Texas. The Texas City Disaster is considered the worst industrial accident in United States history. In December 1956 he created a new blasting agent using a mixture of ammonium nitrate, aluminum powder, and fuel oil: a most unusual mixture. This explosive, {{the first of the}} so-called [...] "slurry explosives," [...] was remarkably safe. He did consulting work for the Iron Ore Company of Canada, where the aluminized ammonium nitrate <b>slurry</b> <b>explosive</b> (with water) he developed was successfully used. His work on slurry explosives {{paved the way for the}} development of the BLU-82, nicknamed the [...] "Daisy Cutter" [...] (because of its use in Vietnam to clear helicopter landing zones), one of the largest and most powerful conventional bombs in the U.S. military inventory, using aluminized slurry.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Avalanche {{control by}} {{explosives}} {{is among the}} key temporary preventive measures and fixed avalanche control installations are frequently installed today. Hitherto, {{little is known about}} weak layer failure and crack propagation due to an explosion. In the winter 2013 - 2014 we performed field ex-periments on a flat study site. We triggered <b>slurry</b> <b>explosive</b> charges ranging from 4. 25 to 5 kg as used in avalanche control at different heights above the snow surface. At three different distances from the point of explosion we measured surface air pressure and accelerations within the snowpack at various depths. Cameras were placed in the snow pits for recording weak layer failure and crack propagation and to monitor the snowpack deformation by particle tracking velocimetry. We assessed whether weak layer fail-ure occurred and if so whether it was caused by crack propagation or the direct impact of the air pressure wave above the point of observation (pit). We compared these results to the data recorded by the accel-erometers and microphones to obtain magnitudes required to cause weak layer failure in a given snow-pack. First results show loading conditions using explosives required to fail a weak layer given a certain snowpack...|$|E

During the winter 2013 – 2014 we performed field experiments on a flat study site. We triggered <b>slurry</b> <b>explosive</b> charges at different heights above the snow surface. At three different distances from the point of explosion we measured surface air pressure and accelerations of the snowpack at various depths. Cameras were placed in the snow pits for recording weak layer failure and crack propagation. We report empirical relations for the decay of near-surface air pressure, accelerations, displacement velocities and displacement with distance from the explosion and depth within the snowpack. Waves within the snowpack arrived earlier at the sensors than the corresponding air pressure waves at the microphones. Air pressure decayed stronger than accelerations within the snowpack. Weak layer failure mainly happened in the top part of the snowpack. We observed two types of weak layer failure, one caused by the direct impact of the air pressure wave close to the point of observation, the other by failure induced by the air pressure wave closer to the point of explosion and subsequent crack propagation. Our measurements increase the understanding of acoustic wave propagation in snow and can be used for comparison with numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The polysaccharides are {{important}} materials in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and related bio-medical applications. Xanthan gum is a microbial polysaccharide of great commercial significance. It {{is well known}} as one of the best thickening polymers due to its high intrinsic stiffness related to the he-lical conformation stabilized in the presence of excess salt. It is used in a wide variety of foods for a number of important reasons, including emulsion stabilization, temperature stability, compatibility with food ingredients, and its pseudoplastic rheological properties. Due to its properties in thickening aque-ous solutions, as a dispersing agent, and stabilizer of emulsions and suspensions, xanthan gum is used in pharmaceutical formulations, cosmetics, and agricultural products, as well as in textile printing pastes, ceramic glazes, <b>slurry</b> <b>explosive</b> formulations, and rust removers. In this work the crosslinking of a mix-ture of xanthan and lignins in the presence of the epichlorohydrin, leading to superabsorbant hydrogels with high swelling rate in aqueous mediums, was studied. The swelling properties of these composite hy-drogels were investigated. Three different types of lignin have been used namely: aspen wood lignin (L), annual fiber crop lignin (GL) and lignin epoxy-modified resin (LER). Semi-interpenetrating polymer net-work hydrogels in various ratios were prepared. The influence of gravimetric ratio between components of the semi-interpenetrating polymer networks, as well as the kinetics of water sorption will be discussed. The maximum swelling degree of the hydrogels and the swelling rate constant were determined as a func-tion of the hydrogel’s composition. It has been established that the nature of lignin significantly influences swelling process, the chemical modified lignin having a particular behavior. Key Words: Semi-interpenetrating networks, xanthan–lignin hydrogels, swelling degree 1...|$|E
50|$|For {{his work}} in {{discovering}} <b>slurry</b> <b>explosives,</b> Cook received a Nitro Nobel Gold Medal in 1968, {{only the second time}} the award had been given (and which has been awarded only once since). This award has sometimes been confused with the Nobel Prize conferred by the Nobel Foundation, but although it is given by the successor explosives company founded by Alfred Nobel, Nitro-Nobel AB (now a part of Dyno Nobel), it is not of the same stature or importance as the Nobel Prize. Although it has been claimed that Cook was at one time a Nobel Prize nominee, he was never nominated.|$|R
50|$|In rock blasting, {{sympathetic}} detonations {{occur when}} the blastholes are sufficiently close to each other, usually 24in or less, and especially in rocks that poorly attenuate the shock energy. Ground water in open channels facilitates sympathetic detonation as well. Blasthole spacing of 36in or more is suggested. However, in some ditch blasting cases sympathetic detonations are exploited purposefully. Nitroglycerine-based explosives are especially susceptible. Picric acid is sensitive as well. Water gel <b>explosives,</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>explosives,</b> and emulsion explosives tend to be insensitive to sympathetic detonations. For most industrial explosives, the maximum distances for possible sympathetic detonations are between 2-8 times of the charge diameter. Uncontrolled sympathetic detonations may cause excessive ground vibrations and/or flying rocks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} assess the {{variation}} of ground vibration intensity, if any, due {{to the use of}} three different blasting methods and two different types of explosives, a large number of monitored ground vibrations was analysed in an open cut coal mine. This work involved 86 sets of blast data for different types of blasting when ANFO and <b>Slurry</b> <b>explosives</b> were used in this mine. Statistical analysis of the data sets resulted in 5 of the best fitting empirical relationships between peak particle velocity and scaled distance with excellent values of coefficients of correlations. A comparison of the analytical work revealed that the level of ground vibration varies significantly with the changing method of blasting and/or explosive type. The roles of these factors have been quantified. The rate of the vibration reduction, due to the variation of blasting modes and/or explosive type, varies within each blasting method. These rates are higher in lower ranges of scaled distances, but converge to an almost constant rate at certain scaled distances. The range of this rate varies from 45. 77 % to 89. 34 % for free face blasting, and from 38. 72 % to 56. 28 % for a buffered blast, depending on the explosive type and scaled distance. It was also observed that one of the two site-specific parameters in the empirical vibration criterion is influenced significantly by the variation of the blasting method and explosive type. However, the other parameter is not much affected by these two factors, and is shown to be more loyal to ground conditions...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the RAIL {{feasibility}} study, Operation Dorothe (March 1961) {{was conducted}} to determine if a liquid explosive could survive the acceleration of launch from a 155 mm howitzer. This operation was successful, although some structural difficulty was experienced with the test round (C- 90). Upon completion of that exercise, it was decided to design a test round that could be used with the more viscous slurry-type explosives, and to fire several of these new rounds with inert filler prior to their use with <b>slurry</b> High <b>Explosives</b> (H. E.), precluding the difficulty previously experienced. The C- 91 projectile, is a modified M 107 H. E. round. It has been reduced in weight, equipped with an obturator, and provided with a large fill orifice. The rotating band has been altered to eliminate rotation. Internally, a plastic plug is used to control column height. A piston-type `O` ring seal prevents gun gas from reaching the interior to the projectile. Four of these projectiles were fired from a 155 mm howitzer at 15, 500 g`s, plus. They survived not only the launch, but also impact and repeated ricochet in sand, gravel, and small rock. No leakage of the inert filler (glycerin) occurred. All rounds were destroyed with explosives upon completion of the exercise. Test data and engineering drawings are provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the fuel content of a monoethanolamine nitrate (MEAN) fueled <b>explosive</b> <b>slurry</b> was investigated. The work was performed in three phases. The first one involved the MEAN content reduction in a reference slurry from its initial value of 36 down to 24 % by weight, the balance being filled with ammonium nitrate, the least expensive item in the slurry composition. This proved to be successful, leading to an overall cost {{reduction of}} 17 %, while keeping the overall performance quite satisfactory. The second phase consisted in trying to bring the MEAN content down from 24 to 17 %. Although this led to further cost reduction, the formulations, obtained by substituting part of the MEAN content by ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO), produced unsatisfactory results regarding ignition and densities. In the third phase, the Design of Experiments Technique was used to find formulations displaying not only lower cost, but also acceptable overall performance. This led to a raw material cost reduction ranging from 23 to 26 % relative to the initial reference slurry formulation...|$|R
