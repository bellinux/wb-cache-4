The Court then went on to find that the Law Society had sufficient interest to apply for mandamus as under the Legal Profession Act one of its purposes was [...] "to maintain and impose the standards of conduct ... of the legal profession in Singapore", and the Council of the Society was empowered by the Act to formulate charges against advocates and solicitors whom the Inquiry Committee felt should be formally investigated.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1930s {{the company was}} in {{financial}} difficulties and had shrunk to a shadow of its former <b>self,</b> <b>employing</b> only 60 workers. The company {{was in the process}} of being taken over by the Bank of California in 1940 when businessman Charles E. Moore, with the financial support of the Six Companies, took a controlling interest. Moore soon managed to contract with the US Navy for the building of some torpedo tube mounts, and shortly thereafter he secured a contract for the building of twelve triple expansion marine steam engines. [...] By 1942, with the US government's wartime Emergency Shipbuilding Program getting underway, it became clear that a large number of new marine engines would be needed to power the new ships. Since there was a shortfall in capacity to produce modern steam turbines, it was realized that most of the new Liberty ships would have to be fitted with older and slower reciprocating steam engines instead. Admiral Vickery contacted Moore to ask if he could double the original order of 12 engines, to which Moore is reported to have responded that it would be as easy to tool up for a hundred as for a dozen. The company was then contracted to build 118 triple expansion steam engines for the Liberty ships.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 310 - 317) Anorexia nervosa and bulimia {{are eating}} disorders whose cause and/ or effect {{may be related}} to self concept. Though many psychological, attitudinal, behavioral, and historical similarities exist between the two disorders, two features distinguish the respective populations: their weights and the regular occurrence of binges and purges. Anorexia characterized by a relentless pursuit of thinness resulting in severe emaciation (regarded nevertheless by many anorexics as approaching an ideal appearance) and may be associated with episodic bulimia. Individuals with primary bulimia may have similar fears, concerns and pursuits as those found in anorexia. However, rather than merely episodic bulimia, they engage in regular and recurrent episodes of binges and purges. Furthermore, the bulimic individual~ unlike the anorexic, does not become severely emaciated. This thesis documents a study of 77 individuals with anorexic and/or bulimic tendencies and attempts to determine whether a self concept difference is apparent between individuals whose eating disorder is primarily bulimic versus those exhibiting abstainer behavior. It was postulated that the bulimic's "out of control" behavior would negatively affect the self concept whereas the anorexic's "virtuous" self restraint would {{have a positive effect on}} the self concept. This was anticipated since the anorexic more closely attains her ideal self, interms of weight and behavior, than the bulimic, who, in an attempt to attain an ideal <b>self,</b> <b>employs</b> a behaviot which undermines her positive self concept. Individuals in the study group were assigned to the anorexic or bulimic category based on their premorbid and current weight histories and the occurrence of regular bulimic episodes. Two instruments were used to measure the self concept: the Tennessee Self Concept Scale, and the Body Cathexis - Self Cathexis Scale. (See more in text. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis employs phenomenological {{hermeneutic}} circle analysis, {{to investigate}} structure versus agency and adult identity change in lifelong learning. Achieving transformed agency and enhanced identity is argued {{to be about}} other ways of doing and other ways of seeing (Mezirow 2000 : 21). It proceeds by exploring if curricula employed in education can provide structure and/or the catalyst which allows ‘other’ to be revealed, agency to be regained, and to explicate what contribution curricula might make in transforming adult identities. Drawing upon the disciplines of sociology and psychology it provides holistic interpretations of participant accounts in the contemporary competitive world and explores the interstices in the duality of tensions between the utilitarian, and pragmatic adult, who employs education as a developmental pathway of choice. Interviews with six participants tell individual stories to provide holistic data of their erudition and experiences of cognitive and social change. Data are then employed to essentialise similarities, differences, themes, and congruent essences, and to distil factors which exemplify growth in understanding and expectations of the self. Growth in self-assurance and identity change capability is then contrasted with the fragility of adult identity; whereupon, this thesis critically positions fragility causation amongst the instrumental policies and forces of lifelong learning. Mezirow contends that agency is achieved by elaborating existing frames, learning new frames, transforming habits, and transforming points of view. This thesis moves to discuss the connected nature of these developmental factors and ‘glass ceilings’, and how immanent personal potential is (re) revealed to the adult <b>self.</b> <b>Employing</b> an archaeological hermeneutic research tool which suggests reflection is a central and developing feature in adult’s educational development the thesis finally contends that education {{is important in the}} personal delivery of agency over structure, and that curricula of any structurally legitimate form make a significant contribution to allowing persons to both flourish and confront a range of ‘other’ life circumstances and dilemmas.
