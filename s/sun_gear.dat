25|$|Because of {{the large}} space between the mean <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and {{the front of the}} case and the size of and {{mechanical}} features on the mean <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship. This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, {{because of the lack of}} evidence many solutions have been put forward.|$|E
25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} ring gears that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> which is almost hidden. The blue gears are called planet gears and the pink gear is the ring gear or annulus.|$|E
25|$|An {{epicyclic}} differential can use {{epicyclic gearing}} to split and apportion torque asymmetrically between {{the front and}} rear axles. An epicyclic differential {{is at the heart of}} the Toyota Prius automotive drive train, where it interconnects the engine, motor-generators, and the drive wheels (which have a second differential for splitting torque as usual). It has the advantage of being relatively compact along the length of its axis (that is, the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> shaft).|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Input torque {{is applied}} to the ring gear (blue), which turns the entire carrier (blue). The carrier is {{connected}} to both <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> (red and yellow) only through the planet gear (green). Torque is transmitted to the <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> through the planet gear. The planet gear revolves around the axis of the carrier, driving the <b>sun</b> <b>gears.</b> If the resistance at both wheels is equal, the planet gear revolves without spinning about its own axis, and both wheels turn at the same rate.|$|R
50|$|The {{photos on}} the right show the planet carrier from a Ford FMX {{automatic}} transmission. The planet carrier is {{the central part of}} a planetary gear set. Not shown are the two <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> called primary and secondary, that rotate within the carrier. Also not shown is a ring gear, also called an annulus, having internal teeth fitting around the carrier. Input power is applied to one or both <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> and output power is taken from the ring gear, which turns the drive shaft.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>gear</b> is {{operated}} from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> b1) {{and in turn}} drives {{the rest of the}} gear sets. The <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, [...] "true sun" [...] pointer that displayed the sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed {{solely on the basis of}} the gear ratios of the gears named.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term annular gear is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. [...] The second <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> serves the same purpose as the annular gear of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of an annular gear.|$|E

5000|$|The double {{planetary}} gear system incorporates an input <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> connected to the driver’s steering wheel, two {{planetary gear}}s, an output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> connected to the steering pinion, and a rotating housing. If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from the input <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> thought the planetary gears (sharing a common lay shaft) to the output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the planetary gear housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained. This characteristic provides a means of steering the vehicle {{in the event of}} an active steering system failure.|$|E
50|$|In one arrangement, the {{planetary}} carrier (green) is held stationary, and the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow) {{is used as}} input. In this case, {{the planetary}} gears simply rotate about their own axes (i.e., spin) at a rate determined {{by the number of}} teeth in each gear. If the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> has Ns teeth, and each planet gear has Np teeth, then the ratio is equal to −N/N. For instance, if the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> has 24 teeth, and each planet has 16 teeth, then the ratio is −24/16, or −3/2; this means that one clockwise turn of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> produces 1.5 counterclockwise turns of each of the planet gear(s) about its axis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} of epicycle gear trains with a planet engaging both a <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and {{a ring gear}} is called a planetary gear train. [...] In this case, the ring gear is usually fixed and the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is driven.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} control system consists of a valve arrangement and an engine driven pump. The automatic transmission contains a planetary gear set consisting of two <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> two sets of three planet pinions contained within a planetary carrier and ring gear. Various speed ratios are obtained by holding or clutching various combinations of elements of the planetary train. This is performed by two bands, two multi-disc clutches and a one-way clutch.|$|R

25|$|The {{rotation}} of the ring gear is always {{the average of the}} rotations of the side <b>sun</b> <b>gears.</b> This is why if the driven roadwheels are lifted clear of the ground with the engine off, and the drive shaft is held (say, leaving the transmission in gear preventing the ring gear from turning inside the differential), manually rotating one driven roadwheel causes the opposite roadwheel to rotate in the opposite direction by the same amount.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} axle {{of the planet}} gear {{is tied to the}} axle of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> by a link that freely rotates around the axis of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and keeps the planet gear engaged with the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> but does not {{contribute}} to the drive torque. This link appears, at first sight, to be similar to a crank but the drive is not transmitted through it. Thus, it did not contravene the crank patent.|$|E
50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train {{consists of two}} gears mounted so that the center of one gear revolves around {{the center of the}} other. A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one gear, called the planet gear, around the other, called the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> The planet and sun gears mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: This {{planetary}} gear train consists of a <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow), planet gears (blue) supported by the carrier (green) and a ring gear (pink). The red marks show {{the relative displacement of}} the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and carrier, when the carrier is rotated 45° clockwise and the ring gear is held fixed.|$|E
50|$|In general, a Ravigneaux can be {{configured}} {{with each}} of the three gears in the set having a different number of teeth, but in the Ford FMX, all three have 18 teeth. Multiple planets, turning in the opposite direction and meshing with different <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> gives the Ravigneaux the ability to provide multiple speeds and reverse, with just one set of planetary gears. The FMX in the photo has three forward speeds, and reverse.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotation}} of the ring gear is always {{the average of the}} rotations of the side <b>sun</b> <b>gears.</b> This is why if the driven roadwheels are lifted clear of the ground with the engine off, and the drive shaft is held (say, leaving the transmission in gear preventing the ring gear from turning inside the differential), manually rotating one driven roadwheel causes the opposite roadwheel to rotate in the opposite direction by the same amount.|$|R
50|$|The Ravigneaux {{improves}} upon earlier planetary automobile transmissions, {{such as the}} Simpson, {{which has}} two complete planetary gearsets. As originally invented, the Ravigneaux puts two planetary gear trains on a single planet carrier. It has two <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> two ring gears, and two sets of planet gears on a single carrier. Using a single carrier makes the Ravigneaux smaller, lighter, and less expensive to make, because the carrier is usually {{the largest and most}} expensive part of a planetary gearset.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In this example, {{the carrier}} (green) is held {{stationary}} while the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow) {{is used as}} input. The planet gears (blue) turn in a ratio determined {{by the number of}} teeth in each gear. Here, the ratio is −24/16, or −3/2; each planet gear turns at 3/2 the rate of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear housing features external gear teeth {{and can be}} rotated by a motor and worm gear. Alteration of the housing position allows rotation of the output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> independently of the input <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> position. I.e. if the driver were to hold the steering wheel (and therefore the input <b>sun</b> <b>gear)</b> stationary, driving the {{planetary gear}} housing {{will result in the}} rotation of the steering pinion (and therefore a steering action at the front wheels). By manipulating the position of the planetary gear housing, the active steering ECU can synthesize a variable steering ratio or generate steering actions independently of the driver.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a twin-disc {{test rig}} for the {{assessment}} of the contact fatigue performances of gear materials is presented. Tests were performed on 17 NiCrMo 6 - 4 discs with two different slide-to-roll ratios. The specimen were designed to recreate the meshing conditions between <b>sun</b> and planet <b>gears</b> of the planetary gear set located in the wheel hub of off-highway vehicles. <b>Sun</b> <b>gears</b> indeed, are particularly prone to manifest pitting damages because of the high frequency of contacts due to the meshing with three or four planets, and because of the small teeth dimensions which results in high contact pressures even with moderate applied loads. The damaging mode observed in disc specimens is then compared with the actual failure mode of gears...|$|R
50|$|Most hub gears are {{operated}} {{in a similar}} manner, with a single twist, trigger or thumb-shifter. An exception is the older style of Sturmey-Archer 5-speed, which used a second shift cable to change between close and wide-range <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> effectively giving two 3-speed hubs in one unit. The middle gear in both ranges was direct drive, so there were five distinct gears. They could either be controlled with a special 5-speed shifter which operated both cables, or with a regular 3-speed shifter and a friction shifter.|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{transmission}} {{families are}} usually based on Ravigneaux, Lepelletier, or Simpson planetary gearsets. Each uses some arrangement {{of one or}} two central <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> and a ring gear, with differing arrangements of planet gears that surround the sun and mesh with the ring. An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses sliding gears on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any planetary gearsets. Although the Honda is quite different from all other automatics, it is also quite different from an automated manual transmission (AMT).|$|R

50|$|Epicyclic gearing is also {{available}} which consists of a sun, a carrier, and two planets which mesh with each other. One planet meshes with the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> while the second planet meshes with the ring gear. For this case, when the carrier is fixed, the ring gear rotates {{in the same direction}} as the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> thus providing a reversal in direction compared to standard epicyclic gearing.|$|E

25|$|Thus, for example, {{if the car}} {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main ring gear may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the left wheel will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel. The <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> (which drive the axle half-shafts) will rotate at different speeds relative to the ring gear (one faster, one slower) by, say, 2 full turns each (4 full turns relative to each other), resulting in the left wheel making 12 rotations, and the right wheel making 8 rotations.|$|R
