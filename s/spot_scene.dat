40|$|Abstract. A quality index, {{based on}} cloud {{contamination}} within the image, {{is assigned to}} each <b>SPOT</b> <b>scene.</b> In this study, the information content, of such a quality index, in terms of cloud cover, was tested by comparing it with coincident meteorological surface observation. Global observations during the period June–October 1995 were analysed, starting with {{the investigation of the}} spatial and temporal variability of cloud covers from both kinds of observations. Comparisons for a series of ‘dependent ’ datasets generated by varying the time (from 0. 5 to 1. 5 h) and space (from 5 to 100 km) matching criteria were performed successively. Results were reported as 5 Ö 9 cloud-class contingency tables and relevant statistics evaluating the correlation between the two observations. The analyses showed an overall good agreement between the two cloud-cover estima-tions, the correlation was slightly lower (10 %) than that obtained by comparin...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of forming a pre-attentive {{mechanism}} {{that can be used to}} analyse surveillance sequences. We address the problem of <b>spotting</b> <b>scene</b> change by performing temporal segmentation on long video sequences with little colour information and observed content. This is typical in surveillance sequences. Our approach: (1) employs sustained temporal change computed for local neighbourhoods in the image frames; (2) defines a frame activity similarity metric that accounts for local spatial and temporal displacement of change; and (3) monitors the similarity over a wide period to detect changes in emphasis that are then identified as scene breaks. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} format of the "SPOT scene" digital products which are produced and distributed by SPOT IMAGE. This format is also called the "CAP format", since it has been designed to be produced by the Centre d’Archivage et de Prétraitement (CAP) located at SPOT IMAGE premices, in Toulouse. This format concerns the <b>SPOT</b> <b>scenes</b> which are processed at level 1 A, 1 B or 2 A. For other digital products (level 2 B, Ortho-images, Imagemaps like SPOTViewÒ), the format is the GIS-Geospot format (or “DIMAP”format) which is outside the scope of this document. This format is capable of handling the additionnal Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) band of SPOT 4.

40|$|Fulltext link (The 17 th Congress, Commission 7) : [URL] paper {{presents}} {{some preliminary}} {{results from a}} series of investigations into the use of texture analysis in urban image understanding. High spatial resolution satellite imagery of urban areas contains much information that is not adequately exploited using per-pixel classification techniques. The principal hypothesis addressed is that detailed spatial features may be recognised by the analysis of urban morphological texture. Results from two analyses are reported. First, co-occurrence matrix measures of homogeneity are used on a <b>Spot</b> Panchromatic <b>scene</b> of Harare, Zimbabwe, to predict housing densities stored in a co-registered database. Second a Fourier domain statistic is developed to measure residential block density and is tested on a <b>Spot</b> panchromatic <b>scene</b> of Cardiff, Wales. The statistic is used to predict urban population counts stored in a co-registered population surface. The results demonstrate that useful morphological information can be extracted from Spot panchromatic images using such methods.

40|$|Plague is a {{zoonotic}} {{infectious disease}} present in great gerbil populations in Kazakhstan. Infectious disease dynamics {{are influenced by}} the spatial distribution of the carriers (hosts) of the disease. The great gerbil, the main host in our study area, lives in burrows, which can be recognized on high resolution satellite imagery. In this study, using earth observation data at various spatial scales, we map the spatial distribution of burrows in a semi-desert landscape. The study area consists of various landscape types. To evaluate whether identification of burrows by classification is possible in these landscape types, the study area was subdivided into eight landscape units, on the basis of Landsat 7 ETM+ derived Tasselled Cap Greenness and Brightness, and SRTM derived standard deviation in elevation. In the field, 904 burrows were mapped. Using two segmented 2. 5 m resolution SPOT- 5 XS satellite scenes, reference object sets were created. Random Forests were built for both <b>SPOT</b> <b>scenes</b> and used to classify the images. Additionally, a stratified classification was carried out, by building separate Random Forests per landscape unit. Burrows were successfully classified in all landscape units. In the ‘steppe on floodplain’ areas, classification worked best: producer's and user's accuracy in those areas reached 88...|$|R
40|$|The ADAM project (Assimilation of Spatial Data within Agriculture Models) was {{aiming at}} the {{development}} and evaluation of methods capable of exploiting high revisit frequency and high spatial satellite observations. The intensive experimental campaign conducted in 2000 – 2001 over wheat crops yielded a unique database where frequent satellite observations at high spatial resolution in the solar and microwave domains were made concur-rently to ground characterization of the soil and the can-opy and their functioning. This includes 39 SPOT im-ages, 15 Radar (ERS and RadarSat) images, soil perma-nent characteriz ation, frequent canopy leaf area index, biomass, soil water and nitrogen contents, as measured over 42 elementary sampling units (ESU). This intensive campaign will be followed in 2002 and 2003 by lighter campaigns where a reduced number of ESUs will be sampled, and a reduced number of <b>SPOT</b> <b>scenes</b> will be acquired. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present the ADAM experiment and the database generated, along with few examples illustrating its potentials.

40|$|This study investigates change {{detection}} in {{the vegetation}} {{cover of a}} closed gold mine to assess whether the rehabilitated vegetation responds {{in a similar manner}} to the surrounding environment. Rehabilitation took place in seven rehabilitation areas within the mine site. <b>SPOT</b> <b>scenes</b> covering the site were acquired at six time periods from September 2004 to September 2005, and annually in the dry season from 2004 to 2010, except for 2008. Normalized difference vegetation index, soil-adjusted vegetation index and transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index were tested to estimate the percentage vegetation cover (PVC) using a linear regression model. The results showed higher PVC during wet season and lower PVC during the dry season in the native vegetation surrounding the mine site. However, temporal and spatial patterns of PVC in rehabilitated and native areas were similar only in the TD 40 ha rehabilitation area, one of the seven rehabilitation areas. This area was the first to be rehabilitated and had the most intensive rehabilitation effort using tube stock planting in March 1998. The seasonal variability showed a high correlation with an r value of 0. 77 in TD 40 ha rehabilitation area in tailings dam, which was similar to the native area with an r value of 0. 82.

40|$|Urban {{areas in}} sub-Saharan Africa are growing at an {{unprecedented}} pace. Much of this growth {{is taking place}} in informal settlements. In South Africa more than 10 % of the population live in urban informal settlements. South Africa has established a National Informal Settlement Development Programme (NUSP) to respond to these challenges. This programme is designed to support the National Department of Human Settlement (NDHS) in its implementation of the Upgrading Informal Settlements Programme (UISP) with the objective of eventually upgrading all informal settlements in the country. Currently, the NDHS does not have access to an updated national dataset captured at the same scale using source data {{that can be used to}} understand the status of informal settlements in the country. This pilot study is developing a fully automated workflow for the wall-to-wall processing of SPOT- 5 satellite imagery of South Africa. The workflow includes an automatic image information extraction based on multiscale textural and morphological image features extraction. The advanced image feature compression and optimization together with innovative learning and classification techniques allow a processing of the SPOT- 5 images using the Landsat-based National Land Cover (NLC) of South Africa from the year 2000 as low-resolution thematic reference layers as. The workflow was tested on 42 <b>SPOT</b> <b>scenes</b> based on a stratified sampling.
