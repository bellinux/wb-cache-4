40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{two related}} structures on finite sets, namely <b>separating</b> systems and covering <b>separating</b> systems. These systems are considered {{from the point}} of view of combinatorial designs. <b>Separating</b> systems have been considered by previous authors but this is the first time that covering <b>separating</b> systems have been studied in detail. A <b>separating</b> system on [n] = { 1, [...] ., n} is a collection of subsets of [n], in which for each pair of elements of [n), there exists a set in the collection which contains the first element but not the second or vice versa. A covering <b>separating</b> system on [n] is a <b>separating</b> system on [n] in which each element of [n] occurs at least once. A covering <b>separating</b> system on [n] in which each set has cardinality k is called a (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> system. The size of a (covering) <b>separating</b> system is the number of sets in the collection. The volume of at (covering) <b>separating</b> system is the sum of the cardinalities of the sets in the collection. A minimal (covering) <b>separating</b> system on [n) is one which contains the least possible number of sets. The size of a minimal <b>separating</b> system has been determined for all n by Renyi. The size of minimal covering <b>separating</b> systems on [n] and bounds or exact values on the size of a minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> system is determined here for all n and k. Various results are derived on the volume of minimal <b>separating</b> systems and minimal covering <b>separating</b> systems on [n], and on the volume of minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> systems. A catalogue of all non-isomorphic minimal <b>separating</b> systems for n ≤ 8 and all non-isomorphic minimal covering <b>separating</b> systems for n ≤ 7 is given. Some conjectures concerning minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> systems are made. The thesis concludes with a brief mention of the connection between covering <b>separating</b> systems and finite topologies. This provides one possible avenue for applications of the theory of covering <b>separating</b> systems...|$|R

5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum <b>separated</b> very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species <b>separated</b> later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a <b>separated</b> species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E
