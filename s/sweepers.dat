5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow <b>sweepers</b> are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow <b>sweepers</b> do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow <b>sweepers</b> the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow <b>sweepers</b> cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E

Christians in the district, and {{elsewhere}} in Pakistan, usually have lower class occupations such as being cleaners and <b>sweepers.</b> Noreen, who is a Roman Catholic, worked as a farmhand in Sheikhupura to support her family. She married Ashiq Masih, a brick laborer who had three children from a previous marriage, and had two more children with him. Noreen and her family were the only Christians in the village. Before her incarceration, she had been repeatedly urged by her fellow workers to convert to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} about France {{rose in the}} 1880s and an electrically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. Additional contact mines were added, forcing incoming vessels to sail into a channel alongside St Mawes, illuminated with electric search lights. As part of this transformation, the castle's 64-pounder guns were partially replaced with light, quick-firing guns in the 1890s, able to engage any torpedo boats or mine <b>sweepers</b> attempting {{to break through the}} defences. The batteries for these were found to be poorly sited, and an additional battery was therefore built above the Henrician castle between 1900 and 1901, again for housing quick-firing guns.|$|E

40|$|The massive coral Goniopora tenuidens {{can develop}} {{elongated}} <b>sweeper</b> polyps. These {{are thought to}} be involved in aggressive interactions with neighbouring benthic organ isms, like the <b>sweeper</b> tentacles of other corals. The cnidoms of <b>sweeper</b> polyps and ordinary polyps of G. tenuidens from the Great Barrier Reef were compared. <b>Sweeper</b> polyps had significantly greater densities of elongate holotrichous isorhizas (34577 +/- 3839 /mg; mean +/- SD, n = 6) than ordinary polyps (936 +/- 371 /mg; p < 0. 05), while ordinary polyps had significantly greater densities of spirocysts (75994 +/- 15992 /mg) than <b>sweeper</b> polyps (19469 +/- 7808 /mg; p < 0. 05). This suggests that <b>sweeper</b> polyps of G. tenuidens, like the <b>sweeper</b> tentacles of other corals, are modified for aggression, and that they probably act through nematocyst discharge. However, the scattered distribution of <b>sweeper</b> polyps observed on colonies of G. tenuidens in the field suggests that <b>sweeper</b> polyps may have other functions...|$|R

40|$|The {{vulnerabilities}} which plague computers cause endless grief to users. Slammer compromised {{millions of}} hosts in minutes; a hit-list worm would take under a second. Recently proposed techniques respond better than manual approaches, but require expensive instrumentation, limiting deployment. Although spreading “antibodies” (e. g. signatures) ameliorates this limitation, hosts dependant on antibodies are defenseless until inoculation; to the fastest hit-list worms this delay is crucial. Additionally, most recently proposed techniques cannot provide recovery to provide continuous service after an attack. We propose a solution, called <b>Sweeper,</b> that provides both fast and accurate post-attack analysis and efficient recovery with low normal execution overhead. <b>Sweeper</b> combines several techniques. (1) <b>Sweeper</b> uses lightweight monitoring techniques {{to detect a}} wide array of suspicious requests, providing a first level of defense. (2) By leveraging lightweight checkpointing, <b>Sweeper</b> postpones heavyweight monitoring until absolutely necessary — after an attack is detected. <b>Sweeper</b> rolls back and re-executes repeatedly to dynamically apply heavy-weight analysis via dynamic binary instrumentation.

25|$|The Victorian era in {{particular}} became notorious for {{the conditions under}} which children were employed. Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous, often fatal, working conditions. In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults. Children also worked as errand boys, crossing <b>sweepers,</b> shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80-hour weeks.|$|E
25|$|Historically, PAHs contributed {{substantially}} to {{our understanding}} of adverse health effects from exposures to environmental contaminants, including chemical carcinogenesis. In 1775, Percivall Pott, a surgeon at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, observed that scrotal cancer was unusually common in chimney <b>sweepers</b> and proposed the cause as occupational exposure to soot. A century later, Richard von Volkmann reported increased skin cancers in workers of the coal tar industry of Germany, and by the early 1900s increased rates of cancer from exposure to soot and coal tar was widely accepted. In 1915, Yamigawa and Ichicawa were the first to experimentally produce cancers, specifically of the skin, by topically applying coal tar to rabbit ears.|$|E
25|$|The {{weakness}} of the man-to-man defence is depth when fresh attackers move up. The man-to-man defence also allows defenders to be drawn out of position, opening gaps for other attackers in vulnerable areas. This was Italy's fatal weakness in the 1970 Final, according to some analysts. To overcome this problem with depth, the man to man defence may use a 'sweeper', who is a central defender and has a free role, i.e. has not been assigned a player to mark. He sometimes takes up a position slightly behind the other defenders, as his defensive role often is to 'sweep up' any attacks that break through the defence and as such he adds valuable depth to the defensive unit. Usually the sweeper will be the controller of the defence. They will determine where the back line should be at any given time. Zone defence {{does not require a}} sweeper role, and as many teams have changed their tactics to this, <b>sweepers</b> are today rare.|$|E
