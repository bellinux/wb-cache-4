40|$|Abstract — Design specifications, {{prototype}} application description, usage instructions, {{and guiding}} principles {{of a cell}} phone application used to implement an additional layer of security for SMS messages. Current vulnerabilities of messages sent over the GSM network stem from <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> capable of retrieving stored and deleted SMS messages, and also from invisible software that can be installed on some cellular phones. To address these vulnerabilities, an application handles message security, and avoids plaintext being stored on the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> or in the phone memory for long periods. Instead, plaintext is held in temporary application-level memory. The key used for message transmission is established using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange, where a shared key between two parties is used for authentication and encrypting the exchange of Diffie-Hellman keys. The time and power required to generate the public keys may be a limiting factor in usability. Appropriate usage scenarios are described for the application, and includes details of how users can use the program. Some problems {{are associated with the}} application's design and implementation, and future work will address many of these issues. Index Terms—Cell phone security, SMS messages...|$|R
40|$|As mobile devices grow in {{popularity}} and ubiquity in everyday life, {{they are often}} involved in digital crimes and digital investigation as well. Cell phones, for instance, are becoming a media or tool in criminal cases and corporate investigation. Cellular phone forensics is therefore important for law enforcement and private investigators. Cell phone forensics aims at acquiring and analyzing data in the cellular phone, {{which is similar to}} computer forensics. However, the forensic tools for cell phones are quite different from those for personal computers. One of the challenges is in this area is the lack of a validation procedure for forensic tools, in order to determine their effectiveness. This paper presents our preliminary research in creating a baseline for testing forensic tools. This research was accomplished by populating test data onto a cell phone (either manually or with an Identity Module Programmer) and then various tools effectiveness will be determined by the percentage of that test data retrieved. This study will shed light and inspire on further research in this field. This research could be expanded further in several ways: First, while we were using a locked T-Mobile standard <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> thus the amount of change that can be done is limited, a test <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> or a Smart card which is unlocked will provide for a greater range of area for data to be written. Second, a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> writer or a identity module programmer for direct writing onto a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> would also allow for population for a greater range of element files. Third, open source <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> writers or identity module programmers and <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> would be more ideal for reading/obtaining data and writing data so researchers have the ability to look at as well as modify code. 1...|$|R

50|$|If the USB drive has no {{protection}} switch, a blocker {{can be used}} to mount the drive in a read-only mode or, in an exceptional case, the memory chip can be desoldered.

The <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is soundly analyzed, such {{that it is possible to}} recover (deleted) data like contacts or text messages.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{identity}} is a development of online authentication and digital signatures, where the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> of one’s mobile phone {{works as an}} identity tool. Mobile identity enables legally binding authentication and transaction signing for online banking, payment confirmation, corporate services, and consuming online content. The user's certificates are maintained on the telecom operator's <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> {{and in order to}} use them, the user has to enter a personal, secret PIN code. When using mobile identity, no separate <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> is needed, as the phone itself already performs both functions.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to other approaches, the mobile phone {{in conjunction with}} a mobile signature-enabled <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> aims to offer the same security and ease of use as for example smart cards in existing digital identity management systems. Smart card-based digital identities can only be used {{in conjunction with a}} <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and a PC. In addition, distributing and managing the cards can be logistically difficult, exacerbated by the lack of interoperability between services relying on such a digital identity.|$|R
50|$|CCID (chip card {{interface}} device) protocol is a USB protocol {{that allows}} a smartcard {{to be connected to}} a computer via a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> using a standard USB interface, without the need for each manufacturer of smartcards to provide its own reader or protocol. This allows the smartcard {{to be used as a}} security token for authentication and data encryption, such as that used in Bitlocker. Chip card interface devices come in a variety of forms. The smallest CCID form is a standard USB dongle and may contain a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> or Secure Digital card inside the USB dongle. Another popular device is a USB smart <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> keyboard, which in addition to being a standard PC USB keyboard, has an additional slot for accepting a smartcard.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{diffusion}} of cellular phones and WLANs, using mobile phones as authentication devices to allow a mobile terminal (laptop, PDA or PC) to log into a WLAN network would be an easy and secure means for final users. Wireless Service Providers are proposing solutions that exploit GSM Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) for network authentication, but the proposed solutions require buying ad-hoc <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> and separate smart <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> {{without being able to}} exploit mobile phones. In this paper we provide a way to override the requirement of additonal SIM and hardware by defining a mechanism and a corresponding interface so that a mobile terminal can use a mobile phone and its stored SIM credentials to get authenticated into an Open Access Network layered on top of a WLAN. The solution proposed in this paper exploits the EAP-SIM [5] authentication protocol that provides the authentication steps and defines the information needed to authenticate a client by the credentials retrieved from a <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is {{designed}} {{not to allow}} the Ki to be obtained using the smart-card interface. Instead, the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> provides a function, Run GSM Algorithm, that allows the phone to pass data to the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> to be signed with the Ki. This, by design, makes usage of the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> mandatory unless the Ki can be extracted from the <b>SIM</b> <b>card,</b> or the carrier is willing to reveal the Ki. In practice, the GSM cryptographic algorithm for computing SRES_2 (see step 4, below) from the Ki has certain vulnerabilities that can allow the extraction of the Ki from a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> {{and the making of}} a duplicate <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Population {{movements}} following disasters {{can cause}} important increases in morbidity and mortality. Without {{knowledge of the}} locations of affected people, relief assistance is compromised. No rapid and accurate method exists to track population movements after disasters. We used position data of subscriber identity module (<b>SIM)</b> <b>cards</b> from the largest mobile phone company in Haiti (Digicel) to estimate the magnitude and trends of population movements following the Haiti 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak. Methods and Findings: Geographic positions of <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> were determined by {{the location of the}} mobile phone tower through which each <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> connects when calling. We followed daily positions of <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> 42 days before the earthquake and 158 days after. To exclude inactivated <b>SIM</b> <b>cards,</b> we included only the 1. 9 million <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> that made at least one call both pre-earthquake and during the last month of study. In Port-au-Prince there were 3. 2 persons per included <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b> We used this ratio to extrapolate from the number of moving <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> to the number of moving persons. Cholera outbreak analyses covered 8 days and tracked 138, 560 <b>SIM</b> <b>cards.</b> An estimated 630, 000 persons (197, 484 Digicel <b>SIM</b> <b>cards),</b> present in Port-au-Prince {{on the day of the}} earthquake, had left 19 days post-earthquake.
