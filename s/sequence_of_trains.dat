Using the sequences obtained and removing the collisions incurred, train scheduling is determined. Numerical examples in small and medium sizes are solved using ACS-TS and compared to exact optimum solutions to check for quality and accuracy.

40|$|We {{consider}} a workforce scheduling problem {{which consists of}} determining optimal working shifts for cleaning personnel at a rail station. Trains arrive and depart according to a specified schedule and require a given amount of cleaning time from the personnel before their departure from the station. Working shifts must specify a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> to be cleaned by a worker together with corresponding cleaning times and are subject to contract regulations which impose both a minimum and a maximum duration of the shift. We model the problem as a mixed-integer program with a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and propose an exponentially sized reformulation obtained through Dantzig–Wolfe reformulation. The reformulation is strengthened by valid inequalities and used to compute lower bounds on the optimal cost. A heuristic algorithm based on column generation and variable fixing is then proposed and computationally evaluated on both a set of instances derived from real data and a larger set of randomly generated ones.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{planning}} procedure for serving freight transportation requests in a railway network with fast transfer equipment at terminals. We consider a transportation system where different customers make their requests (orders) for moving boxes, i. e., either containers or swap bodies, between different origins and destinations, with specific requirements on delivery times. The decisions to be taken concern the route (and the corresponding <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains)</b> that each box follows in the network and the assignment of boxes to train wagons, taking into account that boxes can change more than one train and that train timetables are fixed. The planning procedure includes a pre-analysis step to determine all the possible sequences of trains for serving each order, followed by the solution of a 0 - 1 linear programming problem to find the optimal assignment of each box to a train sequence and to a specific wagon for each train in the sequence. This latter is a generalized assignment problem which is NP-hard. Hence, in order to find good solutions in acceptable computation times, two MIP heuristic approaches are proposed and tested through an experimental analysis considering realistic problem instances.

40|$|Given a {{schedule}} of trains, the locomotive planning (or scheduling) problem (LPP) {{is to determine the}} minimum cost assignment of locomotive types to trains that satisfies a number of business and operational constraints. Once this is done, the railroad has to determine the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> to which each locomotive is assigned by unit number {{so that it can be}} fueled and serviced as necessary. We refer to this problem as the locomotive routing problem (LRP). The LRP is a very large scale combinatorial optimization problem, and the general version that we consider has previously been unstudied and unsolved in the research literature. In this paper, we develop robust optimization methods to solve the LRP. There are two major constraints that need to be satisfied by each locomotive route: (1) locomotive fueling constraints, which require that every unit visits a fueling station at least once for every F miles of travel, and (2) locomotive servicing constraints, which require that every unit visits a service station at least once for every S miles of travel. The output of the LPP is not directly implementable because the LPP does not consider these fueling and servicing constraints. The LRP considers these constraints and its output is therefore implementable. We model the LRP by considering alternative fueling and servicing-friendly train paths (or strings) between servicing stations on the network. We formulate the LRP as a...|$|E

40|$|While {{developing}} into {{modern and}} efficient organisations, railway companies {{are subject to}} market principles. Railway operation must be safe and on time, but must also be conducted efficiently and economically. Among the various aspects of operational control of railways, 'on-the-spot' (i. e. very short-term) train-path management plays an especially important role. In this process the 'path managers' decide about the sequence of the trains running on a network or parts of it. This is to be distinguished from the dispatchers, whose authorities are restricted to their respective signal box areas, and the timetable managers, {{who are responsible for}} long-term scheduling. In case of significant delays, a train-path manager may advise a dispatcher (who remains responsible for the safe dispatching of trains) to alter the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> with the aim of improving punctuality and efficiency. However, the quality of this conflict solution hinges {{on the quality of the}} data input from trains and infrastructure and on the quality of the 'on-the-spot' decision making required. Improving both has been the aim of this paper. The unique idea of this paper is to use the well-tried techniques of computer-aided timetable construction (long-term path management) for the automatic generation of 'on-the-spot' timetables supporting the decisions of train-path managers. The accurate modelling of the infrastructure and the exact calculation of occupation times have long been available in (long-term) scheduling and can be used for the exact calculation of timetables 'on-the-spot', as long-term scheduling and short-term train-path management are virtually the same processes but for different time corridors. The ASDIS program generates those 'on-the-spot' timetables automatically and gives the train-path managers the choice of either implementing them directly or devising a human-made modified solution. The timetables are free of conflicts between trains, as are their long-term counterparts, but are derived directly from the current state of operation. All subsequent changes of the state of operation lead to an update of the 'on-the-spot' timetable. The running time calculation takes into account the fact that delayed trains can make up some of their lost time by using slack built in the scheduled running time, so that an exact forecast of the actual schedule of the trains will be made. Even conflicts between trains that are bound to develop in the future can be recognised and solved early because the program applies the technique of asynchronous simulation, whereby train paths are not calculated on a strict sequential basis, but in the order given by the train hierarchies. This enables the program to be used for the 'on-the-spot' scheduling of trains in wider areas. Thus the automatic 'on-the-spot' scheduling of trains made possible by the ASDIS program contributes to an improvement of productivity, quality and flexibility in railway operation and supports its rationalisation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) {{has been}} showing to {{outperform}} other ensemble learning approaches in off-line mode. A key {{point to the}} success of NCL is that the learning of an ensemble member is influenced by the learning of the others, directly encouraging diversity. However, when applied to on-line learning, NCL presents the problem that part of the diversity has to be built apriori, as the same <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data is sent to all the ensemble members. In this way, the choice of the base models to be used is limited and the use of more adequate neural network models for the problem to be solved may be not possible. This paper proposes a new method to perform on-line learning based on NCL and On-line Bagging. The method directly encourages diversity, as NCL, but sends a different <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data to each one of the base models in an on-line bagging way. So, it allows the use of deterministic base models such as Evolving Fuzzy Neural Networks (EFuNNs), which are specifically designed to perform on-line learning. Experiments show that on-line bagging NCL using EFuNNs have better accuracy than NCL applied to online learning using on-line Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in 4 out of 5 classification databases. Besides, on-line bagging NCL using EFuNNs manage to attain similar accuracy to NCL using off-line MLPs. I...|$|R
