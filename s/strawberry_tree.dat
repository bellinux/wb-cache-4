5|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{is found}} in Africa (Tunisia), Australia, Asia (including the eastern Himalayas of India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, China, the Far East of Russia, and Turkey) and Europe (including the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Spain). It is also present in Mexico and in Guatemala. Widely distributed in North America, it is most common in the southeast and along the Pacific Coast. The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa, limited in distribution to Lewis County, Washington, associates with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Variety compactospora is known from Sardinia, Italy, {{where it has been}} found growing in sandy soil in forests comprising <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Arbutus unedo), tree heath (Erica arborea), and holm oak (Quercus ilex).|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Arbutus unedo) is {{relatively}} {{common in the}} park, {{it is one of}} Ireland's rarest native tree species and is found in very few locations outside Killarney. In the park it is found on cliff tops and the edges of the woodlands around the lake.|$|E
25|$|The North Atlantic Current, {{part of the}} Gulf Stream, flows north past Kerry and {{the west}} coast of Ireland, {{resulting}} in milder temperatures than would otherwise be expected at the 52 North latitude. This means that subtropical plants such as the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> and tree ferns, not normally found in northern Europe, thrive in the area.|$|E
50|$|Understory is also rich, {{featuring}} common hawthorn, blackthorn, wild apple, pear and <b>strawberry</b> <b>trees,</b> erica, Ruscus aculeatus {{and numerous}} others.|$|R

25|$|Aegean and Western Turkey {{sclerophyllous}} {{and mixed}} forests: These Mediterranean-climate forests occupy the coastal lowlands and valleys of western Anatolia bordering the Aegean Sea. The ecoregion has forests of Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), oak forests and woodlands, and maquis shrubland of Turkish pine and evergreen sclerophyllous trees and shrubs, including Olive (Olea europaea), <b>Strawberry</b> <b>Tree</b> (Arbutus unedo), Arbutus andrachne, Kermes Oak (Quercus coccifera), and Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis).|$|E
25|$|Symbols of Hermes {{were the}} palm tree, turtle, rooster, goat, the number four, {{several kinds of}} fish and incense. Sacrifices {{involved}} honey, cakes, pigs, goats, and lambs. In the sanctuary of Hermes Promakhos in Tanagra is a <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> under which it was believed he had created, and in the hills Phene ran three sources that were sacred to him, because he believed {{that they had been}} bathed at birth.|$|E
25|$|The area {{in front}} of the fort is {{characterized}} by low bush or garrigue and by vegetation that can withstand drought as a result of low nutritional requirements. Plants include <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree,</b> coronilla, euphorbia, heathers, gorse and myrtle. In the winter, the anemone, asphodel, brassica, honeysuckle, crocus, and rock rose bloom. Near the castle, there are some Aleppo pines. Indeed, in 1901, Munthe planted a pine forest, part of which was lost during the fires of 1972 and 1987.|$|E

50|$|It is {{characterized}} by a significant mass of pine trees and Mediterranean maquis. In addition, there are oaks, <b>strawberry</b> <b>trees,</b> roses, wild gladiola, and flowering shrubs. There are lizards, butterflies and insects.|$|R
25|$|The oak {{woodlands}} {{typically have}} an understory of holly (Ilex aquifolium). <b>Strawberry</b> <b>trees</b> (Arbutus unedo) are a notable {{part of these}} woods. There are also scattered yews. The field layer includes bilberry and woodrush. The herb layer is not rich in species.|$|R
500|$|The Garden {{was first}} {{documented}} in 1517, {{one year after}} the artist's death, when Antonio de Beatis, a canon from Molfetta, Italy, described the work as part of the decoration in the town palace of the Counts of the House of Nassau in Brussels. The palace was a high-profile location, a house often visited by heads of state and leading court figures. The prominence of the painting has led some to conclude that the work was commissioned, and not [...] "solely... a flight of the imagination". A description of the triptych in 1605 called it the [...] "strawberry painting", because the fruit of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> (madroño in Spanish) features prominently in the center panel. Early Spanish writers referred to the work as La Lujuria ("Lust").|$|E
500|$|In Paradisi in Sole Parkinson {{hinted that}} he hoped to add a fourth section, a garden of simples (medicinal herbs). He {{delivered}} the promise in his other great book, the monumental Theatrum Botanicum (The Botanical Theatre or Theatre of Plants) which he published in 1640 {{at the age of}} 73 years. The release of this work was delayed due to the popularity of Thomas Johnson's edition of John Gerard's book The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes (1597). Theatrum Botanicum, with 1,688 pages of text, describes over 3,800 plants and was the most complete and beautifully presented English treatise on plants of its day. It was the first work to describe 33 native plants, 13 of which grew near Parkinson's Middlesex home. Some of these plants, such as the Welsh poppy, the <b>Strawberry</b> <b>Tree</b> and the Lady's Slipper, were very common but had gone unnoticed or at least unrecorded. He intended the book to be a reliable guide for apothecaries, and it remained so for {{more than a hundred years}} after his death. Parkinson presented the work to Charles I, who conferred on him the title [...] "Botanicus Regis Primarius" [...] ("Royal Botanist of the First Rank") though this came without a salary.|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} Monte Solaro is {{inhabited}} by over 900 species of vegetation.At higher altitudes, one might find acanthus, arbutus, heather, juniper, broom, ilex, lentisk, litosperma, myrtle and smilace. At lower altitudes, one might find laurels, rock-roses, <b>strawberry</b> <b>trees,</b> Daphne shrubs, Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic), myrtles, narcissus, orchids, and pines and the Lithodora Rosmarinifolia.|$|R
50|$|The {{trees in}} this area are {{primarily}} dominated by holly oak (Quercus ilex), Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), <b>strawberry</b> <b>trees</b> (Arbutus unedo), buckthorn and olive trees, all of which are resistant to the precipitation extremes of the climate. There are also areas of savannah, strips of land bounded by walls of loose stone.|$|R
2500|$|According to legend, Madrid {{was founded}} by Ocno Bianor (son of King Tyrrhenius of Tuscany and Mantua) and was named [...] "Metragirta" [...] or [...] "Mantua Carpetana". Others contend that the {{original}} name {{of the city was}} [...] "Ursaria" [...] ("land of bears" [...] in Latin), because of the many bears that were {{to be found in the}} nearby forests, which, together with the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Spanish madroño), have been the emblem of the city since the Middle Ages.|$|E
2500|$|Wood crafts in {{the state}} center on furniture, brightly painted sculptures and toys. The Tzotzils of San Juan de Chamula {{are known for their}} sculptures as well as for their sturdy furniture. Sculptures are made from woods such as cedar, {{mahogany}} and <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree.</b> Another town noted for their sculptures is Tecpatán. The making lacquer to use in the decoration of wooden and other items goes back to the colonial period. The best-known area for this type of work, called [...] "laca" [...] is Chiapa de Corzo, which has a museum dedicated to it. One reason this type of decoration became popular {{in the state}} was that it protected items from the constant humidity of the climate. Much of the laca in Chiapa de Corzo is made in the traditional way with natural pigments and sands to cover gourds, dipping spoons, chests, niches and furniture. It is also used to create the Parachicos masks.|$|E
2500|$|The floristic {{diversity}} includes 823 vascular taxa {{that occur}} in 128 types of natural vegetation. The oak forests which are common throughout the park, are specifically concentrated in Ramiscal, Peneda, Gerês and Beredo river valleys. These forested are dominated by an alliance between the Pyrenean (Quercus pyrenaica) and English (Quercus robur) oaks, which themselves are differentiated among the lower altitudes and exposed flanks (the Rusceto-Quercetum roboris) and those oaks with Atlantic characteristics (Myretillo-Quercetum roboris). The first association are commonly found with English oak (Quercus rober), cork oak (Quercus suber), butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), [...] maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), while the second association unites the English and Pyrenean oaks with bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Arbutus unedo) [...] and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). In upper altitudes there are patches of English oak that enter into their own association (Holco-Quercetum pyrenacia), which is integrated into another group (Quericon robri-patraea). These oaks have been, {{over the course of}} human settlement, the object of intense use, resulting in a general degradation of the spaces into nothing more than shrubbery.|$|E
25|$|The {{cork oak}} forests often contain wild olives, and {{like some of}} the cool groves, are often {{accompanied}} by <b>strawberry</b> <b>trees</b> (Arbutus unedo) with mock privet (Phillyrea angustifolia) which grow in the clearings of these forests and dominate their regressive phases. In western Andalusia, other common components of the ecosystem are the areas of common broom, genus Teline.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} has large {{extensions of}} conifer forest, mostly pine trees {{although there are}} areas with a pine-oak mix and some with semi tropical vegetation.

2500|$|The {{temperate}} climate and humidity resulting from {{proximity to the}} coast favour {{the growth of a}} rich mat of forest includong Atlantic and Mediterranean species, marking the transition in Portugal from northern to southern vegetation. The Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (Quercus robur) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the Cork oak (Quercus suber) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common hazel (Corylus avellana), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), European holly (Ilex aquifolium), Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), [...] <b>Strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Arbutus unedo), Laurestine (Viburnum tinus), Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera), and Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus). In the valleys, near watercourses, grow Narrow-leaf ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), Grey willow (Salix atrocinerea), European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Alder buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) and Black Elderberry (Sambucus nigra).|$|E
60|$|The meaning {{was evident}} enough, but we sought {{something}} further of the druggist at the corner, who {{did his best}} for us in such English as he had. It was not quite the English of Ronda; but he praised his grammar while he owned that his vocabulary was in decay from want of practise. In fact, he well-nigh committed us to the purchase {{of one of those}} votive candles, which he understood we wished to buy; he all but sent to the sacristan to get one. There were several onlookers, as there always are in Latin pharmacies, and there was a sad young mother waiting for medicine with a sick baby in her arms. The druggist said it had fever of the stomach; he seemed proud of the fact, and some talk passed between him and the bystanders which related to it. We asked if he had any of the quince jelly which we had learned to like in Seville, but he could only refer us to the confectioner's on the other corner. Here was not indeed quince jelly, but we compromised on quince cheese, as the English call it; and we bought several boxes of it to take to America, which I am sorry to say moulded before our voyage began, and had to be thrown away. Near this confectioner's was a booth where boiled sweet-potatoes were sold, with oranges and joints of sugar-cane, and, spitted on straws, that terrible fruit of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> which we had tasted at Honda without wishing to taste it ever again. Yet there was a boy boldly buying several straws of it and chancing the intoxication which over-indulgence in it is said to cause. Whether the excitement of these events was too great or not, we found ourselves suddenly unwilling, if not unable, to walk back to our hotel, and we took a cab of the three standing in the plaza. One was without a horse, another without a driver, but the third had both, as in some sort of riddle, and we had no sooner taken it than a horse was put into the first and a driver ran out and got on the box of the second, as if that was the answer to the riddle.|$|E
