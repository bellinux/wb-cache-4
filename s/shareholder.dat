The transaction catapulted Steve Jobs, who was the majority <b>shareholder</b> of Pixar with 50.1%, to Disney's largest individual <b>shareholder</b> with 7% and a new seat on its board of directors. Jobs' new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top <b>shareholder,</b> who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares. Pixar shareholders received 2.3 shares of Disney common stock for each share of Pixar common stock redeemed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the identity of}} non-controlling large <b>shareholders</b> and investigates their effects on firm value in the Chinese market.

The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a <b>shareholder</b> of the club, took up the role in 1973.

The business of Octopus Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited. As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus.

Stock prices of such companies are significantly higher and firms are more likely go public because of this reputation effect. Moreover, insiders divest shares gradually over time, {{at a rate that}} is negatively related to the degree of moral hazard.
