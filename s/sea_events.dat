The objective of this research is to reconstruct the historical extreme submersion-event record using sea-induced deposits preserved in coastal lagoon. The Nador lagoon is the largest Moroccan lagoon (115 km 2). It is located along the western Mediterranean, which has a high cyclogenetic character and is exposed to tsunamis from the Alboran Sea. The sandy barrier which separates the lagoon from the Mediterranean Sea is marked by much overwash, which indicate how intensely it has been exposed to the adverse <b>sea</b> <b>events</b> through history. Using the UWITEC© gravity coring platform, an undisturbed MC 4. 5 core (1. 15 m long) was successfully sampled in the studied lagoon. To identify extreme <b>sea</b> <b>events,</b> a multi-proxy approach was applied combining sedimentological and geochemical data. Three paleoevents were identified; all of them are concentrated over the last 500 years, and the most recent event corresponds to the 1889 storm. For the others deposits, {{it is difficult to determine}} exactly their origin; however, the high frequency of storm events over the relevant period and the absence of historical tsunamis evidence is more in favor of the meteorological origin...|$|E

It is important {{to carry out the}} long-term prediction and probability analysis of typhoon wind, wave height and wave period for the coastal and offshore engineering. In this paper the measured wind and wave data during typhoon processes from 1964 - 1989 are used to predict the long-term extreme sea states by using Grey Markov Chain Model. And the joint probability analysis of extreme wave height with concomitant wave period and wind speed is performed by using Multivariate Compound Extreme Distribution model which involves typhoon occurrence frequency and corresponding joint probability distribution of typhoon induced extreme sea environmental events. The proposed model shows that the mean value of typhoon occurring frequency per year plays the significant role in long term prediction of typhoon induced joint return values of extreme <b>sea</b> <b>events...</b>|$|E

Offshore, deep water directional wave buoys {{are used to}} initialize a non-stationary, linear, spectral refraction wave model. Model hindcasts of spectral parameters commonly used in nearshore process studies and engineering design are validated against nearshore buoy observations seaward of the surfzone. The buoy-driven wave model shows significant skill at most validation sites, but prediction errors for individual swell or <b>sea</b> <b>events</b> can be large. Model skill is high in north San Diego County, and low in the Santa Barbara Channel and along the southern Monterey Bay coast. Overall, the buoy-driven model hindcasts have relatively low bias and therefore are best suited for quantifying mean (e. g. monthly or annual) nearshore wave climate conditions rather than extreme or individual wave events. Model error correlation with the incident offshore wave energy, and between neighboring validation sites, {{may be useful in}} identifying sources of regional modeling errors...|$|E

Aftershocks of earthquakes on the Korean Peninsula followed within 3 days, while those of the 2011 Yellow <b>Sea</b> <b>event</b> followed by as long as 5 days. The last aftershock of the 2011 event that we observed occurred about 118 hours after the mainshock. We investigated seismograms of 5 more days for the 2011 event, but could not find any other aftershocks. Because the epicentral distances of the stations are quite different from each other, it is impossible to compare the absolute number of aftershocks. Instead we compare the number of aftershocks that are large enough to be detected at a distance of 215 km. The broken horizontal lines on each graph indicate the relative values of the PGA corresponding to ML 2.0, to the PGA of the mainshock assuming ML reported by the KMA. Considering events larger than ML 2.0, inland earthquakes of the Korean Peninsula have very few aftershocks within several hours. However, aftershocks of the 2011 Yellow <b>Sea</b> <b>event</b> continued for at least 5 days. This may indicate that the seismic activity is relatively higher in the region around the 2011 Yellow <b>Sea</b> <b>event</b> than on the Korean Peninsula.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Great {{earthquakes}} {{along the}} Philippine Sea interplate boundary, central Honshu, usually rupture {{a large portion}} of the Nankai Trough and Suruga Trough. However, the 1944 Tonankai and 1946 Nankaido earthquakes, the most recent great Philippine <b>Sea</b> <b>events,</b> did not rupture the Suruga Trough. Mogi proposed that strain release from the 1891 Nobi earthquake is responsible for the apparently premature northeast termination of the 1944 rupture zone. Using a recently derived fault model of the 1891 earthquake, combined with a suitable rheological model of central Hon-shu, we quantify both the inland and offshore consequences of the Nobi earthquake. North of the Median Tectonic Line, the co-seismic plus postseismic stress changes of the NoN earthquake promoted the failure of faults which subsequently ruptured in the decades following 1891. In contrast, along the Philippine Sea interplate bound-ary, the co-seismic plus postseismic strain release of the Nobi earthquake during the decades following 1891 has delayed the anticipated Tokai earthquake by at least 20 yr...|$|E

They {{suggested that the}} southern Yellow Sea region is characterized by short recurrence intervals while the northern China region has very long recurrence intervals. Additionally, they argued that short recurrence intervals and low stress drops reflect a lower material strength {{in the region of}} the southern Yellow Sea. The 2011 Yellow Sea event also has a low stress drop, which is lower than the typical value for shallow intraplate earthquakes, similar to the 1984 Southern Yellow Sea event. Meanwhile, earthquakes on the Korean Peninsula and just off the east coast seem to have higher stress drops, indicating that they are typical intraplate events. Therefore, the Yellow Sea region may be in a different geologic, or tectonic, setting from that of the Korean Peninsula or northern China. Choi (2010) estimated stress drops of two moderate Yellow <b>Sea</b> <b>events</b> (2003 M 4.9 and 2003 M 5.0 events in Fig. 2) to be about 10 – 30 MPa.

A steady-state density-dependent flow model was used {{in order to understand}} the position of the freshwater–salt-water interface, as influenced by the hydrogeologic structure and the presence of industrial activities and a river. Collected data and model results showed that in a large part of the area, the salt-water interface is steep and can penetrate only a few meters inland. On the other hand, close to the river mouth, seawater represents the main saline source for the aquifer. The river, in connection with the sea, can enhance seawater encroachment into the coastal aquifer; a long-term survey of river level and chloride concentrations in groundwater is recommended to further improve the physical model and to obtain a better calibration. At the refinery site, two “secondary” sources of saline water were identified and were demonstrated to have had a great influence on the presence of brackish waters in the unconfined aquifer: leakage from the fire-extinguishing system (network of pipes containing seawater) and rough <b>sea</b> <b>events.</b> This confirmed that groundwater contamination by chloride can result from means other than seawater intrusion...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTh (Old and New Testament)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. This study {{examines}} the exodus event {{and its impact}} on identity formation {{in the light of the}} origin and migration narratives of the Yoruba people. On the one hand, it is observed that migration is not only an ancient but a universal phenomenon. Its rootedness in Africa and its profound influence on identity formation are therefore brought to the fore by comparing the origin and migration narratives of the Yoruba with those of the Tiv and the amaZulu. The findings show that certain elements of the origin and migration narratives such as a common ancestor, a common ancestral home, a common belief in Supreme Deity etc., provide a basis for identity formation and recognition among these Africans, in particular, the Yoruba. On the other hand, the study focuses on the <b>Sea</b> <b>event</b> in Exodus 14 - 15 : 18 which is composed of both a narrative and a poetic rendition of the sea-crossing by the children of Israel. In the <b>Sea</b> <b>event,</b> Israel acknowledged in story and song that it was Yahweh who as a warrior, delivered its people from the hand of Pharaoh and took them safely to the other side of the Sea. This research shows that a literary consideration of the text and especially of the interplay between prose and poetry points to Yahweh as the main character in the <b>Sea</b> <b>event.</b> Consequently, Israel’s identity is defined in Yahweh whose own identity as warrior and deliverer brought Israel victory over the Egyptians and paved the way for a new nation in a new land. In this sense, Israel’s identity is assumed to be a theological one. It is argued that the Yoruba origin and migration narratives help to bring to light the memories of exodus and Israel’s recollection of Yahweh as the root of its identity. The narratives help to appreciate more clearly Yahweh’s role in the midst of his people and the his centrality to Israel’s self-understanding even as they show that these can provide valuable resources in today’s world where migration and the struggle for identity are features that are not likely to fade away. Besides, the juxtaposition of cosmogonic myths and migration theories in attesting to the elements of Yoruba identity formation, have a parallel in the blending of both cosmic and migration elements in Exodus 14 - 15 : 18. This blending also foregrounds the role of Yahweh in the <b>Sea</b> <b>event.</b> In addition, the study suggests that the interaction between prose and poetry in the <b>Sea</b> <b>event</b> is an instance of a separate genre which further research may confirm in Yoruba, especially in folk-tales and in oríkì-oríle (praise names/epithet) ...|$|R

The correlation peaks at a land-lead of about 36 yr with an average correlation distance of 200 km, with the implication of an average strain migration rate of 5. 6 km yr-l. The correlation is highly significant (> 99 per cent), both from formal statistics and from tests of random shuffles of the data. Additional analysis of the data, as a point process, confirms {{the results of the}} correlation analysis. The sharpness of the correlation peak, when compared to the individual times of occurrence of the land and <b>sea</b> <b>events</b> suggests a trigger mechanism. To explain the correlation, the general model of subduction-rupture-rebound is extended to include additional features; the buckling of the land plate from the force of the subducting slab, and the viscoelastic coupling of the plate to the underlying asthenosphere. A buckle produces a high-stress region in the continental plate where earthquakes are more prone to occur, thus producing the spatial correlatio...|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{the effects}} of the CMB on PKiKP spectra during {{transmission}} through the CMB, we address this issue {{in the context of the}} results of previous studies. Using amplitude of precursors to PKIKP, Dai et al. (2012) and Yao and Wen (2014) showed that several regions exhibit weak scattering in the lowermost mantle beneath the southwestern Pacific. PKiKP phases from events that occurred in the Banda <b>Sea</b> (<b>events</b> 4 and 9), Sumatra (events 3 and 10), and the Philippines (event 11) enter a “normal” CMB. According to Hedlin and Shearer (2000), there is a relatively weak scattering region in the lowermost mantle beneath the Philippine Sea, which corresponds to the CMB entry points of PKiKP for events 1 and 5 and the CMB exit points for events 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11. Thus, we have reason to believe that the CMB effects on the estimated reflection coefficients for results 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will be negligible. However, a strong scattering area near the CMB exists beneath north Japan and the northwestern Pacific, which includes the PKiKP CMB entry and exit points for events 2, 6, 7, and 8. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that the frequency characteristics of calculated reflection coefficients for results 3, 4, 5, and 7 are CMB effects, e.g., the high-frequency components of PKiKP may be lost by scattering at the CMB.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIt {{is well known}} that the presence of mud deposits on the continental shelf can cause dramatic damping of ocean surface wave, but quantitative field observations are very scarce. Wave prediction models currently lack a physics-based representation of the mud-induced dissipation process, and hence the accuracy of wave predictions in muddy littoral environments is unknown. This thesis presents a comprehensive field data set for comparison with the operational wave model SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore). During February to March 2008, an extensive array of 16 wave measuring instruments were deployed on the muddy shelf of Western Louisiana in depths ranging from 13 to 4 m. Box cores were collected at all instrument sites to characterize bottom sediment properties (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2008). Analysis of local wind <b>sea</b> <b>events</b> along two cross-shore transects shows a decay of waves from the deeper to the shallower instruments, with the strongest decay at the muddiest site. The wave spectra evolution shows strong decay of high-frequency wind sea spectral levels and weaker decay at the lower swell frequencies. The default bottom friction parameterization (the JONSWAP model with coefficient value 0. 067 mÂ²/sÂ³) in the SWAN model generally yields reasonable estimates of nearshore wave heights that are sufficiently accurate for most operational Navy applications. However, the predicted cross-shore wave decay is more gradual than is observed and the model does not capture the spectra decay at high freqRoyal Australian Navy autho...|$|E

The title identifies the area of enquiry as war at sea in the age of Napoleon, an unusual choice given the Corsican’s very limited understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by the use of naval forces. Maritime historians, and particularly those from Britain, are more likely to write about the war at sea during the age of Nelson, the greatest admiral of his time, described by one recent British biographer as ‘a national secular deity, the god of war for troubled times, the last resort against overwhelming odds, guardian against tyranny’. 2 The title was, however, chosen for a reason.

40|$|The Banda Sea {{earthquake}} of November 4, 1963 {{is one of}} {{the largest}} (M~ = 8. 3) intraplate events. It involved oblique thrusting at an intermediate depth within the subducted lithosphere near the abrupt bend in the southeastern Banda arc (6. 86 °S, 129. 580 E). To better understand the tectonic significance of this earthquake, the detailed source process of the Banda <b>Sea</b> <b>event</b> was determined by body wave analysis. The rupture history was established by deconvolving source time functions from long-period P wave seismograms, using both individual station and multi-station time—domain deconvolution methods. The seismic moment release occurred within the first 50 s of rupture, initiating at a depth near 120 km and expanding laterally and downdip over a vertical extent of about 50 km. Slip and moment release were concentrated in one main region near the hypocenter, at depths between 110 and 130 km. The along-strike rupture length was only about 100 km, so it is difficult to resolve any horizontal directivity. The compressional stress orientation inferred from the focal mechanism parallels the strike of the slab, and reflects the importance of contortion of the lithosphere in this region.
