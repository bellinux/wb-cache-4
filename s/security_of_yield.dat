40|$|The {{threat to}} global food <b>security</b> <b>of</b> stagnating <b>yields</b> and {{population}} growth makes increasing crop productivity a critical goal over the coming decades. One key target for improving crop productivity and yields is increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. Central to photosynthesis is ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, Rubisco, which is a critical but often rate-limiting component. Here we present full Rubisco catalytic properties measured at three temperatures for 75 plants species representing both crops and undomesticated plants from diverse climates. Some newly characterised Rubiscos were naturally 'better' compared to crop enzymes and {{have the potential to}} improve crop photosynthetic efficiency. The temperature response of the various catalytic parameters was largely consistent across the diverse range of species, though absolute values showed significant variation in Rubisco catalysis, even between closely related species. An analysis of residue differences amongst the species characterised identified a number of candidate amino acid substitutions that will aid in advancing engineering of improved Rubisco in crop systems. This study provides new insights on the range of Rubisco catalysis and temperature response present in nature, and provides new information to include in models from leaf to canopy and ecosystem scale...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} three funding strategies for pension plans and analyzes the investment strategies that complement these strategies. Although the primary focus is on defined benefit plans, which include Social Security, it also applies to employees' defined contribution plans, which, when their beneficiaries set specific goals for their future retirement benefits, are essentially defined benefit plans. The findings suggest that pension plans should use interest rates on Treasury <b>securities</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>yields</b> on corporate bonds to calculate {{the value of their}} liabilities. Defined benefit plans, including Social Security, could stabilize the balance between the value of their assets and their obligations if they financed only the value of the benefits that their beneficiaries have accrued and they invested their assets in Treasury securities. In this case, the required contribution per dollar of wages would need to change significantly with the rate of growth of employment. By funding the obligation entailed by employees' projected income at retirement, contributions per dollar of wages would change less with the growth of employment. However, in this case, plans would need to invest in a broader range of assetsincluding Treasury inflation-protected securities, stocks, and real assetsto prevent the balance between their assets and liabilities from varying too greatly. Furthermore, plans would need to hold surplus assets to minimize the risk of becoming underfunded...|$|R

30|$|It is {{impossible}} to predict future returns of stocks in any budding security market. The arithmetic mean of historical data is in general considered as the expected return <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> which <b>yield</b> us a crisp value. However, for this technique, two main problems need to be solved. Firstly, if historical data {{for a long period}} are considered, the influence of earlier historical data is {{the same as that of}} recent data, whereas recent data <b>of</b> a <b>security</b> is more important than the earlier historical data. Secondly, if the historical data <b>of</b> a <b>security</b> are not adequate, due to the lack of information, the estimations of the statistical parameters are not adequate. For these reasons, the expected return <b>of</b> a <b>security</b> is considered here as an uncertain variable instead of the crisp arithmetic mean of historical data. Similarly, in an uncertain environment, the risk (entropy) and skewness cannot be predicted exactly. Therefore, the entropy and skewness are also considered here as uncertain variables.|$|R

40|$|A {{yield curve}} can be {{described}} as a sequence <b>of</b> <b>yields</b> on debt instruments with specified maturities, or as a set <b>of</b> discrete <b>yields</b> plotted versus maturity in a graph. Even if in most of the cases the points are connected to form a piecewise linear but smooth graph, the real data is always a finite set of discrete points. A simple observation of the chart below shows that the shape as well as the level <b>of</b> the <b>yield</b> curve for Treasury securities changes over time. As a consequence, interest-rate risk cannot be summarized just in terms of parallel shifts of the curve. Changes in <b>yields</b> on <b>securities</b> <b>of</b> different maturities can be separated into independent modes of fluctuations. In broad terms, shifts in the curve can be characterized as changes in level, slope and curvature. Higher order effects eventually contribute to the shape of the term structure of interest rates. However, statistical analysis shows that the first three components explain more than 90 % of the volatility of each of the points on the curve 1.

First, producing countries are expected to mainly focus on <b>security</b> <b>of</b> demand issues because of the abundant availability of energy resources. This distracts the attention from producer countries’ concerns about supply security. Second, the demand side of the energy equation has been largely neglected as a result of focussing on consuming states interests which equate energy <b>security</b> with <b>security</b> <b>of</b> supply. As a result, both <b>security</b> <b>of</b> supply and demand of producing countries stay largely out of the picture. To address this dual hiatus, the article first unveils the domestic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> supply concerns of the Russian Federation which comparable to consuming countries struggles with Availability, Accessibility, Acceptability and Affordability concerns. The main difference lies within the virtual absence of a geopolitical element of international supplies.
