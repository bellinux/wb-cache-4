40|$|Part 7 : Innovative e-Business ModelsInternational audienceAs is {{the case}} with {{traditional}} markets, the sellers on the Internet do not usually know the demand functions of their customers. However, in such a digital environment, a seller can experiment different prices in order to maximize his profits. In this paper, we develop a dynamic pricing model to solve the pricing problem of a Web-store, where seller sets a fixed price and buyer either accepts or doesn’t buy. Frequent price changes occur due to current market conditions. The model is based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution (indexed by scale and shape parameters), which is used as the underlying distribution of a random variable X representing the amount of revenue received in the specified time period, say, day. In determining (via testing the expected value of X) whether or not the new product selling price c is accepted, one wants the most effective sample size n of observations X 1, …, Xn of the random variable X and the test plan for the specified <b>seller</b> <b>risk</b> of Type I (probability of rejecting c which is adequate for the real business situation) and <b>seller</b> <b>risk</b> of Type II (probability of accepting c which is not adequate for the real business situation). Let μ 1 be the expected value of X in order to accept c, and μ 2 be the expected value of X in order to reject c, where μ 1 [*]>[*]μ 2, then the test plan has to satisfy the following constraints: (i) Pr{statistically reject c | E{X} = μ 1 } = α 1 (<b>seller</b> <b>risk</b> of Type I), and (ii) Pr{statistically accept c | E{X} = μ 2 } = α 2 (<b>seller</b> <b>risk</b> of Type II). It is assumed that α 1 [*]< 0. 5 and α 2 [*]< 0. 5. The cases of product pricing are considered when the shape parameter of the two-parameter Weibull distribution is assumed to be a priori known as well as when it is unknown...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} buyer and <b>seller</b> <b>risk</b> aversion in first and second- price auctions. The setting is the classic one of symmetric and independent private values, with ex ante homogeneous bidders. However, the seller is able to optimally set the reserve price. In both auctions the seller's optimal reserve price is shown to decrease in his own risk aversion, and more so in the first-price auction. Thus, greater <b>seller</b> <b>risk</b> aversion increases the ex post efficiency of both auctions, and especially that of the first-price auction. The seller's optimal reserve price in the first-price, {{but not in the}} second-price, auction decreases in the buyers' risk aversion.

For instance, <b>seller’s</b> <b>risk</b> neutral behavior has been researched by Arnold (1992; 1999) and Deng et al. (2012).

When the <b>seller</b> is more <b>risk</b> averse than the pivotal bidder - a condition often verifiable by deduction prior to the auction - the premium also benefis the seller and therefore leads to a Pareto improvement of the English auction.

40|$|Traditionally, American {{energy markets}} have been {{regulated}} {{using a combination}} of antitrust law and public utility law: the former has predominated in oil markets and the latter in markets for natural gas and electricity. Over time, energy markets have grown increasingly complex and competitive, due partly to changing market conditions (for example, in oil markets) and partly to regulation (in natural gas and electricity markets). Increasingly competitive energy markets meant increased risk for energy companies; those companies turned to energy derivatives as a way to hedge that risk. High energy prices and charges of manipulation in twenty-first century energy markets have led regulators to a new approach, one that borrows from securities regulation and focuses attention on “manipulation and deceit” by energy market participants. The securities model may be a bad fit for energy markets, however, because reliance on this new approach exposes consumers to price risks associated with the exercise of market power by <b>sellers,</b> <b>risks</b> to which buyers were not subject under traditional approaches to regulation. Specifically, the securities regulation model overlooks important ways in which sellers can exert market power at the expense of consumers in the absence of fraud or deceit. This is due to the way securities case law interprets the term “manipulation,” and to some regulators’ common assumptions {{about the ways in which}} market participants respond to price changes—assumptions that do not apply or apply only weakly in some energy markets. In this Article, we explore the origins of these “bad fit” problems, and examine their implications for the future of American energy markets...|$|R

With MSC, shocks to the fundamentals of the asset can be more easily disentangled from the liquidity shocks of the individual owners.

40|$|This paper studies a {{contingent}} claim pricing problem in incomplete markets, {{based on the}} risk indifference principle. The <b>seller’s</b> dynamic <b>risk</b> indifference price is the payment that makes the risk involved for the seller of a contract equal, at any time, to the risk involved if the contract is not sold and no payment is received. An explicit formula for the dynamic risk indifference price is given as the solution of a one-dimensional linear BSDE with stochastic Lipschitz coefficient. The results show that any convex risk measure used for indifference pricing leads to an equivalent martingale measure. This entails a simple linear representation of the price as the expected derivative payoff under the ”risk indifference measure”. From a risk management perspective, the model provides two-sided risk indifference bounds for derivative prices in incomplete markets...|$|R
