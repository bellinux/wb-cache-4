25|$|Soon after tram {{operations}} were started, many problems arose. The hilly terrain of Kiev presented the largest problem. On Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street, {{a pair of}} horses {{was not enough to}} pull the trams uphill. Therefore, another two pairs of horses were added, which did not improve the situation. Thus, mechanizing the tram using a steam-powered engine was attempted as a solution to the problem. However, the steam engines produced a lot of noise, which <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> horses and people, and produced a lot of air pollution.|$|E
25|$|During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877–1878, in February 1878 the Russian {{army had}} almost reached the Ottoman capital but, <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> city might fall, the British sent {{a fleet of}} battleships to intimidate Russia from {{entering}} the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate {{on the outcome of}} the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus.|$|E

25|$|UFOIC's start was {{overshadowed by}} a large, more active Sydney group, the Northern Suburbs Flying Saucer Research Association. The two Sydney groups competed for members {{and soon the}} {{relationship}} between the two broke down. NSFSRA became the central NSW group, primarily due to their public support and hosting of George Adamski on his 1959 Australian visit, organised by Victorian and Queensland Groups. Adamski held his Sydney lecture at Adyar Hall on 27 February 1959. Adamski's visit resulted in UFOIC membership falling away dramatically until it was basically a small, close-knit group of enthusiasts. So bitter was the dispute, UFOIC President Dr. Greenwell resigned in disgust; this opened the position to Dr Miran Lindtner who became president in March 1959. The damage had been done and the Sydney experience <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> NSW UFO community.|$|E
25|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin kills off main characters because he finds it very irritating to know early in the story who as the hero will come through unscathed. Martin dislikes this lack of realism, comparing the situation to a soldier <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> night before a battle. Martin wants his readers to feel {{that no one is}} safe as they turn the page. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature, and points readers not wanting to get upset or disturbed to the plenty of books for comfort reading.|$|E
25|$|According to Amir Khusrau, this defeat <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> Mongols so {{much that}} they retreated to the {{mountains}} of Ghazni. They did not launch any further expeditions into India during Alauddin's reign. On the other hand, Tughluq, Alauddin's governor of Dipalpur, adopted an aggressive policy against the Mongols. Over the next few years, he annually raided Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, and Garmsir, which were located on the Mongol frontier. He plundered these territories, and levied tribute on the residents, without any resistance from the Chagatai Khanate. Amir Khusrau, in his Tughluq-Nama, alludes to Tughluq's 20 victories, most of which were against the Mongols. Barani states that Tughluq, who also received the iqta' of Lahore at some point, defeated the Mongols 20 times. The Moroccon traveler Ibn Battuta states that a mosque in Multan had an inscription, in which Tughluq claimed to have defeated the Mongols 29 times. It is uncertain if these victories refer to the above-mentioned raids.|$|E

25|$|At about 21:00 on 17 April 1961, a {{night air}} strike by three FAL B-26s on San Antonio de Los Baños {{airfield}} failed, reportedly due to incompetence and bad weather. Two other B-26s had aborted the mission after take-off. Other sources allege that heavy anti-aircraft fire <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> aircrews As night fell, Atlantico and Caribe {{pulled away from}} Cuba, {{to be followed by}} Blagar and Barbara J. The ships were to return to the Bay of Pigs the next day to land more ammunition, but the captains of Atlantico and Caribe decided to abandon the invasion and headed out to the open sea out of fear of further air attacks by the FAR. Destroyers from the US Navy intercepted Atlantico about 110 miles south of Cuba, and persuaded the captain to return, but Caribe was not intercepted until she was 218 miles away from Cuba, and she was not to return until it was too late.|$|E
25|$|When looting San Francisco's neighborhoods, the Sydney Ducks even {{set fire}} to San Francisco six times between 1849 and 1851 in order to {{distract}} citizens from their pillaging and murdering. Whenever they planned to start a fire, they waited for south westerly winds so that Sidney Town would not also catch fire. The citizens of San Francisco became enraged and in 1851 they formed a first Vigilance Committee. Two of the Sydney Ducks, Samuel Whittaker and Robert McKenzie, were then arrested for arson, robbery, and burglary. The vigilantes then held a quick trial, and later hanged them. Vigilantes, unauthorized individuals who use trials and lynchings to punish criminals, were not uncommon in the Old West but San Francisco's Vigilance Committees were {{the largest and most}} organized of America's history. The hangings <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> remaining Sydney Ducks into fleeing the city. Within two weeks after the hangings, Sidney Town had but only a few dance halls, saloons, and brothels remaining. That relative peace would only last for two years before criminals started to once again return to the Barbary Coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of the Spanish city of Santiago de Querétaro is pegged to 25 July 1531 when Spaniard Hernán Pérez Bocanegra y Córdoba arrived with the allied Otomi leader Conín (later named Fernando de Tapia) who was the administrative head of the Otomi peoples living in Aztec controlled territory. On this date, the Spanish and their Nahuan allies were battling the local insurgent Otomi and Chichimecas at a hill now known as Sangremal and which was called Ynlotepeque and considered sacred in pre-Hispanic times. Chronicles of this event, such as that written by Friar Isidro Félix de Espinoza, state that the Chichimeca were {{at the point of}} winning when a total eclipse of the sun occurred. This supposedly <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> Chichimeca and the Spanish claimed to have seen an image of Saint James (the patron saint of Spain) riding a white horse carrying a rose-colored cross. This event caused the Chichimeca to surrender. This event is why the city is called Santiago (Saint James) de Querétaro, with James as patron saint. A stone cross imitating the one the Spanish supposedly saw was erected on the hill, which later was accompanied by a church and monastery.|$|E

25|$|The {{conquest and}} {{colonization}} of Querétaro {{began with the}} Spanish settlements at San Juan del Río, Querétaro and Huimilpan between 1529 and 1531. Conquistador Herán Pérez de Bocanegra joined forces with a local Otomi lord from Jilotepec named Conín, also known as Fernando de Tapia, to enter Otomi areas {{in what is now}} the city of Querétaro. There would be only one major battle as part of the conquest in 1531. The Spanish and their Indian allies were battling the local Otomi and Chichimecas at a hill now known as Sangremal, which was then called Ynlotepeque, and considered sacred in pre-Hispanic times.

25|$|Despite the {{government}} setting large bounties on them, it proved difficult {{to crack the}} organization. On one hand, it was popular among many workers; on the other hand, {{those who did not}} sympathize with them were fearful of the group practice of murdering informants. Dłużewski died in the spring of 1911 {{as a result of the}} tip-off of an informant, who was later executed by the group when his betrayal was discovered. One year later, on the anniversary of Dłużewski's death, the group declared that they would kill all policeman they saw on the streets. On that day, 75% of the police officers did not turn up for work. In another well-known event, one of the group members survived a three-day siege in an attic; he killed a policeman, and then left the scene in his victim's uniform. In October 1939 Piątek was arrested. Heavily injured, Piątek was taken to hospital. He <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> policeman interviewing him into believing that he had a bomb, and according to reports, died laughing. Eventually, in around November 1913, a high-ranking member of the group, Michał Zakrzewski, was captured and successfully interrogated. The arrest enabled the group to be dismantled by the authorities by February next year, with 51 of its active members arrested. Due to outbreak of World War I, many of the accused were transported to Moscow, where the trials were finished. Many were executed, others were deported to Siberia.|$|E
25|$|In the Mahabharata epic, Janamejeya, {{the son of}} King Parikshita of Kuru dynasty was {{performing}} a snake sacrifice known as Sarpa Satra, to avenge {{for the death of}} his father from a snake bite by the snake king called Taksaka. A sacrificial fireplace had been specially erected and the fire sacrifice to kill all snakes in the world was started by a galaxy of learned Brahmin sages. The sacrifice performed in the presence of Janamejaya was so powerful that it was causing all snakes to fall into the Yagna kunda (sacrificial fire pit). When the priests found that only Takshaka who had bitten and killed Parisksihita had escaped to the nether world of Indra seeking his protection, the sages increased the tempo of reciting the mantras (spells) to drag Takshaka and also Indra to the sacrificial fire. Takshaka had coiled himself around Indra’s cot but the force of the sacrificial yagna was so powerful that even Indra along with Takshaka were dragged towards the fire. This <b>scared</b> <b>the</b> gods who then appealed to Manasadevi to intervene and resolve the crisis. She then requested her son Astika to go to the site of the yagna and appeal to Janamejaya to stop the Sarpa Satra yagna. Astika impressed Janamejaya with his knowledge of all the Sastras (scriptures) who granted him to seek a boon. It was then that Astika requested Janamejeya to stop the Sarpa Satra. Since the king was never known to refuse a boon given to a Brahmin, he relented, in spite of protects by the rishis performing the yagna. The yagna was then stopped and thus the life of Indra and Takshaka and his other serpent race were spared. This day, according to the Hindu Calendar, happened to be Nadivardhini Panchami (fifth day of bright fortnight of the lunar month of Shravana during the monsoon season) and since then the day is a festival day of the Nagas as their life was spared on this day. Indra also went to Manasadevi and worshipped her.|$|E
