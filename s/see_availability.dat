40|$|Abstract Background Phylogenetic {{networks}} are a generalization of phylogenetic trees {{that allow for}} the representation of evolutionary events acting at the population level, like recombination between genes, hybridization between lineages, and lateral gene transfer. While most phylogenetics tools implement {{a wide range of}} algorithms on phylogenetic trees, there exist only a few applications to work with phylogenetic networks, none of which are open-source libraries, and they do not allow for the comparative analysis of phylogenetic networks by computing distances between them or aligning them. Results In order to improve this situation, we have developed a Perl package that relies on the BioPerl bundle and implements many algorithms on phylogenetic networks. We have also developed a Java applet that makes use of the aforementioned Perl package and allows the user to make simple experiments with phylogenetic networks without having to develop a program or Perl script by him or herself.

High-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of protein complexes can reveal {{the details of}} their function and provide a basis for many computational and experimental approaches. Differentiation between biological and non-biological contacts and reconstruction of the intact complex is a challenging computational problem. A successful solution can provide additional insights into the fundamental principles of biological recognition and reduce errors in many algorithms and databases utilizing interaction information extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Results We have developed a method for identifying protein complexes in the PDB X-ray structures by a four step procedure: (1) comprehensively collecting all protein-protein interfaces; (2) clustering similar protein-protein interfaces together; (3) estimating the probability that each cluster is relevant based on a diverse set of properties; and (4) combining these scores for each PDB entry in order to predict the complex structure. The resulting clusters of biologically relevant interfaces provide a reliable catalog of evolutionary conserved protein-protein interactions. These interfaces, as well as the predicted protein complexes, are available from the Protein Interface Server (PInS) website (<b>see</b> <b>Availability</b> and requirements section). Conclusion Our method demonstrates an almost two-fold reduction of the annotation error rate as evaluated on a large benchmark set of complexes validated from the literature. We also estimate relative contributions of each interface property to the accurate discrimination of biologically relevant interfaces and discuss possible directions for further improving the prediction method. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Some {{mutations}} {{in the internal}} regions of exons occur within splicing enhancers and silencers, influencing the pattern of alternative splicing in the corresponding genes. To understand how these sequence changes affect splicing, we created a database of these mutations. Findings The Alternative Splicing Mutation Database (ASMD) serves as a repository for all exonic mutations not associated with splicing junctions that measurably change the pattern of alternative splicing. In this initial published release (version 1. 2), only human sequences are present, but the ASMD will grow to include other organisms, (<b>see</b> <b>Availability</b> and requirements section for the ASMD web address). This relational database allows users to investigate connections between mutations and features of the surrounding sequences, including flanking sequences, RNA secondary structures and strengths of splice junctions. Splicing effects of the mutations are quantified by the relative presence of alternative mRNA isoforms with and without a given mutation. This measure is further categorized by {{the accuracy of the}} experimental methods employed. The database currently contains 170 {{mutations in}} 66 exons, yet these numbers increase regularly. We developed an algorithm to derive a table of oligonucleotide Splicing Potential (SP) values from the ASMD dataset. We present the SP concept and tools in detail in our corresponding article. Conclusion The current data set demonstrates that mutations affecting splicing are located throughout exons and might be enriched within local RNA secondary structures. Exons from the ASMD have below average splicing junction strength scores, but the difference is small and is judged not to be significant. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Contact {{order is}} a topological {{descriptor}} {{that has been}} shown to be correlated with several interesting protein properties such as protein folding rates and protein transition state placements. Contact order has also been used to select for viable protein folds from ab initio protein structure prediction programs. For proteins of known three-dimensional structure, their contact order can be calculated directly. However, for proteins with unknown three-dimensional structure, there is no effective prediction method currently available. Results In this paper, we propose several simple yet very effective methods to predict contact order from the amino acid sequence only. One set of methods is based on a weighted linear combination of predicted secondary structure content and amino acid composition. Depending on the number of components used in these equations it is possible to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0. 857 – 0. 870 between the observed and predicted contact order. A second method, based on sequence similarity to known three-dimensional structures, is able to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0. 977. We have also developed a much more robust implementation for calculating contact order directly from PDB coordinates that works for > 99 % PDB files. All of these contact order predictors and calculators have been implemented as a web server (<b>see</b> <b>Availability</b> and requirements section for URL). Conclusion Protein contact order can be effectively predicted from the primary sequence, at the absence of three-dimensional structure. Three factors, percentage of residues in alpha helices, percentage of residues in beta strands, and sequence length, appear to be strongly correlated with the absolute contact order. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Transcription factors (TFs) are core {{functional}} proteins which play {{important roles}} in gene expression control, and they are key factors for gene regulation network construction. Traditionally, they were identified and classified through experimental approaches. In order to save time and reduce costs, many computational methods {{have been developed to}} identify TFs from new proteins and to classify the resulted TFs. Though these methods have facilitated screening of TFs to some extent, low accuracy is still a common problem. With the fast growing number of new proteins, more precise algorithms for identifying TFs from new proteins and classifying the consequent TFs are in a high demand. Results The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was utilized to construct an automatic detector for TF identification, where protein domains and functional sites were employed as feature vectors. Error-correcting output coding (ECOC) algorithm, which was originated from information and communication engineering fields, was introduced to combine with support vector machine (SVM) methodology for TF classification. The overall success rates of identification and classification achieved 88. 22 % and 97. 83 % respectively. Finally, a web site was constructed to let users access our tools (<b>see</b> <b>Availability</b> and requirements section for URL). Conclusion The SVM method was a valid and stable means for TFs identification with protein domains and functional sites as feature vectors. Error-correcting output coding (ECOC) algorithm is a powerful method for multi-class classification problem. When combined with SVM method, it can remarkably increase the accuracy of TF classification using protein domains and functional sites as feature vectors. In addition, our work implied that ECOC algorithm may succeed in a broad range of applications in biological data mining. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Automatic {{quantification}} of neuronal morphology from {{images of}} fluorescence microscopy plays {{an increasingly important}} role in high-content screenings. However, there exist very few freeware tools and methods which provide automatic neuronal morphology quantification for pharmacological discovery. Results This study proposes an effective quantification method, called NeurphologyJ, capable of automatically quantifying neuronal morphologies such as soma number and size, neurite length, and neurite branching complexity (which is highly related to the numbers of attachment points and ending points). NeurphologyJ is implemented as a plugin to ImageJ, an open-source Java-based image processing and analysis platform. The high performance of NeurphologyJ arises mainly from an elegant image enhancement method. Consequently, some morphology operations of image processing can be efficiently applied. We evaluated NeurphologyJ by comparing it with both the computer-aided manual tracing method NeuronJ and an existing ImageJ-based plugin method NeuriteTracer. Our results reveal that NeurphologyJ is comparable to NeuronJ, that the coefficient correlation between the estimated neurite lengths {{is as high as}} 0. 992. NeurphologyJ can accurately measure neurite length, soma number, neurite attachment points, and neurite ending points from a single image. Furthermore, the quantification result of nocodazole perturbation is consistent with its known inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth. We were also able to calculate the IC 50 of nocodazole using NeurphologyJ. This reveals that NeurphologyJ is effective enough to be utilized in applications of pharmacological discoveries. Conclusions This study proposes an automatic and fast neuronal quantification method NeurphologyJ. The ImageJ plugin with supports of batch processing is easily customized for dealing with high-content screening applications. The source codes of NeurphologyJ (interactive and high-throughput versions) and the images used for testing are freely available (<b>see</b> <b>Availability).</b> </p...|$|E
30|$|The Nankai Trough is a {{prominent}} geological structure {{resulting from the}} continuous subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the southwest Japan. Large earthquakes with magnitudes around 8 have occurred repeatedly {{in the region and}} have caused tremendous damages in southwest Japan (e.g., Ando 1975; Mochizuki and Obana 2003). The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion (HERP), Japan, has estimated probabilities of 70 – 80 % for the next magnitude 8 – 9 class earthquake to occur within the next 30  years in the Nankai Trough area, based on certain assumptions (HERP 2018). Moderate-magnitude earthquakes are not very frequent in the Nankai Trough compared with those in the Japan Trench area in northeast Japan. On April 1, 2016, an Mw 5.8 earthquake occurred in the coseismic slip area of the 1944 Tonankai earthquake, which was independent of the 2004 southeast off-Kii peninsula earthquake sequence. Ground motions for these earthquakes were recorded by hundreds of strong-motion stations operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). In the present study, we processed and compared the observed ground motion recordings for two moderate-magnitude earthquakes in the Nankai Trough: one having an Mw of 6.5 (an aftershock of the 2004 southeast off-Kii peninsula earthquake) and the other having an Mw of 5.8 (the 2016 southeast off-Mie Prefecture earthquake). According to the revised list of region names for earthquake information by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), both the 2004 and 2016 events belong to the same region: Mie-ken Nanto-Oki, which means the southeast off-Mie Prefecture. However, we used the two distinct names for the earthquakes to separate the 2016 event, which presumably occurred as a plate boundary event, from the 2004 earthquake sequence that occurred inside the subducting Philippine Sea Plate as intraslab events. Moreover, the region name for the 2004 event referred to in this paper is consistent with the previous region name (<b>see</b> <b>Availability</b> of data and materials) and the published literature discussed below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, which {{describes}} {{the function of}} genes and gene products across species, has recently been used to predict protein subcellular and subnuclear localization. Existing GO-based prediction methods for protein subcellular localization use the known accession numbers of query proteins to obtain their annotated GO terms. An accurate prediction method for predicting subcellular localization of novel proteins without known accession numbers, using only the input sequence, is worth developing. Results This study proposes an efficient sequence-based method (named ProLoc-GO) by mining informative GO terms for predicting protein subcellular localization. For each protein, BLAST is used to obtain a homology with a known accession number to the protein for retrieving the GO annotation. A large number n of all annotated GO terms that have ever appeared are then obtained from a large set of training proteins. A novel genetic algorithm based method (named GOmining) combined with a classifier of support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to simultaneously identify a small number m out of the n GO terms as input features to SVM, where m n. The m informative GO terms contain the essential GO terms annotating subcellular compartments such as GO: 0005634 (Nucleus), GO: 0005737 (Cytoplasm) and GO: 0005856 (Cytoskeleton). Two existing data sets SCL 12 (human protein with 12 locations) and SCL 16 (Eukaryotic proteins with 16 locations) with m = 44 and m = 60 informative GO terms, respectively. ProLoc-GO using input sequences yields test accuracies of 88. 1 % and 83. 3 % for SCL 12 and SCL 16, respectively, which are significantly better than the SVM-based methods, which achieve Conclusion The growth of Gene Ontology in size and popularity has increased the effectiveness of GO-based features.

40|$|Abstract Background Metagenomics is an {{approach}} to the characterization of microbial genomes via the direct isolation of genomic sequences from the environment without prior cultivation. The amount of metagenomic sequence data is growing fast while computational methods for metagenome analysis are still in their infancy. In contrast to genomic sequences of single species, which can usually be assembled and analyzed by many available methods, {{a large proportion of}} metagenome data remains as unassembled anonymous sequencing reads. One of the aims of all metagenomic sequencing projects is the identification of novel genes. Short length, for example, Sanger sequencing yields on average 700 bp fragments, and unknown phylogenetic origin of most fragments require approaches to gene prediction that are different from the currently available methods for genomes of single species. In particular, the large size of metagenomic samples requires fast and accurate methods with small numbers of false positive predictions. Results We introduce a novel gene prediction algorithm for metagenomic fragments based on a two-stage machine learning approach. In the first stage, we use linear discriminants for monocodon usage, dicodon usage and translation initiation sites to extract features from DNA sequences. In the second stage, an artificial neural network combines these features with open reading frame length and fragment GC-content to compute the probability that this open reading frame encodes a protein. This probability is used for the classification and scoring of gene candidates. With large scale training, our method provides fast single fragment predictions with good sensitivity and specificity on artificially fragmented genomic DNA. Additionally, this method is able to predict translation initiation sites accurately and distinguishes complete from incomplete genes with high reliability. Conclusion Large scale machine learning methods are well-suited for gene prediction in metagenomic DNA fragments. In particular, the combination of linear discriminants and neural networks is promising and should be considered for integration into metagenomic analysis pipelines.

40|$|Technology is the ‘engine of {{economic}} growth’ and technological progress {{is the most}} important factor driving a nation’s sustained economic growth. New technologies assume significant and long term role in this process {{of economic}} development. New technologies can trigger new cycles of economy, provide windows of opportunity for less developed countries {{to catch up with the}} more advanced nations and are important from the wealth creation point of view. However for this to happen, the technology should be able to reach society in the form of new products, processes. Nanotechnology is a new and emerging technology that can play important role to promote India’s economic development. Wide ranges of applications are claimed for nanotechnology and it is considered to be the next big wave of technology after information technology and biotechnology. Government of India has started a mission on nanoscience and nanotechnology in May 2007 with an allocation of ~ 200 million USD for 5 years. However, if one looks at the ‘Nanotechnology’ from the wealth creation point of view, then, research efforts alone in this field, are not sufficient. The research efforts should lead to new products, new processes, and new platforms. Management of technology can assume significant role in this process. It is generally agreed upon that management of nanotechnology is necessary to create economic advantage at the national level. However, the macro level understandings namely, policy at the national level, must result in ground level organization performance. In order to facilitate innovation in the field of NST (Nanoscience and Technology), the process of innovation in this field must be well understood. Infrastructure and management of R&D is a key aspect and entrepreneurship is vital for the development of a new technology. The aim of this study is to do the assessment of nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. Emerging technology assessments for nation building to meet societal objectives is an extremely complex task. Challenge lies in understanding complex R&D requirements and likely innovations at the lab level. Further challenge lies in assessing initiatives of the start-ups, individual entrepreneurs and comparing them with the Government research initiatives. Understanding the resource requirements of different research initiatives in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) will greatly assist in facilitating innovation in this field. Further understanding of human, cultural issues, education and training aspects, technical and market uncertainties faced by nanoscience and nanotechnology research initiatives will be an added advantage for the policy makers to facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST). Review of Literature A critical literature review in the field of Technology Management; Innovation, Technological Innovation; and nanoscience and nanotechnology from a business perspective gave researcher a strong foundation to define nanotechnological innovation and understand the process of nanotechnological innovation. This literature along with the literature on the emergence of a new industry helped identify factors that would facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. While understanding importance of management in developing nanotechnology to realize its benefits, no study has attempted to link the management processes with the innovation output in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Also, there are very few empirical studies in this area. Thus need to empirically determine various management processes that can facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology and their causal relatedness to output measures of innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology is identified as a research gap. Aims, Objectives This study aims at conceptualizing the challenges of developing appropriate framework for assessment of emerging technologies in a particular domain. It further aims to use this framework for assessing nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India and to come up with set of alternatives for policy makers at the national level. The objectives are 1. 	To develop a framework for the assessment of a new technology initiative with a view to enable innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. This further gave rise to two objectives viz, 	a. 	Measure the innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. 	b. 	Identify factors that enable innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. 1 	To use developed framework to assess nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. 2 	To make suggestions for effective institution building and develop interventions for efficient management of nanoscience and technology research and development initiatives. Conceptual Model The conceptual model links two major aspects viz., output of innovation and factors facilitating innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST). This model is used as a tool to assess nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. Output of innovation is measured at three levels, namely, Focused NST initiative -an initiative where with clear goals, deliverables and resources work on NST project has started. Newness of NST initiative -which measures generation of new products, new processes in the field of NST and Dissemination of NST initiative -which measures publications and patents in the field of NST. Factors facilitating innovation include Organization context, presence of Basic resources, Leadership, Strategic research partnerships, Link with venture capitalists, Technology characteristics and Innovation culture. These factors were thought to be positively linked with the output of innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Methodology Based on a critical literature review, a preliminary study entailing in-depth interviews with strategy experts and a pilot study, a structured questionnaire was developed, to measure constructs and variables in the conceptual model. The main study consisted of data collected from 112 researchers from private as well as public organizations engaged in nanoscience and nanotechnology research and development. Results and Discussion The first part of the analysis began with factor analysis. Based on the factor loadings 31 factors were obtained. These factors were considered to be facilitating innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Similarly output of innovation in the field of NST got loaded onto 3 factors, namely Focused NST initiative, Newness of NST initiative and Dissemination of NST initiative. Non-Hierarchical K-means (K = 2) cluster analysis resulted in two useful clusters among respondents; Cluster 1 primarily represented academic institutes whereas, Cluster 2 mainly represented private sector start-ups in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Factors facilitating innovation and output of innovation were compared across two clusters of the organizations. The student’s t-test was used to compare means of factor scores and items under it across two clusters. Based on the statistical significance of the difference between the factor scores across two clusters, conclusions were drawn as to whether the presence of factors facilitating innovation and output of innovation differ across academic institutes and private sector start-up firms. Significant differences were obtained between the two clusters of organizations with respect to availability of finance, technical and industrial experience of the leadership, strategic research partnerships, market uncertainty and link with the venture capitalists. Output of innovation also differed across two types of organizations, wherein, academic institutes were more active in producing “dissemination” output of innovation and private start-up firms are more active in producing “newness” output of innovation. The next stage of analysis dealt with finding out what among these factors actually contribute to innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Multiple linear regression technique was used to for this purpose. Thus, for three levels of innovation output, three regression models are obtained. Industrial experience of the leaders, Finance, Market readiness of the products are some of the factors facilitating ‘Newness’ output of innovation, whereas, Academic experience and Link with the technical communities are some of the factors affecting Dissemination of NST Initiative. The next stage of analysis dealt with simultaneous estimation of dependent variables. Structural equation modeling in the form of path analysis (AMOS software from SPSS) was used for this purpose. This also helped in explaining how different variables (dependent as well as independent) are related to each other. At an aggregate level, causal model could be fitted between factors facilitating innovation and output of innovation in the field of nanoscience and technology. Chi-square, Normed Fit Index (NFI) and Root mean square error analysis (RMSEA) were the measures used to accept the model. Path analysis also helped to find significant covariances among the independent variables. Concomitant with the quantitative approach of data analysis, qualitative approach using case study was also used to assess nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. Case study was conducted in two different types of organizations; a premier academic institution and a private start-up firm. Case study revealed that private sector organizations indeed struggle to raise finance. However, high entrepreneurial attitude motivates these young engineers. In case of academic institutions it was noted that in an academic environment there is no real motivation for commercialization or taking research to the market. Performance and rewards for faculty depend to a large extent on publications and to a very small extent on patents. Culture of industrial R&D is not very strong in India and not many companies are willing to experiment. Major conclusions of the study Major conclusions of the study pointed out differences between academic institutes and private start-up firms with respect to availability of the resources, leadership of the people, strategic research partnerships. It also pointed out differences in the types of output of innovation produced by these two firms. Causal analysis in the form of regression and path analysis pointed out factors actually contributing to innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Case study analyzed qualitatively challenges faced by researchers from academic institutes and private start-up firms. Major Suggestions to organizations From the data analyzed in the study, it can be seen that private sector firms in India are facing the problem of raising finance as compared with academic institutions. Similarly, analysis of the data shows, significantly less Industry – Government interactions as compared with Academic institutions – Government interactions. Understanding the importance of private industries in developing applications of new technologies, Government needs to come out with appropriate practices to build a good “ecosystem” for nanotechnology innovation. At the national level, efforts are undertaken by the Government to increase and encourage research initiatives in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Substantial investment can be made in developing technology managers and also build technology entrepreneurs who would commercialize the products and build new products from the new technology. Thus, formation of start-up firms can be encouraged. This will absorb the manpower trained by academic research institutes and will enhance technical and market experience among researchers which was noted as a important factor for enhancing ‘newness’ output of innovation. Detailed analysis of various programs initiated by Government of India does show presence of various mechanisms to promote private sector initiatives in field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. However, present study shows that the private sector is finding it difficult to raise finance through various Government schemes. Academic sector is the major beneficiary of Government funding however, the research results stop at publications in these organizations. Private sector is able to bring new products, new processes, however, struggles to raise finance. Thus private sector start-ups could be funded with Government funding mechanisms. These mechanisms can be made less cumbersome for the start-up firms. Academic sector on the other hand should be encouraged by way of incentives for generation of new products. Considering importance of strategic research partnerships, institutional mechanisms could be put into place which will enhance Government – Industry and Industry-Academia research interaction. Contribution of the study The main contribution of this study includes, a conceptual model involving resource based view of innovation. The conceptual model is further used for measuring output of innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) at three levels, namely newness of NST initiative, dissemination of NST initiative and having a focused NST research initiative. Factors which may promote and facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) are also measured. Comparison is made across different types of organizations to <b>see</b> <b>availability</b> of these enabling factors in Indian nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives. Using regression analysis and path analysis, factors which actually contribute to innovation in the field of NST are identified. The main implication of the study is towards a better policy formulation in strengthening human resources, organizational capability, increasing funding for research and enhancing academic – industry interaction for better innovative performance. Limitations of the study The present study does not include all the types of organizations in the technology environment, this includes, namely nanoscience and nanotechnology R&D initiatives in large sized organizations and Government research organizations like Defense research and Development Organization (DRDO), Indian Space research Organization (ISRO). These organizations were contacted for data collection for this study, however they denied permission. Directions for future research Present study involved cross section of researchers engaged in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Future studies can be longitudinal that can track changes in leadership, organizational structure and organizational processes.

However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (<b>see</b> Production and <b>availability).</b> Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|R
40|$|This {{demonstration}} {{will explore}} how people’s existing notebook computers, the WiFi access {{points in a}} city, a carefully selected cache of web pages, and some software glue can be combined to provide a location-enhanced conference guide. Although location-aware applications, tourist guides, museum tours, and the like are well known to the research community {{they have yet to}} <b>see</b> widespread <b>availability.</b> Part of {{the reason for this is}} that exotic infrastructure or additional mobile hardware is generally required. In contrast we will pursue a low-overhead clientbased software-only approach. Users will load a software package on their WiFi-notebook computers that adds WiFi cell-site location to their browser and lets them easily find location-relevant content about the conference hotel and surrounding neighborhood. An unusual aspect of our approach is that it requires no network connectivity: a web page cache provides content and beacons from existing WiFi access points provide location...|$|R

Decisions regarding who shall conceive and with what reproductive tissues may {{be made on the}} basis of; sexual orientation, gender identity, family configuration, available egg donors (<b>see</b> egg donation), <b>availability</b> of sperm donors (see sperm donation), racial/cultural consideration, reproductive health, and access to financial resources. Here novel approaches to creating biological relations can be accomplished by selecting which egg and sperm are used, for example using sperm and egg donors multiple times to create biological ties between children.|$|R
40|$|Information {{relating}} to health has been gathered since ancient times. Physicians often gathered their own books which were sometimes donated to create early medical libraries. The explosion of information, {{the demands of}} qualification accrediting bodies and technological developments have also helped to promote the work of health libraries. The professionalisation of health occupations has tended to move their library support from hospitals into academic settings. Librarians are increasingly concerned with promoting their services and teaching patrons to use library resources. While some health sciences librarians <b>see</b> the <b>availability</b> of health {{information on the internet}} as a threat, to those that can see ways to exploit it, it may serve to enhance their role. 2 Libraries are places, physical or virtual, where knowledge is gathered, organised and then made available to potential users. Health science libraries gather material of relevance to health service practitioners and related professionals. Some may be targeted at particular professions within tha...|$|R
40|$|Public {{distribution}} system {{is one of}} the widely controversial officers that involves corruption andillegal smuggling of goods. All these happen because every job in the ration shop involves manual work andthere are no specific high-tech technologies to automate the job. One of the main concerns in the illegal entryin registers of the shop about the amount of products that are given to the people. Further there is alwaysdifficulty for the checking officials to go through the stocks available and the goods given in a register andfind out irregularities. All the data allocation is done by the computer it can keep track of all the data and thewhole process of data maintenance is taken care of by the PC and hence no chance of mistakes and virtuallyno manual work. Further any checking person can simple enter in and <b>see</b> the <b>availability</b> of the stock andother things by just giving a few clicks in the computer. Hence the whole process is completely error free andhas a lot of advantages...|$|R
40|$|Pudakpayung Sub District is the southest in Banyumanik District of Semarang City. This {{area is a}} Urban Fringe Area {{with high}} {{population}} growth and development area for human settlement. But not supported by good facilities and infrastructure. This research is aiming to <b>see</b> the <b>availability</b> and quality of facilities and infrastructure in this urban fringe area. So, this research can give the recommendation about availability and quality of facilities and infrastructure, especially in urban fringe area. This research will identify changes the pattern of human settlement and then identify the availability, quality, and distribution of neighborhoods facilities and infrastructure. The research method used in this research is quantitative descriptive method. The analysis uses the quantitative descriptive analysis with the provisions of SNI 03 - 1733 - 2004, scoring with a Likert scale, and spatial mapping. The result of this research indicate changes the pattern of land up and indicate the availability, quality, and distribution of every facilities and infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|This is an EPSRC {{responsive}} mode Proposal {{to carry}} out basic long term research into the architectures for programmable all-optical Internet routers. We are revisiting some of the fundamental tenets of computer science {{to carry out}} this work, and so it is necessarily highly speculative. Currently, the processing elements in all-electronic routers are typically fairly conventional von-Neumann architecture computers with processors that have large, complex instruction sets (even RISC is relatively complex compared with the actual requirements for packet pro-cessing) and Random Access Memory. As the need for speed increases, first this architecture (see Nick McKeown’s excellent talk in reference [6]), and then the classical computing hardware components, and finally, electronics cease {{to be able to keep}} up. At this time, optical device technology is making great strides, and we <b>see</b> the <b>availability</b> of gates, as well as a plethora of invention in providing buffering mechanisms. However, a critical problem we foresee is the ability to re-program devices for differen...|$|R
