40|$|A self-bonding {{phenomenon}} {{takes place}} when five layers of beech (Fagus SylvaticaL.) veneers are pressed at temperatures higher than 200 ºC. If the pressing temperature between veneer surfaces reaches at least 225 ºC during pressing {{and if the}} pressure applied is optimal, water-resistant bonds are formed between veneers. This study investigates the relation of thickness reduction (marker of compression) and mass loss (marker of heat treatment intensity) to boards quality. The effect of water and water vapour on the bondings between veneer in boards pressed at 200, 225 and 250 ºC is studied. The conclusion is that pressing 5 layers of 2 mm rotary-cut beech veneer parallel-fibered at 225 ºC, 5 MPa and 300 s leads to a thickness reduction of 33. 4 % and mass loss of 1. 23 %; in such boards bondings are not resistant to liquid water but are resistant to vapour after one adsorption-desorption cycle.

Press-plate temperatures during hot pressing were 200, 225, and 250 degrees C.

Metal anionic species were ion exchanged into the resin-molecular sieve composites obtained in a following step.

40|$|International audienceVegetable {{oil from}} Calophyllum inophyllum kernels {{appears as a}} {{promising}} raw material for biodiesel production in Indonesia. For this, the oil must first be extracted {{and this is the}} twin-screw extrusion technology that has been used in that case to conduct such extraction. A two-step process was developed consisting in a mechanical pressing and then in the aqueous extraction of residual oil in the press cake. And, {{it should be noted that}} a fibrous residue (i. e. sunflower hull) was added in the second twin-screw reactor to facilitate the liquid/solid separation during the aqueous extraction stage. In the best condition tested, 63 % of the oil was extracted. In addition, depending on the extrusion conditions used, residual oil content in the final cake varied from 16. 7 to 19. 1 % of its dry matter instead of 74. 0 % inside the starting material (i. e. the kernel). In this study, the use of the final cakes as sources for fiberboard manufacture through thermopressing was investigated. These cakes can be considered as natural composites with lignocellulosic fibers from the fibrous residue and proteins from the Calophyllum inophyllum kernel breakdown process acting respectively as reinforcing fillers and a natural binder [1 - 2]. Cohesive <b>self-bonded</b> boards were thus obtained through thermopressing using the next molding conditions: 200 °C temperature, 20 MPa pressure and 300 s molding time. For the three cakes tested, part of their residual oil was expressed through the sidewall vents of the mold during molding, which was due to the applied pressure, and this contributed to the increase in the total vegetable oil recovery. In addition, the more the residual oil content in the cake, the more the oil expressed. However, oil expression during molding reduced the mechanical resistance of fiberboards, due to defects appearing within the material as the oil escaped. This contributed to a slight increase in the bending properties (from 12. 1 to 15. 4 MPa for flexural strength at break and from 1. 9 to 2. 0 GPa for elastic modulus) with the cake’s residual oil content decrease (from 19. 1 to 16. 7 %). A significant improvement in the molding process consisted in conducting the cake’s deoiling prior thermopressing using a Soxhlet extraction apparatus and cyclohexane as extracting solvent. From this, the properties of the corresponding board (4. 3 mm thickness and 1185 kg/m 3 density) were much improved: 79 ° Shore D surface hardness (instead of 70 ° without deoiling), 23. 7 MPa flexural strength at break and 3. 1 GPa elastic modulus. In parallel, thickness swelling after 24 h immersion in water was 43. 9 % and it has decreased up to 27. 6 % after the board’s heat treatment (200 °C during 10 min). This optimal fiberboard complied with the French standard NF EN 312 (standard dedicated to the specifications for particleboards), type P 7 (i. e. load bearing boards for use under high stress and in wet conditions) for flexural properties (recommendations of 21 MPa and 3. 1 GPa for flexural strength at break and elastic modulus, respectively, for boards with a 4 to 6 mm thickness). However, thickness swelling after immersion in water will need to be significantly reduced to achieve the 10 % recommended standard value...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} the self-bonding of veneers, and investigations into the properties of boards obtained by hot-pressing beech veneers without adhesives. The raw material is pressed at temperatures from 200 to 250 ºC, at pressures from 4 to 6 MPa and pressing times from 240 to 360 s. The hot-pressing of five layers of veneers results in a <b>self-bonded,</b> compressed, densified board, darker than the raw material. The manufacturing process was optimised using a statistical analysis, the response surface experimental design method. The input factors were the pressing parameters and the output factors were characteristics of the product, the raw material properties being kept constant. The results showed correlations between the pressing parameters, especially temperature, as input data and the physical and mechanical properties as responses. Resistance to water absorption and swelling as well as shear strength, bending strength, and hardness were all enhanced by more severe pressing conditions. All the samples pressed at 250 ºC became water-resistant while samples pressed at 200 ºC delaminated rapidly in water. It {{was found that the}} colour of the edges can be used as an indication of the hardness. Chemical investigations were performed on samples taken from veneers (raw material), bond-lines and inner parts of pressed veneer. A High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to detect and compare the levels of water-soluble monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) in the veneer before pressing and the levels of 5 -hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF) and furfural in boards. From the results obtained in this thesis it is suggested, that besides other degraded compounds of hemicelluloses, the monosaccharides were transformed into hydroxymethyl-furfural during hot-pressing that could further participate in forming new browning compounds that are related to the bonding phenomenon. The UV spectroscopic analysis to evaluate the content of water-soluble phenols showed that the bond-line had a higher amount of conjugated phenols than the inner veneer suggesting a migration of degraded lignin towards the veneer surfaces during pressing. A CP/MAS 13 C NMR study on the solid material showed that the presence of β-ether structures and methoxyl groups in lignin was higher in the bond-line, supporting the hypothesis of a migration of lignin and possibly a condensation reaction occurring at higher temperatures, explaining the water-resistance property acquired by the boards. In a comparative study, oxidative activation with hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate as a catalyst was performed before pressing. Boards made from beech veneer subjected to the pre-treatment step showed a greater mass loss, a lower thickness swelling but also a somewhat lower shear strength. For beech veneers such an oxidative pre-treatment step could be used to gain water-resistant boards pressed at lower pressing temperatures or shorter times than those needed to bond untreated veneers. Scots pine veneers were found to be less suitable for self-bonding than beech veneers. Boards of Scots pine hot-pressed without the oxidative pre-treatment delaminated in water, whereas, under the same pressing conditions, boards made from pre-treated veneers showed a water-resistant bond-line.

A method is developed in order to study the influence of the operating conditions on the compacted materials’ mechanical properties. Pressure has a limited effect above 100 MPa, the molding time has no significant effect (it can be reduced to 3 seconds) and a minimum of moisture content is necessary. Temperature is the most impacting factor and is correlated with higher mechanical properties, higher density and lower moisture uptake of the specimens as well as to a significant decrease of interparticular space on the surface. At 8 % moisture and 200 °C, steam accumulates in the core of the material which leads to the delamination of the samples. The moisture / temperature couple (0 - 8 % and 175 - 250 °C) is thus specifically studied; above 225 °C the effect of delamination is decreased. The best mechanical properties are obtained at 2 % and 250 °C: 31 / 70 MPa of stress at break in tensile/bending and 2 and 8 GPa for the corresponding moduli. The structure / property relationship is discussed thanks to the data obtained. Water has a key role yet contradictory because of its plasticizing effect and higher thermal conductivity in one hand, and the accumulation of steam which hinders the cohesion at the core and leads to delamination. The addition of fatty compounds to cellulose increases the water resistance of the specimens: 5 % of stearic acid and magnesium stearate increased the water drop penetration time and its surface contact angle. The grafting of octanoïc acid (and its anhydride equivalent) during the molding process is studied and confirmed by CPG analysis with a maximum DS value of 3. 9 10 - 2 for the acid and 4. 8 10 - 2 for the anhydride. Pretreatments (solvent exchange and high pressure homogenizer) are necessary in order to increase the cellulose / grafts contact and to obtain a significant grafting yield. The grafting yield is correlated with a decrease of the bending properties of the grafted materials. The process is then applied to a variety of raw plant materials (crop residues or byproducts of a first processing) with the aim of establishing a link between the physico-chemical properties of the plant materials and the compacted materials’ mechanical properties. Despite a mediocre statistical significance and lower properties of the materials compared to cellulose, the link is confirmed between high cellulose and lignin contents, low extractives, hemicelluloses, ashes and protein contents and high mechanical properties and water resistance. In response to the limits of this technique, an alternative process of transfer molding is proposed, together with preliminary tests that confirm numerous prospects...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable {{oil from}} Calophyllum inophyllum kernels {{appears as a}} {{promising}} raw material for biodiesel production in Indonesia. For this, the oil must first be extracted {{and this is the}} twin-screw extrusion technology that has been used in that case to conduct such extraction. A two-step process was developed consisting in a mechanical pressing and then in the aqueous extraction of residual oil in the press cake. And, {{it should be noted that}} a fibrous residue (i. e. sunflower hull) was added in the second twin-screw reactor to facilitate the liquid/solid separation during the aqueous extraction stage. In the best condition tested, 63 % of the oil was extracted. In addition, depending on the extrusion conditions used, residual oil content in the final cake varied from 16. 7 to 19. 1 % of its dry matter instead of 74. 0 % inside the starting material (i. e. the kernel). In this study, the use of the final cakes as sources for fiberboard manufacture through thermopressing was investigated. These cakes can be considered as natural composites with lignocellulosic fibers from the fibrous residue and proteins from the Calophyllum inophyllum kernel breakdown process acting respectively as reinforcing fillers and a natural binder [1 - 2]. Cohesive <b>self-bonded</b> boards were thus obtained through thermopressing using the next molding conditions: 200 °C temperature, 20 MPa pressure and 300 s molding time. For the three cakes tested, part of their residual oil was expressed through the sidewall vents of the mold during molding, which was due to the applied pressure, and this contributed to the increase in the total vegetable oil recovery. In addition, the more the residual oil content in the cake, the more the oil expressed. However, oil expression during molding reduced the mechanical resistance of fiberboards, due to defects appearing within the material as the oil escaped. This contributed to a slight increase in the bending properties (from 12. 1 to 15. 4 MPa for flexural strength at break and from 1. 9 to 2. 0 GPa for elastic modulus) with the cake’s residual oil content decrease (from 19. 1 to 16. 7 %). A significant improvement in the molding process consisted in conducting the cake’s deoiling prior thermopressing using a Soxhlet extraction apparatus and cyclohexane as extracting solvent. From this, the properties of the corresponding board (4. 3 mm thickness and 1185 kg/m 3 density) were much improved: 79 ° Shore D surface hardness (instead of 70 ° without deoiling), 23. 7 MPa flexural strength at break and 3. 1 GPa elastic modulus. In parallel, thickness swelling after 24 h immersion in water was 43. 9 % and it has decreased up to 27. 6 % after the board’s heat treatment (200 °C during 10 min). This optimal fiberboard complied with the French standard NF EN 312 (standard dedicated to the specifications for particleboards), type P 7 (i. e. load bearing boards for use under high stress and in wet conditions) for flexural properties (recommendations of 21 MPa and 3. 1 GPa for flexural strength at break and elastic modulus, respectively, for boards with a 4 to 6 mm thickness). However, thickness swelling after immersion in water will need to be significantly reduced to achieve the 10 % recommended standard value...|$|E

30|$|To provide basic {{information}} on <b>self-bonding</b> in kenaf core binderless boards, {{a series of}} chemical analyses was conducted on binderless boards and their chemical changes during hot pressing were examined in our previous study. In this study, binderless boards were manufactured under conditions that may accelerate the supposed chemical changes to investigate their effect on the board properties. First, to investigate {{the influence of the}} chemical bonds formed by carbonyl compounds on <b>self-bonding,</b> the influence of acetic acid addition prior to board manufacturing was studied and the effect of methanol extractives (containing the carbonyl compounds) was also examined. Second, the influence of the condensation reaction in lignin was discussed from the viewpoint of board density. Last, to examine the influence of thermal softening of lignin, the influences of temperature condition and moisture content, {{as well as those of}} microwave pretreatment, were investigated. As a result, the estimated chemical changes were suggested to influence the binderless board properties.|$|R
40|$|<b>Self-bonding</b> of {{air-dried}} undebarked cotton stalks during {{hot pressing}} in a closely fitting mold was studied. Advanced board-like green nanocomposites from ground undebarked cotton stalks were introduced {{for the first}} time in the present work. The dry forming process was adopted. Moderate molding pressure and temperature were selected and applied in a tight die, thus saving water and energy and avoiding the use of any binders to achieve an environment-friendly green product. Green nanocomposites having densities in the range of 1. 27 – 1. 29 g/cm 3 and 1. 03 – 1. 06 g/cm 3 were prepared. Particle size and cell wall morphological structure were found to play a major role in <b>self-bonding.</b> Properties of composites prepared from the fine fraction of cotton stalks were superior to those prepared from the cotton stalk coarse fraction at the same conditions. This is attributed—among other things—to the dominance of pith (parenchymal cells) in the fine fraction. Such cells possess a high lumen-to-cell wall ratio, which renders them more deformable under pressure, leading to more intercellular or interparticle bonding. Advanced binderless green nanocomposites having bending strength as high as 637 kg/cm 2 and water absorption as low as 12. 1 % were obtained from the ground undebarked cotton stalks. The results show clearly that the advanced green nanocomposite obtained by the dry forming process, without the addition of any binders, is superior to hardboard obtained from cotton stalks by the conventional wet web formation process. The mechanism of <b>self-bonding</b> is discussed...|$|R
