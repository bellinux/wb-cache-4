25|$|Annie {{cleaned up}} and fixed her pet's wounds, and then, vowing vengeance against the snobby brat for {{injuring}} her pet, she put Oil of Tar in his hair tonic; mixed itching powder in with his talcum powder; and poured a half bottle of ink into his <b>shower</b> <b>bath.</b> This left Selby itching and dirty and angry.|$|E

[...] The most luxurious SAL train of its time, {{introduced}} to entice wealthy tourists and businessmen to Florida during the land-boom era, its deluxe features included fresh flowers and fresh fish for the dining car, a library car and observation car, and a club {{car with a}} barber and <b>shower</b> <b>bath.</b> [...] The OBS was later immortalized in a very famous fiddle tune of the same name.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} curing {{techniques}} including <b>showers,</b> <b>baths,</b> hydromassages, applications of mud, filiform shower and aerosols.|$|R

5000|$|... $30,000 was {{appropriated}} for new plumbing, all old bath-rooms and closets to be {{torn out}} and modern <b>shower</b> <b>baths,</b> tubs and closets were installed, and the floors were tiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wow!" [...] spluttered the fun-loving Rover, as he {{staggered}} back. [...] "Hi! Sam, {{do you think}} I need a <b>shower</b> <b>bath?</b> I'm wet enough already." [...] And Tom commenced to brush the water from his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "What curious creatures women are! Archie told us you {{bore the}} news like a hero, {{and now you}} turn pale at a whiff of bad air. I can't explain it," [...] mused Mac as he meekly endured the {{fragrant}} <b>shower</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to see a little lovely weather here. The last week has been almost worse than the rain--the steamy heat is like being in a vapour bath. If it were not that I am on duty, I {{should like to}} strip, and go out and enjoy a <b>shower</b> <b>bath</b> for half an hour." ...|$|E
25|$|In the USA, {{the typical}} single family home consumes 69.3 gallons (262 litres) {{of water per}} day. Uses include (in {{decreasing}} order) toilets, washing machines, <b>showers,</b> <b>baths,</b> faucets, and leaks.|$|R
2500|$|... “…all cabins amidships, the {{pleasant}} and commodious state rooms having real twin beds (rather than berths), {{the abundance of}} accommodation with private tub and <b>shower</b> <b>baths,</b> the spacious public halls, and a cuisine attuned to these distinctive features.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to <b>showering,</b> <b>baths</b> {{were recorded in}} 47 percent of the sampled households in which 2.7 baths were taken each week (or, on average, 1.3 per week across all sampled households). Each bath uses on average 20.2 gallons (or 76.5 liters) of water.|$|R
60|$|When at last Mrs. Quack {{had taken}} a final <b>shower</b> <b>bath</b> and {{appeared}} satisfied that she was looking her best, Peter {{opened his mouth to}} ask her the questions he was so full of, but closed it again as he remembered people are usually better natured when their stomachs are full, and Mrs. Quack had not yet breakfasted. So he waited as patiently as he could, which wasn't patiently at all. At last Mrs. Quack finished her breakfast, and then she had to make her toilet all over again. Finally Peter hopped {{to the edge of the}} bank where she would see him.|$|E
60|$|The couple under {{observation}} {{occupied the}} inn {{so long that}} Mr. Hoopdriver {{at the thought of}} their possible employment hungered as well as thirsted. Clearly, they were lunching. It was a cloudless day, and the sun at the meridian beat down upon the top of Mr. Hoopdriver's head, a <b>shower</b> <b>bath</b> of sunshine, a huge jet of hot light. It made his head swim. At last they emerged, and the other man in brown looked back and saw him. They rode on {{to the foot of the}} down, and dismounting began to push tediously up that long nearly vertical ascent of blinding white road, Mr. Hoopdriver hesitated. It might take them twenty minutes to mount that. Beyond was empty downland perhaps for miles. He decided to return to the inn and snatch a hasty meal.|$|E
60|$|Monday, June 20. Went to {{have our}} {{passport}} viséd. The sky was black, and the rain pouring in torrents. As I reached the quay the Seine was rushing dark, and turbidly foaming. I crept into a fiacre, and was amused, as we rattled on, to see the plight of gay and glittering Paris. One poor organ grinder, on the Pont National, sat with his umbrella over his head, and his body behind the parapet, grinding away, in the howling storm. It was the best use for a hand organ I ever saw. The gardens of the Tuileries presented a sorry sight. The sentries slunk within their boxes. The chairs were stacked and laid on their sides. The paths were flooded; and the classic statues looked {{as though they had}} a dismal time of it, in the general <b>shower</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|E
50|$|A terrace is {{available}} for use in summer time. There are four different locker rooms, which permit the arena to hold two consecutive matches. Each locker room has ten <b>shower</b> <b>baths,</b> three urinals, as well as private wardrobes and massage rooms. There are also four locker rooms for referees.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, Concurrent Technologies Corporation’s System for Laundry and Shower Recycle/Reuse (SYLAS-R2) won an Edison Award. SYLAS-R2 is an energy-efficient, {{scalable}} {{and fully}} automated greywater reuse system that recycles approximately 90% of greywater. Greywater is wastewater generated in households or office buildings from {{sources such as}} sinks, <b>showers,</b> <b>baths,</b> and clothes washers.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} as an 18-unit {{apartment}} building costing $60,000 {{that was to}} provide elegant apartments with modern/luxurious amenities including central heating and incinerator, and <b>shower</b> <b>baths</b> and Frigidaire refrigerators in each apartment. It was designed by George Zagel and Brother architects of Milwaukee, hired by developer James Mahler, {{a real estate agent}} in Milwaukee.|$|R
6000|$|Mac {{apparently}} understood, and {{not only}} took the hint, but surpassed her in cheerful composure, for, merely saying [...] "Good-bye, Cousin; write when you feel like it," [...] he shook hands {{and walked out of}} the house as tranquilly as if only a day instead of three months were to pass before they met again. Rose felt as if a sudden <b>shower</b> <b>bath</b> had chilled her and was about to retire, saying to herself with disdainful decision: [...] "There's no love about it after all, only one of the eccentricities of genius," [...] when a rush of cold air made her turn to find herself in what appeared to be the embrace of an impetuous overcoat, which wrapped her close for an instant, then vanished as suddenly as it had come, leaving her to hide in the sanctum and confide to Psyche with a tender sort of triumph in her breathless voice: [...] "No, no, it isn't genius that must be love!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The hotel {{here at the}} Springs {{is not so much}} crowded as usual, and I {{am having}} a very {{comfortable}} time of it. The hot, white steam puffs up out of fissures in the earth like the jets that come from a steam-boat's 'scape pipes, and it makes a boiling, surging noise like a steam-boat, too-hence the name. We put eggs in a handkerchief and dip them in the springs--they [...] "soft boil" [...] in 2 Minutes, and boil as hard as a rock in 4 minutes. These fissures extend {{more than a quarter of}} a mile, and the long line of steam columns looks very pretty. A large bath house is built over one of the springs, and we go in it and steam ourselves as long as we can stand it, and then come out and take a cold <b>shower</b> <b>bath.</b> You get baths, board and lodging, all for $25 a week--cheaper than living in Virginia without baths.....|$|E
6000|$|But poor Jo {{never got}} her laugh, {{for she was}} transfixed upon the {{threshold}} by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly {{was a shock to}} behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold <b>shower</b> <b>bath</b> had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. At the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but 'that man', as Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, [...] "Sister Jo, congratulate us!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He presumes to exist--that's {{what he has}} done," [...] {{retorted}} Sir Patrick. [...] "Don't stare! I am speaking generally. Your {{friend is}} the model young Briton of the present time. I don't like the model young Briton. I don't see the sense of crowing over him as a superb national production, because he is big and strong, and drinks beer with impunity, and takes a cold <b>shower</b> <b>bath</b> all the year round. There is far too much glorification in England, just now, of the mere physical qualities which an Englishman shares with the savage and the brute. And the ill results are beginning to show themselves already! We are readier than we ever were to practice all that is rough in our national customs, and to excuse all that is violent and brutish in our national acts. Read the popular books--attend the popular amusements; {{and you will find}} at the bottom of them all a lessening regard for the gentler graces of civilized life, and a growing admiration for the virtues of the aboriginal Britons!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Up to {{this hour}} we had conversed little in French. One is {{naturally}} diffident at first; for if one musters courage to commence {{a conversation with}} propriety, the problem is how to escape a Scylla {{in the second and}} a Charybdis in the third sentence. Said one of our fair entertainers, [...] "When I first began I would think of some sentence till I could say it without stopping, and courageously deliver myself to some guest or acquaintance." [...] But it was like pulling the string of a <b>shower</b> <b>bath.</b> Delighted at my correct sentence, and supposing me au fait, they poured upon me such a deluge of French that I held my breath in dismay. Considering, however, that nothing is to be gained by half-way measures, I resolved upon a desperate game. Launching in, I talked away right and left, up hill and down,--jumping over genders, cases, nouns, and adjectives, floundering through swamps and morasses, in a perfect steeple chase of words. Thanks to the proverbial politeness of my friends, I came off covered with glory; the more mistakes I made the more complacent they grew.|$|E
6000|$|The general {{size of a}} {{store in}} Tangier is about that of an {{ordinary}} <b>shower</b> <b>bath</b> in a civilized land. The Muhammadan merchant, tinman, shoemaker, or vendor of trifles sits {{cross-legged on the floor}} and reaches after any article you may want to buy. You can rent a whole block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month. The market people crowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs, dates, melons, apricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not much larger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog. The scene is lively, is picturesque, and smells like a police court. The Jewish money-changers have their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coins and transferring them from one bushel basket to another. They don't coin much money nowadays, I think. I saw none but what was dated four or five hundred years back, and was badly worn and battered. These coins are not very valuable. Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to have money suited to the general cheapness of things, and came back and said he had [...] "swamped the bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, {{and the head of the}} firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the change." [...] I bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shilling myself. I am not proud on account of having so much money, though. I care nothing for wealth.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{notwithstanding}} all this, the boy {{grew more}} and more melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot <b>baths,</b> sitz <b>baths,</b> <b>shower</b> <b>baths,</b> and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist {{the water with a}} slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.|$|R

50|$|The hotel had 440 guest rooms, {{each with}} its own <b>shower</b> <b>bath.</b> Guest suites had a sitting room, dining room, bath, and up to seven bedrooms.

50|$|By the 1920s, {{the school}} {{building}} was enlarged to ten rooms, seven classrooms, a lunchroom, and two lavatories with <b>shower</b> <b>baths.</b> For the 1923-24 school year, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades were added and total enrollment was 350 students. Canutillo students interested in continuing their education after eighth grade had to travel almost 15 miles to attend El Paso High School. This continued through the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|After {{definitively}} {{ending his}} dental practice in late 1845, Wells became a salesman of <b>shower</b> <b>baths</b> which {{he received a}} patent for on November 4, 1846. Wells also planned to sail to Paris to purchase paintings to resell in the United States. He traveled to Paris in early 1847, where he petitioned the Academie Royale de Medicine and the Parisian Medical Society for recognition in the discovery of anesthesia.|$|R
50|$|Nearby was the two-and-a-half-story wood-frame Redstone Club, {{recreational}} facilities for the workers. It included a billiard and pool room, reading room, and bar. At the latter facility, treating others to drinks was prohibited, {{a policy that}} CFI had implemented in Coalbasin and found effective in limiting the impact of alcohol consumption {{on the quality of}} life. Upstairs was a theater; the basement held <b>showers,</b> <b>baths</b> and dressing rooms.|$|R
