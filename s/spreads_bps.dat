40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the link between}} corporate social responsibility and bank debt. Our focus on banks exploits their specialized role as quasi-insider delegated monitors. We find that firms with the worst social responsibility scores pay higher <b>spreads</b> (16 <b>bps)</b> but firms with average or good social scores benefit very little from increasing them further. The modest premium charged the worst firms together with {{the absence of a}} payoff for the best firms suggest that banks do not regard corporate social responsibility as significantly value enhancing or risk reducing...|$|R

5000|$|Big Obsidian Eruptive Episode: About 480 A.D. (1,470 14C years B.P.), {{a three-part}} {{sequence}} of rhyolitic eruptions began which included an air-fall tephra, ash-flow tephra, and an obsidian flow {{from a common}} vent {{at the base of}} the south caldera wall. The initial Plinian eruption 480 A.D. (1,580 14C years B.P.) produced the Newberry pumice fall deposit which blanketed the east flank of the volcano and areas to the east. About 210 years later, the Paulina Lake ash flow (1,310 14C years <b>B.P.)</b> <b>spread</b> from near the south caldera wall to Paulina Lake. The final phase of the eruption produced the Big Obsidian Flow, which covers 1.1 sq mi.|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} wildlife refuges bordering the Gulf of Mexico are havens for a remarkable variety of birds, sea turtles, marine mammals and other wildlife—including at least 27 threatened or endangered species. Many of these refuges, {{and the native}} plants and animals they harbor, are {{in the path of}} <b>spreading</b> oil from <b>BP’s</b> Deepwater Horizon spill. This disaster poses another challenge for a crucial set of protected areas that already faces serious problems. NatioNal Wildlife Refuges iN the gulf of Mexico The National Wildlife Refuge System offers a crucial sanctuary for America’s fish, wildlife and plants, and provides an estimated $ 26 billion in value to the nation’s economy. There are 38 wildlife refuges along the Gulf of Mexico, protecting some of America’s most extensive coastal salt marshes, barrier islands, mangrove swamps and pristine beaches. These habitats support a wide range of animals, from colonies {{of tens of thousands of}} nesting seabirds and pelicans to endangered se...|$|R
40|$|The Greek debt {{restructuring}} of 2012 {{showed that the}} legal terms of sovereign bonds can protect creditors against losses, in particular the type of governing law. This paper studies whether sovereign bonds that are issued in foreign jurisdictions trade at a premium vis-a-vis domestic-law bonds. We use the Eurozone between 2007 and 2014 as a unique testing ground to assess this ``legal safety premium'' and collect secondary market bond yield data for the near-universe of Eurozone government bonds issued in foreign jurisdictions. Controlling for currency risk, liquidity risk, and term structure, we find that foreign-law bonds indeed carry lower yields on average. But a sizable premium only emerges for large values of credit risk (CDS <b>spreads</b> beyond 500 <b>bp).</b> At those levels, a 100 bp increase in CDS spreads {{is associated with a}} 30 - 80 bp larger yield premium on foreign-law bonds. In contrast, we do not find a premium for countries that are perceived as low risk. These results indicate that sovereigns in distress can, at the margin, borrow at lower rates under foreign law...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{plant species}} {{constitute}} a major ecological and economic problem worldwide, often distorting trophic levels and ecosystem balance. Numerous studies implicate factors ranging from environmental plasticity, competition for nutrient and space, and allelopathy {{in the success}} of invasive species in general. The Brazilian Pepper tree (BP) was introduced to the United States in the 1800 s and has since become a category one invasive plant in Florida. It has aggressively spread to about 3000 km 2 of terrestrial surface, fueled in part by the prevalence of the hybrid genotypes and environmental perturbations. It displays some of the well-established invasive mechanisms but there is a serious dearth of knowledge on the plant-microbe-soil interactions and whether the rhizobiome plays any roles in the displacement of native flora and the range expansion of BP. Several control measures, including chemical, mechanical and biological antagonism have been used with limited success while restoration of natives in soils from which BP was removed has proved problematic partly due to a poorly understood phenomenon described as the BP legacy effect. Emerging evidence suggests that allelopathy, selective recruitment of beneficial soil microbes, disruption of microbial community structure and alteration of nutrient cycling, exhibited by many other invasive plant species may also be involved in the case of BP. This brief review discusses the well-established BP invasion mechanisms and highlights the current understanding of the molecular, below-ground processes. It also points out the gaps in studies on the potential role of microbial interactions {{in the success of}} BP invasion. These hitherto poorly studied mechanisms could further explain the aggressive <b>spread</b> of <b>BP</b> and could potentially contribute significantly to effective control measures and enable appropriate strategies for restoring native plants. The review advocates for the use of cutting-edge techniques in advancing the plant microbiome science. Ultimately, comparing metagenomic analyses of the rhizobiome of invasive plants grown in native and non-native soils could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the microbial determinants of biotic resistance, potentially empowering environmental managers with some predictive power of future trends of plant invasion...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy using {{heavy ion}} beam such as Carbon-ion has the {{advantage}} {{for the treatment of}} deep-seated tumour over conventional radiotherapy with X-rays due to an enhanced dose deposition in the Bragg peak (BP) {{at the end of the}} ion range. The highest dose can be deposited in the tumour with much lower doses to the surrounding healthy tissue. The Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) of a carbon-ion radiotherapy beam greatly depends on a depth of the target volume in the body and the nuclear fragmentation process that increases close to the <b>BP</b> or <b>spread</b> out <b>BP</b> (SOBP) as well as neutrons. It is important to understand the RBE of the heavy ions in hadron therapy applications in order to deliver correct dose. Microdosimetry is extremely useful technique, used for RBE study in unknown mixed radiation fields typical of hadron therapy. Conventional detectors for microdosimetry consist of tissue equivalent proportional counters (TEPC) which have advantages of a spherical sensitive volume and tissue equivalency through use of a tissue equivalent gas. However, TEPC has several limitations such as high voltage operation, large size of assembly, which reduces spatial resolution and introduces wall effects, and an inability to simulate multiple cells. A new silicon microdosimeter with 3 D sensitive volumes (SVs) has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional TEPC. The new microdosimeter is called 2 ̆ 2 bridge 2 ̆ 2 microdosimeter as it has thin Si bridges between the SVs to support the Al tracks over the SVs. The charge collection study of the new device and its application for RBE determination in 12 C radiation therapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC), Japan is presented. This work presented the first RBE 10 derivation in a 12 C ion therapeutic beam using a high spatial resolution silicon microdosimeter and demonstrated a simple and fast method for Quality Assurance in charge particle therapy...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} purely {{electrostatic}} {{mechanism by which}} small, mobile, multivalent cations can induce DNA bending. A multivalent cation binds {{at the entrance to}} the B-DNA major groove, between the two phosphate strands, electrostatically repelling sodium counterions from the neighboring phosphates. The unscreened phosphates on both strands are strongly attracted to the groove-bound cation. This leads to groove closure, accompanied by DNA bending toward the cationic ligand. We explicitly treat the dynamic character of the cation-DNA interaction using an adiabatic approximation, noting that DNA bending is much slower than the diffusion of nonspecifically bound, mobile cations. We make semiquantitative estimates of the free energy components of bending-electrostatic (with a sigmoidal distance-dependent dielectric function), elastic, and entropic cation localization-and find that the equilibrium state is bent B-DNA stabilized with a self-localized cation. This is a bending polaron, formation of which should be critically dependent on the strength of electrostatic interaction and the concentration of highly mobile cations available for self-localization. We predict that the resultant bend will be large (approximately 20 - 40 degrees), smooth (because it is <b>spread</b> over 6 <b>bp),</b> and infrequent. The stability of such a bend can be variable, from transient to highly stable (static) bending, observable with standard curvature-measuring techniques. We further predict that this bending mechanism will have an unusual sequence dependence: sequences with less binding specificity will be more bent, unless the specific binding site is in the major groove...|$|R
40|$|Background: A brand’s {{reputation}} {{can take}} many years to build up, although {{the value of the}} brand is not forever. Accidents, scandals or product safety incidents associated to a certain corporation can affect a brands reputation. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 led to much information being <b>spread</b> around regarding <b>BP,</b> the company behind the accident. The environment took damage and BP endured a lot of negative publicity. Purpose: To gain knowledge about the effects on a company suffering from negative publicity and how they could proceed in order to minimize the damage. Delimitations: This study is based on the company BP and their incident in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. The investigation was done in the United States of America on American customers with a population restricted to car owners as the study examines purchase behavior. Method: The research was conducted through a deductive quantitative approach. The data sources were collected by an archival analysis and an electronic questionnaire. Conclusion: If the information received from media and from word-of-mouth after an incident (like BP’s oil spill) is considered as negative towards the company, this leads to a decrease in positive attitudes among customers that in turn affects purchase behavior negatively. It is important to implement strategies in the company as a foundation against negative publicity. The study shows that the most influencing strategies on consumer attitudes were corporate social responsibility followed by brand positioning. ...|$|R
