5|$|At about 11.00pm {{that night}} William Wainewright <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Blackburne's study at Eccles vicarage {{to write a}} brief letter to the Mayor of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|One major {{demonstration}} {{took place}} in the Shi'a island of Sitra, where several thousand men, women, and children took to the streets. According to witnesses interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights, hundreds of fully armed riot police arrived on the scene and immediately began firing tear gas and sound grenades into the crowds. They then fired rubber bullets into the unarmed crowd, aiming at people in the front line who had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the street in protest.|$|E
60|$|The couple {{therefore}} <b>sat</b> themselves <b>down</b> <b>in</b> arm-chairs and waited.|$|R

5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed {{the new wave of}} attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E
25|$|In the Bhagavata Purana, it is {{described}} that after Balarama {{took part in}} the battle causing the destruction of the remainder of the Yadu dynasty and witnessing the disappearance of Krishna, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a meditative state and departed from this world.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> {{his chair}} by the fire, and {{composed}} himself, cross-legged, over his newspaper.|$|R
60|$|Clay {{submitted}} to his treatment and then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> wearily <b>in</b> a room below {{to wait for}} news.|$|R
60|$|Dwining <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> and <b>in</b> a {{few minutes}} wrote a letter, which he handed to Sir John Ramorny.|$|R
25|$|Moscati {{died in the}} {{afternoon}} of 12 April 1927. He had attended Mass that morning, receiving Communion as he always did, and spent {{the remainder of the}} morning at the hospital. Upon returning home he busied himself with patients until around three, after which, feeling tired, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> an armchair in his office; soon after this, he died.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{transaction}} was completed, Fiala began acting like he already owned the club. He started remodeling it and hired his own bouncers. The final provocation was when Fiala moved into Gravano's private office and began breaking through an office wall. Gravano, enraged, stormed {{into the office}} followed by Garafola. Fiala was standing behind Gravano's desk. He <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Gravano's chair, smirking at the two men.|$|E
25|$|In Manchester, 300 (eye-witness Stop the War estimate) {{secondary}} school children, Further Education students and university students met at Albert Square at 12 noon. They {{marched to the}} BBC studios where they <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the road at around 1pm and blocked the traffic {{for over an hour}} where their numbers grew to around 1000 demonstrators. They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed. The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating in front of the Town Hall for some hours. The whole of this event was filmed by anti-war activists accumulating two hours of footage.|$|E
60|$|He laughed again, {{this time}} uneasily, slammed the window to, bolted it, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> his chair.|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> waiting <b>in</b> great terror till Harriet should answer.|$|R
60|$|He did not {{immediately}} answer her. He <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> the chair by her side, {{and pointed to the}} letter.|$|R
25|$|In 1939, Tucker {{organized}} a sit-in at Alexandria Library, which refused to issue library cards to black residents. On August 21, five {{young black men}} whom Tucker had recruited and instructed – William Evans, Otto L. Tucker, Edward Gaddis, Morris Murray, and Clarence Strange – entered the library one by one, requested applications for library cards and, when refused, each one took a book off the shelf and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the reading room until they were removed by the police. Tucker had instructed the men to dress well, speak politely and offer no resistance to the police so as to minimize the chance of the men being found guilty of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. Tucker defended {{the men in the}} ensuing legal actions, which resulted in the disorderly conduct charges against the protestors being dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe (who would later become a key figure in desegregating Virginia schools), and in a branch library being established for blacks.|$|E
25|$|The fourth-day of {{the battle}} was noted for the valour shown by Bhima. Bhishma {{commanded}} the Kaurava army to move on the offensive from the outset. While Abhimanyu {{was still in his}} mother's womb, Arjuna had taught Abhimanyu on how to break and enter the chakra vyuha. But, before explaining how to exit the chakra Vyuha, Arjuna was interrupted by Krishna (other story: Abhimanyu's mother falls asleep while Arjuna was explaining her). Thus from birth, Abhimanyu only knew how to enter the Chakra vyuha but didn't know how to come out of it. When the Kauravas formed the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu entered it but was surrounded and attacked by a number of Kaurava princes. Arjuna joined the fray in aid of Abhimanyu. Bhima appeared on the scene with his mace aloft and started attacking the Kauravas. Duryodhana sent a huge force of elephants at Bhima. When Bhima saw the mass of elephants approaching, he got down from his chariot and attacked them single-handedly with his iron mace. They scattered and stampeded into the Kaurava forces killing many. Duryodhana ordered an all-out attack on Bhima. Bhima withstood all that was thrown at him and attacked Duryodhana's brothers, killing eight of them. Bhima was soon struck by an arrow on the chest and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his chariot dazed.|$|E
500|$|Other couples {{refused to}} be separated. Ida Straus, the wife of Macy's {{department}} store co-owner and {{former member of the}} United States House of Representatives Isidor Straus, told her husband: [...] "We have been living together for many years. Where you go, I go." [...] They <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a pair of deck chairs and waited for the end. The industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim changed out of his life vest and sweater into top hat and evening dress and declared his wish to go down with the ship like a gentleman.|$|E
60|$|Moran {{signaled}} to the boat’s crew, and when Clay had gone they <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> the cabin with thoughtful faces.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they all}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> a large {{ring on the}} bank, and begged the mouse to begin his story.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> <b>in</b> {{the chair}} beside her, took her proffered hand, and leant over her.|$|R
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of [...] "Ice Ice Baby", record {{producer}} Suge Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Ice was eating. After shoving Ice's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of Ice, staring at him before finally asking [...] "How you doin'?" [...] Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions. Eventually, Knight showed up at Ice's hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied {{by a member of}} the Oakland Raiders. According to Ice, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the publishing rights to the song over to Knight; Knight used Ice's money to help fund Death Row Records.|$|E
500|$|After the campaign, {{it emerged}} that Agnew {{had failed to}} report three alleged {{attempts}} to bribe him, made {{on behalf of the}} slot-machine industry, involving sums of $20,000, $75,000 and $200,000, if he would promise not to veto legislation keeping the machines legal in Southern Maryland. He justified his silence on the grounds that no actual offer had been made: [...] "Nobody <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of me with a suitcase of money." [...] Agnew was also criticized over his part-ownership of land close to the site of a planned, but never-built second bridge over Chesapeake Bay. Opponents claimed a conflict of interest, since some of Agnew's partners in the venture were simultaneously involved in business deals with the county. Agnew denied any conflict or impropriety, saying that the property involved was outside Baltimore County and his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he sold his interest.|$|E

60|$|In {{answer to}} this Mr Dale did not say much. He <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> and <b>in</b> some general terms {{expressed}} his good-will towards all the Eames family.|$|R
500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Miles Away" [...] was {{performed}} during the gypsy {{segment of the}} show. Madonna wore a gypsy inspired Givenchy long cape, over a black dress, with pink colored ribbons around her neck. She also wore black stockings on her leg. Before starting the song she said, [...] "This is for all who know the struggle of long-distance relationships. I know you're out there." [...] While dancers gathered and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a circle around her, Madonna went up on a platform, started playing the acoustic guitar and encouraged the crowd to clap and sing along. The screens give another message to the song, showing a stream of world maps and passport stamps and the history as well as journey of gypsies travelling around the world, adding to the atmosphere of that particular section of the show.|$|E
500|$|The act {{occurred}} {{at the intersection of}} Phan Đình Phùng Boulevard (now Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Street) and Lê Văn Duyệt Street (now Cách Mạng Tháng Tám Street) at , a few blocks southwest of the Presidential Palace (now the Reunification Palace). Đức [...] emerged from the car along with two other monks. One placed a cushion on the road while the second opened the trunk and took out a five-gallon petrol can. As the marchers formed a circle around him, Đức calmly <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the traditional Buddhist meditative lotus position on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over Đức's head. Đức rotated a string of wooden prayer beads and recited the words [...] ("Homage to Amitābha Buddha") before striking a match and dropping it on himself. Flames consumed his robes and flesh, and black oily smoke emanated from his burning body.|$|E
500|$|Following the song's success, California rapper Mario [...] "Chocolate" [...] Johnson, an {{associate}} of record producer Suge Knight, claimed that he had helped in writing the song, and had not received credit or royalties. Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Van Winkle was eating. After shoving Van Winkle's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of Van Winkle, staring at him before finally asking [...] "How you doin'?" [...] Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions before Knight showed up at Van Winkle's suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by Johnson {{and a member of}} the Los Angeles Raiders. According to Van Winkle, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw Van Winkle off unless he signed the rights to the song over to Knight. In 2012, Mario [...] "Chocolate" [...] Johnson told to LA Weekly that this story is false.|$|E
