The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance of two experimental heptanoic acid based teat dips vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid teat dips KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing teat dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage.

40|$|The {{effect of}} solvent-conditioning on the {{sorption}} of diuron and phenanthrene was investigated. The organic carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (K(OC)) for diuron and phenanthrene (determined from single initial concentrations of 0. 8 mgL(- 1) and 1. 5 mgL(- 1), respectively) were consistently higher following solvent-conditioning {{of a whole}} soil with five organic solvents (acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, chloroform and dichloromethane). The relative increase in K(OC) was inversely related to the polarity of the <b>conditioning</b> <b>solvent</b> (i. e. greater increases in K(OC) were observed for the least polar solvents: chloroform and dichloromethane). The effect of solvent-conditioning on the sorption properties of the same soil that had been lipid-extracted using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) was also investigated. Since lipid extraction involves treatment with a non-polar solvent (95 : 5 dichloromethane:methanol) one may have expected no further increase in K(OC) on solvent-conditioning. On the contrary, the lipid-extracted soil exhibited very similar increases in K(OC) as the whole soil. This demonstrated that lipid removal and solvent-conditioning, which both increased K(OC) for this soil, are quite separate phenomena. Ahmad Gholamalizadeh Ahangar, Ronald J. Smernik, Rai S.

50|$|At highest {{concentrations}} (50-70%) {{applied for}} 3 to 8 minutes {{under the supervision}} of a physician, glycolic acid promotes slitting between the cells and can be used to treat acne or photo-damaged skin (e.g. due to mottled dyspigmentation, melasma). The benefit of such short-contact application (chemical peels) depends on the pH of the solution (the more acidic the product, or the lower the pH, the more pronounced the results), the concentration of GA (higher concentrations produce more vigorous response), the length of application and prior <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> such as prior use of topical vitamin A products. Although single application of 50-70% GA will produce beneficial results, multiple treatments every 2 to 4 weeks are required for optimal results.

The comprehensive and thoroughly up-to-date handbook presents the sources, identification, analysis, biosynthesis, biotechnology and applications of important polysaccharides likes starches, cellulose, chitin, gum and microbial polysaccharides. Polysaccharides can exhibit complex structure and various functional activities. These bio macromolecules can therefore serve as raw materials for various different materials, e. g. rayon, cellulose acetate, celluloid and nitrocellulose; and they find multiple applications, for instance as surgical threads (chitin), as sources of energy, dietary fibers, as blood flow adjuvants, in cosmetics, emulsion stabilizers, film formers, binders, viscosity increasing agents or <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> agenta, as food additives in gums, chewing gum bases and as vaccines. Polysaccharides form the basis for useful products, like xanthan gum, dextran, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and pullulan.

In this study, the feasibility of using microporous carbon spheres for the extraction of selected nitrosamines from water samples using solid phase membrane tip extraction (SPMTE) technique was investigated. Two types of adsorbents namely non-activated carbon spheres (NCS) and chemically activated microporous carbon spheres (MCS) were hydrothermally synthesized from sucrose. The prepared adsorbents were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nitrogen adsorption analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both adsorbents were spherical in shape as indicated by SEM. The FTIR spectra showed that the NCS and MCS have various surface functional groups such as OH, C=C and C-H which act as active sites. The surface areas of NCS and MCS are 7. 88 and 308. 10 m 2 /g, respectively as obtained from nitrogen adsorption analysis. The two prepared materials and a commercial activated carbon (granular activated carbon, GAC) were used in SPMTE to extract the selected nitrosamines namely Nnitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA) from tap water and lake water matrices. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used for quantitative analysis of the target analytes in the extracts. The optimized SPMTE conditions were <b>conditioning</b> <b>solvent,</b> extraction time, salt addition, pH, desorption solvent, desorption time and sample volume.

The data indicated that <b>skin</b> conductance response <b>conditioning</b> did not occur for the shock groups or for the no-shock group.

40|$|In {{the current}} review article it is {{suggested}} that fear is a central emotional state that can be activated by external threat cues. The subcortical defensive system cannot only be activated by intrinsically aversive events but shows also strong plasticity enabling previously innocuous stimuli to get access to the fear system after they were paired with painful outcomes. On the other hand, aversive conditioning does not only result in the acquisition of a defensive disposition, the organism also learns on a pure cognitive level that one stimulus predicts the occurrence of another stimulus. It is suggested here that potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex is a rather specific measure for fear acquisition, while skin conductance discrimination indexes contingency learning. It is shown that the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle does not require cortical processing of the conditioned stimulus. Moreover, data indicate that conditioned startle potentiation is abolished in patients with unilateral lesions of the amygdala. Finally, conditioned startle potentiation can be obtained without contingency awareness, which on the other hand is necessary for <b>skin</b> conductance <b>conditioning</b> to occur. It is suggested that the learning of stimulus relations is mediated by the hippocampus and that conditioned startle potentiation is also mediated by the hippocampus in trace conditioning...|$|R

In most cases, conditioning and storing at 1 °C maintained ripe fruit quality for up to 20 - 25 d, but longer storage resulted in <b>skin</b> damage. <b>Conditioning</b> then holding at 1 - 5 °C for 30 d showed that 2 °C storage resulted in negligible skin damage and the best balance between minimal flesh diseases and disorders. Also, storing conditioned fruit for 30 d at 2 °C resulted in similar severity of flesh diseases and disorders as non-stored fruit, and significantly less than with 5 °C. Skin appearance was similar with 2 and 5 °C storage. After 40 d, flesh defects were significantly less with 2 °C than with 5 °C, and with acceptable skin spotting and discrete patches severity. These results suggest that conditioned ‘Hass’ fruit can be cold-stored at 2 °C for up to 40 d and perhaps reduce dependence on controlled atmosphere systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the extensive evidence in animals, we previously showed that disrupting reconsolidation by noradrenergic blockade produced amnesia for the original fear response in humans. Interestingly, the declarative memory for the fear association remained intact. These results asked for a solid replication. Moreover, given the constructive nature of memories, the intact recollection of the fear association could eventually ‘rebuild’ the fear memory, resulting in the spontaneous recovery of the fear response. Yet, perseverance of the amnesic effects would have substantial clinical implications, as even the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders display high percentages of relapse. Using a differential fear conditioning procedure in humans, we replicated our previous findings by showing that administering propranolol (40 mg) prior to memory reactivation eliminated the startle fear response 24 h later. But most importantly, this effect persisted at one month follow-up. Notably, the propranolol manipulation not only left the declarative memory for the acquired contingency untouched, but also skin conductance discrimination. In addition, a close association between declarative knowledge and skin conductance responses was found. These findings {{are in line with}} the supposed double dissociation of fear conditioning and declarative knowledge relative to the amygdala and hippocampus in humans. They support the view that <b>skin</b> conductance <b>conditioning</b> primarily reflects contingency learning, whereas the startle response is a rather specific measure of fear. Furthermore, the results indicate the absence of a causal link between the actual knowledge of a fear association and its fear response, even though they often operate in parallel. Interventions targeting the amygdalar fear memory may be essential in specifically and persistently dampening the emotional impact of fear. From a clinical and ethical perspective, disrupting reconsolidation points to promising interventions persistently erasing fear responses from trauma memory without affecting the actual recollection...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{consisted of}} testing surface treatment processes for stainless steel and aluminum {{for the purpose}} of suppressing electron emission over large surface areas to improve the pulsed high voltage hold-off capabilities of these metals. Improvements to hold-off would be beneficial to the operation of the vacuum-insulator grading rings and final self-magnetically insulated transmission line on the ZR-upgrade machine and other pulsed power applications such as flash radiograph and pulsed-microwave machines. The treatments tested for stainless steel include the Z-protocol (chemical polish, HVFF, and gold coating), pulsed E-beam surface treatments by IHCE, Russia, and chromium oxide coatings. Treatments for aluminum were anodized and polymer coatings. Breakdown thresholds also were measured for a range of surface finishes and gap distances. The study found that: (1.) Electrical <b>conditioning</b> and <b>solvent</b> cleaning in a filtered air environment each improve HV hold-off 30 %. (2.) Anodized coatings on aluminum give a factor of two improvement in high voltage hold-off. However, anodized aluminum loses this improvement when the damage is severe. Chromium oxide coatings on stainless steel give a 40 % and 20 % improvement in hold-off before and after damage from many arcs. (3.) Bare aluminum gives similar hold-off for surface roughness, R{sub a}, ranging from 0. 08 to 3. 2 {micro}m. (4.) The various EBEST surfaces tested give high voltage hold-off a factor of two better than typical machined and similar to R{sub a} = 0. 05 {micro}m polished stainless steel surfaces. (5.) For gaps > 2 mm the hold-off voltage increases as the square root of the gap for bare metal surfaces. This is inconsistent with the accepted model for metals that involves E-field induced electron emission from dielectric inclusions. Micro-particles accelerated across the gap during the voltage pulse give the observed voltage dependence. However the similarity in observed breakdown times for large and small gaps places a requirement that the particles be of molecular size. This makes accelerated micro-particle induced breakdown seem improbable also...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{studies of the}} effect of {{temperature}} step-change (between a cool and a neutral environment) on human thermal sensation and skin temperature. Experiments with three temperature conditions were carried out in a climate chamber during the period in winter. Twelve subjects participated in the experiments simulating moving inside and outside of rooms or cabins with air <b>conditioning.</b> <b>Skin</b> temperatures and thermal sensation were recorded. Results showed overshoot and asymmetry of TSV due to the step-change. Skin temperature changed immediately when subjects entered a new environment. When moving into a neutral environment from cool, dynamic thermal sensation was in the thermal comfort zone and overshoot was not obvious. Air-conditioning in a transitional area should be considered to limit temperature difference to not more than 5 °C to decrease the unacceptability of temperature step-change. The linear relationship between thermal sensation and skin temperature or gradient of skin temperature does not apply in a step-change environment. There is a significant linear correlation between TSV and Qloss in the transient environment. Heat loss from the human skin surface can be used to predict dynamic thermal sensation instead of the heat transfer of the whole human body...|$|R
40|$|Sorption of {{non-ionic}} {{organic compounds}} to organic matter is usually {{characterized as a}} partitioning interaction, which is quantified by K [subscript]oc, the organic-C normalized partitioning coefficient. However K [subscript]oc for any single compound varies considerably between soils, often {{by a factor of}} 3 - 10. This study addresses some of the potential causes of this variability. Forty-four soil cores were collected from a 2 ha paddock. Ten of these cores were selected for sorption measurements. The chemical composition of the soil organic matter (SOM) was determined using ¹³C NMR analysis. It was found that K [subscript]oc for diuron was positively correlated with aryl C (r² = 0. 59) and negatively correlated with O-alkyl C (r² = 0. 84). There were no such correlations for phenanthrene K [subscript]oc. A second set of experiments was carried out to investigate the effects of SOM– mineral interactions on the sorption properties of a selection of the soils. It was found that HF-treatment increased K [subscript]oc for both phenanthrene and diuron. The HF treatment removes mineral matter leaving the organic phase unaffected by the treatment. The increase in K [subscript]oc on HF-treatment soils provides strong evidence that interactions between organic matter and soil minerals block organic matter sorption sites. Furthermore, following HF-treatment, there was a positive correlation between K [subscript]oc for phenanthrene and aryl C and carbonyl C and a negative correlation with O-alkyl C. This suggests that the non-constancy of the relationship between organic matter chemistry and K [subscript]oc, for whole soils in the case of phenanthrene, may be a consequence of variability of the effect of organic matter-mineral interactions on K [subscript]oc. The influence of lipids on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene to soils was also investigated. Lipids are known to cover the surfaces of organic matter in soil. K [subscript]oc for diuron and phenanthrene were consistently higher for the lipid-extracted soils than for the whole soils (average of 31 % for diuron and 29 % for phenanthrene), indicating that lipids block sorption sites on the organic matter. Sorption experiments on one pair of HF-treated soils indicated that the blocking effects of minerals and lipids are independent, because lipid extraction and HF-treatment combined increased K [subscript]oc by more than either treatment alone. In the last experiment, the effect of <b>solvent</b> <b>conditioning</b> on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene was investigated. The K [subscript]oc values for compounds were consistently higher for solvent-treated whole soil and lipid-extracted soil than corresponding soils before solvent treatment. Solid-state ¹³C NMR spectra of the solvent-treated soils indicated that there were no significant changes in the chemical structure of SOM caused by solvent treatment. Solvent treatment changes the physical conformation of the SOM, increasing its sorption affinity. The key findings from the research are: •	Variations in sorption affinity for diuron are related to differences in the soil organic matter chemistry. •	SOM-mineral interactions can have a substantial influence on K [subscript]oc for non- ionic compounds. •	Lipids may block the active sorption sites on the SOM thereby diminishing sorption overall. •	<b>Solvent</b> <b>conditioning</b> can change the physical conformation of SOM and lead to enhancement sorption of diuron and phenanthrene.

40|$|This work {{describes}} for {{the first}} time the application of portable micro-solid phase extraction (μ-SPE) for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this technique, a battery-operated electric whisk stirrer combined with a μ-SPE device was employed to provide agitation of the sample solution and facilitate the pre-concentration of the target analytes. The μ-SPE device consisted of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) packed in a polypropylene (PP) membrane. The performance of μ-SPE sampling coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) was evaluated for the analysis of five target PAHs (fluorene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene) in water. Important μ-SPE parameters were studied and the optimal extraction conditions were 30 min extraction time, 10 min desorption time, isopropanol as the <b>conditioning</b> and desorption <b>solvent</b> and no addition of a salt. The developed portable μ-SPE method provided good linearity in the concentration range of 0. 1 - 100 μg L- 1 for fluorene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene, and 1 - 100 μg L- 1 for benzo[a]pyrene, with good coefficients of determination (r 2, 0. 9975 - 0. 9989), low limits of detection (0. 01 - 0. 59 μg L- 1), acceptable intra-day precisions (3. 5 - 6. 2 % for on-site analysis) and acceptable relative recoveries (77. 3 - 107. 2 %). Portable μ-SPE combined with HPLC-UV was successfully applied to the determination of target PAHs in selected water samples. The proposed sample preparation technique proved to be simple, cost effective, easy-to-operate and feasible for both off-site and on-site analyses...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP) {{and long-term}} depression (LTD) of synaptic strength are ubiquitous mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, but their functional relevance in humans remains obscure. Here {{we report that}} a long-term increase in perceived pain to electrical test stimuli was induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) (5 � 1 sec at 100 Hz) of peptidergic cutaneous afferents (27 % above baseline, undiminished for � 3 hr). In contrast, a long-term decrease in perceived pain (27 % below baseline, undiminished for 1 hr) was induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) (17 min at 1 Hz). Pain testing with punctate mechanical probes (200 �m diameter) in skin adjacent to the HFS–LFS <b>conditioning</b> <b>skin</b> site revealed a marked twofold to threefold increase in pain sensitivity (secondary hyperalgesia, undiminished for � 3 hr) after HFS but also a moderate secondary hyperalgesia (30 % above baseline) after strong LFS. Additionally, HFS but not LFS caused pain to light tactile stimuli in adjacent skin (allodynia). In summary, HFS and LFS stimulus protocols that induce LTP or LTD in spinal nociceptive pathways in animal experiments led to similar LTP- and LTD-like changes in human pain perception (long-term hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia) mediated by the conditioned pathway. Additionally, secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia in adjacent skin induced by the HFS protocol and, to a minor extent, also by the LFS protocol, suggested that these perceptual changes encompassed an LTP-like heterosynaptic facilitation of adjacent nociceptive pathways by a hitherto unknown mechanism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPosttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is a frequent}} anxiety disorder with higher prevalence rates in female patients than in male patients (2. 5 : 1). Association with a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs 2267735) in the gene ADCYAP 1 R 1 encoding the type I receptor (PAC 1 -R) of the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide has been reported with PTSD in female patients. We sought to identify the neural correlates of the described PAC 1 -R effects on associative learning. MethodsIn a reverse genetic approach, we examined two independent healthy samples (N 1 = 112, N 2 = 73) using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} during cued and contextual fear <b>conditioning.</b> <b>Skin</b> conductance responses and verbal self-reports of arousal, valence, and contingency were recorded. ResultsWe found that PAC 1 -R modulates the blood oxygenation level–dependent response of the hippocampus. Specifically, we observed decreased hippocampal activity during contextual, but not during cued, fear conditioning in female participants carrying the PAC 1 -R risk allele. We observed no significant differences in conditionability for skin conductance responses, verbal reports, or activation in other brain regions between the genotype groups in female participants. ConclusionsOur results suggest that impaired contextual conditioning in the hippocampal formation may mediate the association between PAC 1 -R and PTSD symptoms. Our findings potentially identify a missing link between the involvement of PAC 1 -R in PTSD and the well-established structural and functional hippocampal deficits in these patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} fear generalization in humans is determined by the amount of fear intensity in nonconditioned stimuli relative to a perceptually similar conditioned stimulus. Stimuli consisted of graded emotionally expressive faces of the same identity morphed between neutral and fearful endpoints. Two experimental groups underwent discriminative fear conditioning between a face stimulus of 55 % fear intensity (conditioned stimulus, CS+), reinforced with an electric shock, and a second stimulus that was unreinforced (CS−). In Experiment 1 the CS− was a relatively neutral face stimulus, while in Experiment 2 the CS− was the most fear-intense stimulus. Before and following fear <b>conditioning,</b> <b>skin</b> conductance responses (SCR) were recorded to different morph values along the neutral-to-fear dimension. Both experimental groups showed gradients of generalization following fear conditioning that increased with the fear intensity of the stimulus. In Experiment 1 a peak shift in SCRs extended to the most fear-intense stimulus. In contrast, generalization to the most fear-intense stimulus was reduced in Experiment 2, suggesting that discriminative fear learning procedures can attenuate fear generalization. Together, the findings indicate that fear generalization is broadly tuned and sensitive to the amount of fear intensity in nonconditioned stimuli, but that fear generalization can come under stimulus control. These results reveal a novel form of fear generalization in humans that is not merely based on physical similarity to a conditioned exemplar, and may have implications for understanding generalization processes in anxiety disorders characterized by heightened sensitivity to nonthreatening stimuli...|$|R
