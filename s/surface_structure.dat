5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the <b>surface</b> <b>structure</b> of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E

40|$|Creation of {{patterns}} and <b>structures</b> on <b>surfaces</b> at the micro- and nano-scale {{is a field}} of growing interest. Direct femtosecond laser <b>surface</b> <b>structuring</b> with a Gaussian-like beam intensity profile has already distinguished itself as a versatile method to fabricate <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> on metals and semiconductors. Here we present an approach for direct femtosecond laser <b>surface</b> <b>structuring</b> based on optical vortex beams with different spatial distributions {{of the state of}} polarization, which are easily generated by means of a q-plate. The different states of an optical vortex beam carrying an orbital angular momentum ℓ = ± 1 are used to demonstrate the fabrication of various regular surface patterns on silicon. The spatial features of the regular rippled and grooved <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> are correlated with the state of polarization of the optical vortex beam. Moreover, scattered surface wave theory approach is used to rationalize the dependence of the <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> on the local state of the laser beam characteristics (polarization and fluence). The present approach can be further extended to fabricate even more complex and unconventional <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> by exploiting the possibilities offered by femtosecond optical vector fields...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{structural}} phenomena {{on the ice}} sheet, the structures with the dimensions of (10) ^ 1 -(10) ^ 4 m are called here "surface structures". The data of the <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> obtained in Mizuro Plateau up to date were compiled and refined. The <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> were classified into five major groups, according to their physical characteristics, A) flat surface, B) undulation (isolated), C) undulation (grouped), D) crevasse and crack, E) moraine and muddy band. These structures are made mostly by deformation of ice caused by movement of an ice sheet. Thus {{the distribution of the}} <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> would be a reflection of stress condition of the ice sheet; stress condition is controlled by ice thickness, flow velocity and bedrock topography. Referring to steepness and frequency of <b>surface</b> <b>structures,</b> Mizuho Plateau was divided into four subdivisional regions, coastal region, transitional region, inland region and mountainous region. The <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> in the coastal region and in the vicinity of exposed land are steeper and more frequent than those of inland. Such variation of the feature of the <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> is well explained by the distribution of the above-mentioned three factors which control the stress condition of the ice sheet.

Nanocolliods are used as an etch mask by spreading them along the material surface, and then ion beam bombardment or film evaporation is used to etch away around the nanocolliods, creating nanocolumns and nanopits, respectively. The final <b>surface</b> <b>structure</b> can be controlled by varying the area covered by colloids and the colloid size. The area covered by the colloids can be changed by modifying the ionic strength of the colloid solution. This technique is able to create large patterned surface areas, which is necessary for tissue engineering applications.|$|E

40|$|We {{have found}} that various ordered mixed <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> are formed by {{coadsorption}} of two dissimilar metal atoms on Cu(001) at room temperature, using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) I-V analysis. As coadsorbates, we employed Mg, Bi, Li and K, and <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> formed by the coadsorption systems of (Mg, Li), (Mg, K) and (Mg, Bi) are presented. A tensor LEED analysis provided detailed geometries of the coadsorbates and the substrate surface. It {{was found that the}} <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> in the above three coadsorption systems exhibit the restructuring of the Cu(001) surface. The phase separation into individual adsorbates does not take place, implying that some additional stabilization arises. We demonstrate two origins for the stabilization of the ordered mixed <b>surface</b> <b>structures</b> on Cu(001). Structures and features formed by the individual adsorption of Mg, Bi, Li and K atoms on Cu(001) are described first, then those of (2 root 2 x root 2) R 45 degrees-Mg,Li, (root 5 x root 5) R 26. 7 degrees-Mg,K, c(2 x 2) -Mg,Bi, and c(6 x 4) -Mg,Bi structures formed by the coadsorption are presented.
