40|$|The {{increasing}} concentration of CO 2 and other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) {{in the atmosphere}} warms up the earth's surface and causes drastic changes to the climate. Therefore, reducing energy consumption {{in order to reduce}} GHGs emission from the manufactures become urgent, especially in developing new industries such as Slow Release Fertilizer (SRF) urea plant. In this work, mixing in an orbiting <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> designed for solid-solid mixing was investigated. Mixing was carried out using urea powder and natural zeolite powder by varying three particle sizes i. e. groups of > 50 mesh, > 60 mesh and > 80 mesh. Mixing process was conducted to examine the influence of orbital and rotation speeds combined with air injection, as well as the particle size of urea-natural zeolite to the specific energy consumption. Achieving a good homogeneity of mixture with a shorter mixing time, thus, power and energy consumption, was one goal of this work. The power consumption was calculated from measured torque of orbital and screw obtained by computerized record. Specific energy consumption was calculated by total power with time tied the homogeneity of the mixture for each particle size group. Experimental results showed that the higher of the orbital and rotation speed, the higher energy consumption. It can be seen that power consumption was dominated by rotation motion of the screw. Smaller particle size required higher power for mixing process due to their cohesiveness. Mixing process used a modified orbiting <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> with air injection showed lower power consumption for each particle size group compared with that of no air injection. This paper also developed a derivation of the power equation model of mixing in the orbiting <b>screw</b> <b>mixer.</b> The influence of speed of mixer in an orbiting <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> on the power consumption can be expressed by the Power Number. ...|$|E
40|$|Granular mixing has a {{significant}} influence on the resulting products {{in a variety of}} industries, such as pharmaceutical production, food processing, and energy generation. Most commonly, granular mixing processes seek a high degree of homogeneity, and in some particular instances, the purpose is to influence simultaneous processing, such as chemical reactions and heat and/or mass transfer rates. Granular mixing is a complex process because it exhibits multiple rheological differences, many times simultaneously within the same granular bed. A fundamental problem commonly encountered during the mixing of granular materials is the tendency for mixtures to segregate due to differences in particle size, shape, and/or density. While significant effort has been made to improve the granular mixing process, the vast majority of granular mixing research efforts have focused on relatively simple mixer geometries and idealized granular materials compared to what is actually used in industrial practice. For example, the renewable energy industry, or more specifically the biomass thermochemical conversion sector, relies on double screw pyrolyzers to convert cellulosic biomass into bio-oil. Currently, there is a large amount of research that relates the feedstocks being used to the bio-oil yields; however, minimal research efforts have been directed toward studying the granular mixing dynamics inside the double screw pyrolyzer due to the opaque nature of the reactor and the granular flow itself. The overall goal of this project is to thoroughly understand, characterize, and optimize the granular mixing of low density red oak chips and high density glass beads within a double <b>screw</b> <b>mixer,</b> which geometrically replicates screw pyrolyzers, under various operating conditions. Moreover, it aims to provide an improved understanding of the biomass and heat carrier media granular mixing dynamics inside the screw pyrolyzer. The increased mixing effectiveness and insight gained through this project will lead to increased heat transfer rates and could enhance product yield and/or quality; thereby improving the economic viability of a screw pyrolyzer. Throughout this project, a number of different visualization and quantification techniques have been developed and used to evaluate the mixing effectiveness of red oak chips and glass beads inside a <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> that was designed and constructed specifically for granular mixing studies. Four parameters were initially investigated: (i) screw rotation speed, (ii) dimensionless screw pitch, (iii) screw rotation orientation, and (iv) material injection configuration. After identifying the influence that these parameters had on the mixing effectiveness, the effect of the dimensionless mixing length was also investigated. Advanced optical visualization methods were first developed by capturing, and then spatially aligning and temporally syncing four independent projections of the <b>screw</b> <b>mixer.</b> Next, an improved granular sampling procedure which satisfies the two 2 ̆ 2 golden rules of sampling 2 ̆ 2 was developed. Composition analysis of the samples was then coupled to analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical methods to qualitatively assess the spatial heterogeneity of the granular mixing process. Together, the qualitative optical visualization and quantitative composition and statistical analysis lead to the optimization of the <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s operating conditions. For the range of parameters that were studied, these conditions were determined to be a screw rotation speed of ω = 60 rpm, a dimensionless screw pitch of p/D = 1. 75, a counter-rotating down-pumping screw rotation orientation (CtrR DP), and a material injection configuration with the red oak chips and glass beads injected into port one and two (RO 1, GB 2), respectively. Studies which investigated the mixing effectiveness of the <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> {{as a function of the}} dimensionless mixing length also indicated that this operating condition lead to the most homogeneous mixture at each of the tested dimensionless mixing lengths. An improved cone-beam compensated back-projection algorithm enabling X-ray particle tracking velocimetry (XPTV) of the <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> was then developed to visualize and quantify the 3 D granular flow structures inside the <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> under various operating condition using 2 ̆ 2 modified 2 ̆ 2 red oak chip tracer particles. It was shown that these improved XPTV methods provided {{a significant}} reduction in error associated with the tracer particle 2 ̆ 7 s position. The influence of the aforementioned four factors on the granular flow structures inside the <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> were investigated using XPTV, and similar results in terms of the desired operating conditions to those from the previous studies were noted. Moreover, the counter-rotating down-pumping screw rotation orientation, which was found to be the most influential factor using the composition and statistical analysis methods, was also shown to increase the material residence time, resulting in a longer mixing time. A number of different methods were developed and used to characterize the granular mixing process inside the <b>screw</b> <b>mixer.</b> While each of the methods provided a different view on mixing behavior, the studies converged on a single double <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> operating condition, leading to a conclusive mixing effectiveness optimization...|$|E

40|$|Granular mixing {{processes}} {{are important to}} many industries including the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and biotechnology industries. These processes often require both {{a high degree of}} homogeneity and a high degree of customizability. As granular mixing {{processes are}} so widely employed, a thorough understanding of the mixing dynamics is necessary to understand and control the resulting products. Research into granular mixing processes has been, thus far, largely focused on laboratory scale mixers with simple geometries, while actual industrial processes often require large mixers with complex geometries. Moreover, granular mixing processes are often very sensitive to changes in operating conditions and any solutions provided to deal with specific mixing problems are highly system-sensitive and do not readily carry over to other mixer types. These sensitivities mean it is necessary to study more complicated mixer geometries, more complicated operating condition, and industry scale mixers in order to apply experimental and theoretical knowledge of granular mixing to industrial processes. One specific example of a complicated industrial mixer is a double screw pyrolyzer used in the bioenergy industry to produce bio-oil via fast pyrolysis. Bio-oil can be converted into synthetic gasoline, diesel, and other transportation fuels, or can be converted into biobased chemicals {{for a wide range of}} purposes. Double screw pyrolyzers utilize a granular mixing process by mechanically conveying and mixing a biomass and heat carrier media together using two intermeshing screws. Fast pyrolysis is still a relatively new technology and much of the research that has been done with double screw pyrolyzers has focused on the products and not on the mixing dynamics within the mixer. However, understanding the xxv mixing dynamics is important because bio-oil yields are dependent on the heat transfer between the heat carrier and the biomass. Improving the mixing effectiveness within the pyrolyzer will improve the heat transfer rates, and thus, will improve the bio-oil yields. The purpose of this project is to expand upon previous work done with double <b>screw</b> <b>mixers,</b> designed to geometrically replicate double screw pyrolyzers, by investigating the effects of various operating conditions and by developing, characterizing, and optimizing larger double <b>screw</b> <b>mixers.</b> Select operating conditions featuring changes in screw rotation speed, dimensionless screw pitch, and screw rotation orientation, previously investigated by Kingston and Heindel (2014 b, c), were repeated while varying additional operating conditions such as material injection configuration, mass flow rate ratio, particle size and density, and mixer scale. Insights gained though this study hope to improve the viability of double screw pyrolyzers by increasing the mixing effectiveness through adjustments to operating conditions, and by bridging the gap between laboratory scale mixers and industry scale mixers...|$|R

Recent work has used X-ray particle tracking velocimetry (XPTV) to characterize the threedimensional (3 D) granular flow structures in a double <b>screw</b> <b>mixer.</b> However, visualizing the experimental 3 D data can be challenging. This study uses virtual reality to allow a user to “walk through” the intermeshing screws of a simulated double screw mixing process and watch individual particles as they travel through the mixer.

The mixing index profile in the axial direction shows a mixing-demixing-mixing oscillation pattern. Increasing screw pitch length is detrimental to mixing performance; decreasing the solid particle feed rate reduces the mixing degree; and increasing the biomass to glass bead size ratio decreases mixing performance.

Determination of total and acceptable forms (on 0. 2 M solution of Trilon B) of phosphorus (P 2 O 5 tot., P 2 O 5 wat.) was performed widely in the analysis of phosphate ores by differential method on photo colour meter PCM- 3 (made in Russia, l = 440 nm) as phosphorus-vanadium-molybdenum complex. This method is based on measuring the light transmission of yellow phosphorus-vanadium-molybdenum complex relative to the reference solution containing a certain amount of phosphates. The method allows analyzing the products with a relative error of determining ± 1 %. The activation rate (Ka) was defined by relation acceptable P 2 O 5 form to total P 2 O 5 form. Decarbonization degree (Kd) was determined by changing C 02 in the phosphate rock and final product. pH of ammonium salts solution and final products were defined after their agitation in 10 % distiller water suspension. Further suspension obtained was measured by potentiometric method on ionomer I- 130 M (made in Russia) with electrode system of electrodes ESL 63 - 07, EVL- 1 M 3. 1. Place and Duration of Study: The laboratory of phosphate fertilizers of the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry under Academy Science of the Republic of Uzbekistan, from July to August in 2016. Methodology: Model laboratory device that obtains fertilizers consists of five-liter <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> made from stainless steel 12 X 18 H 10 T equipped with stirrer, moved by electric motor. The laboratorial experiment is done in the following way: in the beginning measured sample of phosphorite was charged in <b>screw</b> <b>mixer</b> and then it was fed to 2, 5, 10 and 20 % of ammonia solutions at different ratios proportions of mineral fertilizers (MF) and phosphorite powder (PHP), for 30 min with vigorous stirring components. Products obtained from interaction of components were analyzed for nitrogen content and different forms of phosphorus. The weight ratio of MF:PHP was in the range from 1 : 1 to 1 : 10. After completing activation process for 30 minute, wet products were dried in muffle oven at 90 °C until dry condition. Results: The chemical compositions of final products were determined during the experiment. Based on chemical activation of low-grade phosphorite fertilizers containing high acceptable form of phosphorus (v) oxide (P 2 O 5) can be obtained. It had been found that degree of activation (Ka) of phosphorite powder depends {{on the nature of the}} ammonium solution and the pH of the medium. Ammonium sulphate is more acidic than ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, and ammonium chloride. The pH of ammonium sulphate (10 % of its solution) is 3. 80. The decarbonization degree (Kd) of the fertilizers obtained from ammonium sulphate is in a range from 6. 33 to 35. 39 %, which is higher than for other types. Therefore, there had been obtained the fertilizers containing high acceptable form of phosphorus (v) oxide in a range 35. 30 – 59. 07 %. It was revealed that the more phosphate raw is used for activation process, the less is acceptable P 2 O 5 in fertilizers obtained. Moreover, the fertilizers have high content of nitrogen, depending on the type of ammonium salts used, in a range 1. 06 – 17. 33 % in the composition.

We analyse the effect of gas flow on the flow behaviour of cohesionless particles in FT 4 both experimentally and by numerical simulations using the combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results show that the effect of gas flow on the flow energy could be described by the resultant fluid-induced drag on the particles above the blade position as the impeller penetrates the bed. The strain rate in front of the blade is mainly determined by the impeller tip speed, and is not sensitive to the gas flow and particle size. The flow energy correlates well with the shear stress in front of the blade. They both increase with the strain rate and are significantly reduced by the upward gas flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the feasibility of direct melt-blending (intercalation) montmorillonite nanoclay to polyhydroxybutyrate along with vinyl acetate, at different weight percentages, to enhance plasticization using typical plastic processing equipment and typical processing methodology. The purpose was to determine and compare the specific mechanical properties of tensile strength and flexural strength developed as a result from this processing. Single screw and twin <b>screw</b> extrusion, Banbury <b>mixer</b> compounding, and compression molding were used to intercalate montmorillonite, and for sample preparation purposes, to test tensile and flexural strength of the resultant polymer clay nanocomposites (PCN). Results indicate Polyhydroxybutyrate and Ethylene vinyl acetate, and weight percentages of 70 %, 65 % and 60 % PHB, and 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % of EVA, respectively, influenced mechanical properties. The resultant materials remained in a mostly amorphous state. The nanoclay, at specific weight percentage of 10 %, acted as an antimicrobial and preservative for the materials produced during the research. The intention of the research was to promote knowledge and understanding concerning these materials and processes so technology transfer regarding the use, mechanical properties, manufacture, and process ability of these bio-friendly materials to academia, industry, and society can occur.

40|$|A {{continuous}} mix {{pilot plant}} was constructed at Aerojet Propulsion Division in Sacramento, California {{to develop a}} robust propellant mixing process for the full scale plant {{that was to be}} built at the NASA Advanced Solid Rocket Motor facility Yellow Creek, Mississippi. The plant was used to conduct dozens of subsystem and full system mixing tests for evaluation of equipment, processing methods, and control schemes for later use at the production plant. As a culmination to this work, a series of designed experiments were conducted using an eight run Taguchi analysis with four factors at two levels each to determine the primary effect of processing parameters on propellant ballistic and mechanical properties. The factors examined in these runs included the propellant production rate (454 (1000) and 622 kg/hr (1371 Ib/hr)), the product temperature out of the mixer (49 (120) and 63 deg C (145 deg F)), <b>mixer</b> <b>screw</b> speed (75 and 90 rpm), and the deaerator excess capacity (20 and 80 percent). Measured response variables included the uncured and cured density, Crawford Bomb liquid strand burning rates, and selected mechanical properties. The experiment revealed that several of the response variables displayed significant changes from run-to-run with the product temperature being the single most important factor. After concluding this experiment, a twenty-six hour confirmation run was conducted to verify the conclusions reached in the designed experiment. The extended run produced over 12, 250 kgs (27, 000 lbs) of propellant meeting all of the pre-run targeted properties including density (1. 803 g/cc (0. 065 lb/in(exp 3)) with a 0. 12 percent coefficient of variation (CV) at 25 deg C (77 deg F)), liquid strand burn rate (0. 889 cm/s (0. 350 in/s) with a 0. 69 percent CV at 4210 KPa (610 psig), 15. 6 deg C (60 deg F)), nominal maximum stress (828 KPa (120 psig) with a 2. 84 percent CV, S&E at 25 deg C (77 deg F), 5. 08 cm/min (2 in/min)), strain at nominal maximum (47. 4 percent with a 3. 96 percent CV), and initial tangent modulus (5349 KPa (775 psig) with a 7. 26 percent CV) ...|$|R

30|$|Selection of {{reactors}} {{is important}} to control {{the quality and quantity}} of final products. At initial research stage, batch reaction is obviously the best choice in terms of easy processing and easy control. After the full understanding of reaction mechanism and proof of high-quality nanocrystal production ability, a continuous process will be more preferable for higher production rate and real industrial production. Large-scale production of semiconductor nanocrystal by a continuous flow reactor has been demonstrated by scientists from Japan [46]. The reaction recipe followed the previous batch synthesis using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) as the capping organic ligand and the high temperature reaction solvent [47 – 50]. The continuous flow reactor is composed of tanks of two starting liquids (ligand TOPO and Cd/Se stock solution, respectively), two feeding pumps, two feeding pipes, one reactor, one heating zone, one condenser, and a collecting glass bottle. The reactor is made of stainless steel and is equipped with a static <b>mixer</b> (<b>screw)</b> for enhancing the mixing of the starting liquids. Starting from the feed pump, the starting liquids (TOPO and the Cd/Se stock solution) went through the feed pipes for preheating before they were continuously fed into the reactor from the feed pumps and pipes. The heating zone is equipped with stainless steel pipes for desired reaction time and temperature. The product was cooled to 70 – 80  °C (above the melting point of TOPO) by the condenser and finally collected in the collecting glass bottle. In the whole reaction process, dry argon was used to maintain the inside atmosphere. To obtain a high-quality CdSe nanocrystal, the authors have investigated a number of variables. It is determined to be crucial to control a desired reaction temperature at the mixing point of the starting liquids in the reactor. A relatively high reaction temperature of 350  °C is necessary for obtaining high-quality nanocrystal with high photoluminescence efficiency. Also, the quality of commercial TOPO affects the product and adding a small ratio of TDPA helps to control the nanocrystal formation. After the optimization, up to 13  g/h production rate was observed to last for at least 1  h. The bandwidth and the luminescence intensity of the nanocrystal were comparable to batch reaction using the similar approach [47, 48]. There are also a number of works reporting the synthesis of quantum dots via the microfluid reactor [51 – 53]. Although much smaller in size, the “flow-through” concept could still serve as a useful hint for the future design of flow reactors.|$|R
