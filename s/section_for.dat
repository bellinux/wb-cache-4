The new organisation subsumed the NDRC, now chaired by James B. Conant. The Uranium Committee became the Uranium Section of the OSRD, which was soon renamed the S-1 <b>Section</b> <b>for</b> security reasons. To the S-1 Section, Bush added Samuel K. Allison, Breit, Edward U. Condon, Lloyd P. Smith and Henry D. Smyth; Gunn was dropped {{in line with}} an NDRC policy not to have Army or Navy personnel in the sections. Briggs remained the chairman, with Pegram as the vice chairman.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear <b>section</b> <b>for</b> engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|The Sixth World Congress in 1961 {{marked a}} {{lessening}} {{of the political}} divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat and {{the leadership of the}} SWP in the United States.

The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan <b>section,</b> <b>for</b> seeming to support the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{in this paper}} the {{competition}} between (projectile) core-conserving and core-varying single-electron capture processes in Ne 6 +-He collisions for impact energies between 0. 07 and 1. 2 keV amu- 1. By deconvoluting the spectra of the VUV radiation emitted by the decaying product ions, absolute state-selective cross <b>sections</b> <b>for</b> these processes were determined. We also obtained capture cross <b>sections</b> <b>for</b> metastable Ne 6 + ions colliding on helium. Core-conserving capture channels dominate the charge transfer process at the higher impact energies investigated; with decreasing impact energies, however, the core-varying channels gain strength {{at the expense of}} the core-conserving channels. Our results show that the capture cross <b>sections</b> <b>for</b> the core-conserving processes involving metastable primary ions are comparable with those for the ground-state primary ions. At lower impact energies, however, the capture cross <b>sections</b> <b>for</b> the metastables are almost three times larger than the cross <b>sections</b> <b>for</b> ground-state primary ions...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington <b>section</b> <b>for</b> six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E
