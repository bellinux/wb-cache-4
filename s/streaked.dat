5|$|The nelicourvi weaver can be {{distinguished}} from the related sakalava weaver, which has <b>streaked</b> plumage. The somewhat related forest fody and Madagascar fody mostly have <b>streaked</b> upperparts and scarlet as the most obvious colour.|$|E
5|$|The sexes {{are similar}} {{although}} the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more <b>streaked</b> above with prominent streaking on the underparts. A. s. coutellii {{is smaller than}} the nominate subspecies and {{the white of the}} outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily <b>streaked</b> above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. A. s. blakistoni is large, pale and less strongly <b>streaked.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly <b>streaked</b> with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more <b>streaked,</b> and the underparts are white, <b>streaked</b> lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists {{of four or five}} blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E
40|$|Slope <b>streaks</b> are {{surficial}} mass {{movements that}} are {{abundant in the}} dust-covered regions of Mars. Targeting of slope <b>streaks</b> seen in Viking images with the Mars Orbiter Camera provides observations of slope <b>streak</b> dust activity over two to three decades. In all study areas, new and persisting dark slope <b>streaks</b> are observed. Slope <b>streaks</b> disappeared in one area, with persisting <b>streaks</b> nearby. New slope <b>streaks</b> {{are found to be}} systematically darker than persisting <b>streaks,</b> which indicates gradual fading. Far more slope <b>streaks</b> formed at the study sites than have faded from visibility. The rate of formation at the study sites was 0. 03 new slope <b>streaks</b> per existing <b>streak</b> per Mars year. Bright slope <b>streaks</b> do not presently form in sudden events as dark slope <b>streaks</b> do. Instead, bright <b>streaks</b> might form from old dark slope <b>streaks,</b> perhaps transitioning through a partially faded stage...|$|R
50|$|Bright slope <b>streaks</b> are <b>streaks</b> {{that have}} a lighter tone (about 2%) than their surroundings. (See F in Photo Gallery.) They are much rarer than dark slope <b>streaks,</b> but both types of <b>streaks</b> have similar morphologies and occur in the same regions of Mars. Evidence {{suggests}} that bright slope <b>streaks</b> are older than dark slope <b>streaks.</b> New bright slope <b>streaks</b> have never been observed, and dark slope <b>streaks</b> can be seen overlying bright slope <b>streaks</b> in some images, indicating that the former are younger than the latter. It is likely that bright slope <b>streaks</b> form from old dark slope <b>streaks</b> that have transitioned past a partially faded stage. This supposition is supported by geographical evidence indicating that bright slope <b>streaks</b> are slightly more common in regions where the formation rate of new dark slope <b>streaks</b> is low. In other words, areas with relatively many bright <b>streaks</b> {{tend to be less}} active and contain a higher population of old dark <b>streaks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Federer and Nadal {{also have}} the longest winning <b>streaks</b> {{on each of the}} surfaces.

Furthermore, Nadal ended Federer's <b>streaks</b> on grass courts and Federer ended Nadal's <b>streak</b> on clay courts.|$|R
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adult females, {{but have}} broken narrow pale edges of underpart feathers, which give a slightly <b>streaked</b> rather than scalloped appearance, {{and the overall}} appearance is browner rather than uniformly blackish. Juvenile males have brownish-orange feet while juvenile females have brownish feet and a dusky greyish-green bill.|$|E
5|$|P. m. malaccensis, {{described}} by Alphonse Dubois in 1885, is found {{from the southern}} Himalayas east to Hainan and Indonesia. It is a dark race, like P. m. saturatus, but is smaller and more heavily <b>streaked</b> on its upperparts.|$|E
5|$|Similar in appearance, all treecreepers {{are small}} birds with <b>streaked</b> and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long rigid tail {{feathers}} that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.|$|E
50|$|Dark slope <b>streaks</b> {{commonly}} {{share the}} same slope with other slope <b>streaks</b> of varying tones. The darkest <b>streaks</b> are presumed to be youngest; they have margins that are more sharply defined than <b>streaks</b> that are not as dark. This relationship suggests that <b>streaks</b> lighten and become more diffuse with age, probably because they become covered with fresh dust falling from the atmosphere. Faded dark slope <b>streaks</b> {{should not be confused}} with bright slope <b>streaks</b> (discussed below).|$|R

5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or <b>streaked</b> in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often <b>streaked</b> with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{are similar in}} appearance. Juvenile birds are {{slightly}} browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to the feathers of the wings and back. Juveniles have a duller, less <b>streaked</b> appearance than adults. Juveniles moult into adult plumage at around one year old. There is no seasonal difference in the plumage of breeding birds.|$|E
50|$|In sports, {{a losing}} <b>streak</b> or cold <b>streak</b> is an {{uninterrupted}} string of contests (whether games, matches, etc.) lost {{by a team}} or individual.

Major League Baseball recognizes two hitting <b>streak</b> records: Longest hitting <b>streak</b> in one season, and longest hitting <b>streak</b> over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005-2006). Keeler's, Sisler's, and Rollins' <b>streaks</b> are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games when discussing single-season <b>streaks,</b> and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing multiple-season <b>streaks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, its feet are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid.

5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more <b>streaked</b> rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North America can be nearly white with pale scales, and may {{be confused}} with the whitish edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also has them. According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland <b>streaked</b> tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{prominent}} <b>streak</b> discovery in sequence data. Given a sequence of val-ues, a prominent <b>streak</b> is a long consecutive subsequence consisting of only large (small) values, e. g., consec-utive games of outstanding performance in sports, consecutive hours of heavy network traffic, consecutive days of frequent mentioning of a person in social media, and so on. Prominent <b>streak</b> discovery provides insightful data patterns for data analysis in many real-world applications and is an enabling technique for computational journalism. Given its real-world usefulness and complexity, the research on prominent <b>streaks</b> in sequence data opens a spectrum of challenging problems. A baseline approach to finding prominent <b>streaks</b> is a quadratic algorithm that exhaustively enumer-ates all possible <b>streaks</b> and performs pairwise <b>streak</b> dominance comparison. For more efficient methods, we make the observation that prominent <b>streaks</b> are in fact skyline points in two dimensions – <b>streak</b> in-terval length and minimum value in the interval. Our solution thus hinges upon the idea to separate the two steps in prominent <b>streak</b> discovery – candidate <b>streak</b> generation and skyline operation over candidate <b>streaks.</b> For candidate generation, we propose the concept of local prominent <b>streak</b> (LPS). We prove that prominent <b>streaks</b> are a subset of LPSs {{and the number of}} LPSs is less than the length of a data sequence, in comparison with the quadratic number of candidates produced by the brute-force baseline method.

5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be <b>streaked</b> or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare (Lepus starcki) is {{a medium-sized}} species of mammal in the rabbit and hare family, Leporidae. Its dorsal pelage is grizzled, buff white and spotted and <b>streaked</b> with black, while its belly fur is pure white and fluffy. It is endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands, ranging over the Afroalpine {{regions of the}} Shoa, Bale, and Arsi Provinces of Ethiopia. A herbivore, it mostly feeds on moorland grasses. The IUCN rates it as a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} (Anthus petrosus), or just rock pipit, is {{a species of}} small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has <b>streaked</b> greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.|$|E
40|$|Photometric {{studies of}} crater related bright and dark <b>streaks</b> have {{strongly}} supported {{the hypothesis that}} the bright <b>streaks</b> are excess dust deposits and dark <b>streaks</b> are erosional windows in a partial dust cover. Red-blue (and red-violet) plots show that bright <b>streaks</b> are consistent with mosaics of bright red dust and background material. Here the plains are also consistent with a partial dust cover; the dark <b>streak</b> is the least covered area. Bright and dark <b>streaks</b> both reverse contrast relative to surrounding plains at phase angles over 100 deg in violet filter images. The similar phase behavior of both bright and dark <b>streaks</b> supports the idea that they are both changes in the amount of dust cover. Red-violet plots of bright <b>streaks</b> are most easily explained by mosaics of optically thick dust and plains material. Lengths of bright <b>streaks</b> are independent of their contrasts. This suggests the <b>streak</b> deposition, if in the mosaic patterns indicated above, is a function of available sites of deposition, rather than atmospheric dust loading. Contrasts of dark <b>streaks</b> with plains indicate the plains have fractional dust covers nealy as great as the maximum additional cover in bright <b>streaks.</b> The bright <b>streaks</b> thus store little of the global supply of dust...|$|R

5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily <b>streaked.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often <b>streaked</b> reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E

40|$|Low-speed <b>streaks</b> are {{involved}} in bypass transition, yet they can interact with Tollmien-Schlichting waves to delay transition. Recent progress concerning <b>streak</b> stability has used the model of an Optimum <b>streak</b> computationally, or <b>streaks</b> from roughness elements experimentally. Questions remain concerning the characteristics of <b>streaks</b> which originate from the free-stream. This thesis provides insight into the origin of steady vortical free-stream disturbances, creation of <b>streaks,</b> and their influence on boundary layer transition.   Computational results are co-validated with published experimental observations of steady <b>streaks,</b> generated by {{the wake of a}} wire upstream. The largest <b>streak</b> occurs when the wire is placed upstream of the wind tunnel contraction. Flow through the contraction creates streamwise vorticity in the test-section via tilting and stretching of the normal vorticity in the wake. The computational results reinterpret the original experiment as a receptivity experiment, demonstrating the boundary layer is more receptive to streamwise vorticity. The sensitivity of normal vorticity receptivity to the leading edge attachment is also shown. More than 30 years ago, Morkovin highlighted issues of spanwise variation (<b>streaks)</b> in wind tunnels and called for establishing the link with settling chamber screens. This thesis uses CFD to link screens with boundary layer <b>streaks</b> assuming steady, laminar flow. The screen is modelled by a zither of wires. The effects of zither open-area ratio and geometric imperfections are examined. The computational results mirror experiment with zithers of decreasing open-area ratio and greater imperfection creating larger <b>streaks.</b> For example, an imperfect zither with an open-area ratio of 50 % can create a <b>streak</b> causing 80 % variation of boundary layer thickness. The free-stream flow angle is only 0. 1 degrees. The <b>streaks</b> have the same attributes as Klebanoff <b>streaks.</b> A PSE- 3 D analysis suggests the <b>streaks</b> will stabilise Tollmien-Schlichting waves. Large <b>streaks</b> have been attributed to an “instability” downstream of screens that leads to “coalescence of jets”. Current results demonstrate and attribute <b>streak</b> formation to increasing drag variation across the zither. Drag variation modifies the wake decay rate, creating a stronger wake. The stronger wake passing through the contraction generates increased streamwise vorticity, creating larger <b>streaks.</b> A published analysis is tested for predicting zither wake strength and wavelength. New zither wake decay rates are derived based on drag variation. “Coalescence of jets” {{is considered to be a}} symptom rather than a cause. <b>Streaks</b> are computationally generated near the leading edge using free-stream normal or streamwise vorticity. BiGlobal stability analysis in the early boundary layer shows normal vorticity <b>streaks</b> favour the growth of high frequency disturbances while streamwise vorticity <b>streaks</b> favour lower frequencies. Both <b>streaks</b> stabilise the boundary layer further downstream. A model using the spanwise mean and the first Fourier mode of the <b>streak</b> is used to investigate stability. <b>Streaks</b> can destabilise or stabilise depending on modification of the mean-flow wall-normal profile by the <b>streak,</b> the <b>streak</b> width relative to the boundary layer thickness, and the relative amplitude of the mean-flow modification. These characteristics depend on the free-stream source and nonlinear growth of the <b>streak...</b>|$|R
