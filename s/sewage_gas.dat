2500|$|Biogas, and {{especially}} landfill gas, are already {{used in some}} areas, but their use could be greatly expanded. Experimental systems were being proposed for use in parts of Hertfordshire, UK, and Lyon in France. [...] Using materials that would otherwise generate no income, or even cost money to get rid of, improves the profitability and energy balance of biogas production. [...] Gas generated in sewage treatment plants is commonly used to generate electricity.

50|$|On 1 August 2014, {{a revised}} Renewable Energy Sources Act entered into force.

Wind and solar power are to be targeted over hydro, gas (landfill gas, <b>sewage</b> <b>gas,</b> and mine gas), geothermal, and biomass. In late-2015, this new scheme is being tested, as a pilot project, for ground-mounted PV installations.
