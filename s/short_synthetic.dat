50|$|Bivalirudin is a DTI that overcomes many {{limitations}} {{seen with}} indirect thrombin inhibitors, such as heparin. Bivalirudin is a <b>short,</b> <b>synthetic</b> peptide that is potent, highly specific, and a reversible inhibitor of thrombin. It inhibits both circulating and clot-bound thrombin, while also inhibiting thrombin-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Bivalirudin has a quick {{onset of action}} and a short half-life. It does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells. Therefore, it has a predictable antithrombotic response. There is no risk for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia/Heparin Induced Thrombosis-Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (HIT/HITTS). It {{does not require a}} binding cofactor such as antithrombin and does not activate platelets. These characteristics make bivalirudin an ideal alternative to heparin.|$|E

50|$|Fruton was a {{researcher}} at the Rockefeller Institute from 1934 to 1945, part of Max Bergmann's long-term and very successful research program in protein chemistry. In his earliest work there, Fruton tested the stereochemical specificity of dipeptidase. Under the tutelage of fellow Bergmann lab researcher Leonidas Zervas, a pioneer in peptide synthesis, Fruton synthesized stereospecific dipeptides and other small peptides as enzyme substrates. Fruton and his colleagues found significant instances of specificity in a range of proteases—observations that were relevant to the ongoing theoretical discussions of protein structure. His most significant discovery at the Rockefeller Institute was a synthetic peptide substrate for pepsin, contrary to the common idea that pepsin would not act on <b>short</b> <b>synthetic</b> peptides. As a side project, he also worked on applications of Bergmann and Zervas's carbobenzoxy method of peptide synthesis and some of the associated side reactions.|$|E
50|$|Illumina {{sequencing}} technology works in three basic steps: amplify, sequence, and analyze. The process begins with purified DNA. The DNA gets chopped up into smaller pieces and given adapters, indices, {{and other kinds}} of molecular modifications that act as reference points during amplification, sequencing, and analysis. The modified DNA is loaded onto a specialized chip where amplification and sequencing will take place. Along the bottom of the chip are hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotides (<b>short,</b> <b>synthetic</b> pieces of DNA). They are anchored to the chip and able to grab DNA fragments that have complementary sequences. Once the fragments have attached, a phase called cluster generation begins. This step makes about a thousand copies of each fragment of DNA. Next, primers and modified nucleotides enter the chip. These nucleotides have reversible 3' blockers that force the primers to add on only one nucleotide at a time as well as fluorescent tags. After each round of synthesis, a camera takes a picture of the chip. A computer determines what base was added by the wavelength of the fluorescent tag and records it for every spot on the chip. After each round, non-incorporated molecules are washed away. A chemical deblocking step is then used in the removal of the 3’ terminal blocking group and the dye in a single step. The process continues until the full DNA molecule is sequenced. With this technology, thousands of places throughout the genome are sequenced at once via massive parallel sequencing.|$|E

Two membrane-active peptides with appropriate sequences of lysine and leucine amino acids and a short polylysine have been probed. The results revealed that the secondary structure of the peptide decisively aimed the peptide-DNA complex formation: only the longest peptide, {{which is the only}} one to exhibit an α-helical structure in solution, could achieve DNA compacting before charge neutralisation. The obtained complex retained a significant membrane activity as demonstrated by calcein leakage experiments.

40|$|The {{escalating}} {{threat of}} antimicrobial resistance has increased pressure to develop novel therapeutic strategies to tackle drug-resistant infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have gathered considerable interest {{as a new}} source of antibiotics due to their broad-spectrum and rapid bactericidal activities, in addition to their ability to synergise with conventional antibiotics against drug-resistant pathogens. However, natural AMPs are increasingly recognised as poor therapeutic candidates due to their long sequences, which inadvertently induce significant systemic toxicities and translate into higher manufacturing costs. To enhance their clinical utility, <b>short</b> <b>synthetic</b> analogues have been designed by fine-tuning their selectivity to preferentially interact with microbial over mammalian cells. However, the strategies employed by the majority of these studies have remained largely empirical, often utilising natural AMPs as templates, or helical wheel projections to perform modifications by replacing, deleting or scrambling amino acid sequences. Furthermore, synthetic peptides derived from natural host defence peptides possess high sequence similarity, which may promote cross-resistance when applied as therapeutic agents. Adopting a de novo approach enables the rational design of <b>short</b> <b>synthetic</b> AMPs, whilst mitigating concerns of resistance development to naturally occurring innate immune peptides. However, such rational approaches have yet to be applied to the de novo design of <b>short</b> <b>synthetic</b> anti-mycobacterial peptides. As such, this thesis first explores the feasibility of rationally designed synthetic alpha-helical AMPs as anti-tubercular agents and subsequently, a new sequence-based approach for the design of multifunctional alpha-helical peptides with idealised facial amphiphilicity, is proposed. In doing so, we demonstrate that the adoption of such systematic design principles, in the optimisation of <b>short</b> <b>synthetic</b> AMPs, could facilitate the development of safe and effective novel peptide therapeutics for application in infectious and inflammatory human diseases.
