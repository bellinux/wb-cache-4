5000|$|The {{technology}} {{works like}} this: during a piping installation, the axial {{movement of the}} Lokring driver over the fitting body swages the body onto the pipe surface, compressing the pipe wall first elastically and then plastically. When the pipe wall resists this swaging action, it generates high unit compressive loads at the contact points. These contact stresses are high enough to plastically yield the pipe surface under the multiple <b>sealing</b> <b>lands,</b> forming a 360-degree circumferential, permanent, metal-to-metal seal between the pipe and fitting body. Finally, the installation process causes the Lokring driver to grow slightly in diameter — an [...] "elastic strain" [...] — so that it exerts an elastic, radial preload on the metallic seals. This secures the fitting {{for the life of}} the connection.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the debate on}} polycentric development and land consumption in growing urban regions. The {{aim of this study}} is to verify if urban morphology reflects the transition from a mono-centric and hyper-compact form centred on Barcelona (Spain) towards a polycentric agglomeration based on subcentres functionally distinct from the head city. The spatial distribution of impervious land by municipal unit has been investigated under three spatial domains (province, metropolitan region and metropolitan area of Barcelona). Soil sealing indicators have been analysed using descriptive, inferential and multivariate statistical techniques. Sealing intensity and diversification decreased with the distance from the centre of Barcelona, while per-capita <b>sealed</b> <b>land</b> was low in the central city and much higher and stable in peripheral municipalities. Our results shed light on Barcelona’s long-term expansion, providing evidence in favour of settlement scattering instead of a genuine polycentric structure. The article finally debates the use of soil sealing indicators for the assessment of polycentric or scattered urban development in the Mediterranean region...|$|R

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the Cape route, caravel ships of Portuguese Franciscans and Dominicans set out to evangelize the no longer <b>sealed</b> <b>lands</b> of the East, and traversed the coasts in search of suitable centres for their operations. A legend tells how, when a caravel with some Franciscan missionaries was cruising up the Coromandel Coast, towards nightfall their attention was attracted by a light on shore and they decided to land there. They did, without knowing for some time that they had landed at the ruins of Betumah. But when they attempted to approach the light, it preceded them inland, across the ruins of the Nestorian town, over an empty stretch of ground, past (new) Mylapur and into a forest, where the light vanished. Here the Franciscans established a mission and built a church (still extant) in honour of Our Lady of Light in 1516, whence the locality, no longer a forest, but a wealthy residential quarter, is still known as The Luz—after Nossa Senhora da Luz (Portuguese for Our Lady of Light). The Dominicans followed in their wake, and in 1520 Fre. Ambrosio, O.P., was consecrated bishop for the Dominican missions at Cranganore and Mylapur.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation method based on 3 -D Navier–Stokes equation and Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method is presented to analyze the grooved slipper performance of piston pump. The moving domain of grooved slipper {{is transformed into a}} fixed reference domain by the ALE method, which makes it convenient to take the effects of rotate speed, body force, temperature, and oil viscosity into account. A geometric model to express the complex structure, which covers the orifice of piston and slipper, vented groove and the oil film, is constructed. Corresponding to different oil film thicknesses calculated in light of hydrostatic equilibrium theory and boundary conditions, a set of simulations is conducted in COMSOL to analyze the pump characteristics and effects of geometry (groove width and radius, orifice size) on these characteristics. Furthermore, the mechanics and hydraulics analyses are employed to validate the CFD model, and there is an excellent agreement between simulation and analytical results. The simulation results show that the <b>sealing</b> <b>land</b> radius, orifice size and groove width all dramatically affect the slipper behavior, and an optimum tradeoff among these factors is conducive to optimizing the pump design...|$|R

25|$|Executed in the {{starting}} hours of Operation Just Cause, this operation was handled by SEAL Team 4. Consisting of 48 U.S. Navy SEALs (three SEAL Platoons; Golf, Echo, and Delta) {{under the command of}} Lt. Cmdr. Toohey, this SEAL Team was tasked with destroying Noriega's private jet on the ground at the Punta Paitilla Airport, a coastal airport in Panama City. The main force of <b>SEALs</b> <b>landed</b> just south of the airport at approximately 0030, shortly before the initial combat operations started within Panama City itself. Several reconnaissance teams were hidden {{on the north side of}} the airfield to provide real-time data on enemy movements. Once the <b>SEALs</b> <b>landed,</b> Lt. Cmdr. Toohey established a command post near the southern edge of the runway. At this time Cmdr. McGrath, a SEAL officer stationed on a patrol boat offshore coordinating several operations, passed on information implying that the aircraft was to be disabled with “minimal damage” (defined as shot out tires and cut control wires), rather than destroyed. This later became a point of controversy after the operation, as the message was poorly worded and forced the SEALs to change their tactics at the last minute and approach the aircraft more closely than anticipated. The three platoons then began advancing up the airfield, with Golf platoon taking up final assaulting positions outside the hangar at roughly 0105. At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey received a message stating that PDF V300 Cadillac Gage armored cars were heading towards the airport. To counter the threat, a squad (Squad One of Golf Platoon) was ordered to move into ambush positions on a nearby road. As they stood up to move, the PDF soldiers stationed in the airfield immediately opened fire, killing one SEAL and wounding five others. The other two platoons moved to reinforce Golf, and within several minutes had secured the hangars, with two more SEALs killed and four more wounded. The SEALs then disabled Noriega’s private plane by shooting it with an AT4 rocket. Shortly after, a MEDEVAC helicopter arrived and transported the injured SEALs to the Joint Casualty Collection Point at Howard Air Force Base. The SEALs held the area throughout the night, and disabled the runway for use by any PDF transport planes by rolling other aircraft onto it. The next day, the SEALs were replaced by a company from the 75th Ranger Regiment. Due to the high level of casualties sustained and several inconsistencies regarding planning and command and control during the battle, the Battle of Paitilla Airport is considered one of the most controversial operations within Operation JUST CAUSE from the US military perspective.|$|R
