5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> to have complained {{about the lack of}} landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E
25|$|Many foals, {{particularly}} if they are buckskin, smoky black, or black, are born with primitive markings such as dorsal stripes and leg bars that disappear after the foal coat sheds. Such horses are sometimes mistakenly registered as dun. This error <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> common in foals that turn gray.|$|E
25|$|He {{tried his}} luck again in Nules in the {{subsequent}} campaign of 1918, though political configuration of the time <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> obscure and illegible. According to some, he represented the purs faction and {{was supported by a}} partially controlled newspaper, La Gaceta de Levante, opposed by the competing paquistes fraction and the conservative mauristas. According to another scholar, Chicharro was criticized by orthodox Carlists for his strong predilection for broad Right-wing alliances, blurring the Traditionalist political identity. He lost again, failing to get the ticket also in by-elections staged later that year as the victorious candidate died soon after having been elected.|$|E

25|$|Gerry Evans: Gerry is {{initially}} portrayed as an intensely negative character, particularly by Kate, for having left Chris after fathering her illegitimate son, Michael. However, upon {{his first appearance}} in the play, Gerry is shown to be charming and genuinely affectionate towards Chris. His current job as a gramophone salesman (like his former job as a ballroom dancing instructor) represents his freedom, {{in sharp contrast to}} the stagnant lives of the Mundy sisters. This is made all the more obvious by the fact that he is leaving Ireland to join the International Brigade and fight in the Spanish Civil War, something that is further disapproved of by Kate. Through Michael's narration, we learn that Gerry is later left with a limp after falling off a motorbike in Barcelona. As well as having romantic feelings for Chris, Gerry <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> inclined towards Agnes, although the true state of their relationship remains in doubt. We learn later that he secretly has another family back in Wales, and that all his proposals of marriage to Christina have been false. Adult narrator Michael reveals that, after Gerry's death in the 1950s, he had been contacted by a half brother in South Wales, who revealed that Gerry had had a wife and several sons there at the time depicted in the drama.|$|E
500|$|DCS {{can also}} be caused at a {{constant}} ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as isobaric counterdiffusion, and presents a problem for very deep dives. For example, after using a very helium-rich trimix at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium, but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in [...] "fast" [...] tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> sensitive to this effect.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{criticized the}} lack of {{reasonable}} challenge for the Underwoods. James Poniewozik notes that [...] "Francis needs a stronger nemesis, {{if not for the}} sake of justice then for the sake of excitement. And House of Cards would be a greater show if it had characters who were people more than game pieces. Still, on its limited terms, it's absorbing to watch". According to Entertainment Weekly Karen Valby, the show's fundamental problem is that [...] "The Underwoods have no worthy opponents." [...] According to Variety Brian Lowry, as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> adept at recognizing this or combating him". Valby notes that neither Tusk nor Goodwin is an effective foe, leaving the audience longing for a comeuppance in the first four episodes that served as a preview for critics and his hopeful that Sharp provides a good foil as the season progresses. He also wrote that House of Cards overplays its depiction of the edginess of [...] "Washington being venal and corrupt". He describes the show as a [...] "mixed bag".|$|E

500|$|According to The Kansas City Star Smith, [...] "Frank hasn’t changed, {{and neither}} has his brand of Machiavellian {{political}} theater" [...] and [...] "Spacey has lost {{none of his}} smarmy magnetism as the cartoon-ish villain". According to Variety Brian Lowry, [...] "Kevin Spacey’s showy performance as an unscrupulous politician" [...] is foremost among the show's strengths, but the show's weakness is the [...] "failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes". Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> adept at recognizing this or combating him". Goodman says [...] "Spacey {{is nothing if not}} constantly magnetic". The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever. Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that [...] "Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano, Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power, and reminds us of the fact in his asides to the camera...he may be a ruthless sociopath, but there's something to admire there". [...] However Willmore noted that Frank became lighter in season 2 noting that the season was [...] "...delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before." ...|$|E
500|$|Tina Hart of MSN UK {{stated that}} [...] " [...] {{maintain}} her ‘badass’ demeanour. Britney’s familiar tones greet {{you on the}} verse and Kesha sounds perfectly {{at home on the}} chorus." [...] Wesley Case of The Baltimore Sun stated that while Spears sounds processed, [...] "Minaj's larger-than-life performance matches the in-the-red party production" [...] and Kesha [...] "adds an extra layer of dirt-under-the-nails sheen." [...] He summarized his review by saying that the remix [...] "is the perfect example of pop's current love affair with Euro dance [...] and add-it-all-to-the-pot rules." [...] Jordan Zakarin of The Huffington Post commented the track [...] "has enough star power to dwarf our own sun" [...] and added that it [...] "puts enough of a spin on the original version to make it worth a spin on its own." [...] Samesame.com.au stated that Minaj's rap was [...] "fantastic", and that although Kesha's verse was [...] "a little strange", it also [...] "works, but [...] further emphasises what a poor choice for single Till The World Ends was in the first place, as the song sounds even more like a B-side to Ke$ha’s Cannibal EP." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice highlighted the breakdown and Minaj [...] "who <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> energized here, stretching and bending her voice like it's a Plasticman doll." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "like most remixes, we’ll stick with the original". Anderson also stated that Kesha's contribution is [...] "generally ignorable" [...] and that Minaj's rap does not flow well {{with the rest of the}} song. Pitchfork Media included the Femme Fatale Remix in their Top 100 Tracks of 2011 list, writing: ...|$|E
2500|$|As a form, {{strategy}} {{was said to}} be one of [...] "Ten Abilities and Seven Arts" [...] that a warrior should have, but Musashi disagrees that one person can gain strategy by being confined to one particular style, which <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> fitting as he admits [...] "I practice many arts and abilities — all things with no teacher" [...] — this perhaps being {{one of the reasons he}} was so highly regarded a swordsman.|$|E

2500|$|In {{comparison}} with the vigorous optimism of the communist myth, the mythology propagated by the national socialists <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> inept; {{and this is not}} only because of the limitations of the racial myth (how could one imagine that the rest of Europe would voluntarily accept submission to the master-race?), but above all because of the fundamental pessimism of the Germanic mythology. [...] For the eschaton prophesied and expected by the ancient Germans was the ragnarok--that is, a catastrophic end of the world.|$|E
2500|$|... 1.96 is the {{approximate}} {{value of the}} 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution used in probability and statistics. 95% of the area under a normal curve lies within roughly 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, and due to the central limit theorem, this number is therefore used {{in the construction of}} approximate 95% confidence intervals. Its ubiquity is due to the arbitrary but common convention of using confidence intervals with 95% coverage rather than other coverages (such as 90% or 99%). This convention <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> common in medical statistics, but is also common in other areas of application, such as earth sciences, social sciences and business research.|$|E
2500|$|Associated Press {{movie critic}} Christy Lemire called Season of the Witch [...] "a supernatural action thriller that's never {{actually}} thrilling". She wrote, [...] "The scenery is drab, the battles are interchangeable, {{and no one}} <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> interested in being here. At the same time, Dominic Sena ... never flat-out goes for it in a schlocky, B-horror kind of way. What we're left with is just bloated, boring and utterly forgettable." [...] The critic found Cage and Perlman to be poorly utilized and said of the film's progression, [...] "It's a slog from one challenge to the next, with no real tension building, {{and all the while}} the alleged witch plays coy about whether she's actually a witch, pouting beneath her bangs, Kristen Stewart-style." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{question}} {{that may be}} asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust {{in the face of}} typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation). The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like [...] "if-then" [...] statements. For example, adult attachment style <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> sensitive to early childhood experiences. As adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; {{this is an example of}} another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.|$|E
2500|$|Most importantly, through Shakespeare, Melville infused Moby-Dick with a {{power of}} {{expression}} he had not previously possessed. Reading Shakespeare, Matthiessen observes, had been [...] "a catalytic agent" [...] for Melville, one that transformed his writing [...] "from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces". The extent to which Melville was in full possession of his powers is demonstrated by Matthiessen through the description of Ahab, which ends in language [...] "that suggests Shakespeare's but is not an imitation of it: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> Shakespearean, [...] "but its two key words appear only once each in the plays... and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination." [...] Melville's assimilation of Shakespeare, Matthiessen concludes, gave Moby-Dick [...] "a kind of diction that depended upon no source", and that could, as D.H. Lawrence put it, convey something [...] "almost superhuman or inhuman, bigger than life." [...] The prose {{is not based on}} anybody else's verse but on [...] "a sense of speech rhythm".|$|E

2500|$|Melville owned an {{edition of}} Shakespeare's works by 1849, and his reading of it greatly {{influenced}} {{the style of}} his next book, Moby-Dick (1851). The critic F.O. Matthiessen found that the language of Shakespeare far surpasses other influences upon the book, in that it inspired Melville to discover his own full strength. On almost every page, debts to Shakespeare can be discovered. The [...] "mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing" [...] {{at the end of}} [...] "Cetology" [...] (Ch.32) echo the famous phrase in Macbeth: [...] "Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury/ Signifying nothing." [...] Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the [...] "Quarter-Deck" [...] (Ch.36) is practically blank verse and so is Ahab's soliloquy at the beginning of [...] "Sunset" [...] (Ch.37):'I leave a white and turbid wake;/ Pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail./ The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm/ My track; let them; but first I pass.' Through Shakespeare, Melville infused Moby-Dick with a power of expression he had not previously possessed. Reading Shakespeare had been [...] "a catalytic agent" [...] for Melville, one that transformed his writing from merely reporting to [...] "the expression of profound natural forces." [...] The extent to which Melville assimilated Shakespeare is evident in the description of Ahab, Matthiessen continues, which ends in language that seems Shakespearean yet is no imitation: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase <b>seems</b> <b>particularly</b> Shakespearean, [...] "but its two key words appear only once each in the plays...and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination."
