A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a borderless and {{randomly}} generated universe, filled with asteroids, planets, stars and <b>solar</b> <b>systems.</b> Life forms are also present in the game. They appear on planets sufficiently big to store life, and are represented by a variety of ships of different size and attack power. Spaceships are coloured green if they belong to the player's planet, or to a planet that belongs to the player's solar system; red if they belong to an enemy planet or solar system; and white if they don't belong to any planet or system. All the spaceships in the map are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI), and they will constantly engage in combat against enemy ships, asteroids or planets to destroy them.|$|E

5|$|The player must explore <b>solar</b> <b>systems,</b> gather clues, {{and find}} special {{artifacts}} that grant {{access to the}} Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last journal entry {{can be found on}} the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet's surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} within the fictional {{universe}} in which prior Traveller releases are also set. The most significant power in this universe is the human-dominated Imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited <b>solar</b> <b>systems.</b> Bordering the regions controlled by the Imperium are other interstellar powers including the Zhodani Consulate. The Imperium and the Zhodani {{have a long history}} of tense relations and, as the game begins, rumors of another frontier war are circulating. Against this backdrop, a security agent working for Sharushid, a large corporation active throughout the Imperium, discovers that a company sub-sector chief named Konrad Kiefer is secretly aiding the Zhodani by smuggling arms across the border into the hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within the Imperium to be coordinated with a Zhodani attack. This security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a bar on the planet Efate and entrusts them with evidence of Kiefer's treachery. These adventurers are tasked with delivering the evidence to a second Sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping Kiefer and his conspiracy against the Imperium. The player assumes control over the party just after the security agent entrusts it with the evidence against Kiefer.|$|E

25|$|The term {{antimatter}} {{was first}} used by Arthur Schuster in two rather whimsical letters to Nature in 1898, in which he coined the term.

25|$|Later Neapolitan was {{replaced}} by Spanish during Spanish domination, and then by Italian. In 1458 the Accademia Pontaniana, {{one of the first}} academies in Italy, was established in Naples as a free initiative by men of letters, science and literature. In 1480 the writer and poet Jacopo Sannazzaro wrote the first pastoral romance, Arcadia, which influenced Italian literature. In 1634 Giambattista Basile collected Lo Cunto de li Cunti, five books of ancient tales written in the Neapolitan dialect rather than Italian. Philosopher Giordano Bruno, who theorised the existence of infinite <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> and the infinity of the entire universe, completed his studies at University of Naples.

40|$|Several {{short-lived}} radionuclides (SLRs) {{were present}} in the early <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> some of which should have formed just prior to or soon after the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> formation. Stellar nucleosynthesis has been proposed as the mechanism for production of SLRs in the <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> but no appropriate stellar source has been found to explain the abundances of all <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> SLRs. In this study, we propose a faint supernova with mixing and fallback as a stellar source of SLRs with mean lives of < 5 Myr (26 Al, 41 Ca, 53 Mn, and 60 Fe) in the <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> In such a supernova, the inner region of the exploding star experiences mixing, a small fraction of mixed materials is ejected, and the rest undergoes fallback onto the core.

40|$|It is {{determined}} {{that the existence of}} Al- 26 and Pd- 107 in meteorites in the early <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> indicates that our <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> probably formed inside an OB association that had been contaminated by the debris of at least one supernova. In addition to these radioactive tracers, the contamination of the material out of which the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> formed would have significantly enriched the heavy element composition of the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> relative to that of the average interstellar medium. It is found that the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> would be enriched in those isotopes which are produced by the more massive stars, such as O- 16, C- 12, Ne- 20, and some other r-process material. It is proposed that specific isotopic ratios and elemental ratios reflecting these differences would include the Ne- 20 /Ne- 22 ratio, which would be higher in the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> than in the interstellar medium and the cosmic rays, the C- 12 /C- 13 ratio which would be higher in the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> than in the interstellar medium, and the oxygen-to-carbon ratio, which would also be higher in the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> than in the typical interstellar medium...|$|R
