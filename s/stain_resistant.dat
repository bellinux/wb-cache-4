40|$|The {{staining}} {{property of}} pericentromeric heterochromatin of chromosome 18 is compared by C-banding and restriction endonuclease AluI digestion methods. Only a small distal fraction of C-band of chromosome 18 is observed to be resistant to AluI treatment, which positively stained with subsequent Giemsa <b>staining.</b> The <b>resistant</b> fraction is characteristic and usually located toward the short arm. The extensive heterogeneity of constitutive heterochromatin revealed by AluI treatment {{is useful in}} demonstrating the heterozygosity of homologous chromosomes. This, in turn, may provide frequent markers to identify the chromosomes 18 's. This present approach can be utilized in evaluation of the families to describe {{the origin of the}} extra chromosome 18 in Edward syndrome.

40|$|Objective: Cholera is endemic in Iran {{and each}} year we are facing with some {{outbreaks}} throughout the country. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the isolated cholera strains at outbreak 2013 for studying the their similarity and compare their homology in order to find out the route of infection either emerge from abroad or reemerge from inside native strains. Methods: All diagnosed V. cholerae isolates were entered to the study after re-identification at referral laboratory of Health Ministry based on standard procedures. These specimens were examined for specific serogroups by O 1 polyvalent and Ogawa/Inaba monospecific antisera and tested by MIC Test Strip Method against Ciprofloxacin, Nalidixic Acid, Cefixime, Ampicillin, Tetracycline, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethaxazone, and Erythromycin. Results: A total of 257 clinical Vibrio cholerae was isolated in an outbreak of Iran at 2013. The dominant causative type was Inaba. Vibrio cholerae was reported and isolated from 12 provinces, while 81. 71 % of cases from two southeast provinces. The outbreaks started from August and lasted in November. In Antibiotic susceptibility test isolates were 100 % resistant to Nalidixic acid, Tetracycline and SXT while all were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Cefixime and Ampicillin. However, 23 % of strains were sensitive to Erythromycin and all were isolated at the first two weeks of outbreak either from Iranian citizen or foreign travelers. Homology of isolates was investigated through genotyping by PFGE method and their clonality was compared with previous isolated Iranian native strain. Overall 92 % of analyzed strains showed a homolog pattern. These strains were located in 8 clusters. Although isolated strains at 2011 had 80 % homology with recent isolates, located in complete distinct cluster than all strains isolated at 2013. PFGE analysis revealed no dissimilarity between those <b>stains</b> <b>resistant</b> and sensitive to Erythromycin. Conclusion: This study confirmed that isolated Inaba strains at 2013 had different clonality pattern in PFGE than previously identified, suggested have foreign route from the neighboring countrie...|$|R

40|$|An immunocytochemical {{method was}} used to test the {{reactivity}} of the anti-P-glycoprotein antibodies, C 219, MRK 16, JSB- 1 and 265 /F 4 against multidrug resistant (MDR) variants derived from the human small cell lung carcinoma line, NCI-H 69, the mouse fibrosarcoma line, RIF- 1 and the mouse mammary tumour cell line, EMT 6. C 219 produced positive staining in MDR variants of both human and mouse tumour cell lines. MRK 16 and JSB- 1 however recognised P-glycoprotein only in the human MDR cell lines and not in the mouse MDR cells. 265 /F 4 appeared the most selective of the monoclonal antibodies used, producing positive staining of MDR variants derived from the RIF- 1 line, but not of MDR variants derived from the EMT 6 line. Total RNA was prepared from the mouse cell lines and, following reverse transcription, cDNA sequences were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for either the murine mdr 1 a or the mdr 1 b genes. From this it was possible to show that only the mdr 1 a gene is overexpressed in the resistant EMT 6 lines that do not stain with 265 /F 4 whereas both mdr 1 a and mdr 1 b are overexpressed in the positively <b>staining</b> <b>resistant</b> fibrosarcoma line, RIF/ 1. 0. Low level expression of mdr 1 b was detected in the sensitive parent RIF- 1 cells and increasing levels of expression correlated with increasing resistance in the lines, RIF/ 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 1. 0. Expression of mdr 1 a was found only in the more resistant fibrosarcoma cell lines. It seems that 265 /F 4 recognises only the mdr 1 b P-glycoprotein. Western blotting confirmed that this antibody detects a 170 kDa protein only in membranes derived from the resistant fibrosarcoma cells. 265 /F 4 may thus be used to distinguish between the murine P-glycoprotein isoforms so revealing differences between tumour cell lines in cellular localisation and in the time of appearance of mdr 1 a and mdr 1 b P-glycoprotein following drug exposure...|$|R

50|$|The Power-Heat-Set process, {{formerly}} known as Suessen process, {{was developed in the}} beginning of the 1970s and was the first continuous heat setting system worldwide.

Using this innovative technology, completely new carpet collections were created. In the Power-Heat-Set process, the yarns and filaments oxidize slightly on the surface due to the existing oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere and the higher temperatures.

5000|$|Synthetic fibers {{are more}} durable than most natural fibers and will readily pick-up {{different}} dyes. In addition, many synthetic fibers offer consumer-friendly {{functions such as}} stretching, waterproofing and stain resistance.Sunlight, moisture, and oils from human skin cause all fibers to break down and wear away. Natural fibers tend {{to be much more}} sensitive than synthetic blends. This is mainly because natural products are biodegradable. Natural fibers are susceptible to larval insect infestation; synthetic fibers are not a good food source for fabric-damaging insects. [...] Compared to natural fibers, many synthetic fibers are more water resistant and <b>stain</b> <b>resistant.</b> Some are even specially enhanced to withstand damage from water or stains. Some fabrics are also designed to stretch in specific ways, which makes them more comfortable to wear. Cotton production is resource intensive: it takes significant amounts of water to farm cotton. Wool producing sheep also need water and grazing land in order to survive. Thus it is claimed by some that although synthetic fiber production does involve some carbon emissions, the environmental footprint of many fibers is much lower.|$|E
50|$|Berber carpet {{is highly}} durable {{and is often}} found in offices, schools, and other high traffic areas. It is <b>stain</b> <b>resistant</b> as well, and is {{generally}} more affordable than thicker plush carpets. To care about it is recommended by most professionals that Moroccan Olefin Berber should be cleaned using a low-moisture or dry cleaning process. Traditional steam cleaning with high alkaline detergents can cause potential pH burns in the olefin. These appear as large yellow or brown splotches. Yellow or brown spots also may be tannin bleed from the sugars in natural fiber carpets that {{are drawn to the}} top by improper drying usually caused by over wetting. There are carpet chemicals that can remove most of this yellowing or browning but they are very expensive, and {{it would be better to}} not get the yellowing or browning. A better, but more difficult, method may be to dry the carpet from the bottom. This method would generally require lifting up some of the carpet to install a carpet fan under the carpet, and using hot air, not just room temperature air. Regrettably, many of these stains can be permanent if not corrected immediately by a professional carpet cleaner. As with all carpets, Berber should be cleaned every 6 to 12 months to prevent permanent wear patterns.|$|E

The MAA strain showed strong virulence via mortality in rabbits and chickens. The prepared tuberculin of the MAA strain had similar potency compared to the MAA reference strain and standard tuberculin via a tuberculin skin test.

In the corpus striatum and cerebral cortex, NO synthase immunoreactivity and NADPH diaphorase staining are colocalized in medium to large aspiny neurons.

Transfection of human kidney cells with NO synthase cDNA elicits NADPH diaphorase staining. The ratio of NO synthase to NADPH diaphorase staining in the transfected cells is the same as in neurons, indicating that NO synthase fully accounts for observed NADPH staining.
