5|$|Silicon {{is present}} in silatrane, a highly toxic rodenticide. Long-term {{inhalation}} of <b>silica</b> <b>dust</b> causes silicosis, a fatal disease of the lungs. Silicon is an essential trace element. Silicone gel {{can be applied to}} badly burned patients to reduce scarring.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. <b>Silica</b> <b>dust</b> and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis.

50|$|The {{cause of}} IPF is unknown but certain {{environmental}} factors and exposures {{have been shown}} to increase the risk of getting IPF.

40|$|Background & Objectives : Silica {{is one of}} {{the most}} air {{pollutant}} in workplaces which long-term occupational exposure to silica is associated with an increased risk for respiratory diseases such as silicosis. Silicosis is an oxidative stress related disease and can lead to the development of lung cancer. This study aims to analysis of endogenous alkanes and aldehydes in the exhaled breath of workers exposed to <b>silica</b> containing <b>dusts.</b> Methods: In this study, the exhaled breath of 20 workers exposed to <b>silica</b> containing <b>dust</b> (case group), 20 healthy non-smokers and 25 healthy smokers (control group) were analyzed. The breath samples using 3 -liter Tedlar bags were collected. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were extracted with solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MS). Result: Totally, thirty nine VOCs were found in all breath samples (at least once). Aldehydes and alkanes such as acetaldehyde, hexanal, nonanal, decane, pentadecane, 2 -methle propane, 3 -methyle pentane and octane were detected in the exhaled breath subjects. Among the these compounds, mean peak area of acetaldehyde, hexanal, nonanal, decane and pentadecane were higher in the exhaled breath of an case group than control groups (Pvalue< 0. 05). Conclusions : The use of exhaled breath analysis as well as new media in the occupational toxicology and exposure biomarker assessment studies. It seems that acetaldehyde, hexanal, nonanal, decane and pentadecane can be considered as useful breath biomarkers for exposure assessment of <b>silica</b> containing <b>dust.</b> However, additional studies are needed to confirm thes results. ...|$|R

25|$|Silicon (Si) is {{the second}} most common element in the Earth's crust (oxygen is the most common). The {{compound}} silica, also known as silicon dioxide (SiO2), is formed from silicon and oxygen atoms. Since oxygen and silicon make up about 75% of the Earth's crust, the compound silica is quite common. It is found in many rocks, such as granite, sandstone, gneiss and slate, and in some metallic ores. Silica can be a main component of sand. It can also be in soil, mortar, plaster, and shingles.

High flexibility and good thermal insulation properties of fiber-reinforced silica aerogel composites at both high and low vacuum conditions make it a promising insulation candidate for the space suit application.

Thermal conductivity evaluations are proposed for different types of aerogels space suit elements to identify the lay-up concept that may have the best overall thermal performance for both Moon and Mars environments.

40|$|Issue: All {{types of}} dust {{have come under}} {{increasing}} regulatory control in the U. S. {{because of the potential}} or perceived health hazards they pose toward workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets standards for worker exposure to airborne dust under Federal regulations 29 CFR 1910. 1000. The standards can substantially effect the cost of dust control and material handling, as well as company liability for worker safety. Container glass is made from over 70 % silica. The term silica refers to the naturally occurring mineral silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Crystalline forms of silica, also known as “free”silica, can contribute to certain lung diseases under prolonged exposure conditions. An understanding of the difference between glass <b>dusts</b> and <b>silica</b> <b>dusts</b> in the crystalline form, and what the permissible exposure limits are, is necessary to ensure worker safety and to avoid liability in recycled glass processing. Best Practice: Glass In considering glass dusts, it is important to evaluate both the chemical composition of glass and its physical state. Bottle glass is a silicate containing various other ingredients that have been melted and upon cooling form an amorphous, or noncrystalline structure. The majority of the raw material silica occurs as quartz, a crystalline form of SiO 2. Other crystalline forms of silica include tridymite and cristobalite. Whil...|$|R

40|$|Using various surface {{modified}} <b>silica</b> <b>dusts</b> we previously {{showed that}} the samples able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced transformation of Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine in what measure trace iron on the surface of silica particles is involved in the cellular effects, through the formation of ROS. Min-U-Sil 5 quartz (Q) and an amorphous diatomite earth (DE), as well as the same samples pretreated with the Fe chelators ferrozine (fz, 3 mM) and desferrioxamine (dfx, 0. 1 mM), were studied for: (i) morphological transformation; and (ii) aberrant mitotic division of SHE cells, which we reported as one of the possible mechanisms of silica-induced cell transformation. In order to determine the nature of the ROS involved in these effects, the antioxidants superoxide dismutase, catalase and mannitol were added to the treated cells. On a per weight basis, DE appeared more cytotoxic and slightly more transforming than Q. The suspensions of Q and DE preincubated in Fe chelators were significantly less transforming and, in particular Q particles, had reduced potency in inducing abnormal mitoses than the untreated samples. Although the amount of Fe mobilized from the silica particles by dfx was greater than that of Fe(II) mobilized by fz, a decrease in transforming potency was largely achieved after pretreatment of particle...|$|R

40|$|Type II cell {{hypertrophy}} with surfactant accumulation in the lung {{is a common}} observation in silicosis. Mechanisms leading to these alterations are poorly understood. By using <b>silica</b> <b>dusts</b> and alveolar fluids from saline and silica exposed sheep, we explored four different pathways of surfactant turnover in vitro: (1) synthesis and (2) secretion of lipids by rat type II cells; and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) uptake/reuptake by (3) type II cells and (4) alveolar macrophages. Silica had no direct specific effect on type II cell lipid metabolism. Alveolar fluids from both saline and silica exposed animals induced several alterations compared to control medium: (a) an increase in lipid synthesis (60 to 130 %, P < 0. 05); (b) a decrease in lipid secretion (25 to 70 %, P < 0. 05); (c) a 50 to 75 % increase in DPPC reuptake by type II cells (P < 0. 05); (d) a 65 to 75 % decrease in DPPC uptake by alveolar macrophages (P < 0. 05). DPPC uptake by in vivo silica exposed alveolar macrophages was reduced. Alterations of surfactant lipid metabolism induced by alveolar fluids from silicotic animals was more pronounced than in those treated with control fluids. Anti SP-A antibodies significantly suppressed most of the alveolar fluid induced effects on surfactant turnover. From these in vitro data, silica-induced type II {{cell hypertrophy}} seems to result from an increase in lipid synthesis activity and an imbalance in the lipid secretion/reuptake ratio...|$|R

The level of total exposure and respirable dust were measured by personal sampling. Then the level of dust was quantified by gravimetric method.
