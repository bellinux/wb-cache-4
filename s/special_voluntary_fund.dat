50|$|Following {{the results}} of the inquiry, James Hardie entered into {{negotiations}} with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of James Hardie's products. In December 2004, James Hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a <b>voluntary</b> compensation <b>fund.</b> The details of the fund were to be legally determined by June 2005 but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised. Further conflicts between the company and the then Federal Government over tax deductibility of donations to the <b>voluntary</b> <b>fund</b> saw finalisation of the deal further delayed. It was not until November 2006, after the federal government had created 'black hole' tax legislation, which made the contributions of James Hardie into the <b>voluntary</b> <b>fund</b> tax deductible, and had granted the <b>voluntary</b> <b>fund</b> tax-exempt status, that James Hardie finalised the compensation deal. There was immense pressure on the Federal Government from state governments, union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem. Sexton claims that the Federal Government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation. The final step in giving the <b>voluntary</b> <b>fund</b> a legal structure was approval of the scheme by James Hardie shareholders. In February 2007, 99.6% of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later.|$|R
