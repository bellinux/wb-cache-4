5000|$|... in April 2011 Iain Duncan Smith {{introduced}} {{a period of}} mandatory work activity amounting {{to a maximum of}} four weeks of thirty hours each week in employment. It was expected this activity would be required of approximately 10,000 individuals. The main claimants who it was expected would be subject to mandatory work activity were those who had been <b>signing-on</b> <b>for</b> at least thirteen weeks. Despite this any recipient of Jobseeker-benefit could be required to take part in work activity regardless of how long that person had been signing on.|$|R
500|$|Arminius {{served as}} a coastal defense ship {{for the first six}} years of her service with the Prussian Navy. She saw {{extensive}} service in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars during the process of German unification. The vessel was the primary challenge to the French blockade of German ports during the latter conflict. After the wars, Arminius was withdrawn from front-line service and used in a variety of secondary roles, including as a training ship <b>for</b> <b>engine-room</b> crews and as a tender for the school ship [...] The ship was eventually sold in 1901 and broken up for scrap the following year.|$|R
5|$|SMS Greif was an aviso {{built by}} the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine), the only ship of her class. She was built at the Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1885, she was launched in July 1886, and she was commissioned in July 1887. Unlike the other avisos built by Germany, Greif was equipped only with a gun armament. Greif served with the fleet from 1887 until 1911, though {{she was not a}} particularly successful design and so saw little active service, having spent most of her time in reserve. In 1912, she was reduced to a training ship <b>for</b> <b>engine-room</b> personnel. In 1917, she was hulked for minelayers in Kiel. She was ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921 in Hamburg.|$|R

The explosion immediately killed eight of the crew and trapped 38 others below. The 38 crew were eventually rescued by the officers with only 6 in of air space left in their compartment.|$|R
5|$|Designed for {{overseas}} service protecting Germany's maritime trade, Hansa {{spent the first}} nine years of her career abroad. In 1884, {{it was found that}} her hull was badly corroded; this stemmed from the lengthy construction period, during which the iron had already begun to corrode. As a result of the poor shape of her hull, Hansa was removed from active service in 1884 and used as a guard ship in Kiel. While in Kiel, she was also used as a training ship <b>for</b> <b>engine-room</b> personnel and stokers. She was formally stricken from the naval register on 6 August 1888. She was then used as a floating barracks in Kiel, until 1905. Hansa was then moved to Mönkeberg, hulked, and used to train stokers. The ship did not last long in this service, and was sold in March 1906 for 96,000marks. Hansa was broken up later that year in Swinemünde.|$|R
5|$|The ship {{took part}} in an {{international}} naval demonstration in mid-1886 aimed at preventing a war between Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Lussin joined the ironclad , six torpedo boats, and several wooden vessels for the operation. After Greece refused to demobilize, the international fleet blockaded several Greek ports; Lussin {{and the rest of}} the Austro-Hungarian squadron blockaded Volos in May, and by June, the Greek government had conceded; Lussins period of service in Greek waters lasted from 7 May to 19 June. By 23 June, she had returned to Pola, where she was decommissioned the next day. She was reactivated for service with the training squadron from 8 May to 6 June 1887, but she spent the following year in reserve. Too slow to perform the duties of a fleet scout or a torpedo-boat flotilla leader, Lussin was removed from frontline service in 1890. Lussin was reclassified as a training ship <b>for</b> <b>engine-room</b> personnel in 1889, and for boiler-room personnel the next year.|$|R
500|$|Engine {{problems}} {{plagued the}} ship throughout her career; Kronprinzs engines broke down during the fleet maneuvers in May 1883. Two {{of the three}} other armored frigates also broke down, which forced the cancellation of the maneuvers. Kronprinz had anti-torpedo nets installed in 1885; these were removed in 1897. The ship served on active duty with the fleet until 22 August 1901, when she was stricken from the naval register. She was reconstructed at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel that year. The propulsion system was overhauled and the eight J Penn & Sons boilers were removed. Two Dürr and two Thornycroft boilers were installed in their place. Her barque rig was cut down to [...] After emerging from the reconstruction, Kronprinz served as a training ship <b>for</b> <b>engine-room</b> personnel, based in Kiel. The ship was ultimately sold to Bonn, a German ship-breaking firm, on 3 October 1921 for 5,000,000marks. Kronprinz was broken up for scrap in Rendsburg-Audorf later that year.|$|R

5|$|Owing {{to their}} poor {{performance}} and slow speed, the Zara-class cruisers {{did not see}} significant service with the fleet. They were too slow {{to be used as}} fleet scouts or flotilla leaders, and their gun armament was too weak for {{them to be able to}} protect torpedo boats from torpedo-boat destroyers. As a result, they spent most of the 1880s and 1890s , being reactivated briefly for training exercises. Sebenico returned to active service in 1893, alternating between sea duty with the training squadron and harbor service as a training ship <b>for</b> <b>engine-room</b> personnel. In 1897, Spalato became assigned to the artillery school, while Zara was recommissioned for use in the torpedo school. That year, Sebenico took part in the only significant period of fleet service, when she was sent to the island of Crete to participate in an international naval demonstration during Greco-Turkish War. During the blockade, Sebenico stopped and sank a Greek vessel trying to break the blockade. Sebenico served in a variety of auxiliary roles over the following five years, before joining Spalato in the artillery school in 1903; the three ships served in their training roles until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, at which point they became guard ships.|$|R
50|$|In June 1922 Jim Sullivan joined Wigan from Cardiff RFC {{when he was}} 17 years old.

60|$|When, finally, he went {{on board}} the Merrimac Thursday night, he had been without sleep since Wednesday morning. His uniform was begrimed, his hands were black, and {{he looked like a}} man who had been hard at work in and about an <b>engine-room</b> <b>for</b> a long time. As he said good-bye, the {{lieutenant}} remarked that his only regret was that all of the New York’s volunteers could not go with him.|$|R
25|$|On 5 May 1998, a {{flexible}} fuel hose in the ship's engine room burst. The spraying fuel ignited when it {{came into contact with}} hot machinery, and the first-response extinguishers were unable to cope with the fire's intensity. It took two hours for the fire to be extinguished, and four sailors died from carbon monoxide poisoning. A Board of Inquiry reported in December that a different type of hose inappropriate <b>for</b> an <b>engine-room</b> environment was fitted, the civilian contractors that fitted the hose had not passed the configuration changes to the Lloyd's Register classification society as required, and that personnel aboard Westralia did not have the training and qualifications required for their responsibilities. Repairs and modifications were made to the ship, and she returned to operational service during 2000.|$|R
60|$|Signing the diver to go on, he {{followed}} him round the vessel's stern. The sand {{on the other}} side was high and one could climb on board, but Lister shrank from the dark alleyway that led to the <b>engine-room.</b> <b>For</b> all that, he went in and saw the diver had opened the jambed door. When he reached the ledge a flash from the other's electric lamp pierced the gloom and he tried to forget his throbbing head and looked about.|$|R
60|$|Marston hesitated at {{the bottom}} of the ladder. It would be very awkward if he were caught on board the tug; but he must find out if she were ready for sea and he wore light, rubber-soled deck shoes. The ladder was not fastened, for the top began to slip along the plates when he climbed, and he was forced to reach up and seize the rail. Next moment he stepped {{cautiously}} down on deck. Nobody seemed to have heard him and all was dark but for the glow from the skylight, which only shone for a few feet on the damp planks. As Marston made <b>for</b> the <b>engine-room</b> his foot struck an iron drum and he stopped. It was a paint-drum, but he must discover if it were empty and what paint the crew had used.|$|R
5000|$|Goemon is {{hired as}} a {{bodyguard}} by Yakuza boss, Makio Inaniwa, who runs a gambling boat and is being threatened by internal factions. At the same time, Lupin attempts to steal the proceeds of the gaming vessel and meets Fujiko who had the same intention. Lupin and Fujiko decide to divide sales proceeds, but suddenly the boat explodes. Goemon heads <b>for</b> the <b>engine-room</b> and encounters the huge and powerful Hawk or [...] "Bermuda ghost" [...] with his twin axes who is seeking Lupin. While Goemon is fighting Hawk, Inaniwa dies in the flames, abandoned by his men. To avenge his father, Inaniwa Jr. sends Goemon to kill Hawk. Goemon finds Hawk but is easily beaten, and undertakes a punishing ordeal to understand why he lost. He returns to Inaniwa Jr. to take his punishment, but explodes at his men's insensitivity and brutality, and attacks them, leaving only Inaniwa Jr. standing. Goemon eventually finds Hawk again as he is pursuing Lupin and Daisuke. Goemon intervenes and confronts and defeats Hawk in a final bloody battle.|$|R
50|$|In the League of Ireland Cork F.C. {{continued}} were Fordsons left off. In 1931-32 and 1933-34 they runners-up. They {{also won}} the 1933-34 FAI Cup, defeating St. James's Gate 2-1. However the 1934-35 season saw Cork F.C.’s form slump dramatically when they suffered the ignominy of having to apply for re-election after finishing in last position with only 10 points from 18 games. However the outstanding goal scoring performance of Jimmy Turnbull in 1935-36 saw Cork F.C. finish in third place in the league. They also reached the 1935-36 FAI Cup final. Turnbull scored an astonishing 68 goals including a record 37 league goals and a further 11 in the cup campaign. However the season ended in controversy for Cork F.C. when {{it was revealed that}} two members of the Cup final team - Owen Madden and Jack O'Reilly - had agreed to sign for Norwich City. When Cork F.C., who received no fee, protested over the moves, both Madden and O'Reilly were suspended by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) for three years. Having already lost two forwards the club subsequently lost a third when Turnbull signed for Belfast Celtic after the Cork F.C. directors refused to pay him a £50 <b>signing-on</b> fee <b>for</b> the next season. This decision effectively {{marked the beginning of the}} end for Cork F.C. and in 1936-37 they finished 11th out of twelve teams. Without the draw of Turnbull, crowd attendances and gate receipts dropped and the club went into serious financial decline. In 1937-38 the club began to struggle to raise funds to travel to away games in Dublin. Unable to travel they were forced to concede an away league game to Shelbourne. The final straw came when a demoralised team, paying their own train fares, were defeated 3-0 by St James’s Gate in an 1937-38 FAI Cup game. Shortly after on 8 February 1938 it was announced that Cork F.C. was going into voluntary liquidation.|$|R
6000|$|But peace {{upon the}} Channel has been but a {{transitory}} thing since August, 1914. It proved itself such that morning, for I had scarce gotten into my dry clothes and taken the girl's apparel to the captain's cabin when an order was shouted {{down into the}} <b>engine-room</b> <b>for</b> full speed ahead, and an instant later I heard the dull boom of a gun. In a moment I was up on deck to see an enemy submarine about two hundred yards off our port bow. She had signaled us to stop, and our skipper had ignored the order; but now she had her gun trained on us, and the second shot grazed the cabin, warning the belligerent tug-captain {{that it was time}} to obey. Once again an order went down to the engine-room, and the tug reduced speed. The U-boat ceased firing and ordered the tug to come about and approach. Our momentum had carried us a little beyond the enemy craft, but we were turning now on the arc of a circle that would bring us alongside her. As I stood watching the maneuver and wondering what was to become of us, I felt something touch my elbow and turned to see the girl standing at my side. She looked up into my face with a rueful expression. [...] "They seem bent on our destruction," [...] she said, [...] "and it looks like the same boat that sunk us yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In the man's own words, [...] "just {{when the}} fog was thickest, the engines broke down. They {{had been doing}} this for some weeks, and we were too weary to care. I went forward of the bridge, and leaned over the side, {{wondering}} where I should ever get something that I could call a ship, and whether the old hulk would fall to pieces as she lay. The fog was as thick as any London one, but as white as steam. While they were tinkering at the engines below, I heard a voice in the fog about twenty yards from the ship's side, calling out, 'Can you climb on board if we throw you a rope?' That startled me, because I fancied {{we were going to be}} run down the next minute by a ship engaged in rescuing a man overboard. I shouted <b>for</b> the <b>engine-room</b> whistle; and it whistled about five minutes, but never the sound of a ship could we hear. The ship's boy came forward with some biscuit for me. As he put it into my hand, I heard the voice in the fog, crying out about throwing us a rope. This time it was the boy that yelled, 'Ship on us!' and off went the whistle again, while the men in the engine-room--it generally took the ship's crew to repair the Hespa's engines--tumbled upon deck to know what we were doing. I told them about the hail, and we listened in the smother of the fog for the sound of a screw. We listened for ten minutes, then we blew the whistle for another ten. Then the crew began to call the ship's boy a fool, meaning that the third mate was no better. When they were going down below, I heard the hail the third time, so did the ship's boy. 'There you are,' I said, 'it is not twenty yards from us.' The engineer sings out, 'I heard it too! Are you all asleep?' Then the crew began to swear at the engineer; and what with discussion, argument, and a little swearing,--for there is not much discipline on board a tramp,--we raised such a row that our skipper came aft to enquire. I, the engineer, and the ship's boy stuck to our tale. 'Voices or no voices,' said the captain, 'you'd better patch the old engines up, and see if you've got enough steam to whistle with. I've a notion that we've got into rather too crowded ways.' ...|$|R
