For example, the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden with its zero tolerance drug policy, does not accept physical <b>smart</b> <b>shops</b> and has shut down every known Swedish online <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> that have been selling pure research chemicals on the visible Web. To circumvent this the usage of anonymous marketplaces through the Tor network have taken over since the establishment of Silk Road, which in contrast took the FBI {{two and a half years}} to take down for one month.|$|R

They commonly provide instruction leaflets similar to the package inserts distributed with prescription drugs, which contain information on contra-indications, side effects, and the importance of set and setting. In the Netherlands, there is relatively little formal regulation of the <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> industry, but the natural concentration of expertise about a relatively exotic range of products in combination with the realization that closer public scrutiny and regulation are always lurking in the background have caused the <b>smart</b> <b>shops</b> to organize into an industry association that, among other things, promotes the spread of information about its wares.|$|R

50|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>shops</b> {{are best}} known in {{practice}} for selling whatever psychedelics, dissociatives, entactogens and deliriants local law permits. In the Netherlands, which {{is home to}} most of the <b>smart</b> <b>shops</b> in Europe, this includes Salvia divinorum, Amanita muscaria, Peyote, San Pedro cactus, Tabernanthe iboga, and various ingredients for Ayahuasca preparations. As of 1 December 2008, magic mushrooms are under stricter control in the Netherlands. Those new controls are quite controversial, because the list of banned mushrooms also contains species that have no psychoactive substances. Magic Mushroom spore prints and grow boxes are still available over the counter in the Netherlands. Psilocybin is not included in the ban and continues to be sold in <b>smart</b> <b>shops</b> nationwide in truffle form.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} {{consumer}} attitudes toward using <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> cart, considering country of origin, gender, age, and intentions to use <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts while purchasing. Moreover, it investigates {{the influence of}} extracted factors on consumers’ attitudes toward using <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts and the users’ levels of digital competence. The data was collected through survey questionnaires using a purposive sample of 313 Croatian and Italian respondents. To this end, we applied statistical methodologies such as binary logistic regression, factor analysis, and analysis of variance. We found that, compared with Croatians, Italian respondents have a more positive attitude toward using <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts, regardless of age or gender. Moreover, we found that consumers are influenced by two major factors: functional and convenience. Consumers who purchase for functionality reasons will have preferences associated with faster product selection and speeding up the purchasing process without fearing that they lack the necessary expertise. If functionality has the tendency to increase, respondents will not lack ICT knowledge when purchasing with the smart cart...|$|R
50|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>shop</b> is {{distinguished}} from head shops {{found in many}} countries. Head shops provide only paraphernalia, whereas <b>smart</b> <b>shops</b> usually sell at least some actual drugs. The term head shop {{is more common in}} the UK, though many British head shops sold magic mushrooms until July 2005 when the Government introduced a complete ban on magic mushrooms, putting them in the same category as heroin and crack cocaine. Many of the British head shops still sell a range of other legal highs.|$|R

40|$|<b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents,</b> which {{search the}} Internet {{for the most}} {{favourable}} offer, collect information and are even capable of purchasing a product independently without human interference will {{play an important role}} in future E-Commerce. There are however a lot of legal issues related to the use of <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> such as how to legally classify <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> or if contracts concluded by <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> are binding upon its principal. Further it is questionable if the principal is liable for the conduct of the Agent. The evaluation of these legal issues will be completed by a description of the characteristics of such Agents. 1 What are <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents?</b> At present online shopping is still an arduous venture. In order to acquire a product suppliers have to be found and a comparison between those, as well as the individual products has to be executed by hand. Due to the large number of suppliers it is almost impossible to get an overview over the different offers. Thus a selection of the optimal product is hardly possible. Since these steps of searching, evaluating and purchasing a product always recur it is advisable to automate and transfer them upon an <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agent.</b> The sought article is described to the <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agent,</b> which searches the Internet for the most favourable offer, collects information and is even capable of purchasing that product independently without human interference...|$|R

The problem is complicated for mobile agent systems as the remote sites on which the mobile agent executes cannot be controlled by the application programmer. In this paper, we use MAgNET, a mobile agent enabled ecommerce system to study and propose solutions for the reliability of mobile agent systems. In MAgNET, human buyers create and deploy mobile <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> that visit dierent seller sites on the Internet to comparison shop for a particular item. MAgNET employs passive replication of the mobile <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> to protect against faults on the remote seller sites. Process faults are addressed by cloning the <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> on each seller site prior to execution. To address network and node faults, we have used the bounded failure rate hypothesis along with passive replication of the <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> at each seller site...|$|R

30|$|The Friendly Mart <b>Smart</b> <b>Shop</b> in Talaav (Ilol) {{which was}} {{situated}} near a pond {{in the village}} and Pahaadiya (Ilol) was one and a half kilometers from Talaav on a slight elevation near a Kirana (convenience) store called Sahyog Kirana. Few store owners were keen to open a franchise seeing a good response to a <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> but lack enough space, so, it may not pass muster as a Friendly Mart franchise. At time, the idea of a Saral store would be ideal to convert small Kirana stores into more organized shop, material organized in a systematic way, and sold across the counter. Thus, Friendly Mart Saral Sahyog Kirana Store came into being in October 2007. Then, a whole sequence of setting up stores in the villages’ one after the other started.|$|R

40|$|Although {{interest}} in <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts is increasing, both retailers and consumer groups {{have concerns about}} how real-time spending feedback will influence shopping behavior. Building on budgeting and spending theories, the authors conduct three lab and grocery store experiments that robustly show that real-time spending feedback has a diverging impact on spending depending on whether a person is budget constrained ("budget" shoppers) or not ("nonbudget" shoppers). Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget shoppers to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget shoppers to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, <b>smart</b> <b>shopping</b> carts increase repatronage intentions for budget shoppers while keeping them stable for nonbudget shoppers. These findings underscore fundamental unexplored differences between budget and nonbudget shoppers. Moreover, they have key implications for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers as well as app developers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} {{of a range of}} new technologies like auto-identification devices, active tags, and smart items has impacted profoundly on business software solutions such as supply chain management, logistics, and in-ventory control. Integration of automatic data acquisition with enterprise appli-cations as well as potential to provide real-time analytic functionality is opening new avenues for business process automation. In this paper, we propose a novel application of these technologies in a retailing environment leading to the vi-sion of a <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> floor. We firstly present the infrastructure for the <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> floor. We then demonstrate how the proposed infrastructure is feasible and conducive to real-time acquisition of buyer behaviour data through three se-lected queries. Complete algorithmic solutions to each query are presented to provide proof of concept, and further deliberations on analytic potential of the proposed infrastructure are also provided.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years the use of herbal drugs of abuse, {{so-called}} 'smart products' and eco-drugs has increased. Many of these products have psychoactive effects. The variety of smart products sold in the so-called <b>smart</b> <b>shops</b> is enormous and this is still a growing market. The increased availability of these products and the continuing appearance of new products on the market, has led to increased awareness of the possible negative health aspects {{associated with the use of}} these products. At present, the Dutch Inspectorate for Health Protection, Commodities and Veterinary Public Health is testing the activities of these <b>smart</b> <b>shops</b> and the products for adherence to the regulations. This document, prepared by the National Poisons Control Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), serves as a practical aid to the Inspectorate in evaluating the various smart products. Four important groups of smart products can be discerned: the energizers, relaxing herbs, aphrodisiacs and products with hallucinogenic properties. For each of these groups the following items are described: the various product appearances, usage, the (desired) effects of the product according to <b>smart</b> <b>shop</b> information brochures, a description of the original plants (most of these products are derived from plants), the active ingredients in the product, and to the best of our knowledge, the pharmacology and medical toxicology of these ingredients and products. Further monitoring of the use of these smart products and the health effects they cause, should make clear to which specific group of smart products most attention should be paid from a medical point of view...|$|R
