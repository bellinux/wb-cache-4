500|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1950s Gielgud's career was in the {{doldrums}} as far as new plays were concerned. British theatre was moving away from the West End glamour of Beaumont's productions to more [...] works. Olivier had a great success in John Osborne's The Entertainer in 1957, but Gielgud was not in tune with the new wave of writers. He remained in demand as a Shakespearean, but there were few new plays suitable for him. He directed and played the lead in Coward's Nude with Violin in 1956, which was dismissed by the critics as old-fashioned, though it ran for more than a year. He made two film appearances, playing a cameo comedy scene with Coward as a prospective manservant in Michael Anderson's Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and as the father of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Sidney Franklin's 1957 remake of The Barretts of Wimpole Street. He did not consider his performance as the tyrannical father convincing, and confessed that he undertook it only for the large fee ("it will <b>set</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> for a couple of years") and to keep him before the public in America, where he had not performed for over four years.|$|E

In Number One magazine, he hit back at the claims he joined the band for money: [...] "Firstly, I didn't need the money, and secondly the cash wasn't exactly a long time coming. It wasn't exactly an experience that <b>set</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> for retirement." [...] He also was accused of ripping off the Power Station sound for his own records. He snapped: [...] "Listen, I gave the Power Station that sound. They took it from me, not the other way around." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A-E-F#m-D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] "First you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh ... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you <b>setting</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> / <b>Setting</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2009 it was {{suggested}} that the success of the single had made Rowland consider signing a new record deal with EMI Music. Despite earlier claims, Rowland told Entertainment Weekly in 2010 that she didn't leave Columbia Records of her own accord. She was dropped because her previous album, Ms. Kelly (2007), was not commercially successful. Then in May 2010, speculation of Rowland's new record ended when an official press release revealed that she had signed to Universal Motown Records. It was whilst recording within the studios with Guetta that Rowland caught the attention of the head of Universal Motown, Sylvia Rhone, which led to the new deal. On the decision to go with Rhone's label, Rowland said [...] "they have really embraced me and have <b>set</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> to succeed. I decided, after careful thought, to sign with Universal Motown not only because of their track record of success, but also because they truly put their artists first". Here I Am has a distinctly different sound to Rowland's previous albums. Simply Deep (2002) followed a rock–dance sound, while Ms. Kelly featured an urban sound. However, on her third album, {{there are a lot of}} up-tempo tracks. The album is tailored specifically towards individual markets, with the US version of the album featuring more traditional R and pop records, while the international version of the album features more of an [...] "up-tempo dancey" [...] sound.|$|E
2500|$|Misha B's {{breakthrough}} {{into the}} music industry came in 2011, [...] through her appearance on the eighth series of [...] UK version of The X Factor. In her first audition, she sang Aretha Franklin's cover of [...] "Respect". The Voice recounted her performance as being [...] "confident" [...] and [...] "show-stopping", and as a promising sign of Misha B's future in the competition. Noted for her [...] "Lauryn Hill-like rap-singing style", she was mentored by American recording artist Kelly Rowland and finished fourth. A variety of sources including The Daily Telegraph, Digital Spy and bluesandsoul.com have regarded Misha B {{as one of the}} more gifted and exciting acts ever to have come out of a talent competition. BBC 1xtra noting her [...] "show-stopping performances", considered her {{to be one of the}} most credible artists to emerge from the show and a [...] "break from the traditional X Factor contestant". In a review of the series, The Daily Telegraph picked her performance of [...] "Rolling in the Deep"(Adele) as one of the highlights of the series, saying she [...] "oozed star quality from the start... Like a 21st century Grace Jones or an urban Lady Gaga, the teenager seemed like a proper pop star already." [...] Bryan was involved in a controversy during the third live show when Tulisa Contostavlos accused her of making [...] "mean comments" [...] and [...] Louis Walsh accused her of being a [...] "bully" [...] backstage. No evidence was ever provided to support either allegation and both accusers apologised the next day. The other two judges and her fellow contestants defended Misha B during and after the show. Judge Gary Barlow later said he believed the wrongful allegations had ended Misha B's chances of winning the competition. Bryan asked about her experience on X Factor said [...] "I one hundred percent appreciate the platform it gave me...but it's not for the faint-hearted lol. You have to remember that at the end of the day it’s an entertainment show for TV." [...] "Things are said which are out of all of our hands as contestants. [...] I wasn't asked any questions, I was just accused." [...] Misha B spoke to grammy.com in 2013, [...] "I experienced not only highs but my share of lows on The X Factor, but it has <b>set</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> with the thick skin needed for this industry...

This <b>sets</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> to solve the Black-Scholes partial differential equation, which uses change of variables and Fourier Transforms to arrive at an explicit formula for pricing a call option. I then apply the formula and concepts to professional baseball free agency, where I use them to model a system of call options that teams can buy on players to acquire them at a future date in their contract. Using what I have learned, I explore which concepts can be found in baseball, and determine how feasible this model is under the Black-Scholes assumptions...|$|R

For these letters I was appointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready, but a future time was still named. Thus we went on till the ship (whose departure, too, had been several times postponed) was on the point of sailing. Then, when I called to take my leave and receive the letters, his secretary, Dr. Baird, came out to me and said the governor was extremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle before the ship, and then the letters would be delivered to me.|$|R

5000|$|Rosser was {{yet again}} wounded at Trevilian Station, where his brigade {{captured}} {{a number of}} prisoners from former West Point classmate and close personal friend George Armstrong Custer. His brigade later gallantly fought against Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley, and he efficiently commanded Fitzhugh Lee's division at Cedar Creek. A rare defeat where Custer overran Rosser’s troops at the Battle of Tom's Brook allowed Custer to repay Rosser for Trevilian Station. For no tactical reason, Custer chased Rosser's troops for over 10 miles and the action {{became known as the}} [...] "Woodstock Races" [...] in Union accounts.
