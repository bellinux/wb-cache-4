50|$|Modern day <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> {{are often}} used in mining and {{military}} operations, to provide a time-delay before ignition, and they {{more often than not}} are used to initiate an explosive detonator, thereby starting an explosive chain reaction to detonate a larger more stable main charge. <b>Safety</b> <b>fuses</b> are typically colored green or black (military) or fluorescent orange (commercial) to distinguish them from detonating cords such as Primacord, which are brightly colored or transparent.|$|E
5000|$|The Ensign-Bickford Company (EBCo) {{was started}} in 1836 in Simsbury, Connecticut as a {{manufacturer}} of William Bickford's <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> for use in mining. <b>Safety</b> <b>fuse</b> was a great advance in mining technology over the practice of filling holes with black powder.|$|R

50|$|A {{safety fuse}} {{consists}} of a black powder core in a textile tube, covered with asphaltum or other waterproofing agent, and having an outer wrapper of tough textile or plastic. They are made in a standard diameter designed to be crimped into blasting caps. Once ignited, <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> will burn underwater, and have no external flame that might ignite methane or other fuels such as might be found in mines or other industrial environments. <b>Safety</b> <b>fuses</b> are manufactured with specified burn times per 30 cm, e.g. 60 seconds, which means that a length of fuse 30 cm long will take 60 seconds to burn. Manufacturers warn that although every effort is made to ensure uniform burn times, <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> are subject to variation depending on conditions and should be used with adequate safety measures in place.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> {{is a type}} of fuse invented and {{patented}} by William Bickford in 1831. Originally it consisted of a [...] "tube" [...] of gunpowder surrounded by a waterproofed varnished jute [...] "rope". It replaced earlier and less reliable methods of igniting gunpowder blasting charges which had caused many injuries and deaths in the mining industry. The <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> burnt at a rate of typically about 30 seconds per foot (1 second per cm).|$|R

50|$|Igniter Cord is a {{commercial}} grade of visco fuse {{that is designed}} to ignite multiple <b>safety</b> <b>fuses.</b> Like visco, igniter cord burns with an external, visible flame. It is often heavily lacquered for water resistance, and sometimes has an inner wire core for mechanical strength.|$|E
50|$|He is {{best known}} as the {{inventor}} of the safety fuse, which was inspired by watching a friend, James Bray making rope. With his son-in-law George Smith, he established a factory in Tuckingmill for the production of his invention, and in its first year it produced 45 miles of fuse. He died a short while before his company actually started up. It took a while for miners to use the <b>safety</b> <b>fuses,</b> for the old ones were cheaper. His company eventually became part of the Ensign-Bickford Company.|$|E
50|$|Cuba, and the Cobre Mine in particular, was an {{attractive}} destination.The pay {{was good and}} the handbills circulated in Cornwall hinted that Cuba was a land of opportunity.Between August 1836 and April 1838 Alfred Jenkin, their agent in Cornwall, recruited 136 Cornish miners and mechanics, and also arranged for mining machinery, <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> and other material to be shipped from Cornwall to Cuba.He shipped clothes for the West African slaves working in the Cuban mines.Jenkin offered ₤100 per year plus free lodging, to young, fit, sober and single men, mostly from the mining areas around Camborne, Illogan and Redruth.|$|E
5000|$|Dyno Nobel's history {{dates back}} to 1865 with Swedish {{dynamite}} inventor Alfred Nobel. [...] The invention of the <b>Safety</b> <b>Fuse</b> by William Bickford in 1831 was also instrumental in the company’s development.|$|R
5000|$|Given the {{unreliability}} of fuses {{and means}} of detonation prior to Bickford’s fuse, this new technology changed the safety and conditions of mining. Due to poor record keeping or lack thereof, it is relatively difficult to determine {{the exact number of}} mining accidents and related statistics prior to the invention of the <b>safety</b> <b>fuse.</b> However [...] "this fuse soon replaced the less reliable fuses which were made of straws or quills filled with black powder, thus greatly reducing the hazard of accidental explosions in mining or construction." [...] Word of the reliability of Bickford's <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> spread, and was soon in large demand across world markets.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the south}} side of the main street, at the bottom of Tuckingmill, set in a wall, was (certainly prior to 1990) an inscribed stone which amongst other things {{credited}} his daughter with the inspiration/possible invention of the <b>safety</b> <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{expedient}} formerly used {{to ignite}} bickford style <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> was {{to split the}} end of a safety fuse, place a match head into the split and tie the split back together, holding the match head against the powder core. This technique was slower, cumbersome and more failure prone than piercing and cross matching. Also, a single length of igniter cord could pass through and serially ignite multiple pieces of safety fuse attached to various charges in more complex, multiple charge blasting schemes. This technique and the several burn rate types of igniter cord manufactured by ICI could be used to implememt quite complex ignition sequences.|$|E
50|$|Thermalite a {{specific}} type of fuse used in pyrotechnic applications. The product was designed to be used in cross matching <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> of the Bickford type. As safety fuse is designed to neither give nor take fire through the heavy fuse jacket, ignition may be achieved by punching a hole perpendicular to and through a safety fuse powder core, threading a piece of Thermalite or similar igniter cord through the hole, then gently squeezing the safety fuse with pliers or similar to bring the powder core into contact with the igniter cord. The Thermalite could be ignited by a match, or more certainly by a purpose made igniter, similar to a wire sparkler.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{then became}} a {{business}} partner of William Bickford, his father-in-law. He took out patents for improvements in <b>safety</b> <b>fuses,</b> by himself or with others, and built up a fortune in business. He {{was chairman of the}} Cornwall Railway to January 1864, overseeing the construction of the line from Plymouth to Truro and Falmouth. He was known locally also for his powers of speaking and lecturing, in 1823 became a local preacher for the Wesleyan Methodists, and was seen as one of their leading laymen. He {{was a member of the}} Royal Asiatic Society, of the Society of Antiquaries of London (23 December 1841), of the Royal Society of Literature, and of the Irish Archæological Society. In 1859 he was created LL.D. of New York.|$|E

50|$|A pencil {{detonator}} or time pencil is a {{time fuze}} designed {{to be connected to}} a detonator or short length of <b>safety</b> <b>fuse.</b> They are about the same size and shape as a pencil, hence the name. They were introduced during World War II.|$|R
50|$|Toy’s son-in-law, in 1867, {{expanded}} the business further by starting another company, Coast Manufacturing and Supply Company, which much later in 1913-1914 moved its operations to Livermore, California.

50|$|The {{simplest}} form of fuse is {{the burning}} fuse, believed to {{date back to}} the 10th century and originating in China. This simple fuse consisted of lightweight paper filled with loose gunpowder, and served as a means of delaying ignition in fireworks. This simple form of burning fuse can still be found today in many modern fireworks. A version of this simple fuse is called visco fuse, and consists of the burning core coated with wax or lacquer for durability and water resistance. Early fuses for grenades also consist of an wooden plug with a longitudinal hole filled with a slow burning gunpowder mixture inserted into the grenade. Such fuses were in use until the 18th century. The commercial and military version of a burning fuse referred to as safety fuse (invented by William Bickford) is a textile tube filled with combustible material and wrapped to prevent external exposure of the burning core. <b>Safety</b> <b>fuses</b> are used to initiate the detonation of explosives {{through the use of a}} blasting cap.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a fuse-element for <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> in the nominal current region from 10 up to 50 A, the {{suitability}} of aluminium in combination with galvanic tin-plating with and without zinc as an interlayer was studied. A technology is described for fabrication of such fuse-elements starting with an aluminium wire (99. 5 % Al) of 0. 5 mm diameter. Experimental tests clearly prooved that the material under study cannot satisfy the existing DIN regulations, it either fuses too slowly or no fusing takes place at all.

50|$|Ordinary {{detonators}} {{usually take}} the form of ignition-based explosives. Whilst they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form of detonator is most commonly initiated using <b>safety</b> <b>fuse,</b> and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. conventional munitions disposal. Well known detonators are lead azide, Pb(N3)2, silver azide (AgN3) and mercury fulminate Hg(ONC)2.|$|R

50|$|Visco is a 2-3-mm-diameter cord with a {{black powder}} core. There are three {{external}} layers to visco fuse. First, a layer of string is wound around the core, then a second, less tight, layer of string is wound {{in the opposite direction}} to prevent unraveling. The last layer is a low-nitrate nitrocellulose lacquer that keeps the fuse from falling apart. The last layer helps to make the visco fuse water resistant and to prevent moisture from degrading the black powder core. Unlike dynamite <b>safety</b> <b>fuse,</b> visco fuse burns with a visible external flame. After ignition, most visco fuses can burn underwater.|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} use of explosives uses electrical detonators or the capped fuse {{which is a}} length of <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> to which an ordinary detonator has been crimped. Many detonators' primary explosive is a material called ASA compound. This compound is formed from lead azide, lead styphnate and aluminium and is pressed into place above the base charge, usually TNT or tetryl in military detonators and PETN in commercial detonators.|$|R

50|$|A plastic {{igniter cord}} (PIC) {{is a type}} of fuse used to {{initiate}} an explosive device or charge. In appearance igniter cord is similar to <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> and when ignited, an intense flame spits perpendicular to the cord at a uniform rate as it burns along its length. Igniter cord in construction is again similar to <b>safety</b> <b>fuse,</b> consisting of a pyrotechnic composition at the core, wrapped with a nylon sheath to provide shape and finally wrapped again in an outer plastic shell to provide water resistance. Normally, igniter cord also consists of a metal wire {{at the very center of}} the pyrotechnic core which also runs the entire length of the cord; the pyrotechnic composition will react with the metal wire (typically aluminum, iron or copper) to increase the energetics of the fuse. There are two types of PICs: the fast type which has nominal burning speed of 30 cm per second, a diameter of about 3 mm, and is brownish in color; and the slow type, which has a diameter of 2 mm, is greenish in color, and has a nominal burning speed of 3 cm per second.|$|R

5000|$|Oxyliquits have {{numerous}} advantages. They are inexpensive to make, can {{be initiated}} by a <b>safety</b> <b>fuse,</b> {{and in case}} of a misfire, the oxygen evaporates quickly, rendering the charge quite safe {{in a short period of}} time. The first large scale deployment took place in 1899 during the building of the Simplon Tunnel, in the form of cartridges filled with diatomaceous earth soaked with petroleum, or an absorbent cork charcoal, dipped in liquid oxygen immediately before use. In another modification, the cartridge is filled with liquid oxygen after placement in the borehole.|$|R
