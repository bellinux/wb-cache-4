50|$|A <b>snifting</b> <b>valve</b> (sometimes snifter valve) is an {{automatic}} anti-vacuum valve {{used in a}} steam locomotive when coasting. The word Snift imitates the sound made by the valve.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: LNER Peppercorn A1 class Tornado <b>snifting</b> <b>valve</b> is {{the small}} {{mushroom}} directly behind the chimney.The square cover beneath is another distinctive LNER feature, covering {{the end of the}} superheater header.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Snifting</b> <b>valve</b> (not shown) [...] - [...] An anti-vacuum valve which permits air to {{be drawn}} through the {{superheater}} and cylinders which allows the engine to coast freely when the regulator is closed.|$|E
50|$|The {{probable}} {{explanation for}} this diversity is that <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> were useful as long as steam temperatures were relatively low. As locomotive development proceeded, larger superheaters were fitted and steam temperatures increased. When the locomotive was coasting, the air passing from the superheater to the cylinders became so hot that it oxidised the cylinder oil and interfered with lubrication. At this point, most railways decided to abandon <b>snifting</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{somewhat}} different functions, <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> {{were also used}} in atmospheric steam engines and hydraulic rams. They are not generally used in later stationary steam engines, road engines, or marine engines.|$|R
25|$|The entire U1 {{class had}} smokebox <b>snifting</b> <b>valves,</b> a feature {{previously}} {{used on the}} other Maunsell moguls. The main batch saw the front steps relocated ahead of the cylinders, as opposed to behind on the A890 rebuild, which was another relic of its previous guise as a 2-6-4 tank locomotive. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933, as {{with most of the}} locomotives designed by Maunsell. The smokebox <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> were removed by Oliver Bulleid {{by the end of the}} Second World War, although the U1 class chimney was used to improve draughting on the other Maunsell moguls.|$|R
50|$|The steam {{passing through}} the {{superheater}} elements cools their metal and prevents them from melting, but when the throttle closes this cooling effect is absent, and thus a damper closes in the smokebox {{to cut off the}} flow through the flues and prevent them being damaged. Some locomotives (particularly on the London and North Eastern Railway) were fitted with snifting valves which admitted air to the superheater when the locomotive was coasting (drifting). This kept the superheater elements cool and the cylinders warm. The <b>snifting</b> <b>valve</b> can be seen behind the chimney on many LNER locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|... in 1895, {{the first}} {{four-stroke}} engine {{was ready for}} production. The 138 cc (bore 50 mm, stroke 70 mm) single cylinder engine with a surface carburettor produced 0.5 HP at an engine speed of 1500 RPM, a remarkably high speed for the time. For comparison: Hildebrand & Wolfmüller reached 240 RPM, the Daimler Reitwagen motor ran at maximum 750 RPM. Bouton {{found out that the}} glowplug ignition was the obstacle to higher speeds. He developed a high voltage ignition system for the motor with circuit breaker. The dry battery for the ignition is located under the upper frame tube (in the case of a motor tricycle); ignition timing could be adjusted with a small lever. Side valves were driven via a gear-driven camshaft, with automatic <b>snifting</b> <b>valve</b> activation. The advantage of the design should have been very early (0-5 degrees before top dead centre) opening inlet valve. The cylinder head was removable and bolted with four bolts on the crank case. The weight of the existing cast iron engine including all auxiliary units amounted to less than 20 kg. [...] "The benefits of this engine were simplicity and ease." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{pressure}} vessel 6 containing air cushions the hydraulic pressure shock when the waste valve closes, {{and it also}} improves the pumping efficiency by allowing a more constant flow through the delivery pipe. Although the pump could in theory work without it, the efficiency would drop drastically and the pump {{would be subject to}} extraordinary stresses that could shorten its life considerably. One problem is that the pressurized air will gradually dissolve into the water until none remains. One solution to this problem is to have the air separated from the water by an elastic diaphragm (similar to an expansion tank); however, this solution can be problematic in developing countries where replacements are difficult to procure. Another solution is to have a mechanism such as a <b>snifting</b> <b>valve</b> that automatically inserts a small bubble of air when the suction pulse mentioned above reaches the pump. Another solution is to insert an inner tube of a car or bicycle tire into the {{pressure vessel}} with some air in it and the valve closed. This tube is in effect the same as the diaphragm, but it is implemented with more widely available materials. The air in the tube cushions the shock of the water the same as the air in other configurations does.|$|E
5000|$|UK railway {{companies}} did {{not agree}} {{on the merits of}} <b>snifting</b> <b>valves.</b> The London and North Eastern Railway used them very widely. The Southern Railway used them for a while but later removed them.|$|R
50|$|The <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> may {{be mounted}} {{directly}} on the cylinders or steam chests. The drawback of this arrangement is that they admit cold air which cools the cylinders and leads to condensation when the steam is turned on again.|$|R
50|$|A {{pressure}} relief valve was fitted to the cylinder covers and <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> were fitted to the steam chests. Lubrication of the cylinders and piston valves was {{by means of a}} Ritter six-piston oil press, which was arranged in the cab at the right hand side of the engine and actuated from the trailing crank pin.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{superheater}} is fitted, {{one or two}} <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> may {{be mounted}} on the [...] "wet" [...] side of the superheater header. This causes air to be drawn through the superheater and heated so that it keeps the cylinders warm. Different railways had different ideas about the merits of drawing air through the superheater elements when coasting.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} {{shuts off the}} steam to the {{cylinders}} of a steam locomotive while it is in motion, the moving pistons could create a partial vacuum in the cylinders. This would give rise to two problems. Firstly, the pumping action would absorb energy and prevent the engine from coasting freely. Secondly, when the exhaust valve opened, soot and cinders from the smokebox could be sucked down the exhaust pipe and into the valve chest or cylinder, causing damage. (The exhaust {{is open to the}} smokebox because in normal running the exhaust steam is sent through the blastpipe to draw the fire and eject the combustion products from the chimney.) These problems are avoided by using <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> to allow air to be drawn into the cylinder. On railways which did not use <b>snifting</b> <b>valves,</b> drivers were instructed to keep the regulator slightly open when coasting to avoid the creation of a vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Further similar {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on Class 5B no. 726 in September 1931, Class 16B no. 805 in July 1932, Class 16DA no. 876 in August 1932, Class 15CA no. 2852 in March 1933 and finally on Class 15A no. 1961. The results of these extended tests did not prove entirely satisfactory and all these engines were gradually refitted with standard piston <b>valves</b> and <b>snifting</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first such}} {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on Class 16C no. 851. Further similar experiments were carried out on Class 16B no. 805 in July 1932, Class 16DA no. 876 in August 1932, Class 15CA no. 2852 in March 1933 and finally on Class 15A no. 1961.

500|$|In 1937, Maunsell's {{replacement}} Oliver Bulleid saw no need {{to improve}} draughting of the class, and spared them from trials with Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipes and wide-diameter chimneys. However, he had Maunsell's smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> removed {{at the end of}} the Second World War in an effort to reduce maintenance. Bulleid also had eight new [...] tenders built specially for the left-hand drive locomotives. In 1947, No.1831 was given electric lighting and converted to oil-burning as part of government-backed fuel trials in anticipation of a post-war coal shortage, though it was reverted to coal-firing in December 1948.|$|R
50|$|There were {{originally}} eight cams for forward motion and three for reverse, which gave {{a range of}} cut-offs from 15% to 85% in forward gear. The hand reversing screw spindle carried a disk, suitably notched with a locking device {{to ensure that the}} cam rollers would be in the centre of the selected cams under working conditions. During drifting, the reversing gear is placed in the neutral position where the exhaust valves are held fully open. These conditions were ideal for drifting and superior to any Walschaerts valve gear in admitting steam to the steam chests, even with cylinders equipped with by-pass <b>valves,</b> <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> and drifting valves.|$|R
5|$|Construction of {{the delayed}} 1926 order for 20 K class {{locomotives}} began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification. As {{a result of}} Harold Holcroft’s position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new-builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox <b>snifting</b> <b>valves,</b> {{both of which were}} used on the K and N class locomotives.|$|R
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|R
50|$|First engines {{had large}} steam domes, open cabs and C16 style tenders. Those built from 1938 onwards, commencing with N°858, had small steam domes, sedan cabs with welded tenders and also larger {{diameter}} (9+1/2 in) piston valves. The {{two types of}} boilers were occasionally interchanged at overhauls and by later years most of the old style ones had been replaced. The last 40 engines, N°961 to N°1000, were fitted with Timken roller bearings and painted brown. They acquired the nickname of Brown Bombers after American boxer Joe Louis. Those overhauled {{in the last years}} of steam operations were repainted black. A number of modifications were carried out over their life including the fitting of large mushroom air <b>snifting</b> <b>valves.</b> Several had additional sandboxes and/or rear headlights fitted at various times for working lines where no turning facilities were available.|$|R
50|$|The Trofimoff {{piston valve}} {{consisted}} of two fixed discs secured to the valve spindle, and two junk rings, each carrying a bull ring and four valve rings and both free to move longitudinally on the spindle. When the regulator is opened, steam forces the loose valve bodies against their respective fixed discs and they then act as units, similar to ordinary piston valves. When steam is shut off, the loose valve heads become detached from their respective discs and remain in their idle positions near {{the centre of the}} steam chest, while the valve spindle and fixed disks continue their reciprocating motion with the spindle sliding freely through the now stationary loose valve heads, and with the steam and exhaust ports now in communi&shy;ca&shy;tion. With both ends of the cylinders now in communication, the use of ordinary by-bass or <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> became unnecessary.|$|R
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. <b>Snifting</b> <b>valves</b> were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|R
5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke deflector plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|R
50|$|Other visible {{differences}} are larger mechanical lubricators and external {{drive from the}} valve spindle, a vacuum ejector exhaust muffler {{just in front of}} the safety valves, pipes conveying exhaust and ejector steam to the ashpan for mixing with the primary air, the secondary air inlets in the firebox sides with spark arresting plates outside them, and the <b>snifting</b> and bypass <b>valves</b> which were removed and blanked off since the modified locomotive drifted in mid-gear with steam supplied from the drifting valve.|$|R
500|$|Maunsell and Holcroft {{completed}} {{plans for}} a new 3-cylinder locomotive in 1919. Designated N1, the new design was an attempt to increase the operational flexibility and power of the SECR 2-6-0 without substantially increasing axle loading. Holcroft's previous employment as an engineer involved with the GWR's 4300class meant that the N1 used the same Churchward features as the Nclass to aid standardisation and the manufacture of parts. These included the use of long-travel valves for free running at speed, right-hand drive in the cab and [...] driving wheels. The retention of the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement meant ample accommodation for the Nclass' tapered boiler with Belpaire firebox. As with the Nclass, detail design on the N1 was left to another of Maunsell's assistants, James Clayton, who brought functional Midland Railway influences to the design: the loading gauge-friendly shape of the cab, the tender and the large-diameter smokebox. The smokebox housed a large superheater, regulator <b>valve</b> and <b>snifting</b> (anti-vacuum) <b>valves.</b> [...] The N1 also retained Walschaerts valve gear on both outside cylinders.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 49 The aim of pump {{development}} {{in recent years}} has been mainly reliability, safety, low maintenance, and the avoidance of dangerous leakages. For years, more and more rigid regulations against pollution and for better safety have been issued. Many reaction components have been classified toxic or dangerous, with the consequence of a great trend towards leak free systems. For oscillating displacement pumps, the plunger sealing is difficult due to high pressure, pulsating forces and sliding speed. If ever one finds a satisfactory solution for a difficult plunger seal, there remain the disadvantage of unavoidable low leakage, necessary skilled maintenance and low lifetime. The obvious separation of the pump?s liquid end from the drive mechanism by diaphragms has been realized for years in small metering pumps. The development climbed to increasing power of about 10 kW, so that actually, there is a dominance of the diaphragm towards piston pumps. Recently, the development of very large diaphragm pumps for process service, with power up to 500 kW, shows very reliable performances. Together with the total leak-free design the remarkable increase of reliability compared with conventional multiplex plunger pumps is very important. Many difficult fluids, such as abrasive suspensions, nonlubricating solvents or liquids gases can be pumped troublefree at pressures up to 1000 bar. For process service, the application of resistant fluor plastomer or metal diaphragms is a mus. The design, calculation, sealing, champing, fatigue, lifetime, and especially the future development, which is expected to reduce the dimensions, are explained. Long term applications have shown that diaphragm pumps actually perform to trouble-and maintenance-free service of many months. The most important step towards total safety was the development of sandwich diaphragm rupture monitoring systems. The hydraulic system and the alternative designs are compared. This has developed towards automatic position-control of the diaphragm. Safety, venting and <b>snifting</b> <b>valves</b> and their control are very important. Some remarks deal with fatigue and wear problems at high pressure of components like thick walled parts and valves, and with design of the drive units and their control. An important condition for reliable service of high pressure diaphragm pumps is the restriction of pressure vibrations in the piping system and avoiding any cavitation. There is a significant influence of fluid compressibility on displacement characteristics and stimulation of pipe vibrations. A computation method including dampers is outlined...|$|R
