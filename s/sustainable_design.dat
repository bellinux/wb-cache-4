Design {{management has}} been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the European Union as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations. The main issues and debates included the topics of design thinking, strategic design management, design leadership, and product service systems. Design management {{was influenced by the}} following design trends: <b>sustainable</b> <b>design,</b> inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and design thinking.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Research that investigates how {{interior}} designers use environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> {{criteria in}} their design solutions {{has not been}} done. To provide a base to develop education strategies for <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design,</b> {{this study examined the}} state of environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> practice. Approach: A national, Internet-based survey of interior design practitioners was conducted. To collect data, the random sample of US interior design practitioners was drawn from the American Society of Interior Designers membership list. Environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> practice was defined by three factors: Global <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design,</b> indoor environmental quality and interior materials. For each statement about environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> practice, respondents were asked to rate three dimensions: frequency of application, importance to the designers firm and importance to the designer. Descriptive statistical analysis focused on the state of environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> practice. Results: Every statement to measure environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> practice showed the highest mean score in the category of importance to the designer and the lowest mean score in the category of frequency of application. Important to designers firm ratings were always between these two extremes. Use of sustainable interior materials was identified as a less frequently applied component of environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> than indoor environmental quality. Conclusion/Recommendations: The application of environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> practice did not reach the same level as its perceived importance. Teaching methods that improve environmentally <b>sustainable</b> interior <b>design</b> practice and an understanding of the life cycle impact of interior materials are needed...|$|R

Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.|$|E
