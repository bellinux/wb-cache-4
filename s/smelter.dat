5|$|Both {{buildings}} {{were designed by}} architects Yorke Rosenberg Mardall, with engineering consultation from Engineering & Power Consultants Ltd. The power station was constructed by Tarmac Construction and the <b>smelter</b> by M.J. Gleeson Company. Both the power station and <b>smelter</b> were brought into operation in March 1972.|$|E
5|$|William Champion's brother, John, {{patented}} {{a process}} in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process. Prior to this, only calamine {{could be used to}} produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort <b>smelter.</b> Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc <b>smelter</b> in Belgium that processed even more zinc.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{extension}} did {{not make}} a great deal of difference to the financial stability of the Chillagoe Company. The high cost of fuel for the <b>smelters,</b> a lack of ore, increasing wages, low metal prices and over-capitalisation on railways and <b>smelters</b> all contributed to the closure of the Chillagoe <b>smelters.</b> The Company asked for a government loan in February 1914 and when this was refused the company shut down its smelting and ore-buying operations. Ironically, the price of metal rose during the course of World War I, while the <b>smelters</b> were idle.|$|R
5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the <b>smelter.</b> This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and <b>smelter.</b> Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.|$|E
5|$|In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion {{patented}} {{a process}} to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort style <b>smelter.</b> His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the <b>smelter</b> during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the <b>smelter,</b> all exports now go to the grid.|$|E
5000|$|The Chillagoe <b>smelters</b> {{produced}} copper in 37 of {{the years}} between 1901 and 1943 and lead in 25 of those years. The <b>smelters</b> total production can be summarised as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|When WA Doyle made {{application}} in 1918 for assistance to re-establish the copper <b>smelters</b> Government Geologist Ball undertook investigations, the result being {{that there was}} insufficient ore to warrant a re-establishment of the <b>smelters.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of the local dispute and arbitration, COMINCO looked for ways to reduce the <b>smelter's</b> smoke output while increasing the <b>smelter's</b> production. The initial solution involved increasing the height of the smoke stacks to 409 feet in 1926 in an effort to disperse the <b>smelter's</b> smoke by pushing it higher into the atmosphere, but this local solution proved to be a problem for their Washington neighbours.|$|R
5|$|The strike had an {{immediate}} effect. By {{the end of}} February, every <b>smelter</b> in Colorado was either closed or running part-time. At the beginning of March, the Gold King and Granite mines gave in and resumed the eight-hour day.|$|E
5|$|After antiquity, {{mention of}} lead {{poisoning}} was absent from medical literature {{until the end}} of the Middle Ages. In 1656 the German physician Samuel Stockhausen recognized dust and fumes containing lead compounds as the cause of disease, called since ancient Roman times morbi metallici, that were known to afflict miners, <b>smelter</b> workers, potters, and others whose work exposed them to the metal.|$|E
5|$|After the war Matthais went to Brazil, {{where he}} helped build a {{hydroelectric}} facility. He joined the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1951, and {{was involved in}} the construction of its Kemano-Kitimat hydroelectric dam and aluminum <b>smelter</b> project in northern British Columbia and the Chute-des-Passes project in Quebec. He was a vice president at Kaiser Engineering from 1960 to 1973.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Metallothionein (MT) and {{two forms}} of {{superoxide}} dismutase (SOD), which are dependent on zinc and copper ions, are involved in defense against the same superoxide anion radicals and are present in extra- and intracellular compartments. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} MT concentration and Cu/Zn SOD activity in the plasma and erythrocyte lysate of the non-smoking and smoking <b>smelters.</b> Material and Methods: The investigations were performed in the blood of 300 male <b>smelters</b> and 100 non-exposed male subjects. We have measured zinc, copper, malondialdehyde (MDA) and MT concentrations as well as SOD activity. Results: We have observed an increase of Cu/Zn coefficient and decrease of Zn/Cu coefficient in the serum of <b>smelters</b> in comparison with the non-smoking control group. Concentration of MDA in the plasma of <b>smelters</b> was higher in comparison with its concentration in the non-smoking control group. The plasma and the erythrocyte lysate MT concentration increased significantly in the whole group of <b>smelters</b> as compared to the non-smoking control group. The mean value of MT concentration in plasma of the smoking <b>smelters</b> was above 2 -fold higher than in the non-smoking control group. The activity of Cu/Zn SOD in plasma of the smoking and non-smoking <b>smelters</b> was decreased in comparison with the smoking and non-smoking control groups, respectively. The lowest activity of Cu/Zn SOD, about 2 - 3 ‑fold decreased in comparison with the smoking and non-smoking control groups, was detected in plasma of the <b>smelters.</b> An inverse relationship was observed in the erythrocyte lysate. The highest activity of Cu/Zn SOD was reported in the erythrocyte lysate of the smoking <b>smelters</b> and it was about 2 -fold higher than in the non-smoking control group. Conclusions: In extracellular environment MT plays a crucial role in comparison with the SOD, while in the intracellular compartment Cu/Zn SOD and MT cooperate with each other...|$|R
50|$|Murray's {{industry}} suffered {{greatly in}} the 1930s depression. The <b>smelters</b> began {{to close in}} 1931, and major industry had nearly vanished by 1940. Murray was quick {{to take advantage of}} various federal projects to compensate for this economic loss. In 2000, to avoid designation as a Superfund site, the landmark ASARCO <b>Smelters</b> were imploded, and Intermountain Healthcare purchased the site for its Intermountain Medical Center. As landmarks, the <b>smelters</b> are remembered in Murray City’s logos and trademarks.|$|R

5|$|The {{direct or}} American process starts with diverse {{contaminated}} zinc composites, such as zinc ores or <b>smelter</b> by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with {{a source of}} carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect process. Because of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process {{as compared to the}} indirect one.|$|E

The <b>smelters</b> were administered by the Minister for Mines under the State Enterprises Act 1918 and under the Chillagoe and Etheridge Railways Act 1918.Smelting recommenced in January 1920 with one copper and one lead furnace in blast. The <b>smelters</b> settled into a steady run of seven years production, drawing their copper ore supplied from Einasleigh mine and lead ore from the Girofla mine at Mungana. Metal prices continued to decline.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} of the final closure the total debt was over £453,451, the figure on 31 March 1940 when the Co-ordinator General decided not to spend any more money on the Chillagoe <b>smelters</b> from the Income (State Development) Tax funds. The files on the {{disposal}} of the <b>smelters</b> equipment and machinery record the official dispersal of items on the <b>smelters</b> site. Small machines and tools went to the Collinsville State Coal Mine in 1946 and secondhand bricks were sold off to private buyers. Part of the <b>smelters</b> were dismantled in 1949 and delivered to other departmental operations. The Queensland Government wrote off the figure of £2,832 on 30 June 1954 when the only remaining assets were an unsaleable building valued at £50 and the annual rent of a horse paddock for £10.|$|R

When the Panic of 1893 occurred, investors found that Menage's properties were fraudulent. Many of the deeds were held by random names taken from the Minneapolis and Saint Paul telephone books, the properties themselves were unimproved, and the payments to investors were being made out of the bank's funds.|$|E
