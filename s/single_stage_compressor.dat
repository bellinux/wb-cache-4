40|$|An axially {{nonuniform}} type of rotor {{tip clearance}} was conceived and tried on a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compressor.</b> This concept {{is based on}} the advantages of a smaller tip clearance in the front portion of the blade and a larger clearance in the rear portion, which allows a higher tip leakage flow to interact with the passage secondary flow, casing wall boundary layer, separated flow on the blade suction surface and the scraping vortex, which are more prominent at the rear portion of the blade. Experimental results indicate that an axially nonuniform clearance can provide improved performance of a compressor stage.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a throughlow analysis tool {{based on a}} modern ¯nite-volume approach. The numerical model is obtained by averaging the 3 -D Navier-Stokes equations in the blade passage, keeping only the axisymmetric part of the equations. The averaging reduces the spatial dimension of the problem but introduces additional terms, the blade forces, which have to be modeled.

40|$|The {{process of}} stall {{inception}} in axial compressors {{has been studied}} by using time and space resolved measurements.

On both, stall transients were performed at different throttle rates, with and without inlet distortion. Each time, a period of small amplitude wave propagation is observed, with a travelling speed of approximately 30 % of rotor speed. This wave evolves into a stall cell without discontinuity in amplitude or angular position, showing that pre-stall travelling waves and stall cells are two stages of the same phenomenon.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the aerodynamic performance of an annular S-shaped duct representative of that used to connect the compressor spools of aircraft gas turbine engines. Measurements of both the mean flow and turbulent structure have been obtained using both 5 hole pressure probes and a 3 component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. The measurements indicate that development of the flow within the duct is complex and significantly influenced by the combined effects of streamwise pressure gradients and flow curvature. For inlet conditions in which boundary layers are developed along an upstream entry length the static pressure, shear stress and velocity distributions are presented. The data shows {{that as a result of}} flow curvature significant streamwise pressure gradients exist within the duct, with this curvature also affecting the generation and suppression of turbulence. The stagnation pressure loss within the duct is also assessed and is consistent with the measured distributions of shear stress. More engine representative conditions are provided by locating a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compressor</b> at inlet to the duct. Relative to the naturally developed inlet conditions the flow within the duct is less likely to separate, but mixing out of the compressor blade wakes increases the measured duct loss. With both types of inlet conditions the effect of a radial strut, such as that used for carrying loads and engine services, is also described both in terms of the static pressure distribution along the strut and its contribution to overall loss. The effects of inlet swirl on the flow field that develops within an annular S-shaped duct have also been investigated. By removing the outlet guide vanes from an upstream <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compressor</b> swirl angles in excess of 30 ° were generated. Results show that within the S-shaped duct tangential momentum is conserved, leading to increasing swirl velocities through the duct as its radius decreases. Furthermore, this component influences the streamwise velocity as pressure gradients are established to ensure the mean flow follows the duct curvature. Consequently in the critical region adjacent to the inner casing, where separation is most likely to occur, higher streamwise velocities are observed. Within the duct substantial changes also occur to the turbulence field which results in an increased stagnation pressure loss between duct inlet and exit. Data is also presented showing the increasing swirl angles through the duct which has consequences both for the design of the downstream compressor spool and of any radial struts which may be located within the duct...|$|E

The paper reports an experimental investigation into the possibility of increased interactions between combustor external aerodynamics and upstream components e. g. pre-diffuser, compressor OGV and even the compressor rotor, caused by the trend in lean module fuel injectors to larger mass flows entering the combustor cowl. To explore these component interaction effects, measurements were made on a fully annular rig comprising a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compressor,</b> an advanced integrated OGV/pre-diffuser, followed by a dump diffuser and a generic combustor flametube with metered cowl and inner/outer annulus flows. The flow split entering the cowl was increased from 30 % to 70 %. The results demonstrate that, with fixed geometry, as the injector flow increases, the performance of the pre-diffuser and feed annuli suffer. Pre-diffuser losses increase and at high injector flow rates the diffuser moves close to separation. The substantial circumferential variation in cowl flow can feed upstream and cause rotor forcing. Notable differences in performance were observed inline and between injectors at OGV exit, suggesting that geometry changes such as an increased dump gap or non axisymmetric pre-diffuser designs may be beneficial...|$|E
