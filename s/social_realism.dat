40|$|This paper {{examines}} policy outputs {{associated with}} the 2004 Bhutan antitobacco law, including 2009 amendments, {{to determine if the}} law is congruent with punctuated equilibrium or <b>social</b> policy <b>realism</b> theories of policy change. There was no direct and sudden tobacco policy output change in Bhutan due to a shock to the policy system contrary to what punctuated equilibrium theory would predict. Rather, policy change was sweeping but nonpunctuated. This paper reconfirms prior findings of <b>social</b> policy <b>realism</b> theory that various and complex policy output patterns occur due to a mixture of contingent and complex factors. Under <b>social</b> policy <b>realism,</b> a complex interplay of factors drive policy with the state, corporate actors, and interest groups, and the market often playing a primary role. These complex policy outputs have a direct impact on society and the natural environment reflected in government policy output actions or inactions...|$|R

Many of the angry young men of post-war literature were Northern, and working-class life in the face of deindustrialisation is depicted in novels such as Room at the Top (1959), Billy Liar (1959), This Sporting Life (1960) and A Kestrel for a Knave (1968).|$|E

The play's form is a dramaturgic fantasy, in which an employee of a tourist firm is eaten by her colleagues and the firm's president under a dressing; yet, in essence, the play is a theatrical satire on the Soviet reality. The author took arms against the falsehood, hypocrisy and dogmas, which invaded life and art with the beginning of Leonid Brezhnev's reign {{at the end of the}} Khrushchev «thaw».

40|$|This paper {{underlines the}} {{importance}} of the distinction between 'social' and 'system' integration (agency and structure) introduced by David Lockwood in 1964. Its four sections (i) examine the original difficulty of maintaining any distinction between the 'parts' of society and its 'people' against the social ontology of Individualism whose proponents argued that the former must always be reduced to the latter as individuals were the ultimate constituents of society, (ii) shows how collectivist opposition held 'systemic factors' to be indispensable in sociological explanations, but could not substantiate their ontological status against the charge of reification whilst empiricism held sway, (iii) explores how once the individualist/collectivist debate was superseded, Lockwood's distinction was redefined in structuration theory, where insistence on treating structure and agency as mutually constitutive effectively denied their independent variation and thus reduced the 'social' and the 'systemic' to differences in the scale of social practices; (iv) argues that <b>social</b> <b>realism's</b> ontology, in which 'structures' and 'agents' belong to different emergent strata of social reality, avoids reducing one to the other or eliding the two. Instead it supplies the ontological grounding for Lockwood's distinction and enables it to be developed into an explanatory programme-analytical dualism-whose central tenet is the need to explore the interplay between these two irreducible constituents of social reality in order to account for why things are 'so and not otherwise' and in a manner which is of direct utility to practical analysts of society...|$|R

25|$|Cankar's {{work and}} his {{personal}} world view influenced all three major literary trends in Slovene literature between 1918 and 1945: the expressionism of Catholic authors such as Ivan Pregelj, Stanko Majcen, and France Bevk, the <b>social</b> <b>realism</b> of the liberal left and Marxist authors (particularly Miško Kranjec, Prežihov Voranc, Ciril Kosmač, and Mile Klopčič) and the avantgardism of Srečko Kosovel. During the same period, Cankar's political ideas influenced the Slovene social-democratic ideologist Etbin Kristan, the Christian Democratic political theorist Andrej Gosar and the democratic thinkers Albin Prepeluh and Dragotin Lončar.

Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for <b>social</b> <b>realism</b> in prose.

40|$|Numerous {{researchers}} have confirmed sharp and punctuated policy change. Newer findings in U. S. forest {{policy in the}} Pacific Northwest and U.

25|$|History of Slovene {{literature}} {{began in}} the 16th century with Primož Trubar and other Protestant Reformers.

In the 20th century, the Slovene literary fiction went through several periods: {{the beginning of the}} century was marked by the authors of the Slovene Modernism, with the most influential Slovene writer and playwright, Ivan Cankar; it was then followed by expressionism (Srečko Kosovel), avantgardism (Anton Podbevšek, Ferdo Delak) and <b>social</b> <b>realism</b> (Ciril Kosmač, Prežihov Voranc) before World War II, the poetry of resistance and revolution (Karel Destovnik Kajuh, Matej Bor) during the war, and intimism (Poems of the Four, 1953), post-war modernism (Edvard Kocbek), and existentialism (Dane Zajc) after the war.|$|E
25|$|Why {{this style}} gained {{mainstream}} acceptance in the 1950s {{is a matter}} of debate. American <b>social</b> <b>realism</b> had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the Great Depression, but also by the muralists of Mexico such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as The Art of This Century Gallery. The McCarthy era after World War II was a time of artistic censorship in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally abstract then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.|$|E
25|$|American Scene {{painting}} and the <b>Social</b> <b>Realism</b> and Regionalism movements that contained {{both political and}} social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists like Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, George Tooker, John Steuart Curry, Reginald Marsh, and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the Uruguayan painter Joaquín Torres García and Rufino Tamayo from Mexico, the muralist movement with Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, José Orozco, Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martinez Delgado and the Symbolist paintings by Frida Kahlo began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. Frida Kahlo's Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the Magic Realism movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self-portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{three different}} but interrelated theoretical strands associated with contemporary society-nature debates; namely <b>social</b> constructionism, <b>realism</b> and ecological modernisation. By using empirical evidence from {{a case study}} of community and forestry interactions in a South Wales ex-mining village, the paper argues for the need to incorporate into these theoretical debates a deeper analysis of community understandings and practices. It argues that variable aspects of nature are a critical element in understanding social community change, just as the latter is important in shaping the value and worth attributed to natural relations. The analysis begins to identify some of the conceptual and empirical gaps which exist in the theoretical interstices between the three approaches; suggesting a need to focus more effectively on aspects of community construction and practice, evolving governance and local embeddedness. These factors become important conceptual bridges in the larger social science quest to relate human materialities much more effectively to natural materialities (and vice versa) ...|$|R

40|$|Multilingualism is a {{fact that}} has shaped and is shaping the {{linguistic}} set-up of our societies. Fictional texts also have a long tradition of drawing on polyglottal means, a fact that has been studied in many different disciplines. This chapter sketches the different research traditions that explore the phenomenon. It touches especially on the techniques of incorporating different languages in the same fictional text, such as attempts at presenting authentic multilingual renditions as well as simplifying the multilingual situation in processes that draw on the potential of linguistic indexicality, translation and contextual embedding. The main focus lies on the potential pragmatic effects that the texts can achieve, such as scene creation/enrichment, character creation, the creation of humor, the display of <b>social</b> criticism, <b>realism</b> and ideological debates of difference and belonging. For a text to work it is rarely necessary to transpose multilingual reality entirely in all its complexity into a fictional text. However, the ways in which multilingualism does occur in fiction deserve to be studied in their own right...|$|R
