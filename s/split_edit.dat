50|$|A <b>split</b> <b>edit,</b> is a {{transition}} from one shot to another in film or video, where transition of the audio and video happen at different times. This is often done to enhance the aesthetics or flow of the film, allowing the audience to see context—either before or after—of speaking rather than simply the speaking itself. Without <b>split</b> <b>edit,</b> a conversation between two people can feel like a tennis match.|$|E
50|$|With {{proliferation}} of computer-based non-linear editing different variants of <b>split</b> <b>edit</b> received their own names {{based on how}} the video being edited is presented on the timeline. A variant of <b>split</b> <b>edit</b> when the audio from preceding scene overlaps the video from the following scene is known as L cut. If the audio from the following scene overlaps the video from the preceding scene, then this cut is known as J cut.|$|E
50|$|An L cut is {{a variant}} of a <b>split</b> <b>edit</b> film editing {{technique}} in which the audio from preceding scene overlaps the picture from the following scene, so that the audio cuts after the picture, and continues playing over {{the beginning of the}} next scene.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>split</b> <b>edits</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as overlapping the sound, {{not to be confused with}} overlapping dialogue, where the latter involves laying one sound track over another sound track.|$|R

50|$|<b>Split</b> <b>edits</b> {{are also}} used to hide {{transitions}} between scenes. They can be very effective in editing dialog scenes shot with a single camera using multiple takes. The ability to cut the picture/video separately from the sound/audio allows the sound from the various takes to flow smoothly, even though the picture cuts are at different places. In longer shots, this allows the editor to use the picture from one take with the sound from another take if the dialog reading is better.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Given an {{undirected graph}} G and a {{positive}} integer k, the NP-hard Sparse <b>Split</b> Graph <b>Editing</b> problem asks to transform G into a graph that consists of a clique plus isolated vertices by performing at most k edge insertions and deletions; similarly, the P 3 -Bag Editing problem asks to transform G into a graph which is the union of two possibly overlapping cliques. We give a simple linear-time 3 -approximation algorithm for Sparse <b>Split</b> Graph <b>Editing,</b> an improvement over a more involved known factor- 3. 525 approximation. Further, we show that P 3 -Bag Editing is NP-complete. Finally, we present a kernelization scheme for both problems and additionally for the 2 -Cluster Editing problem. This scheme produces for each fixed ε in polynomial time a kernel of order εk. This is, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, the first example of a kernelization scheme that converges to a known lower bound. ...|$|R

Although only two helicopters were used, post-production techniques such as <b>split</b> screen <b>editing,</b> camera angles and CGI produced the huge number of helicopters seen in the video.|$|R

So I decided to give consideration to the problem of split screen at my Batchelor theoretical work. I would like to focus on specification of using this technique and some crags of it. I built some examples of practical situations and I indicate differences between classical and <b>split</b> screen <b>editing</b> on them. I propose concept of split screen film making from preparing to post production as well...|$|R

40|$|The blues, {{having been}} {{fundamental}} to the history and heritage of African Americans, can help kids find themselves and their cultures in the language-based activities {{that are part of}} the writing program at School # 74 in Buffalo, New York. One of the chapters in the student anthology which resulted from the university/school cooperative program contains poetry written as blues, specifically 12 -bar blues. Objectives of the poetry-as-blues activity were to reinforce the writing process; to provide "fun" writing without the realization that learning was present; and to show that solid and meaningful writing could and should come from what students know. During the first class session, the 12 -bar blues lessons were accompanied by a handout that illustrated the structure and AAB format of the 12 -bar verse. During the second session, time was <b>split</b> between <b>editing</b> and performing (with guitar accompaniment...|$|R

Nicecast combines Audio Hijack's {{ability to}} capture audio with the open source Icecast streaming media system to enable users to broadcast audio from any program over the internet. Airfoil {{allows for the}} transmission of any audio through the remote speaker system of Apple's AirPort Express, which currently only supports audio from iTunes. Fission is an audio file editor designed to be simple and user-friendly. It has basic operations like fading and <b>splitting,</b> and can <b>edit</b> MP3 files without losing quality to recompression.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{exploration}} of multidimensional datasets {{has become a}} common task in the last years. Information Visualization has many techniques which can handle this kind of data. For example, we have parallel coordinates, scatter plots, glyphs mapping, multidimensional projections, etc [...] In this document we report some theoretical aspects and classification of the multidi-mensional projection techniques, specially those ones which are applied on visualization. Furthermore we present two user cases where the multidimensional projections were successfully used. Former presents the combination of Parallel Coordinates (PC) and Multidimensional Projection (MP) to find patterns in two source of climate datasets (model output and model structure data). Here, the PC’s view is used to represent the model structure and the MP’s view represents the model outputs. Using linked views we can explore and find some interesting patterns showing the model output’s behavior based on the metadata. Latter uses the Multidimensional Projection technique in combination with a Topic Modeling Algorithm (TMA). Here the MP is used to do a post-processing on the TMA’s output and get feedback from the user. The feedback is captured by allowing the user {{to interact with the}} projection view doing three kind of operations: merge, <b>split</b> and <b>edit</b> topics. These operators have mathematical foundations in order to not increase the error presented initially...|$|R
5000|$|Helicon Filter's live preview {{can be used}} {{in either}} simple mode (commercial and {{freeware}} versions) or expert mode (commercial versions only). Simple mode allows the user to control aspects of the picture with fewer sliders, fewer brushes, no equalizers and no Aberrations filter, while expert mode gives the user more sliders along with equalizer control. Live preview can be used to show the final image after editing, can show a <b>split</b> between the <b>edited</b> version and the original, and can show images as a full-screen preview. Right-clicking causes the image preview to temporarily be replaced with the original version. A slider exists to select custom zoom, and in most filter tabs, a magnifying class can be used to view portions of a picture at higher magnification. In some filters, an [...] "edit map" [...] can be used to view which areas which will be affected from those filters. There is also a filter-guide wizard to help in going through a workflow of the different filter tabs.|$|R
40|$|This DVD {{presents}} {{the making of}} a hybrid performance/lecture-demonstration which was first devised as a presentation of artistic process as part of ResCen's Nightwalking Conference in September 2002. The work and the DVD are designed to un-pick and expose the layers of exploration within the creative process. Intimacies, subtleties and fruitful accidents are revealed locating the audience as witnesses to the dancers' thought processes and physical challenges, as well as hearing my struggles and discoveries as choreographer: many are stimulated by the writings of Niki Pollard. Simultaneously an intimate duet unfolds between the dancers. The DVD uses non-linear, multimedia potential of interaction as a means to document both the making and the performance. It includes rehearsal footage, notebooks, and other material that influenced the creation of the work as well as a detailed <b>split</b> screen <b>edit</b> of the performance itself. It exposes the ways that the dancers, Eddie Nixon and Henrietta Hale, and the choreographer communicate together in the studio as well as with their audience in performance. The work raises questions and dilemmas for the maker, the performers and the audience: for example, {{what is the nature of}} performing in this context? Does the audience gain from knowing more? Is improvisation or set material the best means of reflecting a relationship in dance? How can one describe the process in words without destabilising what is understood to be the audience experience? Collaborators: Dancers Henrietta Hale and Eddie Nixon. Choreographed in collaboration with the dancers. Writing by Rosemary Lee and Niki Pollard. Documentation design and production: Ludivine Allegue: Camera/Sound recording during the rehearsals: Peter Anderson and Ludivine Allegue...|$|R
5000|$|Emacs can <b>split</b> the <b>editing</b> area into {{separate}} sections called [...] "windows," [...] {{a feature that}} has been available since 1975, predating the graphical user interface in common use. In Emacs terminology, [...] "Windows" [...] are similar to what other systems call [...] "frames" [...] or [...] "panes" [...] - a rectangular portion of the program's display that can be updated and interacted with independently. Each Emacs window has a status bar called the [...] "mode line" [...] displayed by default at the bottom edge of the window. Emacs windows are available both in text-terminal and graphical modes and allow more than one buffer, or several parts of a buffer, to be displayed at once. Common applications are to display a dired buffer along with the contents of files in the current directory (there are special modes to make the file buffer follow the file highlighted in dired), to display the source code of a program in one window while another displays a shell buffer {{with the results of}} compiling the program, to run a debugger along with a shell buffer running the program, to work on code while displaying a man page or other documentation (possibly loaded over the World Wide Web using one of Emacs' built-in web browsers) or simply to display multiple files for editing at once such as a header along with its implementation file for C-based languages. In addition, there is follow-mode, a minor mode that chains windows to display non-overlapping portions of a buffer. Using follow-mode, a single file can be displayed in multiple side-by-side windows that update appropriately when scrolled. Emacs windows are tiled and cannot appear [...] "above" [...] or [...] "below" [...] their companions. Emacs can launch multiple [...] "frames", which are displayed as individual windows in a graphical environment. On a text terminal, multiple frames are displayed stacked filling the entire terminal, and can be switched using the standard Emacs commands.|$|R
40|$|The essay dwells on {{some aspects}} of {{contemporary}} art and theory in Belgrade. It is mainly concerned with artistic and theoretical practices who are based on models of “doing” (more generally then “performing”) and who question their own position in contemporary life in their city. The first case study is the artist collective Umetnik* (Artist*), a collective of two young artists who appeared in 2012 {{with a couple of}} performances in public space. Their aim is to create space and visibility for younger artists who are not able to enter the very small cultural circles, which are dominated for years by the same players. Another aspect of their work is to criticize the fact that major cultural institutions (as the Museum for Contemporary Art) have been closed for a long time. The second example is the theoretical position of the collective Prelom (<b>Split)</b> that was <b>editing</b> a same-titled magazine for images and politics. Apart from discursive work the group also engaged in political action against privatizations and in the analysis of transition and its consequences for society. Similar to Prelom that takes a clear Marxist standpoint, the curators of Pančevo biennial 2012 (Nikola Dedić and Aneta Stojnić) try to find trajectories for the future in analysis of history, i. e. anti-nationalist and communist history of Yugoslavia. The fourth case study, the cooperative Treći Beograd, on the other hand operates with the term utopia when working on alternative models for society. These artists are creating a physical and mental space that consists of a building they constructed themselves on Danube bank opposite of the city center as well as of their ephemeral activities, which take place either in this building or in public space. Their work operates right on the border between autonomy and public visibility. The essay ends with a short historical survey of the possible models of artistic agency that finds its correspondence in the presented projects...|$|R
