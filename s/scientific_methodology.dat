5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research {{based on the assumption that}} the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology.</b>|$|E

25|$|Eysenck made early {{contributions}} to {{fields such as}} personality by express and explicit commitment to a very rigorous adherence to <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology,</b> as Eysenck believed that <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology</b> was required for progress in personality psychology. He used, for example, factor analysis, a statistical method, to support his personality model. An example is Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study, quoted above. His early work showed that Eysenck was an especially strong critic of psychoanalysis {{as a form of}} therapy, preferring behaviour therapy. He was particularly critical of Freud and his methods and wrote a book criticising them entitled Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire.|$|E

25|$|In 1928 Ido's major {{intellectual}} supporter, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, abandoned Ido, {{and published}} his own planned language, Novial. It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Occidental, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido.

25|$|Determining {{the balance}} of how the several effects of reuse {{interact}} is often best accomplished by a formal life cycle assessment. For example, {{research has shown that}} reusing a product can reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint by more than 50% relative to the complete product life cycle. A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint is reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the supply chain is unknown. A <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology</b> has been developed to calculate how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used or second hand hardware versus new hardware, the so-called durability greener network calculator.|$|E

25|$|When he {{approached}} Pearson and the English university system, Georgescu was amazed with the informality and openness he found. There {{was no more}} feeling like a métèque, a stranger. Studying with Pearson {{for the next two}} years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu's <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology</b> and philosophy. The two men even made a friendship, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics. They co-pioneered research on the so-called 'problem of moments', one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither of them were able to solve the problem. This was a great disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu was pleased about experiencing their joint effort nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% carbolic solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution. He also introduced the steam steriliser to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology</b> toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, Hickman {{then worked}} for the American Piano Company (also known as Ampico), {{improving}} the company's player piano products. The inventor of the Ampico piano, Charles Fuller Stoddard, needed a physicist and mathematician to develop improvements to reproducing instruments as well as manufacturing aspects of automatic pianos. He employed Hickman in this role at a research laboratory that Ampico established in 1924 at the Chickering Hall in New York. Hickman's work enabled the development of Ampico's dynamic recording machine and the Model 'B' player piano. Author Larry Givens wrote: Dr. Hickman's employment with American Piano Company, from 1924 {{through the end of}} 1929, may accurately be said to represent the only period {{in the history of the}} player piano industry in which real <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology</b> was applied to the development of the player piano. Most development work in the industry had theretofore consisted of scratch-paper sketches and empirical constructing of models with hopes that they would function! For his achievements at Ampico, Hickman was inducted into the Automatic Musical Instruments Collector's Association Hall of Fame in 1976.|$|E

500|$|While {{philosophical}} thought {{pertaining to}} science dates {{back at least}} to the time of Aristotle, philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only {{in the middle of the}} 20th century in the wake of the logical positivism movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. Thomas Kuhn's landmark 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was also formative, challenging the view of scientific progress as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a [...] "paradigm," [...] the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period. Karl Popper and Charles Sanders Peirce moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for <b>scientific</b> <b>methodology.</b>|$|E

40|$|In a {{state of}} {{voluntary}} trance or meditation, the perception of reality appears to extend beyond the usual and temporal boundaries that are normally perceived by the sense organs. It is argued that the problems of validity and reliability of trance experiences for scientific discourse are in principle no different than {{the problems associated with}} ordinary perception. The shift in early Greek philosophy from myth to and emphasis on logos (reason) has led to a neglect of those subtle qualities of reason that were considered to be gateways for divine revelation. <b>Scientific</b> <b>methodologies</b> cannot account for such revelation, and there are no criteria known to science that would enable people to utilize these phenomena. Shamanic experiences are intersubjectively accessible and provide data that is suitable for the construction of rational theories if appropriate methodologies are developed. However, for a scientist, shamanic experiences are considered at most to be psychological ones, and consequently without any value for empirical research. This article examines the possibility of reevaluating the terms "rationalâ€? and "consciousness,â€? in order to expand <b>scientific</b> <b>methodologies</b> {{in such a way that}} volitionally altered perceptions of reality can be integrated into scientific research...|$|R
