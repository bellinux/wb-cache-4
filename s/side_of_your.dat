The {{recording}} sessions {{took place in}} studios around California and New York City, including Electric Lady Studios in New York, The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, Conway Recording Studios, The Record Plant and NRG Recording Studios in Hollywood. According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought. She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> voice. But I thought the lyrics on this record are so personal, deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than what I could do with my voice technically".|$|E

2500|$|Modeliste {{grew up in}} the 13th Ward of New Orleans. The {{eldest of}} six siblings, he was raised in part by his grandmother, Lula Blouin. His first drum set was a three-piece paid for by Blouin. He was nicknamed Zigaboo at age ten by a {{neighborhood}} kid, and by junior high school the name had stuck. His drumming style was influenced by Smokey Johnson, Bob French and other New Orleans drum greats as he learned by watching them perform at gigs. He said listening to other musicians was {{the most important part of}} his learning process. He particularly tried to emulate Smokey Johnson's style. He started playing gigs at an early age including a stint with The Hawketts, a band led by Art Neville at the time. Over time the band evolved into The Neville Sounds and by late 1960s into The Meters. In a 2013 interview with Modern Drummer, Modeliste said: [...] "Your biggest teachers were those two things you got on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head. (...) It's got nothing to do with rudiments, nothing to do with time signatures, but it's got a lot to do with what you hear." ...|$|E
