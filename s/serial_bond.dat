Although it is often acknowledged that NIC is a defective measure of the interest cost and sometimes a costly one to the issuer, an alternative measure, the TIC (true interest cost, effective interest cost, interest cost according to the Canadian method, or the {{internal rate of return}}) is often regarded as too computationally difficult to employ. State and local governments are becoming increasingly aware of the internal rate of return or TIC as a measure of interest expense. The use of TIC as a method of awarding bond issues to underwriters is growing very rapidly. This paper contains a simple computer algorithm for calculating optimal bids on a TIC basis. ...|$|E

The first step towards nationalisation of Putra-LRT took place on 26 November 2001 when Prasarana acquired all the rights, benefits and entitlements under the loan from Putra-LRT's and also Star-LRT's lenders (see below for takeover of Star-LRT). This effectively made Prasarana the creditor of Putra-LRT and Star-LRT. The loans owed by both companies stood at approximately RM5.7 billion at that time. The purchase consideration was satisfied via the issuance of RM5.468 billion fixed rate <b>serial</b> <b>bonds</b> by Prasarana guaranteed by the government to the respective Star-LRT and Putra-LRT lenders. According to the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee, the successful resolution of the debt restructuring of the two companies was estimated to have reduced the level of non-performing loans in the Malaysian banking system by RM2.9 billion or 0.7% on a net six-month basis.

In the theoretical part of the paper, the structure and functioning of the photovoltaic cells are discussed. The {{first part of the}} paper also explains how the photovoltaic cells which generate direct current function in larger systems. In the theoretical part of the paper, also includes a chapter which analyses the function of current transducers /converters. The issue of the efficiency of photovoltaic cells and the influence of the parameters, such as: the density of solar radiation, the temperature of the photovoltaic panel, the illumination angle, the size of the surface and the number of solar cells that have parallel and <b>serial</b> <b>bonds,</b> are addressed as well in this chapter. At the end of the theoretical part, the influence of the photovoltaic cells on the environment is also presented. The empirical part of the thesis is dedicated to the analyses {{of the results of the}} measurements, which were carried out in the laboratory of the Faculty of Education, and the lesson plan for a middle school technology activity day. With the measurements, we analyzed the influence of different wavelengths of radiation and the illumination angle on the amount of the produced electricity and thus the efficiency of the photovoltaic cells under different circumstances. The results helped us to make a draft of the lesson plan for a middle school technology activity day on the efficiency of solar cells, keeping in mind that the main aim of the of the technology activity day is to inform the students about the alternative and clean sources of energy, such as solar power. The pre- and post- tests, and educational recommendations were also prepared in order to help the teachers to carry out the technology activity day on the efficiency of solar cells. ...|$|R

This paper discusses the valuation of a default-free sinking-fund bond issue in the Vasicek (1977) and, alternatively, the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR) (1985) frameworks. We show in particular that, calling the bond issue without the delivery option 'corresponding serial', and the one without the prepayment feature 'corresponding coupon', under no-arbitrage a sinking-fund bond can be priced either {{in terms of the}} corresponding coupon bond and a bond call option, or in terms of the corresponding <b>serial</b> and a <b>bond</b> put option. We also present a detailed comparative-statics analysis of our valuation model, where we show that a sinking-fund bond has a stochastic duration intermediate between the ones of the corresponding <b>serial</b> and coupon <b>bonds.</b> We argue that such a feature gives a further rational for the presence of the delivery option. Moreover, we compare our results with the ones of Ho (1985), who has previously discussed the valuation problem under scrutiny. sinking-fund bonds, delivery option, term structure models, Vasicek, CIR,...|$|R

The electrical interconnection lines are built on a glass substrate made of 500 / 2000 Å of Cr/Au with 3150 μm in length and 10 μm in width. Two silicon chips are processed as the device chips to be electrically interconnected. It has been demonstrated that 98 out of 102 interconnects are established in parallel with a successful rate of 96 % and the average resistance of the electroplating bond is 12 Ω. This process has potential applications in replacing the conventional, <b>serial</b> wire <b>bonding</b> or tape automated bonding (TAB) process for massive interconnection requirements in IC or MEMS devices.

50|$|The <b>bonded</b> <b>serial</b> bus {{architecture}} was chosen over the traditional parallel bus due to inherent {{limitations of the}} latter, including half-duplex operation, excess signal count, and inherently lower bandwidth due to timing skew. Timing skew results from separate electrical signals within a parallel interface traveling through conductors of different lengths, on potentially different printed circuit board (PCB) layers, and at possibly different signal velocities. Despite being transmitted simultaneously as a single word, signals on a parallel interface have different travel duration and arrive at their destinations at different times. When the interface clock period is shorter than the largest time difference between signal arrivals, recovery of the transmitted word is no longer possible. Since timing skew over a parallel bus can amount to a few nanoseconds, the resulting bandwidth limitation is {{in the range of}} hundreds of megahertz.|$|R

The discussion is limited to surface tension directed self-assembly where the capture, alignment, and electrical connection process {{is driven by the}} surface free energy of molten solder bumps where the authors have made a contribution. The general context is to develop a massively parallel and scalable assembly process to overcome some of the limitations of current robotic pick and place and <b>serial</b> wire <b>bonding</b> concepts. The following parts will be discussed: (2) Single-step assembly of LED arrays containing a repetition of a single component type; (3) Multi-step assembly of more than one component type adding a sequence and geometrical shape confinement to the basic concept to build more complex structures; demonstrators contain (3. 1) self-packaging surface mount devices, and (3. 2) multi-chip assemblies with unique angular orientation. Subsequently, measures are discussed (4) to enable the assembly of microscopic chips (10 μm– 1 mm); a different transport method is introduced; demonstrators include the assembly of photovoltaic modules containing microscopic silicon tiles. Finally, (5) the extension to enable large area assembly is presented; a first reel-to-reel assembly machine is realized; the machine is applied to the field of solid state lighting and the emerging field of stretchable electronics which requires the assembly and electrical connection of semiconductor devices over exceedingly large area substrates...|$|R
40|$|Municipal finance {{has been}} {{characterized}} {{in the past as}} being inefficient and outdated in developing tax-free debt issues, resulting in high costs to the issuers and taxpayers. A dynamic, competitive marketing environment combined with an increased need for funds has necessitated the application of improved decision making techniques in municipal finance. This research presents a multiple-objective based decision support system designed to aid the decision maker in determining the maturity structure and coupon rate assignments for a serial revenue debt issue. ^ The multiple-objective portion of the decision support system is formulated as a goal programming (GP) model. Goals deal with total interest costs, marketability, and debt servicing. The decision support system (DSS) combines the GP model with a group of pricing and statistical models that generate the required rate of return for the issues 2 ̆ 7 various maturities along with marketability, production and revenue flow information. Output from these DSS modules is then analyzed with regard to the purchase of insurance and the use of variable-rate or fixed-rate coupons. The DSS is designed to be flexible and work in an interactive fashion with the decision maker to aid {{in the development of a}} cost-effective minimal-risk <b>serial</b> revenue <b>bond</b> issue. This research begins with a review of the related literature followed by a presentation of the GP model and the DSS.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the physicochemical properties, sealing ability, cytotoxicity and bond strength of a new resin-based root canal sealer (NRCS). MethodsThe physicochemical properties were assessed by the flow, setting time, solubility, film thickness, radiopacity and dimensional changes. Sixty premolar root samples were filled with either Resilon/NRCS or Resilon/Epiphany and sectioned perpendicularly at the long axis at 2 mm below the cemento-enamel junction into 1 -mm <b>serial</b> slices. The <b>bond</b> strength was tested by a universal testing machine. The glucose microleakage model was used to test the sealing ability. Elutes of NRCS and Epiphany were co-cultured with human periodontal ligament cells to test the cytotoxicity. ResultsAll the physicochemical properties of NRCS conformed to ISO 6876 : 2001 (E). The root samples filled with Resilon/NRCS had significantly less leakage (p < 0. 01) and greater bond strength (p < 0. 001) than the Resilon/Epiphany group had. Environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that Resilon/NRCS filling material was intimately bonded to the root dentin. Although NRCS was slightly toxic to human periodontal ligament cells, its cytotoxicity was significantly less than that of Epiphany (p < 0. 01) ConclusionNRCS has better physicochemical and sealing properties, as well as lower cytotoxicity and microleakage than Epiphany ha...|$|R
40|$|Getting {{benefits}} of {{many kinds of}} coupon {{is not the only}} advantage of bond investment, but also it gives potential risks such as credit risk. Credit risk originates from the fact that counterparties may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations. Credit Value at Risk (CVaR) is introduced as a method to calculate bond credit risk if default occurs. CVaR is defined as the most significant credit loss which occurs unexpectedly at the selected level of confidence, measured as the deviation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL). To construct optimal bond portfolio requires Mean variance Efficient Portfolio (MVEP) method. MVEP is defined as the portfolio with minimum variance among all possible portfolios that can be formed. This study case has been constructed through two bonds, bond VI of Jabar Banten Bank (BJB) year 2009 <b>serial</b> B and <b>bond</b> of BTPN Bank I year 2009 serial B.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{cross-country}} {{differences in the}} underlying volatility and persistence of macroeconomic shocks help explain two historical regularities in sovereign borrowing: the existence of "vicious" circles of borrowing-and-default ("default traps"), {{as well as the}} fact that recalcitrant sovereigns typically face higher interest spreads on future loans rather than outright market exclusion. We do so in a simple model where output persistence is coupled with asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders about the borrower''s output process, implying that a decision to default reveals valuable information to lenders about the borrower''s future output path. Using a broad cross-country database spanning over a century, we provide econometric evidence corroborating the model''s main predictions-namely, that countries with higher output persistence and conditional volatility of transient shocks face higher spreads and thus fall into default traps more easily, whereas higher volatility of permanent output tends to dampen these effects.

40|$|Portfolio {{selection}} has a {{long tradition}} in financial economics and plays an integral role in investment management. Portfolio selection provides the framework to determine optimal portfolio choice from a universe of available investments. However, the asset weightings from portfolio selection are optimal only if the empirical characteristics of asset returns do not violate the portfolio selection model assumptions. This thesis explores the empirical characteristics of traditional assets and hedge fund returns and examines their effects on the assumptions of linearity-in-the-mean testing and portfolio selection. The encompassing theme of this thesis is the empirical interplay between traditional assets and hedge fund returns. Despite the paucity of hedge fund research, pension funds continue to increase their portfolio allocations to global hedge funds in an effort to pursue higher risk-adjusted returns. This thesis presents three empirical studies which provide positive insights into the relationships between traditional assets and hedge fund returns. The first two empirical studies examine an emerging body of literature which suggests that the relationship between traditional assets and hedge fund returns is non-linear. For mean-variance investors, non-linear asset returns are problematic as they do not satisfy the assumption of linearity required for the covariance matrix in portfolio selection. To examine the linearity assumption as it relates to a mean-variance investor, a hypothesis test approach is employed which investigates the linearity-in-the-mean of traditional assets and hedge funds. The findings from the first two empirical studies reveal that conventional linearity-in-the-mean tests incorrectly conclude that asset returns are nonlinear. We demonstrate that the empirical characteristics of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in asset returns are the primary sources of test mis-specification in these linearity-in-the-mean hypothesis tests. To address this problem, an innovative approach is proposed to control heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the underlying tests and it is shown that traditional assets and hedge funds are indeed linear-in-the-mean. The third and final study of this thesis explores traditional assets and hedge funds in a portfolio selection framework. Following the theme of the previous two studies, the effects of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation are examined in the portfolio selection context. The characteristics of <b>serial</b> correlation in <b>bond</b> and hedge fund returns are shown to cause a downward bias in the second sample moment. This thesis proposes two methods to control for this effect and it is shown that autocorrelation induces an overallocation to bonds and hedge funds. Whilst heteroscedasticity cannot be directly examined in portfolio selection, empirical evidence suggests that heteroscedastic events (such as those that occurred in August 1998) translate into the empirical feature known as tail-risk. The effects of tail-risk are examined by comparing the portfolio decisions of mean-variance analysis (MVA) versus mean-conditional value at risk (M-CVaR) investors. The findings reveal that the volatility of returns in a MVA portfolio decreases when hedge funds are included in the investment opportunity set. However, the reduction in the volatility of portfolio returns comes at a cost of undesirable third and fourth moments. Furthermore, it is shown that investors with M-CVaR preferences exhibit a decreasing demand for hedge funds as their aversion for tail-risk increases. The results of the thesis highlight the sensitivities of linearity tests and portfolio selection to the empirical features of heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation and tail-risk. This thesis contributes to the literature by providing refinements to these frameworks which allow improved inferences to be made when hedge funds are examined in linearity and portfolio selection settings...|$|R
