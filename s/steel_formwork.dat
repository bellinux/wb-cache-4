Limited quantities of cold steel plate were available, and the timber obtained by permit was to a considerable extent used as framing to which the steel plate was fixed.

Given the small size of construction site and increasing housing demand in Hong Kong, precast concrete has been frequently adopted in not only public residential buildings, but also the private sector. This study compares the carbon emissions of precast and traditional cast-in-situ construction methods based on a case study of a private residential building in Hong Kong. Life cycle assessment (LCA) model is established to consider the system processes from cradle to end of construction. The comparison is conducted based on eight scenarios at four levels, i. e. cubic meter concrete, precast facade, group of façade elements, and an apartment. It is found that the carbon emission of the studied residential apartment is 669 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per one square meter floor area.

A mechanical system was developed for pre-stressing the CFRP strips. The experimental program was composed by the following four types of RC column elements, all of cross section aspect ratio (larger to smaller edge ratio) of 2. 0 : 1) reference column without any confinement; 2) RC column fully wrapped with CFRP; 3) RC column confined with strips of CFRP; 4) RC column confined according to the new proposed technique. The columns have a cross section of 120 × 240 mm 2, height of 700 mm, and corner radius of 25 mm. All columns were subjected to axial compressive loading until their failures. The experimental results showed that the new proposed technique provides a significant increase of the load carrying capacity compared to the conventional strengthening techniques and the reference columns. Based on the obtained experimental results, the new proposed technique remarkably increased the confinement effectiveness of the rectangular RC columns.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the structural {{performance of the}} proposed prefabricated pad footing foundation using BRC as reinforcement and Cold-formed Steel Lipped Channel Section as permanent <b>formwork.</b> <b>Steel</b> bars or mesh has been used traditionally in reinforced concrete. Cold-formed Steel {{has the advantage of}} higher yield strength as an effect of cold working, plus its pre-galvanised metal has high resistance to corrosion. However, the use of Cold-formed Steel Lipped Channel Section for prefabrication of pad footing structures is yet to be established. Investigation has been carried out by examining the structural performance of both the proposed and typical footings. Experimental tests of 3 typical and 3 proposed pad footings were carried out in Structural and Material Lab, UTM. Comparison on the failure mode and ultimate load was made between the two set of specimens. The results shown that the proposed pad footing performed better compared to typical footing. It is concluded that pad footing foundation designed using Cold-formed Steel Lipped Channel Sections is feasible for construction...|$|R
