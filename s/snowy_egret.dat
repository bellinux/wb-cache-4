5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, <b>snowy</b> <b>egret,</b> great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked stilt, caracara and the black vulture.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of {{wildlife}} and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, Pacific halibut, and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California clapper rail, the <b>snowy</b> <b>egret,</b> and the black crowned night heron.|$|E
25|$|These include {{pied-billed grebe}} (Podilymbus podiceps), Neotropic {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), <b>snowy</b> <b>egret</b> (Egretta thula), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), whistling heron (Syrigma sibilatrix), black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) and osprey (Pandion haliaetus).|$|E
50|$|<b>Snowy</b> <b>egrets</b> are {{permanent}} residents in most of South America and Central America. In the United States, they are often {{permanent residents}} along the Atlantic coast north to Virginia Beach, Virginia, along the Gulf Coast, and along the Pacific lowlands from central California southward. During the breeding season, <b>snowy</b> <b>egrets</b> wander north along the Atlantic flyway between the lower Chesapeake Bay and coastal Rhode Island, and up the Pacific Coast to northern California. <b>Snowy</b> <b>egrets</b> also breed in the lower Mississippi Valley westward into eastern Texas. Birds banded in United States have been recovered {{as far away as}} Panama and Trinidad.|$|R
40|$|We report two {{previously}} undescribed foraging {{techniques used}} by <b>Snowy</b> <b>Egrets</b> (Egretta thula) and Yellow-crowned Night-Herons (Nyctanassa violacea) to catch crawfish (Procambarus spp.). <b>Snowy</b> <b>Egrets</b> were selecting crawfish that had recently molted their shells and Yellow-crowned Sight-Herons were targeting crawfish that were emerging from their burrows. These observations {{were conducted on}} commercial crawfish ponds near Catahoula, LA, USA...|$|R
50|$|<b>Snowy</b> <b>egrets</b> nest in colonies on thick {{vegetation}} {{in isolated}} places, such as barrier islands, dredge-spoil islands, salt marsh islands, swamps, and marshes. They often change location {{from year to}} year. During the breeding season, <b>snowy</b> <b>egrets</b> feed in estuaries, saltmarshes, tidal channels, shallow bays, and mangroves. They winter in mangroves, saltwater lagoons, freshwater swamps, grassy ponds, and temporary pools, and forage on beaches, shallow reefs, and wet fields.|$|R
25|$|Ardeidaes rest in salty ponds (<b>snowy</b> <b>egret,</b> green heron, western cattle egret, yellow-crowned night heron, tricolored heron, etc.) {{and living}} with the aquatic turtles, the common moorhen, the blue land crab, the blackback land crab, the sand fiddler crab and other species of crabs. The common kestrel is easily visible and audible during rides into the dry forest, like the zenaida dove, an endemic species of West Indies {{protected}} inside the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|As {{trees are}} drowned by rising beaver impoundments, they become ideal nesting sites for woodpeckers, which carve {{cavities}} that attract many other bird species, including flycatchers (Empidonax spp.), tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), tits (Paridae spp.), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), goldeneyes (Bucephala spp.), mergansers (Mergus spp.), owls (Tytonidae, Strigidae) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Piscivores, including herons (Ardea spp.), grebes (Podicipedidae), cormorants (Phalacrocorax ssp.), American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosa), great egret (Ardea alba), <b>snowy</b> <b>egret</b> (Egretta thula), mergansers, and belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon), use beaver ponds for fishing. Hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus), green heron (Butorides virescens), {{great blue heron}} (Ardea herodias) and belted kingfisher appeared more frequently in New York wetlands where beaver were active than at sites with no beaver activity.|$|E

60|$|As we went I {{saw that}} the {{regiment}} of the Amawombe, picked men every one of them, all fifty {{years of age or}} over, nearly four thousand strong, was marshalled on the dancing-ground, where they stood company by company. A magnificent sight they were, with their white fighting-shields, their gleaming spears, their otter-skin caps, their kilts and armlets of white bulls' tails, and the <b>snowy</b> <b>egret</b> plumes which they wore upon their brows. We rode to the head of them, where I saw Maputa, and as I came they greeted me with a cheer of welcome, for in those days a white man was a power in the land. Moreover, as I have said, the Zulus knew and liked me well. Also the fact that I was to watch, or perchance to fight with them, put a good heart into the Amawombe.|$|E

50|$|The {{capped heron}} is {{normally}} solitary, {{although there are}} cases {{where they have been}} found in couples or groups. Birds may be seen with other species such as <b>snowy</b> <b>egrets</b> (Egretta thula) and scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), however other studies have found that they avoid large mixed-species flocks, appearing in fewer than 1% of 145 observed feeding aggregations. Capped herons appear to be submissive to great egrets (Ardea alba), but dominant to <b>snowy</b> <b>egrets</b> (Egretta thula) and striated herons (Butorides striatus).|$|R

50|$|Interspecies roosts {{have been}} {{observed}} between different bird species. In San Blas, Mexico, the great egret (Ardea alba), the little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), the tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), and the <b>snowy</b> <b>egret</b> (Egretta thula) are known to form large communal roosts. It {{has been shown that}} the <b>snowy</b> <b>egret</b> determines the general location of the roost {{due to the fact that}} the other three species rely on it for its abilities to find food sources. In these roosts there is often a hierarchical system, where the more dominant species (in this case the <b>snowy</b> <b>egret)</b> will typically occupy the more desirable higher perches. Interspecies roosts have also been observed among other avian species.|$|E

50|$|White {{little blue}} herons often mingle with snowy egrets. The <b>snowy</b> <b>egret</b> tolerates their {{presence}} more than little blue herons in adult plumage. These young birds actually catch more fish {{when in the}} presence of the <b>snowy</b> <b>egret</b> and also gain a measure of protection from predators when they mix into flocks of white herons. It is plausible that because of these advantages, they remain white for their first year.|$|E
