25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and <b>stewing.</b> <b>Meat</b> was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{preferences}} of this regional cuisine is to combine the sweetness of a dish with a taste contrast like sour or salty. These combinations are also described as ‘Broken sööt’ which means ‘broken sweetness’ in English and is especially present in dishes which are ‘ssötsuur’ (sweet-sour).Many typical dishes feature this ‘broken-sööt-taste’ due to their preparation such as Holsteiner Sauerfleisch or Rübenmalheur. This impression mainly emerges from the association of tangy meat dishes with sweet side dishes {{such as in the}} famous stew Birnen, Bohnen und Speck. In this stew the sweetness of pears is combined with the hearty and rich bacon broth. In some dishes this taste combination is accomplished by <b>stewing</b> <b>meat</b> for a long time together with vegetables and is then being served e.g. with caramelized potatoes or some sugar to add and adjust sweetness after the cooking process.Often the sweetness is also due to dried fruit such as plums or raisins which are not only used as a stuffing for poultry but can also be served as a side dish to grilled meats or fish or being featured in chicken or beef broth.|$|E
