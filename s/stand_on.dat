The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
