They are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of the robotic arm on rocks and soils. Each camera in a pair is hardlinked to one of two identical main computers for redundancy; only four out of the eight cameras are in use at any one time. The cameras use visible light to capture stereoscopic three-dimensional (3-D) imagery. The cameras have a 120° field of view and map the terrain at up to 3 m in front of the rover. This imagery safeguards against the rover crashing into unexpected obstacles, and works in tandem with software that allows the rover to make its own safety choices.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{report a}} {{technique}} for {{the solution of}} an intraoperative complication occurred during penile prosthetic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A 70 -year-old patient underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy in 2004 due to a prostate cancer - Gleason 6 (3 + 3) pT 2 N 0 M 0. The erectile dysfunction subsequently observed was not responsive to oral or intracavernosal drug administration, so a malleable penile implant surgery was recommended. RESULTS. During the positioning of the left penile cylinder, a septum perforation (cross-over) occurred. Instead of interrupting and postpone surgery {{in order to allow}} the septum to recover, we decided to proceed utilizing our technique for a <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of the implants. As far as we know, this is the first detailed report on the technique. CONCLUSIONS. Septum perforation during a penile prosthesis implant does not represent an absolute contraindication to terminating surgery. Our technique allows a safe placing of the cylinders after septum perforation with optimal functional and aesthetic results at long-term follow-up. (Urologia 2009; 76 : 218 - 20...|$|E

Outer Mongolia, a vassal {{state of the}} Qing Empire until 1911, produced ethnographic paintings intended as new cartographic visuals {{around the time of}} its independence. Mongolia’s last ruler, the Bogd Khan (1870 – 1924) commissioned the artist Balduugin Sharav to produce a large painting of the Mongol countryside titled Daily Events, a work that constitutes an unusual cartographic “picture-map” (Paul Harvey 1980) intended for a special public display. The work (now known as One Day in Mongolia) depicts the Mongolian people as a distinct ethnic group in quotidian scenes of Central Mongolian (Khalkha) nomadic life. This article demonstrates how the covert connections between the scenes together construct a Buddhist didactic narrative of the Wheel of Life, and argues that this picture-map {{was the result of the}} Tibetan-born ruler’s anxieties over ethnic identity, national unity, and the survival of his people, who strove for independence from the Qing, as well as their <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> vis-à-vis new political neighbors...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) results {{primarily}} {{from the loss of}} an effective antireflux barrier, which forms a mechanical barrier against the retrograde movement of gastric content. Restoration of the incompetent antireflux barrier is possible by longitudinal and rotational advancement of the gastric fundus about the lower esophagus, creating an esophagogastric fundoplication. This article describes the technique of performing a rotational and longitudinal esophagogastric fundoplication, performed transorally using EsophyX. Methods: The transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) technique enables the creation of a full-thickness esophagogastric fundoplication with fixation extending longitudinally up to 3. 5 cm above the Z-line and rotationally more than 270 degrees around the esophagus. A key element of the technique involves rotating the fundus around the esophagus with a tissue mold during gastric desufflation. Anatomic considerations and use of the device's tissue invaginator to push the esophagus caudally are important to ensure <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of the plications below the diaphragm.

40|$|Background. The carina {{level has}} been shown to be near the pericardial {{reflection}} and can easily be identified as a landmark on a routine chest radiography. The purpose of this study was to reveal a simple method to predict the adequate central venous catheter (CVC) depth, hereby facilitating <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of the CVC tip. Methods. Central venous catheterization was performed via the right internal jugular vein (IJV) or the right subclavian vein (SCV). The CVC was placed at a depth derived by adding the length between the needle insertion point and the clavicular notch and the vertical length between the clavicular notch and the carina on the chest radiograph. The distance between the CVC tip and the carina was measured on the postoperative chest radiograph. Results. The tip position of 100 CVCs placed via the right IJV was 0. 1 (1. 1) cm [mean (SD) ] below the carina (95 % CI: 0. 3 cm below carina– 0. 2 cm above carina) and the tip position of 153 CVCs placed via the right SCV was 0. 0 (1. 2) cm [mean (SD) ] below the carina (95 % CI: 0. 2 cm below carina– 0. 2 cm above carina). There were nine outliers (two in IJV group and seven in SCV group). Conclusions. When CVCs are inserted to a depth derived by adding the length between the needle insertion point and the clavicular notch and the vertical length between the clavicular notch and the carina, the CVC tip can be reliably placed near the carina level...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To present two new {{approaches}} to acetabular surgery that were established in Berne, and which aim at enhanced visualization and anatomical reconstruction of acetabular fractures. METHOD: The trochanteric flip osteotomy allows for surgical hip dislocation, and was introduced as a posterior approach for acetabular fracture management involving the posterior column and wall. For acetabular fractures predominantly involving the anterior column and the quadrilateral plate, the Pararectus approach is described. RESULTS: Full exposure of the hip joint, as provided by the trochanteric flip osteotomy, facilitates anatomical reduction of acetabular or femoral head fractures and <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of the anterior column screw in transverse or T-shaped fractures. Additionally, the approach enables osteochondral transplantation as a salvage procedure for severe chondral femoral head damage and osteoplasty of an associated inadequate offset at the femoral head-neck junction. The Pararectus approach allows anatomical restoration with minimal access morbidity, and combines advantages of the ilioinguinal and modified Stoppa approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of the trochanteric flip osteotomy eases visualization of the superior aspect of the acetabulum, and enables the evaluation and treatment of chondral lesions of the femoral head or acetabulum and labral tears. Displaced fractures of the anterior column with a medialized quadrilateral plate can be addressed successfully through the Pararectus approach, in which surgical access is associated with minimal morbidity. However, long-term results following the two presented Bernese approaches are needed to confirm that {{in the treatment of}} complex acetabular fractures the rate of poor results in almost one-third of all cases (as currently yielded using traditional approaches) might be reduced by the utilization of the presented novel approaches...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{puncture}} of the navicular bursa at the limbs of slaughtered horses {{in the view of}} the podotrochlear syndrome. These investigations are carried, to gain extra Imformations about the <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of the puncture of the navicular bursa. Depending on breed, age and weight of the horses, the sizes and shapes of the hooves differ significantly. The injection-method described in this study has prooved to be very reliable and applicable to all hoof shapes (pointed, regular, edgeless) and sizes (small, medium, large). On different hoof sizes of legs from slaughtered horses, the necessary penetration depth for injections into the navicular bursa has been determined (between 4. 6 to 5. 5 cm). This injection-technique, with its determination of the appropriate cannula size and depth of penetration, allows a high reliability in the punctuation of the navicular bursa. The results of this study can be used as basis for further research conducted with living horses. Another finding of this study is the fact that aspiration of synovia from the navicular bursa is not possible. The mess of fluence that can be injected in to the navicular bursa varies from limb to limb (between 1 to 10 ml). The pressure measuring instrument used for the aforementioned experiments can be used to help positioning the cannule. The technique for a reliable punctuation of the navicular bursa as described above is well applicable in practice. The results of this study show that the pressure in the navicular bursa falls with the time at zero. In this study it can be observed that the strength of the load has no meaningsful consequence on the pressure ratio in the navicular bursa. The pressure in the navicular bursa reises when fluids are reised.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Due to {{advances}} {{in the field of}} medicine, infants born prematurely now have greater chances of survival despite not being carried to Full Term. However, serious health complications exist due to premature birth. Therefore, premature neonates require a specialized form of individualized care. Developmentally supportive care stresses the importance of proper handling, positioning and regular repositioning of the patient. In Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) there does not exist a standardized form of care in regards to the proper positioning of these patients. Currently, healthcare providers use rolled blankets, towels or foam positioning barriers and pillows to position and reposition the neonate. However, these forms of handling the neonate require some form of manual intervention which can cause undue stress and harm to the infant’s already fragile and compromised condition. As a result, there exists a need for a novel automated repositioning device that can safely and effectively position the neonate in a slow and controlled manner to ensure that they reach proper developmental milestones {{while at the same time}} preventing any further medical complications. In this study, an automated repositioning device was created. This system employs the use of inflatables to serve as air cells in order to achieve the <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of these patients. The system is comprised of two pumps, four valves and four inflatable air cells that safely and slowly direct the air flow into the desired air cells by means of an Arduino Uno and a multi-directional control switch in order to obtain safe and proper positioning. The four air cells that comprise this system position the patient in either a Fowler’s, Trendelenburg, Left or Right position. Testing was conducted on this automated inflatable repositioning system using a manikin that was similar to the size of a full term infant. Range of motion testing was conducted and it was discovered that this system is successful in achieving a sufficient range of motion in order to safely position the manikin. A pressure sensor was also connected to the system to measure the amount of pressure in the air cells over time during inflation. From this testing, it was found that the system is successful in inflating the air cells in a slow and controlled manner. Additionally, four NICU nurses from the Kapi’olani Medical Center for Women and Children tested the device and a survey was conducted to obtain feedback about the performance of the system. Overall the device created was found to be successful in achieving positions in four directions in a safe, slow and controlled manner by means of an easy to use system that has the potential to be integrated into current neonatal health care technology...|$|E

40|$|Within orthodontics, mini-implants proved {{of value}} {{especially}} {{in cases where}} stable anchorage was necessary. An interradicular insertion on the vestibular side {{in the area of}} the fixed gingiva is ideal for the biomechanic of the appliance and the stability of the mini-implants. This location, however, constitutes a risk of damage to the adjacent roots. Additionally, the possibility of a failure increases in case of a root contact. Literature presents numerous methods and auxiliary devices for a <b>safe</b> <b>positioning</b> of mini-implants, yet the efficiency of these methods has not been proved. This survey investigates if an injury of roots can be avoided by planning the implant position on a cast. Special attention lay on the clinicians experience. For this purpose an optical navigation system (lapdoc, BZMM) was used, allowing the simulation of the insertion of mini-implants. Therefore, several clinicians were able to simulate insertions on the same subjects and their casts. The relation of teeth, bone and soft tissue was done by using cone-beam computed tomography and navigation bow with optical check marks. The method error was determined previously with a deviation of 0, 66 mm and 0, 38 °. The insertion was simulated with a surgical hand tool. First, each one of the three participating clinicians defined the suitable mini-implant insertion sites, using virtually created panoramic views. Then, ten insertions were made in each of the casts and subjects. The implant positions were saved as data sets. The analysis of the results proved that a comparison could be established not only between the different jaws, the various clinicians and their insertion technique, but also between the difference of an insertion in the cast and of an intraoral insertion. Additionally, mini-implants of various sizes were used for the different saved positions. The results of the study were examined according to the frequency and degrees of root injuries. Panoramic view did initially not prove to be an appropriate method for avoiding root contact. The insertion sites chosen by the clinicians with the help of the panoramic view appeared to be the most suitable, but the available bone was less than what is needed for a safe insertion. But the available bone was with 2, 85 mm to 3, 35 mm not adequate for a save insertion. Therefore, the number of root injuries was higher than expected. It seems that all clinicians were able to avoid a root contact more often on a cast than intraoral. Comparing with intraoral attempts, with a relative incidence of 0, 58 more than twice the number root-contacts could prevented on the casts (intraoral 0, 28). Also, a correlation of the clinicians experience and his results on the casts could not be identified. However, the clinicians experience affected the success of the intraoral positioning of mini-implants. Root contact occurred less often in the mandible than in the maxilla. The effect of the implants diameter on the number of root contacts was bigger than the impact of the length of the implants. Furthermore, there was an evident learning curve of the handling of the system formerly unknown to the clinicians. In the present study, the frequency of root contacts exceeded the failure rates observed in the literature far more than expected. Possible causes might be the actual space available, limited visibility conditions of the insertion area and the system error. Moreover the three-dimensional data sets allowed to diagnose root contact more easily. Still, the results of the present study indicate that a cast presents sufficient information for positioning a mini-implant without injuring the roots...|$|E
