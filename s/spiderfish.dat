In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal <b>spiderfish</b> (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), {{a species}} of <b>spiderfish,</b> uses its fin {{extensions}} to [...] "stand" [...] on the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|The tripodfish {{is closely}} related to the spider fish Bathypterois longifilis, which is similar in {{appearances}} and habits but is smaller and has much shorter fin extensions. They are often found standing very close to each other. [...] The family to which both fish belong, Inopidae, is called the family of tripod fishes or <b>spiderfishes</b> interchangeably.|$|R
2500|$|Some fishes don't {{fit into}} the above classification. For example, the family of nearly blind <b>spiderfishes,</b> common and widely distributed, feed on benthopelagic zooplankton. Yet they are {{strictly}} benthic fish, since they stay {{in contact with the}} bottom. Their fins have long rays they use to [...] "stand" [...] on the bottom while they face the current and grab zooplankton as it passes by.|$|R
50|$|The Mediterranean <b>spiderfish,</b> Bathypterois dubius, a {{lizardfish}} of {{the family}} Ipnopidae, {{is found in the}} Eastern Atlantic, as well as the Mediterranean and northwest Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other species}} in its family, the Mediterranean <b>spiderfish</b> is hermaphroditic. It is solitary {{in nature and}} feeds on mysids and copepods. It reaches a length of 20.5 cm SL.|$|E
50|$|The abyssal <b>spiderfish,</b> Bathypterois longipes, is {{a species}} of deepsea tripod fish, a {{demersal}} fish living {{on the bottom of}} the Atlantic Ocean, even on the abyssal plain. It is one of the deepest-dwelling fish known.|$|E

50|$|The tripodfish or tripod <b>spiderfish,</b> Bathypterois grallator, is a deep-sea benthic {{fish in the}} Ipnopidae family {{found at}} lower latitudes. It is now {{relatively}} well known from photographs and submersible observations, and seem to prefer to perch on the ooze using much elongated fin rays in the tail and two pelvic fins to stand, facing upstream with the pectoral fins turned forward so the outthrust projecting fin rays resemble multiple antennae, and are indeed used as tactile organs. B. grallator is hermaphroditic. At least 18 species are placed in the genus Bathypterois, several of which have similar appearance and behavior to B. grallator. B. grallator is the largest member of its genus, commonly exceeding a standard length of 30 cm and reaching up to 43.4 cm.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBetween 1990 and 1992, 2 adult {{specimens}} of the ventrad <b>spiderfish,</b> Bathypterois ventralis Garman 1899, were collected at depths between 637 and 880 m off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. These specimens constitute the first {{record of the}} species, the genus, and the family in Costa Rican waters. A brief description of specimens, as well as comparative morphometric data and distributional information are provided and discussed herein...|$|E
