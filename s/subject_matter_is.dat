25|$|From the 9th century, {{the various}} schools of Thai art then became {{strongly}} influenced by Cambodian Khmer art {{in the north and}} Sri Vijaya art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> characteristic of the Mahayana pantheon with multiple creations of Bodhisattvas.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{sequencing}} of <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> concerned, {{it is the}} constructivist viewpoint that the foundations of any subject may be taught to anybody at any stage in some form (Duffy and Jonassen 1992). This means that instructors should first introduce the basic ideas that give life and form to any topic or subject area, and then revisit and build upon these repeatedly. This notion has been extensively used in curricula.|$|E

The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine curricular infrastructure combines a lecture-and problem-based curriculum with early and in-depth clinical experiences and an integrated organ systems approach to the pre-clinical sciences. The clinical years are characterized by an integrated clerkship structure and an emphasis on student flexibility.

25|$|The {{three major}} {{modalities}} for therapy {{with children and}} adolescents are family therapy, group therapy, and individual therapy. Which course is used depends {{on a variety of}} factors that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For instance, treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment, for example group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> very personal and/or embarrassing.|$|E
25|$|La danse (Bacchante) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 73 x 54cm (28.75 by 21.25 in). The work represents a nude {{woman in a}} composition that contains {{a wide variety of}} exotic geometrized elements. Metzinger's bold use of color characteristic of his work between 1904 and 1907 is highly noticeable in Bacchante. His brushstrokes are practically all the same size but their directions and colors vary giving rhythm to the overall work. The depth of field is flattened; the foreground blending in with background components. The <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> classical—reminiscent of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (an artist Metzinger greatly admired)—yet its treatment is everything but classical.|$|E

25|$|The {{protection}} of photographs in this manner has been criticised on two grounds. Firstly, {{it is argued that}} photographs should not be protected as artistic works, but should instead be protected {{in a manner similar to}} that of sound recordings and films. In other words, copyright should not protect the subject matter of a photograph as a matter of course as a consequence of a photograph being taken. It is argued that {{protection of}} photographs as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation. As such, it is more similar to a film, or sound recording than a painting or sculpture. Some photographers share this view. For example, Michael Reichmann described photography as an art of disclosure, as opposed to an art of inclusion. Secondly, it is argued that the {{protection of photographs}} as artistic works leads to bizarre results. <b>Subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> protected irrespective of the artistic merit of a photograph. The subject matter of a photograph is protected even when it is not deserving of protection. For copyright to subsist in photographs as artistic works, the photographs must be original, since the English test for originality is based on skill, labour and judgment. That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low. Essentially, by this, Arnold is arguing that whilst the subject matter of some photographs may deserve protection, it is inappropriate for the law to presume that the subject matter of all photographs is deserving of protection.|$|E
500|$|Sonnets of {{all types}} often make use of a volta, or [...] "turn," [...] {{a point in the}} poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a {{question}} is answered (or introduced), or the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> further complicated. This volta can often {{take the form of a}} [...] "but" [...] statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.|$|E

500|$|Write Me Back expands on its predecessor's {{traditional}} R aesthetic with 1970s influences, particularly Philadelphia {{soul and}} elements of Chicago stepping.

500|$|Etymologiae (Latin for [...] "The Etymologies"), {{also known}} as the Origines ("Origins") and usually {{abbreviated}} Orig., is an etymological encyclopedia compiled by Isidore of Seville (c.560–636) towards the end of his life. Isidore was encouraged to write the book by his friend Braulio, Bishop of Saragossa. The Etymologies summarized and organized a wealth of knowledge from hundreds of classical sources; three of its books are derived largely from Pliny the Elder's Natural History. Isidore acknowledges Pliny, but not his other principal sources, namely Cassiodorus, Servius and Solinus. The work contains whatever Isidore, an influential Christian bishop, thought worth keeping. Its <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> extremely diverse, ranging from grammar and rhetoric to the earth and the cosmos, buildings, metals, war, ships, humans, animals, medicine, law, religions and the hierarchies of angels and saints.|$|E
