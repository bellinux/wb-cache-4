5|$|After {{putting on}} the crown, Finn becomes {{corrupted}} by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a debt as established in the previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic bomb that Simon <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a mutagenic puddle and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.|$|E
5|$|Frank, now entirely across Fremont {{street and}} still walking {{at a good}} pace {{according}} to Claiborne's testimony, fired twice more before {{he was shot in}} the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had fired the shot that killed Frank, but since neither of them testified at the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, emulating Clark's {{success at}} Vincennes, French officer Augustin de La Balme {{organized}} a militia force of French residents to capture Fort Detroit. While marching to Detroit, the force <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> sack Kekionga. The delay proved fatal when the expedition met the warriors of the Miami tribe under Miami Chief Little Turtle along the Eel River, {{and the entire}} force was killed or captured. Clark organized another assault on Fort Detroit in 1781, but it was aborted when Chief Joseph Brant captured {{a significant part of}} Clark's army at a battle known as Lochry's Defeat, near present-day Aurora, Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the wounds}} inflicted by the blast were {{permanently}} debilitating, {{such as those}} caused by flying glass or by the flash of the explosion. Thousands of people had <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving them directly {{in the path of}} glass fragments from shattered windows. Roughly 5,900 eye injuries were reported, and 41 people lost their sight permanently.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{then decided}} to depart, owing {{to the risk of}} encountering {{superior}} warships. Upon leaving the harbor, he encountered a British freighter, , loaded with ammunition, that had already <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> pick up a harbor pilot. While preparing to take possession of the ship, Emden had to recall her boats when she spotted an approaching ship. This proved to be the French destroyer , and the unprepared ship was quickly destroyed. Emden <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> pick up survivors from Mousquet and departed at around 08:00 as the other French ships were raising steam in preparation to get underway. One officer and thirty-five sailors were plucked from the water. Another French destroyer tried to follow, but lost sight of the German raider in a rainstorm. On 30 October, Emden stopped the British steamer Newburn and put the French sailors aboard her after they signed statements promising not to return to the war. The attack on Penang was a significant shock to the Entente powers, and caused them to delay the large convoys from Australia, since they would need more powerful escorts.|$|E

Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E

5|$|The {{sighting}} by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man {{carrying a}} child that night became {{an important part of}} the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a report}} of the trip Armstrong later filed with the Hawaiian government, any {{negotiations}} for Indian contract labor had to be done with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India. They arrived in Calcutta on May 28 and visited the Alipore Zoological Gardens. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their trip across the British India subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the Middle East, and they <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> tour the Ellora Caves prior to reaching Bombay. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the Parsi Towers of Silence, and a visit from businessman Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.|$|E
5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who <b>Stopped</b> <b>to</b> Help and The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E
5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory {{to search for the}} legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E

5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> adjust his shoes {{on the right side}} of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Around 2:45 a.m., Kelly was {{on patrol}} and <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} a broken-down {{car on the}} side of the road, which was idling with its hood up. Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen. While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report, Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting. Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle. Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area for a gun. Kelly fired several rounds at Clemmons and hit him at least twice, killing him. Clemmons was carrying a handgun that had belonged to Lakewood Officer Greg Richards. Kelly was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting. Police later said Clemmons would have eventually died from the gunshot wound he sustained at the Lakewood shooting.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E

C Squadron was ordered to charge into Gambut, but when it became apparent that the Axis was retreating, they pursued until the New Zealand infantry engaged and then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome. The following evening, the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk. On 25 November, C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on Sidi Rezegh and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters. Four Stuart tanks, captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured, were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Syrian superiority {{in numbers}} and equipment, the {{destruction}} of a multitude of armored vehicles and the infantry's failure to infiltrate Degania Alef was the likely cause for the retreat of the main Syrian force to Samakh (Tzemah). A less-organized and sparsely numbered armored and infantry force forked off to attack Degania Bet. Eight tanks, supported by mortar fire, moved within 400 yards of the settlement defense, where they <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> provide fire support for an infantry attack. The Syrians made two failed attempts to breach the Israeli small arms fire defense and gave up the attempt. Against this force, the Israelis had about 80 people and one PIAT. The defenses in Degania Bet were disorganized and there were not enough trenches. They also had no communication link to the command, so Moshe Dayan sent one of his company commanders to assess the situation.|$|E
5|$|HMS Grafton (H89) was a G-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the non-intervention measures agreed by Britain and France. After the beginning of World War II she was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet to Great Britain for escort and contraband inspection duties. Grafton was refitting when the Norwegian Campaign began in April 1940, but the ship escorted convoys to Norway once her refit was completed. She evacuated British troops from the Dunkirk bridgehead in May, but was sunk by a German submarine after she <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> rescue survivors from another British destroyer.|$|E
