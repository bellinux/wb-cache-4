For Quine, there is but one connective, the Sheffer stroke, and one quantifier, the universal quantifier. All polyadic predicates can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to modus ponens and substitution. He preferred conjunction to either disjunction or the conditional, because conjunction has the least <b>semantic</b> <b>ambiguity.</b> He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: abstraction and inclusion. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine's approach to logic, see his [...] "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic," [...] ch. 5 in his From a Logical Point of View.|$|E

40|$|Spoken {{language}} comprehension {{is known}} to involve a large left-dominant network of fronto-temporal brain regions, {{but there is still}} little consensus about how the syntactic and semantic aspects of language are processed within this network. In an fMRI study, volunteers heard spoken sentences that contained either syntactic or <b>semantic</b> <b>ambiguities</b> as well as carefully matched low-ambiguity sentences. Results showed ambiguity-related responses in the posterior left inferior frontal gyrus (pLIFG) and posterior left middle temporal regions. The pLIFG activations were present for both syntactic and <b>semantic</b> <b>ambiguities</b> suggesting that this region is not specialised for processing either semantic or syntactic information, but instead performs cognitive operations that are required to resolve different types of ambiguity irrespective of their linguistic nature, for example by selecting between possible interpretations or reinterpreting misparsed sentences. Syntactic ambiguities also produced activation in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. These data confirm the functional relationship between these two brain regions and their importance in constructing grammatical representations of spoken language...|$|R

Just as our research has found, in Chinese oral communication, such means as lengthening or shortening {{the length of a}} sound unit to rhyme are often used to distinguish semantic contents and segment different syntactic structures so as to remove <b>semantic</b> <b>ambiguities</b> and achieve a good understanding of the meanings. The lengthened part becomes the semantic focus and the shortened part is weakened semantically.
