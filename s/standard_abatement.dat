40|$|In the Energy Economics {{issue of}} May 2005, Kavuncu and Knabb (KK) develop an IAM-OLG model {{to analyze the}} costs and {{benefits}} per generation of a Kyoto type emission stabilization program. They find that the first generations are confronted with huge costs, from 8 % in 2000 to 40 % in 2100. Only after 2315, generations start to benefit. I believe that this result is fully driven by the assumed very high abatement costs. I add an OLG structure to the existing DICE 99 model, and reproduce their results based on the same abatement costs function. Under the <b>standard</b> <b>abatement</b> costs function that comes with DICE 99, however, an emission stabilization program results in early generations having costs always below 0. 5 %, while generations start to benefit from 2080 onwards. © 2006 Elsevier B.

Three outcomes from this modelling research have significant impacts on the way we ‘optimise’ the greenhouse gas abatement path.

Secondly, optimising an abatement program where ETC has been included can lead to an increased risk profile during the time of widespread CO 2 abatements due to the costs associated with learning. Finally, the inclusion of ETC leads to a slightly deferred optimised abatement path followed by a drastic abatement program that itself would seem highly impractical. Together, the results draw attention to the possibilities of uncovering uncertainty through proactive abatements. Endogenous Technical Change, Optimal Abatement, Climate Change...|$|E

Because of the presence of punishment effects and stronger own and cross-tariff effects, we find that discrimination yields higher standards than MFN (and free trade) independently of the extent of pollution spillovers. When pollution is local and incentives to free ride on other countries' abatement efforts are weak, we show, however, that welfare is larger under MFN than under discrimination. In a dynamic setting, {{we consider}} the impact of symmetric and asymmetric treatments on the sustainability of an international environmental agreement (IEA) and obtain that multilateral cooperation is easier to sustain under discrimination than under MFN (or free trade).

40|$|In this paper, I analyze {{incomplete}} {{enforcement in}} a political economy model. I use a contest framework to explain changes in lobbying behavior when special interest groups anticipate the incomplete enforceability of environmental regulation. In this setting, I compare two instruments, namely an <b>abatement</b> <b>standard</b> and an emission tax. Regulation of a polluting output is proposed and two lobby groups - representing the interests of producers and environmentalists, respectively - seek to influence the government {{in order to prevent}} or support the implementation of the regulation. I develop a general framework to demonstrate that the lobbying efforts are determined not only by the stringency of the proposed policy - as determined by the level of the tax or <b>abatement</b> <b>standard</b> - but, importantly, also by its enforceability. Using common functional specifications, I then show that, when an emission tax is proposed, incomplete enforcement may not only reduce the industry's opposition to regulation compared to a situation with full enforcement, but it may, despite the possibility of untruthful reporting, also reduce expected environmental damage. When instead an <b>abatement</b> <b>standard</b> is proposed, however, the effects of regulatory stringency and enforceability are ambiguous, rendering unequivocal policy recommendations for this case impossible...|$|R

To achieve this goal, we use a negotiation game and the Nash bargaining solution as equilibrium. On the one hand, we remark that the argument of similarity of countries to defend the use of uniform standards is not appropriate, when there exists high level of fixed costs in abatement technology for symmetric countries. On the other hand, for asymmetric countries, according to the total welfare criteria, we notice first that differentiated standards with transfers are generally better than uniform standards with transfers. Secondly, differentiated standards without transfers always outperform uniform standards without transfers. Last, the numerical {{results show that the}} asymmetry on abatement benefits between the countries makes the uniform regime with imperfect transfers better than the differentiated regime without transfers, while an asymmetry on abatement costs gives the opposite result.

Our findings indicate that whenever countries are able to partially commit, the agreement on a uniform standard may be preferable, as it creates greater incentives for firms to invest in costly abatement technology. This result relies on the low level of the set-up cost of this technology. If this level is sufficiently high, the announcement and implementation of the agreement on a uniform standard with transfers is not optimal, because it takes away the incentive of all firms to invest in a new <b>abatement</b> technology. agreements, <b>standards,</b> transfers, technology adoption, irreversible investment, bargaining, transboundary pollution. ...|$|R
40|$|Caledonian Paper (CaPa) {{is a major}} paper mill, {{located in}} Ayr, Scotland. For its steam supply, it {{previously}} relied {{on the use of}} a Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustor (CFBC) of 58 MWth, burning coal, wood bark and wastewater treatment sludge. It currently uses a bubbling fluidized bed combustor (BFBC) of 102 MWth to generate steam at 99 bar, superheated to 465 degrees C. The boiler is followed by steam turbines and a 15 kg/s steam circuit into the mill. Whereas previously coal, wood bark and wastewater treatment sludge were used as fuel, currently only plantation wood (mainly spruce), demolition wood, wood bark and sludge are used. Since these biosolids contain nitrogen, fuel NO is formed at the combustion temperature of 850 - 900 degrees C. NOx emissions (NO + NO 2) vary on average between 300 and 600 mg/Nm(3) (dry gas). The current emission standard is 350 mg/Nm(3) but will be reduced in the future to a maximum of 233 mg/Nm(3) for stand-alone biomass combustors of capacity between 50 and 300 MWth according to the EU LCP <b>standards.</b> NOx <b>abatement</b> is therefore necessary. In the present paper we firstly review the NOx formation mechanisms, proving that for applications of fluidized bed combustion, fuel NOx is the main consideration, and the contribution of thermal NOx to the emissions insignificant. We then assess the deNO(x) techniques presented in the literature, with an updated review and special focus upon the techniques that are applicable at CaPa. From these techniques, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) using ammonia or urea emerges as the most appropriate NOx abatement solution. Although SNCR deNO(x) is a selective reduction, the reactions of NOx reduction by NH 3 in the presence of oxygen, and the oxidation of NH 3 proceed competitively. Both reactions were therefore studied in a lab-scale reactor and the results were transformed into design equations starting from the respective reaction kinetics. An overall deNO(x) yield can then be predicted for any operating temperature and NH 3 /NOx ratio. We then present data from large-scale SNCR-experiments at the CFBC of CaPa and compare results with the lab-scale model predictions, leading to recommendations for design and operation. Finally the economic impact is assessed of implementing SNCR-technology when applying an NH 3 SNCR or urea SNCR to the CFBC at CaPa. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{watershed management}} framework that combines economic, hydrologic and GIS modeling is developed to study cost effective land retirement in multiple watersheds to achieve off-site sediment reduction goal. This integrated framework examines two alternative standards-a uniform standard under which each watershed {{is required to}} achieve the same sediment reduction goal and a non-uniform standard under which marginal cost of sediment abatement is equal across watersheds. Furthermore, for each <b>standard,</b> costs of <b>abatement</b> under two alternative rental instruments based on marginal cost of sediment abatement ($/ton) and uniform payments per acre ($/acre) are examined. Then the cost effectiveness of the four policy options (uniform standard with $/ton and $/acre instrument, non-uniform standard with $/ton and $/acre instrument) is discussed. The integrated framework is applied to 12 agricultural watersheds in Illinois Conservation Reserve Enhancement program (CREP) region. The watersheds varied in size between 29, 995 and 70, 849 acres. Cropland within 900 feet of streams- 129, 955 acres (33. 4 % of all cropland in the 12 watersheds) -is considered eligible for enrollment into the CREP. Consistent with Illinois' program, a sediment reduction goal of 20 % is selected for all of the simulations. Policy implications from the empirical results are quite interesting. With either a $/ton or a $/acre instrument, the non-uniform standard, which equalizes marginal cost of abatement across watersheds, outperforms the uniform standard policy. With either a uniform or non-uniform standard, a $/ton instrument outperforms a $/acre instrument. The least preferred policy option, the uniform standard with a $/acre instrument, is 2. 5 times as costly as the most preferred policy option, the non-uniform standard with a $/ton instrument. These results suggest that program administrators may want to consider a program that includes a non-uniform standard and a rental payment instrument based on marginal cost of abatement in order to achieve their objectives at least cost.

40|$|The author brings {{together}} two of government's primary challenges: environmental protection, and taxation to generate revenues. If negative externalities {{can be reduced}} not only by changes in consumption patterns, but also by making each activity cleaner (abatement efforts), how shall inducements to various approaches be combined? If negative externalities are caused by agents as different as consumers, producers, and government, how does optimal policy combine inducements to reduce pollution? Intuitively it seems right to tax emissions neutrally, based on marginal damages - no matter which activity pollutes, or whetherthe polluter is rich or poor, consumer or producer, private or public. The author provides a theoretical basis for such simplicity. Three assumptions are critical to his analysis: 1) Returns to scale do not influence the traditional problem of revenue generation. 2) consumers have equal access to pollution abatement opportunities (but he also relaxes this assumption). 3) Planners can differentiate policy instruments (emission taxes or <b>abatement</b> <b>standards)</b> by polluting good, and by whether the polluter is a consumer, producer, or government, but they cannot differentiate such instruments (or commodity taxes) by personal characteristics, or make them non-linear in individual emissions. Among the author's findings and conclusions: Abatement efforts and consumption adjustments at all stages are optimally stimulated by a uniform emission tax, levied simply where emissions occur. It simplifies things that the optimal abatement is independent of whether the car is used by government, firms, or households - for weddings, or for work. It also simplifies implementation, that the stimulus to abatement at one stage (say, the factory) is independent of whether it yields emission reductions from the factory, or form others (say, from car owners who by the factory's products). Finally, ministers of finance and of the environment should coordinate efforts, but they need not engage in each other's business. The minister of environment need not know which commodities are elastic in demand, and thus would bear a low commodity tax. The finance minister need not know which commodities or agents pollute or who pays emissions taxes.

40|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} and industrialization can exacerbate {{pollution problems}} {{in developing countries}}. Tax revenues in developing countries are too low to support adequate infrastructure for treating and disposing of wastes, {{but the problem is}} also attributable to the classic problem of externalities in productiion and consumption. "Externalities"means that the costs of environmental degradation are not considered by the private decisionmakers undertaking the activities that cause the problems. Two types of policies are commonly considered to correct this market failure and improve the allocation of resources: command-and-control policies (such as emmission and <b>abatement</b> <b>standards)</b> and market-based incentive policies (such as emissions charges, taxes on production and consumption, and marketable pollution quotas), which raise the price of such activities for the perpetrators. Market based incentives theoretically reduce pollution at least cost and increase government revenues, but may require costly monitoring to be effective, and are usually implemented in an environment of imperfect information about the costs of abatement. Sometimes command and control policies make more economic sense in this environment. Efficiency gains from curbing pollution in developing countries may be large. Some polluting activities are subsidized, so curtailing them brings both fiscal and environmental benefits. Taxing polluting inputs and outputs is a particularly attractive policy in developing countries which often lack experience in administering and enforcing other types of environmental regulation. Corrective taxes make use of existing administrative structures and increase tax revenues, which can be spent on public goods to improve environmental quality (including treatment facilities for water and sewage, waste disposal, and sanitation) or can be used to reduce other taxes (which are often highly distortionary in countries with a narrow tax base). Which goods and inputs to single out for corrective taxation depends on the main sources of pollution, which varies from country to country. Air pollution from vehicles is growing in many countries where increased fuel taxes, perhaps coupled with improved regulations for vehicle maintenance, may be desirable. Higher taxes on high sulphur coal would curb both industiral and household emissions of sulphur dioxide. Charges can be implemented for fixed site easy to monitor industrial emissions. Subsidies to industries that cause pollution should be phased out and those industries should be subjected to higher than average tax rates.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Presentation date: 1976 - 07 - 09 This study {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of federal legislation to control water pollution in the period between 1935 and 1965. In this legislative history, the function of interest groups, the actions of congressmen and congressional committees, {{and the role of}} the President and the Executive Branch are reviewed. The water pollution control program as developed under this law provided financial and technical aid to state and interstate agencies for the development of state programs and financial aid to municipalities for the construction of sewage treatment facilities. The federal government also sponsored research on improved methods of waste treatment, and cooperated with state agencies in the collection of basic data on water quality. The most controversial elements of the federal program in the period between 1948 and 1965 were the attempts to control pollution through: 1) holding enforcement conferences between the particular states involved and the federal administering agency; and 2) setting water quality standards to reduce the amount of wastes discharged into interstate waters. The administering agencies played an important part in this program. The criticisms of these agencies and the numerous administrative reorganizations are emphasized. The overall effect of the federal water pollution control law is evaluated as having mixed results. The impact of the federal water pollution control legislation from 1948 through 1965 on water quality of the Lower Columbia River is examined. This impact took the following forms: 1) Financial aid was given to municipalities for the construction of waste treatment facilities which reduced the load of bacterial pollution and some of the organic pollution. 2) Grants were made to the state water pollution control agencies of Oregon and Washington which enabled these agencies to improve their programs. 3) An enforcement conference was initiated by the states of Oregon and Washington with the Public Health Service regarding the municipal and industrial pollution interferring with legitimate uses of the Lower Columbia River. Little was accomplished by this conference to affect the discharge of wastes from the pulp and paper mills, but other industries and most municipalities did meet the requirements of an Action Program devised by the conferees. In addition, the conference was at least partially responsible for making the city of Portland increase its treatment capacity and install chlorination facilities to rid the river downstream of serious levels of coliform bacteria. 4) The setting of water quality standards had a positive impact on the approach to water pollution control by requiring the states to catalog the waste sources and develop treatment requirements and time schedules for their <b>abatement.</b> <b>Standards</b> also gave state agencies one more weapon against recalcitrant polluters. In summary, the Water Pollution Control Act provided stimuli for the states of Oregon and Washington to improve the water quality of the Lower Columbia River...|$|R
5000|$|... :This {{gives some}} insight into the scope of Parliament's {{legislative}} jurisdiction over railways {{and the manner in which}} it is charged with the responsibility of weighing both the national and local socio-economic ramifications of its decisions. Moreover, it cannot be seriously questioned that Parliament may deal with biophysical environmental concerns touching upon the operation of railways so long as it is legislation relating to railways. This could involve issues such as emission <b>standards</b> or noise <b>abatement</b> provisions.:To continue with the example, one might postulate the location and construction of a new line which would require approval under the relevant provisions of the Railway Act. [...] That line may cut through ecologically sensitive habitats such as wetlands and forests. The possibility of derailment may pose a serious hazard to the health and safety of nearby communities if dangerous commodities are to be carried on the line. On the other hand, it may bring considerable economic benefit to those communities through job creation and the multiplier effect that will have in the local economy. The regulatory authority might require that the line circumvent residential districts in the interests of noise abatement and safety. In my view, all of these considerations may validly be taken into account in arriving at a final decision on whether or not to grant the necessary approval. To suggest otherwise would lead to the most astonishing results, and it defies reason to assert that Parliament is constitutionally barred from weighing the broad environmental repercussions, including socio-economic concerns, when legislating with respect to decisions of this nature.:The same can be said for several other subject matters of legislation, including one of those before the Court, namely navigation and shipping. Some provisions of the Navigable Waters Protection Act are aimed directly at biophysical environmental concerns that affect navigation. Sections 21 and 22 read:::21. No person shall throw or deposit or cause, suffer or permit to be thrown or deposited any sawdust, edgings, slabs, bark or like rubbish of any description whatever that is liable to interfere with navigation in any water, any part of which is navigable or that flows into any navigable water.::22. No person shall throw or deposit or cause, suffer or permit to be thrown or deposited any stone, gravel, earth, cinders, ashes or other material or rubbish that is liable to sink to the bottom in any water, any part of which is navigable or that flows into any navigable water, where there are not at least twenty fathoms of water at all times, but nothing in this section shall be construed so as to permit the throwing or depositing of any substance in any part of a navigable water where that throwing or depositing is prohibited by or under any other Act.:As I mentioned earlier in these reasons, the Act has a more expansive environmental dimension, given the common law context in which it was enacted. The common law proscribed obstructions that interfered with the paramount right of public navigation. Several of the [...] "works" [...] referred to in the Act do not in any way improve navigation. Bridges do not assist navigation, nor do many dams. Thus, in deciding whether a work of that nature is to be permitted, the Minister would almost surely have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the interference with navigation. This could involve environmental concerns such as the destruction to fisheries, and all the Guidelines Order does then is to extend the ambit of his concerns.|$|R
40|$|Two common {{desires for}} {{individuals}} are {{to live in}} a society with a healthy and sustainable environment, and a growing and productive economy. Through environmental regulatory policy, governments pursue these objectives on behalf of their electorate. It can often be a difficult balancing act, however, as these objectives do not always fit well together. Industrial activities that drive and stimulate the economy often have negative and lasting impacts on the environment. In this dissertation, I look at the modeling of this tradeoff in both a static and dynamic setting, and in relation to two significant environmental concerns: climate change and aquatic ecosystem acidification. In the first essay, co-authored with Peter Berck, we consider the impact of an increase in regulated <b>abatement</b> <b>standards</b> on static measures of economic welfare. By limiting emissions, these standards effectively decrease a key factor of production. Using a theoretical general equilibrium model, we show that all else equal, an increase in regulated abatement will therefore decrease utility and make individuals in the economy worse off. While we generally expect utility to be concave in abatement, when accounting for changes in the household's consumption and input supply decisions, and the corresponding impacts on income, we find this will not always be the case. Using a CGE model of the California economy, we then consider the impact of both carbon reduction measures, and a rising carbon price, on indicators of economic welfare in California. We find that environmental and economic objectives do not always have to be at odds, and that under certain conditions, both the carbon reduction measures and the rising carbon price can lead to increases in indicators of economic welfare. We also find that although conditions for non-concavity of the welfare function exist in California, our primary indicator of economic welfare, real State Personal Income, is concave in the carbon price. In the second essay, I look at the application of optimal regulatory policy to achieve the recovery of a group of freshwater lakes from acidification. Assuming a social planner is able to perfectly regulate the emissions of local firms, I develop a dynamic programming model where the planner's objective is to minimize a social disutility function, consisting of the damages from acidified lakes and the cost of emissions abatement, subject to state equations that describe the impact of emissions reductions on lake water quality. To parameterize the state equations, I use a panel data set that monitors the recovery of 32 acidified lakes located in the region surrounding Sudbury, Ontario, Canada over a 24 -year period. I then use numerical methods to solve the control problem for the optimal path of emissions reductions, and the expected rate of lake recovery. My results show that optimal emissions reductions rely heavily on the assumed level of damages, and {{the current state of the}} lakes. If lakes are already in a recovery state, then at most reasonable estimates of environmental damages, further optimal abatement is zero. I also find that as the level of damages increases, the optimal abatement policy "jumps" to full abatement of emissions, and there is only a narrow region of lake quality where partial abatement is optimal. Due to the slow recovery process, however, it is possible for lakes to remain in this narrow interim region for extended periods of time, and for partial abatement to be optimal over this entire period...|$|R
