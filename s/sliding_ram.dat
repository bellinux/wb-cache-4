40|$|FEM-analysis of {{dynamics}} in the bearing system of a heavy-duty machine tool {{has been carried}} out in the paper. This is a prospective variant for a large-size multi-purpose machine tool with a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>ram.</b> A saddle and a ram are moving vertically along a subtle mono-column. A rigid double-column is used in the existing analog machine tool. A static, modal and harmonic analysis of the bearing system with the mono-column has been made in the paper. It has been done with the help of FEM-simulation prior to fabrication of a prototype sample. Previously conducted calculations for the analog machine tool have shown good compatibility of FEM-calculation with experiments. Six common machine tool resonances have been revealed for the bearing system. Their oscillating cutting forces are actively exciting three-four resonance modes. Ranges of a flexure-torsion resonance (20 – 40 Hz) and nose-diving resonances (70 – 90 Hz) have been determined in the paper. The paper shows that the range of multi-wave resonances starts significantly higher from 140 Hz. These resonances are interconnected with bending oscillations of the ram and bucklings of the column walls which are matched with the oscillations. The paper demonstrates stability in resonance pattern. The torsional resonance of the column on the frequency of nearly 40 Hz is considered as the more dangerous one. Spindle rigidity goes down up to 3. 8 Н/μm. It is possible to observe self-stabilization of the torsional resonance. Frequency of the torsional oscillations is practically unchangeable when there is a lifting or lowering down of the saddle and the ram. It is related to the migration of dynamical axis of torsion. Frequency-response characteristics of the bearing system have been constructed for various saddle positions on the column. Three frequency intervals that make it possible to carry out machining operation have been determined in the paper. The first interval is a static one. The machine tool with a mono-column comes short of the analog machine tool in this interval. The main reason of it is low static rigidity of the subtle column. The second interval is narrow and it is located between flexure-torsion and nose-diving resonances. The third interval is considered as the most efficient one. The interval contains a section of inter-range pause between general machine tool and multi-wave resonances. In this case it is possible to observe a significant increase of the dynamic rigidity on the spindle that compensates the column subtility. High potential of the dynamic rigidity has been revealed {{in the direction of the}} ram axis (> 2000 Н/μm). The paper shows liability of the machine tool to displacement crossings during oscillations. Peculiar features of this effect have been discussed in the paper. The diagram with a mono-column is recommended for practical application. The main condition is a transition to high-speed drive within the framework of concept on high-speed machining. It is necessary to ensure rigidity of the axial feed drive system. </p...|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} Mechanical Presses use an {{eccentric}} drive {{to move the}} press's <b>ram</b> <b>slide,</b> length of stroke or slide travel depends on the crankshaft or eccentric, whereas hydraulic cylinders are used in hydraulic presses. The nature of drive system determines the force progression during the ram's stroke. Mechanical presses have a full tonnage rating point above BDC / Bottom Dead Center, normal full tonnage rating points are [...]187", [...]25" [...] & [...]5". Hence a mechanical press has a tonnage curve and should be operated within the press capacity limits. Link Motion mechanical is yet another option, this provides a slide slow down near BDC / bottom dead center for soft touch tooling. This link feature can improve die life and reduce reverse-snap thru tonnage for blanking operations.|$|R
50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of rubber pad forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a rubber pad as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by a blank holder, through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the <b>ram</b> <b>slides</b> down, then the blank holder moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|R

If the drill pipe is in the well, the pipe <b>rams</b> <b>slide</b> perpendicular to the pipe, closing around it to form a tight seal.

40|$|Abstract [...] We {{describe}} {{experiments in}} which large (14 x 40 cm nominal contact area) blocks of gabbro were sheared {{in a direct}} shear apparatus at room temperature, 5 MPa normal stress, and slip velocities from 0. i to 10 #m/s. The apparatus was servocontrolled using a displacement feedback measurement made directly between the gabbro blocks. Two surface roughnesses were studied (rough, produced by sandblasting, and smooth, produced by lapping with # 60 grit) and accumulated displacements reached 60 ram. Measurements of surface topography were used to characterize roughness and asperity dimensions. Step changes in loading velocity were used to interrogate friction constitutive properties. Both rough and smooth surfaces showed appreciable displacement hardening. The coefficient of friction # for rough surfaces was about 0. 45 for initial slip and 0. 7 after <b>sliding</b> 50 <b>ram.</b> Smooth surfaces exhibited higher # and a greater tendency for unstable slip. The velocity dependence of friction a-b and the characteristic friction distance D c show systematic variations with accumulated displacement. For rough surfaces a-b started out positive and became negative after about 50 mm displacement and D c increased from l to 4 #m over the same interval. For smooth surfaces, a-b began negative and decreased slightly with displacement and Dc was about 2 #m, independent of displacement. For displacements < 30 mm, rough surfaces exhibit a second state variable with characteristic distance about 20 #m. The decrease in a-b with displacement is associated with disappearance of the second state variable. Our data indicate that D c is controlled by surface roughness in a complex way, including {{but not limited to}} the effect of roughness on contact junction dimensions for bare rock surfaces. The data show that simple descriptions of roughness, such as rms and peak-to-trough, are not sufficient to infer Dc. Our observations are consistent with a model in which D c scales with gouge thickness. Key words: Rock friction, constitutive laws, scaling, characteristic friction distance...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the studies {{reported}} in this Thesis was to increase our understanding of two aspects of the reproductive system in farm animals: the andrological evaluation and the follicular fluid composition. The final aim was to give some tools that {{can be helpful in}} optimizing the application of assisted reproductive technologies. Studies were conducted in bulls, rams, alpacas, lamas and dairy buffalo cows. The first study was designed to investigate the efficacy of scrotal thermographic monitoring in the evaluation of young bulls with low semen production after GnRH administration. Yearling bulls with low semen quality were selected. Scrotal surface temperature (SST) and serum testosterone (T) were evaluated before and after administration of 10. 5 µg Buserelin Acetate IV. Bulls were divided in two groups: LowTemp bulls had a decreased SST at 60 minutes; HighTemp bulls had an increased SST. After 60 minutes from Buserelin administration, LowTemp bulls had higher T values compared to HighTemp bulls: 14. 32 ± 0. 53 ng/ml vs. 10. 30 ± 1. 37 ng/ml respectively (mean ± SEM) (P< 0. 05). Reproductive performances in both groups improved after Buserelin administration, but the improvement was more marked in LowTemp bulls. In conclusion a decreased SST after GnRH administration was associated with better testicles functionality. The second study was done to assess the predicting value of trans-scrotal ultrasonography (TSUS) and testicular fine-needle aspiration cytology (TFNAC) on sperm production in rams. TSUS and TFNAC were performed on eighteen adult rams {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. After evaluation, semen was collected twice with electroejaculation from each ram, and then epididymal spermatozoa were collected after slaughtering. Ultrasonography appearance of testicular parenchyma was analyzed to create a four classes division of the animals. Relative percentages of spermatogenic cells and Spermatic Index (SI = percentage of spermatozoa on the total of spermatogenic cells) were calculated after obsersation of TFNAC <b>slides.</b> <b>Rams</b> having a better echogenicity had a higher SI and a higher total sperm and number of straws per ejaculate either with electroejaculation or epididymal spermatozoa than the worst groups. Several cytological parameters were correlated with sperm production: the most interesting correlation was between SI and number of straws obtained by epididymal collection (0. 667; P= 0. 003. In conclusion, TSUS and TFNAC can be usefully integrated in breeding soundness evaluation of rams, as these techniques had a potential as a marker of semen production. The third study documents the variability of follicular fluid (FF) composition of South American camelids, in different stages of ovarian activity. In the first experiment, ovaries of alpacas were collected at slaughterhouse and FF was aspirated dividing sample on the base of ovarian cycle stage and follicular dimension. Follicle size affected FF composition, either by biochemical analysis or electrophoresis. Conversely, the influence of corpus luteum was minimal. In the second study, ovaries of thirty lamas were scanned ultrasonographically to identify wave emergence. FF was aspirated trans-vaginally at three different stage of development (growing, static and regressing phase). The electrophoresis analysis revealed differences between groups in 4 classes of weight (250 KDa, 75 KDa, 25 KDa, 15 KDa). This study offers new information concerning the biochemical composition of follicular fluid in South American camelids, suggesting that oocytes grow and mature in an environment that changes in function of the follicle stage, while is minimally influenced by the presence of the corpus luteum. The aim of the forth study was to characterize the biochemical and fatty acids composition of the follicular fluid (FF) in water buffalo. Ovaries of buffalo were collected after slaughtering during breeding season. Fluid was aspirated from follicles of small and large follicles (6 mm respectively) and dividing females in those in luteal or follicular phase of estrous cycle. Biochemical analysis and gas chromatography were performed. Biochemical and fatty acids compositions were influenced by both follicular dimension and phase of ovarian cycle. Biochemical composition and its variation was in agreement with previously study conducted in buffalo and other species. Twenty-two fatty acids were identified in FF; nine were saturated fatty acids, six monounsatured fatty acids and seven polyunsatured fatty acids. The most dominant fatty acids were linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and arachidonic acid. All the identified fatty acids concentrations varies at least because of follicle dimension or phase, with the exception of γ-linoleic acid and arachidonic acid which concentrations remain stable in all classes. The fifth study was designed to investigate the effect of different diets on the testicular fine-needle aspiration cytology (TFNAC) in rams. Eighteen rams were fed with three different diets since 8 months of age up to 1 year. The diets were: 1 - pasture (N= 6); 2 - hay and commercial concentrate (N= 6); 3 - hay, commercial concentrate and a supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) containing equal parts of cis- 9, trans- 11 and trans- 10, cis- 12 isoforms (N= 6). After slaughtering, testes were collected to perform TFNAC. No statistical differences were observed in live weight and testicular weight between groups. CLA supplemented rams had higher relative percentage of early spermatogenic cells (primary spermatocytes and AB spermatids) and lower percentage of CD spermatids and SI compared to other groups. Total CLA concentration in diets was similar in pasture and CLA supplemented groups, but rams graze at pasture receive almost all cis- 9, trans- 11 isomer. Rams fed with hay and concentrate received a lower quantity of CLA in the diet. In conclusion, CLA supplementation and in particular the trans- 10, cis- 12 isomer affected negatively the TFNAC results in peripubertal rams probably because it returded the onset of puberty. ...|$|R
