5|$|The {{output of}} the ducal printer, Baldini, {{consisted}} largely of music written for the concerto delle donne, including {{the works of the}} foremost madrigalists: Luzzaschi, Gesualdo, and Alfonso Fontanelli. His first publication for the Duke was Il lauro secco (1582), which was followed by Il lauro verde (1583), both containing music by the leading composers of Rome and Northern Italy. Music in honor of the concerto was printed as far away as Venice, with Paolo Virchi's First Book à 5, published by Giacomo Vincenti and Ricciardo Amadino containing the madrigal which begins SeGU'ARINAscer LAURA e prenda LARCO / Amor soave e dolce / Ch'ogni cor duro MOLCE. This capitalization is in the original, clearly <b>spelling</b> <b>out</b> the equivalent of the names Anna Guarini, Laura Peverara, Livia d'Arco, and Tarquinia Molza.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters <b>spelling</b> <b>out</b> a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

25|$|There are two {{standards}} for listing verbs in dictionaries.

Similar to the latter, this article follows the stem-as-citeword standard.|$|E

25|$|The {{bombing of}} the 13th-century Orthodox monastery Sveti Atanasij {{in the village of}} Lesok is {{considered}} a war-crime by some.

25|$|Suffixed or {{compound}} words usually {{obey the}} second main principle, word analysis. It {{means that the}} original constituents (morphemes) of a word should be written the same way, regardless of pronunciation assimilations. This, however is only true when the resulting pronunciation conforms to some regular pattern; irregular assimilations are reflected in writing too. For example, hagy + j (’you should leave ’) is pronounced like “haggy”, but written as hagyj according {{to the principle of}} word analysis. This is because the composition of gy and j gives a long gy in Hungarian phonology anyway, so <b>spelling</b> <b>out</b> the original morphemes is considered clearer. By contrast hisz + j (’you should believe’) is pronounced “higgy” and also written as higgy, since this pronunciation cannot be regularly deduced from the morphemes and basic phonological rules. Compound words are generally written so that all constituents retain their spelling, but some compounds have become vague enough not to be considered true compounds any more, especially if one of the elements is obsolete. An example is kesztyű ‘glove’, which originally comes from kéz ‘hand’ and an obsolete tyű and in this case the spelling no longer reflects the derivation.|$|E
25|$|From {{that time}} she was an indefatigable reader, troubling her parents only by her devotion to books {{rather than to the}} play natural to her age. Her father had a {{considerable}} library, the contents of every book in which she made her own, always preferring history, — before she had finished her 10th year being acquainted with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and kindred writers. At this point, she was sent away to school. Her father and mother, seeing the intellect for which they were responsible, took all possible pains with her education, and fortunately her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. She cared more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no especial pleasure in mathematics. Booth's superior education was not given her at school, where she learned less than she did by herself, for she showed very young that disdain of obstacles and that taste for literature which were two strong points in her character. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French. A stray French primer fell into her hands, and she became interested in <b>spelling</b> <b>out</b> the French words and comparing them with the English ones, and continued to study in this way. Later she acquired German in the same manner, and being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she never learned to speak them, but made herself so proficient in them in after years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French at sight, reading them aloud in English.|$|E
