50|$|In the russ vehicle, modern {{tradition}} {{requires a}} powerful audio equipment inside the vehicle, and on buses {{also on the}} roof (the largest systems allowed have forty <b>speaker</b> <b>boxes</b> which can generate over sixty thousand watts and be among the best sound systems in the world, rivaling those used by famous artists on concert tours). Some buses have had over 60 <b>speaker</b> <b>boxes.</b> Other accessories include sweaters and caps with the group's chosen logo and a bus song or slogan. It is also common {{to have some sort}} of theme for the interior and name/concept. Many buses have expensive theme interior, sometimes a bar, and plenty of flat-screens. A party light system is also common in buses.|$|R

50|$|Slim Array Technology (SAT) was {{developed}} to confront issues using large line array elements by substituting the big enclosures with slim boxes. Whereas a big air volume inside a large <b>speaker</b> <b>box</b> in a standard line array is necessary to maximize the speaker efficiency in the mid-low frequency range, a slim box allows sound to exit instantaneously without resonance, generating {{a significant amount of}} sound pressure in the low and low-mid range with a fast transient response. Therefore, all sounds characterized by fast transients, like percussion instruments, are reproduced in a more natural way.|$|E
50|$|The {{restaurant}} {{retains a}} 1950s style of ordering food. Customers pull their car {{up to one}} of the carports and order through a retro-looking metallic <b>speaker</b> <b>box.</b> The orders are delivered to the car window by a carhop with a tray that hooks on to the car door. When finished eating, the customer flips a switch on the box and a carhop comes to take the tray back. Many of the carhops have been there for years and have a loyal base of customers. There is also a walkup window and a small seating area inside the restaurant. The Wheeling location has a much larger indoor seating area.|$|E
5000|$|Disney Sound Source. Covox-idea based DAC, marketed by Disney Software {{in early}} 1990s. It {{consisted}} of 2 parts: a DAC plugged into printer port and separate amplifier / <b>speaker</b> <b>box.</b> Its price {{was set to}} only $14 and it was supported by many games (see below). It used external power (9 volt battery) and could be turned on/off by software. Contrary to the Speech Thing the output rate {{is determined by the}} hardware (7 kHz) and the design features a 16 byte FIFO allowing for autodetection and flow control of the output. In 2015 the hardware was reverse engineered so compatible circuits can be built from easily available off the shelf components. It is also emulated by the popular DOSBox emulator.|$|E

A typical store features a drive-thru with a <b>speaker</b> <b>box</b> and most of the employees are young teenage workers. In the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield", the Springfield police are comparing the differences between Krusty Burger and McDonald's, a parallel of the [...] "Royale With Cheese discussion" [...] seen in Pulp Fiction.

50|$|In total, the Challenge Stradale {{is up to}} 110 kg (243 lb) {{lighter than}} the {{standard}} Modena if all the lightweight options are specified such as deleted radio, lexan (plexiglass) door window and Alcantara fabric (instead of the leather option). As much as 74 kilograms (207 lb) was taken off on the car by lightening the bumpers, stripping the interior of its sound deadening and carbon mirrors and making the optional Modena carbon seats standard. Resin Transfer Moulding was utilized for the bumpers and skirts, a carry over from the Challenge cars which resulted in lighter bumpers than on the Modena. The engine and transmission weight was slimmed down 11 kg (24 lb) {{through the use of}} a smaller, lighter weight sports (yet still stainless steel) exhaust back box and valved exit pipes. The Challenge Stradale also got Brembo carbon ceramic brakes as standard (which later became standard fitment on the F430) which shaved 16 kg off the curb weight and improved handling by reducing unsprung weight and completely eliminating brake fade. Cars fitted with the center console stereo option, sub <b>speaker</b> <b>box</b> behind the seats and glass side windows re-gained approximately 30 kg over the best selected options (from a weight perspective).|$|E

On Day 2, the second batch of housemates were introduced via ASAP 20. Enchong Dee was also introduced as a new host; and as one of the show's traditions with its hosts, Enchong had to stay inside the house. On the same day, Enchong was tasked to deliver a box, filled with things from the housemates' parents, without being noticed by them; he was successful. Afterwards, the housemates were called for an activity in the pool area, where they had to transfer 11 boxes using a big plane and ropes without getting wet; they were able to transfer 10 boxes. On that night, Bailey was called to the confession room for several violations. Right afterwards, all the remaining boys along with Barbie were called to the confession room for not wearing their lapel microphones. On Day 3, Bailey was punished to become a human <b>speaker</b> <b>box</b> and to remain as is until Big Brother had told him otherwise.
