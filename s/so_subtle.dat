He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E

The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not <b>so</b> <b>subtle</b> ways (such as changing the font, or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version.

Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises."

MacFarlane found a list of plot ideas from the third season that says [...] "Peter goes gay" [...] {{and he decided to}} make an episode with that premise. The writers originally wanted to take [...] with the episode. In the first draft, Peter's homosexuality was <b>so</b> <b>subtle,</b> that he just appeared a little more refined. When the writers could not come up with any high road jokes, they [...] "went with what they know". The writers had fun [...] "gaying up the episode" [...] by including Peter in a different outfit during every scene after he turned gay. The writers wanted to further the idea that sexuality is inborn, not chosen.|$|E
500|$|In native Sweden, [...] "Dressed for Success" [...] and [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] {{were chosen}} as the first two singles from their second album Look Sharp!, as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to {{highlight}} Fredriksson's singing. Gessle said, [...] "I always thought we should promote the songs Marie sang. Me being a lead singer wasn't part of the plan, not for me anyway." [...] Both singles reached the top 10 of the Swedish singles chart, while the album, which was released in Sweden in October 1988, held the No.1 position for 14 weeks. Music critic Måns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album, writing derisively: [...] "To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, the album sounds unbelievably conventional. Most striking are the lyrics. Gessle's once <b>so</b> <b>subtle</b> Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense." [...] But the album won Roxette their first Rockbjörnen awards in Sweden and Gessle his first Grammis award in the category Best Composer.|$|E

50|$|These {{philosophical}} {{arguments were}} not entirely successful in convincing the filial Chinese {{that the behavior}} advocated by Buddhism was correct, and <b>so</b> less <b>subtle</b> methods were employed. To more directly give Buddhism filial nature, passages and parables that were of minor importance in Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism.

500|$|Sicherman {{writes that}} [...] "A Valediction" [...] {{is an example}} of Donne's writing style, {{providing}} [...] " [...] confident opening, a middle in which initial certainties give way gradually to new perceptions, and a conclusion manifesting a clear and profoundly rooted assurance". At the same time, she considers it [...] "a poem whose development is <b>so</b> <b>subtle,</b> whose conclusion so perfect, that one may remain unaware of while responsive to the pattern of discovery". The analogy of beaten gold was heavily criticised by T. S. Eliot as not being based on a statement of philosophical theory; Targoff argues that this is incorrect — that Donne had a consistent philosophy, and that the analogy of beaten gold {{can be traced to the}} writings of Tertullian, one of Donne's greatest religious influences. Another critic of Donne, Samuel Johnson, noted that the poem's compass analogy highlights the [...] "violence" [...] used by metaphysical poets to [...] " [...] the most heterogeneous ideas together".|$|E
500|$|Stafford was {{admired by}} critics and the {{listening}} {{public for the}} purity of her voice, and {{was considered one of}} the most versatile vocalists of her era. Peter Levinson said that she was a coloratura soprano, whose operatic training allowed her to sing a natural falsetto. Her style encompassed a number of genres, including big band, ballads, jazz, folk and comedy. The music critic Terry Teachout described her as [...] "rhythmically fluid without ever sounding self-consciously 'jazzy' [...] ", while Rosemary Clooney said of her, [...] "The voice says it all: beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman too." [...] Writing for the New York Sun, Will Friedwald described her 1947 interpretation of [...] "Haunted Heart" [...] as [...] "effective because it's <b>so</b> <b>subtle,</b> because Stafford holds something back and doesn't shove her emotion in the listener's face." [...] Nancy Franklin described Stafford's version of the folk song [...] "He's Gone Away" [...] as [...] "wistful and tender, as if she had picked up a piece of clothing once worn by a loved one and begun singing." [...] Frank Sinatra said, [...] "It was a joy to sit on the bandstand and listen to her". The singer Judy Collins has cited Stafford's folk recordings as an influence on her own musical career. The country singer Patsy Cline was also inspired by Stafford's work.|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics since airing. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a [...] "superb example" [...] of political satire, [...] "demonstrating the lengths people will go to to win votes. Marge, of course, sees straight through Burns and uses Blinky the three-eyed fish to demonstrate his lack of conviction." [...] Phil Rosenthal of the Los Angeles Daily News called the episode a [...] "wonderful stab" [...] at American politics and the [...] "media machine that drives it", and added: [...] "The message is <b>so</b> <b>subtle,</b> the makers of The Simpsons might deny it is there at all for fear of turning off a portion of its audience. Truth is, you {{may very well be}} so busy laughing and taking in the fine details, such as the references to Citizen Kane, to notice." [...] Hal Boedeker of The Miami Herald said the episode took [...] "some well-aimed satirical jabs at American politics and the publics' short attention span. The episode has the wit of the best of All in the Family, and benign mother Marge becomes a force for good, in the Edith Bunker tradition." [...] Virginia Mann of The Record called the episode [...] "terrific", though she believed its social and political [...] "overtones" [...] were more likely to appeal to adults than children. Tom Shales of the Washington Post described the episode as [...] "a bull's-eye political satire".|$|E

500|$|For Japan, the {{war began}} with the {{undeclared}} war and invasion of China in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called [...] "The China Incident". The government dispatched a [...] "pen brigade" [...] to write and film the action in China with [...] "humanist values". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and Soldiers (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely. Once war with the United States was declared, the Japanese conflict {{became known as the}} Pacific War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese values. The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as [...] "losers do not get reruns", yet they were <b>so</b> <b>subtle</b> and skilful that Frank Capra thought Chocolate and Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country. These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the [...] "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and [...] "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an [...] "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower comments that the perversity of this image [...] "is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others." ...|$|E
