However, when a project is completed, its SV is always 0 and SPI is always 1, even if the project was delivered unacceptably late.

The Earned Value concept was conceived by industrial engineers working in American factories over a century ago. This concept improved by the time and in July 1998, the Earned Value Management System became the American National Standards Institute (ANSI/EIA) Standard # 748. By concise reports derived from using Earned Value Method (EVM) in the project, the manager is able to have exact information about the project details and also can mitigate the risks in his decisions in critical conditions of the project. It would be an early warning tool for a project control. Consequently, the project could be finished after {{a short period of}} time.
