2500|$|In Florida, State Representative Joe Negron {{was picked}} to fill Foley's {{spot in the}} November elections. The Democratic nominee for the seat was Tim Mahoney. Florida law {{prohibited}} Foley's name from being removed from the ballot {{at the time of}} his withdrawal from the race, but Republicans hoped that voters would recognize that a vote for Foley would transfer to Negron as a <b>substitute</b> <b>candidate.</b> [...] Nevertheless, Boehner noted that because of the procedures in Florida, [...] "to vote for this candidate, you have to vote for Mark Foley. How many people are going to hold their nose to do that?" [...] Negron used the slogan, [...] "Punch Foley for Joe", having the double meaning of officially voting for Foley in order to really elect Negron as well as evoking images of physically striking the offending member of Congress. Foley's Republican-held seat was regarded as unlikely to change hands before the scandal broke, but CQPolitics changed its rating of the race from Safe Republican where it had stood since July to Leans Democratic in early-October. On Election Day, Mahoney won the seat.|$|E

Two main steps are included in our method: <b>candidate</b> <b>substitute</b> extraction and <b>candidate</b> scoring. In the first step, <b>candidate</b> <b>substitutes</b> for each target word in a given sentence are extracted from WordNet. In the second step, the extracted candidates are scored and ranked using a web-based scoring method. The substitute ranked first is selected as the best substitute. For the multiword subtask, a simple WordNet-based approach is employed. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a new model}} for in vitro assessment of novel vitreous <b>substitute</b> <b>candidates.</b> Methods: The biological impact of three vitreous <b>substitute</b> <b>candidates</b> was explored in a retinal explant culture model; a polyalkylimide hydrogel (Bio-Alcamid®), a two component hydrogel of 20  wt. % poly (ethylene glycol) in phosphate buffered saline (PEG) and a cross-linked sodium hyaluronic acid hydrogel (Healaflow®). The gels where applied to explanted adult rat retinas and then kept in culture for 2, 5 and 10  days. Gel-exposed explants were compared with explants incubated under standard tissue culture conditions. Cryosections of the specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, immunohistochemical markers (GFAP, Vimentin, Neurofilament 160, PKC, Rhodopsin) and TUNEL. Results: Explants kept under standard conditions as well as PEG-exposed explants displayed disruption of retinal layers with moderate pyknosis of all neurons. They also displayed moderate labeling of apoptotic cells. Bio-Alcamid®-exposed explants displayed severe thinning and disruption of retinal layers with massive cell death. Healaflow®-treated explants displayed normal retinal lamination with significantly better preservation of retinal neurons compared with control specimens, and almost no signs of apoptosis. Retinas exposed to Healaflow® and retinas kept under standard conditions showed variable labeling of GFAP with generally low expression and some areas of upregulation. PEG-exposed retinas showed increased GFAP labeling and Bio-Alcamid®-exposed retinas showed sparse labeling of GFAP. Conclusions Research into novel vitreous substitutes {{has important implications for}} both medical and surgical vitreoretinal disease. The in vitro model presented here provides a method of biocompatibility testing prior to more costly and cumbersome in vivo experiments. The explant culture system imposes reactions within the retina including disruption of layers, cell death and gliosis, and the progression of these reactions can be used for comparison of vitreous <b>substitute</b> <b>candidates.</b> Bio-Alcamid® had strong adverse effects on the retina which is consistent with results of prior in vivo trials. PEG gel elicits reactions similar to the control retinas whereas Healaflow® shows protection from culture-induced trauma indicating favorable biocompatibility.

40|$|With the {{impending}} fossil fuel crisis, {{the search for}} and development of alternative chemical/material substitutes is pivotal in reducing mankind’s dependency on fossil resources. One of the potential <b>substitute</b> <b>candidates</b> is polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA).

At present, PHA is not cost competitive compared to fossil-derived products. Encouraging and intensifying research work on PHA is anticipated to enhance its economic viability in the future. The development of various biomolecular and chemical techniques for PHA analysis {{has led to the}} identification of many PHA-producing microbial strains, some of which are deposited in culture collections.
