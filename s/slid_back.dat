5|$|After the 1992 {{match with}} Spassky, Fischer, now a fugitive, <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> into {{relative}} obscurity, taking {{up residence in}} Budapest, Hungary, and allegedly having a relationship with young Hungarian chess master Zita Rajcsányi.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
25|$|He {{was voted}} WPBSA Newcomer of the Year and WSA Young Player of the Year in 1999. Tipped by many pundits as a {{potential}} champion of the game, Fu's subsequent performance was disappointing, and he <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> down the rankings.|$|E

25|$|As Geneva {{shuttered}} {{itself in}} mourning, Elisabeth’s body {{was placed in}} a triple coffin: two inner ones of lead, the third exterior one in bronze, reposing on lion claws. On Tuesday, before the coffins were sealed, Franz Joseph's official representatives arrived to identify the body. The coffin was fitted with two glass panels, covered with doors, which could be <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> to allow her face to be seen.|$|E
25|$|Elsie and her {{brothers}} established studios at their family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough after 1901. On the seven acre {{grounds of the}} estate were three large studios, including a metal foundry. In order to work in natural daylight, the siblings arranged for the studios to have walls that could be <b>slid</b> <b>back.</b> The walls were tall enough {{that they could be}} utilised during wartime to hang up parachutes to dry.|$|E
25|$|The shaft skin {{can also}} be <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> and forth with just the index finger and thumb wrapped around the penis. A {{variation}} on this is to place the fingers and thumb on the penis as if playing a flute, and then shuttle them back and forth. Lying face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may {{include the use of}} a simulacrum, or artificial vagina.|$|E
60|$|There {{were three}} or four men in morions behind Don Miguel, and Lord Julian {{realized}} the position. He released his hilt, {{and a couple of}} feet or so of steel <b>slid</b> softly <b>back</b> into the scabbard. But Don Miguel smiled, with a flash of white teeth behind his grizzled beard, and held out his hand.|$|R
5000|$|... "And of the Builders themselves, {{their own}} all-too-effective weapons, the berserkers, had left {{nothing but a}} few obscure records—video and voice recordings. Those videos had {{recorded}} slender, fine-boned beings, topologically like Solarian humans with the sole visible exception of the eye, which in the Builder species was a single organ, stretching clear across the upper face, with a bright bulging pupil that <b>slid</b> rapidly <b>back</b> and forth." ...|$|R
60|$|Dick was now on {{his knees}} and feeling {{around the back of the}} safe with his hand. Presently he found a crack, and {{inserting}} his fingers he gave a push. Much to his astonishment a portion of the safe <b>back</b> <b>slid</b> upward.|$|R
25|$|Parramatta saw {{very little}} success {{in their early}} years, despite {{narrowly}} missing out on finals qualification in 1949 {{under the guidance of}} former Western Suburbs and Leeds five-eighth Vic Hey. Between 1952 and 1961, they finished last eight times and won only 35 of 180 matches. In 1962, Parramatta made the finals for the first time; this achievement was repeated for the three following seasons. However, the club <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> down the ladder in the following years, collecting the wooden spoon in 1970 and 1972. The club’s first major success came in 1975 when they defeated Manly-Warringah in the pre-season cup final.|$|E
25|$|A 3–1 win at Fulham on Boxing Day—West Ham's first {{away win}} of the season—appeared {{to ease the}} {{pressure}} on Grant, as did a 2–0 home win over fellow strugglers Wolverhampton Wanderers on New Year's Day, which lifted the Hammers out of the relegation zone. However, a 5–0 defeat at Newcastle United on 5 January put Grant's position in further doubt as the Hammers <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> {{to the bottom of}} the table. The pressure became intense with another defeat on 15 January, as many media sources reported that Martin O'Neill would replace him as manager, only to later find that O'Neill ruled himself out of the job.|$|E
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with Autosport magazine, Villeneuve's manager Craig Pollock confirmed that Villeneuve's Formula One career was over. It was announced on August 24, 2007 that Villeneuve would run the remaining seven {{races in the}} Craftsman Truck Series driving a Toyota Tundra for Bill Davis Racing and undertake a full-time Sprint Cup Series schedule in 2008. In Villeneuve's first Truck Series race on September 22, 2007, in Las Vegas Motor Speedway, he qualified in seventh position, and finished 21st. He made his NASCAR Nextel Cup race debut in the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama over the weekend of October 5–7, 2007. He qualified sixth, however, due to his lack of experience {{in this type of}} car, he elected to start the race {{from the back of the}} field and ran there for most of the race. He finished 21st due to a large number of accidents and mechanical failure on the other cars. Villeneuve failed to qualify for the 2008 Daytona 500. He lost his ride in Bill Davis Racing's No. 27 car due to a loss of sponsorship, two days after he caused a pileup in his qualifying race, when his car got loose, then <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> up the track, colliding with another car. He took part in the Nationwide race in Montreal for Braun Racing. The race started off in the sun, but before halfway, it began to rain and the teams were told to pit and use rain-tires, for the first time in NASCAR. Qualifying 5th, Villeneuve finished 16th after crashing into a car during a caution caused by poor visibility due to the rain. The race ended shortly after.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's as {{plain as}} daylight!" [...] cried Tom. [...] "The thief didn't {{have to open}} the safe door at all. He simply came in here, removed that board, <b>slid</b> up the <b>back</b> section of the safe, and took out what he wanted." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} week at Bristol, while running 5th, leader Denny Hamlin was wrecked by Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead, which then sent Hamlin's {{car into the}} inside wall. Hamlin's car then <b>slid</b> right <b>back</b> {{up in front of}} the No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was bad enough to send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.|$|R
50|$|During {{afternoon}} practice, John Andretti {{added to}} the D & R Team's woes, with a wreck in turn one. Sitting on the bubble, Andretti was practicing in expectations to re-qualify. The back end broke loose, and he slid into the wall. Graham Rahal was following close behind the crash. He went high to avoid debris, but Andretti's car <b>slid</b> right <b>back</b> into his path. Rahal took evasive action, and spun the car inside to avoid contact. He suffered four flat tires, but kept the car off the wall.|$|R
2500|$|After their 1946 Series win, the Cardinals <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> to {{the middle}} of the National League while the New York City clubs Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants loomed as National League powerhouses, {{stockpiling}} such stars as Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, Willie Mays and Monte Irvin. [...] The Cardinals managed 13 winning seasons from 1947–63, including a [...]612 winning percentage and 96 wins in 1949, but were unable to realize a first-place finish and did not make a World Series appearance again until 1964.|$|E
2500|$|Participating in Operation Mo, {{during the}} {{invasion}} of Tulagi from 3 to 4 May 1942, Kikuzuki was torpedoed by United States Navy aircraft from the aircraft carrier [...] in Tulagi harbor on 4 may, killing 12 crewmen and injuring 22 others. The submarine chaser Toshi Maru No.3 towed her to the beach at Gatuvu Island and took off the survivors. Kikuzuki then <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> into the water on 5 May 1942 during the next high tide cycle and sank at coordinates [...] Kikuzuki was struck from the Navy List on 25 May 1942.|$|E
2500|$|When Ghana (then Gold Coast) {{was under}} colonial rule, a few {{citizens}} {{complained about the}} practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads. [...] They derided him as [...] "the blind {{man who wants to}} help others see". [...] The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924. [...] The investigating District Commissioner, W. Price Jones, called it [...] "a pernicious habit of handing girls over to the fetish", but for economic reasons, decided not to interfere. [...] As a result of that inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished. [...] Soon after, the colonial government ignored another complaint that the shrine was still keeping trokosi. After that, the practice <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.|$|E

50|$|The aircraft, with 139 {{passengers}} and five crew members, was carrying forty {{more people than}} the plane was designed to carry, without taking cargo into account. It crashed two minutes after take-off. Some reports speculate that cargo may have <b>slid</b> to the <b>back</b> of the plane, resulting in a weight imbalance and causing the crash.|$|R
60|$|As {{she worked}} {{she failed to}} hear the {{scraping}} of naked bodies clambering over the ship's side, or the padding of unshod feet upon the deck above her. She {{was about to give}} up her work at the hatch when the heavy wooden cover suddenly commenced to move above her as though actuated by some supernatural power. Fascinated, the girl stood gazing in wide-eyed astonishment as one end of the hatch rose higher and higher until a little patch of blue sky revealed the fact that morning had come. Then the cover <b>slid</b> suddenly <b>back</b> and Virginia Maxon found herself looking into a savage and terrible face.|$|R
2500|$|By now my {{dysentery}} was so violent I was draining blood. Every {{one of the}} men {{was sick}} from one cause or another. My shoulders were worn raw from the pack straps, and I left the pack behind... The boys with me weren't in much better shape... A scout moving ahead suddenly held his rifle high in the air. That meant Enemy sighted... Then at last we saw them, coming down the railroad four abreast... The gunner crouched low over his tommy-gun and tightened down. Then the gun spoke. Down flopped a half-dozen Japs, then another half dozen. The [...] column spewed from their marching formation into the bush. We grabbed up the gun and <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> into the jungle. Sometimes staggering, sometimes running, sometimes dragging, I made it back to camp. I was so sick I didn't care whether the Japs broke through or not; so sick I didn't worry any more about letting the colonel down. All I wanted was unconsciousness.|$|E
2500|$|During {{extensive}} ice {{trials in}} the Bothnian Bay in March 1986, Otso was put {{through a series}} of test to determine her icebreaking capability. In a race against the 1975-built Urho in [...] level ice, Otso beat the older but more powerful four-propelled icebreaker by more than a ship's length, showing that in terms of ice resistance the new icebreaker was superior to her predecessor. In [...] ice, she could easily maintain a speed of [...] and small ice ridges along the way appeared to be of no consequence to the vessel. However, the strength of the new icebreaker was put to the ultimate test when she encountered a large pressure ridge reaching {{all the way to the}} seafloor some [...] below the surface. After preparations, Otso was accelerated to a speed of [...] and rammed into the ridge at full power. Since the new icebreaker had a smooth inclined stem and lacked the bow propellers of her predecessors, she rode up the ridge and began listing to the port side as the hull rose from the water. After coming to a stop, Otso <b>slid</b> <b>back</b> by herself without utilizing the engines, and the ridge was penetrated on the second charge. The robustness of the ship and its propulsion system were further proven when the icebreaker was backed into a ridge at [...] "to prove to the customer it doesn't break".|$|E

60|$|The mother's head {{appeared}} at the bedroom window. She <b>slid</b> the sash <b>back,</b> and craned out, vainly trying {{to look over the}} gutter below the slates. She was even more dishevelled than usual, and the tears had dried on her pale face. She stretched further out, clinging to the window frame and to the gutter overhead, till I was afraid she would come down with a crash.|$|R

6000|$|They whinnied {{in concert}} {{to see these}} scampering Mulgars come panting over the snow. And Nod remembered {{instantly}} the longed-for gongs and stripes of his childhood, and he called like a parakeet: [...] "Tishnar, O Tishnar!" [...] He could say no more. The Wonderstone that had lain couched on his tongue, as he opened his mouth, <b>slid</b> softly <b>back,</b> paused for his cry, and the next instant had glided down his throat. But by this time Thumb had straddled {{the biggest of the}} little plunging beasts. And, like arrows from the Gunga's bow, each with his hands clasped tight about his Zevvera's neck, away went Thumb, away went Thimble, away went Nod, the night wind whistling in their ears, their rags a-flutter, the clear stripes of the Zevveras winking in the rising moon.|$|R

Brian Vickers, the other Toyota driver in the event, started fourth, and though he went back-and-forth through the field, finished eighth.|$|R
50|$|The next new moon, {{the moon}} {{said that the}} princess of Adana was more beautiful, so the mother knew where her {{daughter}} was. She had a beautiful ring made {{that would make the}} wearer fall asleep and had a witch bring it to her daughter, pleading that she had been out of her mind when she ordered her death. The gypsy girl persuaded the daughter to wear the ring, and she fell down dead. The prince refused to bury his wife; he would tend her as she had tended him. Many doctors were unable to heal her, but one tried to steal the ring. She started to come awake; he <b>slid</b> it <b>back</b> on and got the prince to promise him rewards for healing his wife. Then he took the ring off, which restored Nourie Hadig to life.|$|R
5000|$|About 12:40 pm, {{the lookout}} {{on the bridge}} spotted a {{submerged}} rock directly ahead and the captain ordered an immediate change of course. This course was confirmed around 12:43 pm by First Officer Reiling using location bearings. Seconds later the ship struck a rock which did not show on the nautical charts at that time. The outer skin of Monte Cervantes was ripped open and water poured in. According to a passenger, there was a [...] "formidable breach in the keel and a thunderous din of roaring engines and then, suddenly, the boat leaned left." [...] The resulting shock and vibrations caused innumerable plates, cups, and even furniture to break. The hatches were closed, but soon Monte Cervantes slipped a little and <b>slid</b> slightly <b>back</b> into the sea. More water poured into the interior and flooded the cargo hold and steerage.|$|R
