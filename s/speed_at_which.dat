5|$|Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel {{long before}} Lucas would shoot it. They trained {{extensively}} with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As {{in the previous}} two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes {{without the use of}} stunt doubles. The <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.|$|E
5|$|The forward <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> non-oscillatory leaning increases, {{where the}} capsize mode {{eigenvalues}} switch from negative to positive in a pitchfork bifurcation at about 8m/s (18mph) in this example, {{is called the}} capsize speed. Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled bike to fall over.|$|E
5|$|The forward <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> {{oscillations}} begin, {{at about}} 1m/s (2.2mph) in this example, {{sometimes called the}} double root speed due to there being a repeated root to the characteristic polynomial (two of the four eigenvalues have exactly the same value). Below this speed, the bike simply falls over as an inverted pendulum does.|$|E
50|$|Landings are {{typically}} performed very differently. Although a conventional landing is possible, {{the range of}} <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> {{this can be done}} is narrow due to relatively vulnerable outrigger undercarriage. Operationally, a near-vertical landing with some forward speed is preferred.|$|R
50|$|Some of the unit's {{most common}} uses {{are in the}} {{description}} of sine waves and musical tones, particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications. It is also used to describe the <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> computers and other electronics are driven.|$|R
50|$|Air-to-air {{missiles}} are typically long, thin cylinders {{in order to}} reduce their cross section and thus minimize drag <b>at</b> the high <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they travel. Missiles are divided into five primary systems (moving forward to aft): seeker, guidance, warhead, rocket motor, and control actuation.|$|R
5|$|The forward <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> {{oscillations}} do not increase, {{where the}} weave mode eigenvalues switch from positive to negative in a Hopf bifurcation at about 5.3m/s (12mph) in this example, {{is called the}} weave speed. Below this speed, oscillations increase until the uncontrolled bike falls over. Above this speed, oscillations eventually die out.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E

5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} {{are able to}} use liquid crystals {{in a variety of}} applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, {{leading to the}} development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved {{with the use of the}} rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon. Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> ships could be sailed.|$|E
50|$|A drogue {{parachute}} is more elongated {{and has a}} far smaller area than a conventional parachute and therefore provides less drag. This means that a {{drogue parachute}} cannot slow an object {{as much as a}} conventional parachute, but it can be deployed <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> conventional parachutes would be torn apart.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of redistributing the tax burden across {{households}} on the current account. The set-up is a dynamic small open economy with infinitely lived households that have perfect foresight. It is shown that the different <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> households adjust consumption levels to their long-run values may cause nonmonotonic transient paths. ...|$|R
50|$|For flow between Mach 3 and 3.5 during cruise flight, <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the {{turbojet}} {{could not}} function {{because of the}} temperature limitations of its turbine blades, this design provides the ability to operate from zero speed to over Mach 3 using the best features of both the turbojet and ramjet combined into a single engine.|$|R
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} concerns {{for the design of}} venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a very long time to disperse from a badly designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage. Malliagh explained that Chinese Nü Yr is based {{a story about}} 'Xiāngjiāo', a gelatinous and amorphous worm who wears a witch hat and is voiced by heavily pitch-shifted and processed recordings {{of his father and}} little sister. Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground. Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> it travels. In a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated the fate of the worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E
50|$|The working {{principle}} involves electrification of the propellant (gas or water) which {{can then be}} directed by a magnetic field, pushing the vehicle in the opposite direction. Although some working prototypes exist, MHD drives remain impractical due to the slow <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they generally propel a vessel and {{the large amount of}} energy needed to operate them.|$|R

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> data can be analysed.|$|E

When afterburning engines are equipped with a C-D nozzle the throat area is variable. Nozzles for supersonic flight <b>speeds,</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> high nozzle pressure ratios are generated, also have variable area divergent sections.|$|R
50|$|The first McLaren crest logo was {{designed}} in 1964. The logo {{focused on a}} kiwi, which was based upon New Zealand's national symbol. The ‘Speedy Kiwi’ version was introduced in 1967, once again designed by Michael Turner to emphasize the higher <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> Bruce’s cars were racing. Its colour palette featured a papaya orange, which became known as ‘McLaren Orange’ and was introduced in their cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantage}} of a plasma cannon is that it uses electricity as energy source. The more energy is supplied the faster the gases expand and the faster the projectile is accelerated.

5|$|On {{water-based}} pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce {{friction and}} increase the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, {{during and after the}} game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile third-generation or 3G pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon Sagas battles {{take place}} while flying on the dragon. They mix {{real-time}} and turn-based elements, with three action gauges that charge in real time. When a gauge fills, the player {{can make a}} move, such as attacking or using an item such as a shield or poison cure. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates more options, such as making multiple moves in quick succession, but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack. The <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's agility attribute; if this {{is higher than the}} enemy's agility attribute, the player can make moves more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{due to the}} <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> she was constructed, Tsukuba {{reportedly}} {{suffered from}} numerous defects. Shortly after she was completed in 1907, the ship sailed for America where she participated in the Jamestown Exposition Naval Review in May. The ship then sailed to Europe where she made numerous port visits {{over the next several}} months. While in Britain, Tsukuba was fitted with a Vickers fire-control system that calculated the firing data for each gun and with which the gunnery officer fired the guns in unison. Ikoma visited England in July 1910 as part of the Japan–British Exhibition.|$|E
