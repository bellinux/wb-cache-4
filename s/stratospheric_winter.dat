The {{dynamical}} {{evolution of}} the relatively warm <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> season 2002 – 2003 in the Northern Hemisphere was studied and compared with the cold winter 2004 – 2005 based on NCEP-Reanalyses.

Six sudden stratospheric warming events, including the major warming event with a splitting of the polar vortex in mid-January 2003, have been identified. This led to a very high vacillation of the zonal mean circulation and a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex over the whole winter season.

40|$|In this study, the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> {{circulation}} in the coupled middle atmosphere ocean model MAECHAM 5 /MPI-OM, is analysed. Due to the dynamical and thermodynamical {{interaction with the}} ocean, the simulated atmospheric circulation {{is affected by the}} internal variability of the ocean. Differences of the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> circulation between MAECHAM 5 /MPI-OM and former MAECHAM 5 simulations may be attributed to the interactive ocean. This work is divided into three parts: first the climatology of the model is examined, then major Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs), and at last the relationship between these warmings and tropospheric blockings. To examine how the model reproduces the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> circulation, the climatology of the zonal mean zonal wind and of planetary waves of zonal wavenumber 1 to 3, are carefully analysed and compared with those obtained from ERA- 40 observations. While the zonal mean zonal wind is in good agreement with observations, amplitudes and phases of zonal wavenumber 2 are not well represented. Major SSWs are analysed because of the strong impact that such phenomena can have throughout the atmosphere, influencing the weather at the surface for several weeks after the onset of the warming. To identify major SSWs, a new algorithm based on the 10 hPa zonal mean zonal wind at 60 °N, is developed. This is done because a comparison between a recent study by Charlton and Polvani (2007) and the Freie Universität Berlin climatology of mid-winter major SSWs, reveals a significant disagreement. The new algorithm is applied to two databases: one obtained from the model simulation and one from the ERA- 40 assimilation. ERA- 40 data are used for validation of MAECHAM 5 /MPI-OM. Comparison of the obtained frequencies of major SSWs shows that in the model a slightly higher number of events occurs. While in ERA- 40 the average frequency is of 0. 60 events per year, in the model it is of 0. 70 events per year. The seasonal distributions show also that the highest number of major SSWs occurs in January and in February respectively for ERA- 40 and model data, which is improved for MAECHAM 5 /MPI-OM compared to former MAECHAM 5 simulations. In this work, unlike previous model studies, the state of the polar vortex is also examined during the pre-warming phase of major SSWs, by analysing the planetary wave activity, to determine the behaviour of waves with different zonal wavenumbers. Only planetary waves of zonal wavenumber 1 and 2 appear to have {{a key role in the}} development of major SSWs, with wavenumber- 1 events being more frequent than wavenumber- 2 events and a ratio of 57 : 13 similar as observed. Because of the influence of tropospheric blockings on major SSWs via alteration of planetary waves, a correlation analysis is performed to determine if the model represents this relationship well. It appears that Pacific blockings are correlated with wavenumber- 2 major SSWs although a larger number of wavenumber- 2 events would be necessary to make such assertion. No significant correlation is instead obtained for wavenumber- 1 major warmings...|$|E

40|$|The 2015 / 2016  Arctic {{winter was}} one of the coldest <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winters</b> in recent years. A stable vortex formed by early December and the early winter was {{exceptionally}} cold. Cold pool temperatures dropped below the nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) existence temperature of about 195  K, thus allowing polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) to form. The low temperatures in the polar stratosphere persisted until early March, allowing chlorine activation and catalytic ozone destruction. Satellite observations indicate that sedimentation of PSC particles led to denitrification as well as dehydration of stratospheric layers. Model simulations of the 2015 / 2016 Arctic winter nudged toward European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis data were performed with the atmospheric chemistry–climate model ECHAM 5 /MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) for the Polar Stratosphere in a Changing Climate (POLSTRACC) campaign. POLSTRACC is a High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO) mission aimed at the investigation of the structure, composition and evolution of the Arctic upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The chemical and physical processes involved in Arctic stratospheric ozone depletion, transport and mixing processes in the UTLS at high latitudes, PSCs and cirrus clouds are investigated. In this study, an overview of the chemistry and dynamics of the 2015 / 2016 Arctic winter as simulated with EMAC is given. Further, chemical–dynamical processes such as denitrification, dehydration and ozone loss during the 2015 / 2016 Arctic winter are investigated. Comparisons to satellite observations by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura/MLS) as well as to airborne measurements with the Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere (GLORIA) performed aboard HALO during the POLSTRACC campaign show that the EMAC simulations nudged toward ECMWF analysis generally agree well with observations. We derive a maximum polar stratospheric O 3 loss of ∼  2  ppmv or 117  DU in terms of column ozone in mid-March.

As stratosphere-resolving general circulation models begin to resolve the QBO and represent its teleconnections with other parts of the climate system, it seems timely to summarize what is currently known about the QBO’s high-latitude influence.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of the {{strength}} of the polar <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> vortex in the dynamics of the life cycles of North Atlantic teleconnections. A new set of teleconnection patterns was produced from low-pass-filtered daily 300 hPa height data of NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data 1958 - 1998. All teleconnections are meridional dipoles, which to a certain degree resemble the North Atlantic Oscillation based on surface pressure data. There are two distinct teleconnections (one over the eastern and one over the western North Atlantic) during episodes of weak polar vortex, and only one, over the central North Atlantic, during strong polar vortex episodes. The teleconnections have periods of about two weeks. Stream function tendency analysis of the life cycles shows that the relatively simple resulting teleconnections evolve from very complex structures. During the growth phase of the teleconnection indices there are strong and systematic differences between the two polar vortex regimes. While in the weak vortex regime the anomaly growth is mainly driven by transient eddy vorticity fluxes from the low-frequency domain, in the strong vortex regime there is also low-frequency advection of relative vorticity resulting from the interaction of low-frequency eddies with stationary eddies.

By separating the response into high (36 months) frequency domains, {{we have found that}} spatially different 11 -year SC signals exist for high- and low-frequency domains. In the stratosphere, the high- and low-frequency responses tend to enhance each other near the Equator and Subtropics, while they oppose one another at high latitudes. The high-frequency response is marked by a strengthened <b>stratospheric</b> jet during <b>winter</b> and the response is not static but tracks with the centre of the polar vortex. In the lower stratosphere, the positive response of temperature to the 11 -year SC is dominated by its low-frequency component, which extends from the North Pole to the South Pole. The low-frequency tropospheric response is latitudinally symmetrical about the Equator and consistent with the modelled responses to temperature perturbation in the lower stratosphere. The signals are found to be sensitive to contamination from the 2002 sudden stratospheric warming event and major volcanic eruptions but the general spatial pattern of the responses remains similar.

40|$|Wave and zonal mean {{features}} of the downward dynamic coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere are compared by applying a time-lagged singular value decomposition analysis to Northern Hemisphere height fields decomposed into zonal mean and its deviations. It is found that both zonal and wave components contribute to the downward interaction, with zonal wave 1 (due to reflection) dominating on the short time scale (up to 12 days) and the zonal mean (due to wave–mean-flow interaction) dominating on the longer time scale. It is further shown that the two processes dominate during different years, depending {{on the state of}} the stratosphere. Winters characterized by a basic state that is reflective for wave 1 show a strong relationship between stratospheric and tropospheric wave- 1 fields when the stratosphere is leading and show no significant correlations in the zonal mean fields. On the other hand, winters characterized by a stratospheric state that does not reflect waves show a strong relationship only between stratospheric and tropospheric zonal mean fields. This study suggests that there are two types of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> states, characterized by different downward dynamic interaction.

40|$|The {{importance}} of stratospheric dynamics for the stratospheric ozone {{distribution in the}} Northern Hemisphere is investigated using multi-annual simulations of the coupled dynamic-chemical general circulation model ECHAM 3 /CHEM. This model includes a parameterization for heterogeneous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) and on sulphate aerosols. A warm and a cold <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> are examined to estimate the range of chemical ozone loss due to heterogeneous reactions on PSCs. Ozone depletion in the model mainly occurs inside the polar vortex. An additional ozone reduction due to heterogeneous reactions on PSCs is found as well outside the polar vortex. Secondary vortex formation and vortex contraction after an elongation lead to a transport of airmasses with chemically reduced ozone values out of the vortex. Except for such events, {{the edge of the}} modelled polar vortex acts as a barrier to transport. During the formation of secondary vortices no additional heterogeneous reactions occur therein. Other dynamic events like the elongation of the polar vortex and its displacement to lower latitudes lead to an intense ozone depletion. A modelled minor stratospheric warming causes a total deactivation of chlorine components and prevents further ozone depletion. In midlatitudes, the amplitude of short-term variations of total ozone is amplified by PSC heterogeneous chemical ozone reduction. (orig.)

40|$|This study {{provides}} a mechanistic {{explanation of why}} the Holton-Tan (HT) effect, a phenomenon in which the strength of northern <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> polar vortex synchronizes with the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), was disrupted in the middle to late winters of 1978 – 1997. In line with recent reassessments of the HT effect, we find that an easterly QBO in the lower stratosphere leads {{to the formation of}} a midlatitude wave guide that enhances both the upward propagating planetary waves from the troposphere into the lower stratosphere (~ 35 – 50 °N, 30 – 200 [*]hPa) and the northward wave propagation in the upper to middle stratosphere (~ 35 – 60 °N, 20 – 5 [*]hPa). This enhanced poleward refraction of planetary waves results in a more disturbed polar vortex, causing the HT effect. The weakening of the HT effect in 1978 – 1997 was associated with a broader and strengthened polar vortex in November to January. The divergence of wave activity generated by eddies growing within the vortex provided the momentum source and allowed wave activity to propagate meridionally away from the vortex; this interfered with the QBO modulation of planetary wave propagation and led to a weakening of the HT effect during this period. The stronger than average polar vortex in 1978 – 1997 was associated with a vertically coherent cooling signature over northeastern Asia in the stratosphere. We suggest that a change of stratospheric circulation and/or a change of the stratosphere-troposphere coupling were the main causes for the disrupted HT effect in 1978 – 1997...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> {{polar vortex}} {{consists}} of strong westerly winds; this winter flow regime can undergo a complete breakdown during sudden stratospheric warming events. In the Northern Hemisphere these events are {{often accompanied by}} the descent of anomalous flow regimes which can result in extreme surface weather. The focus of this thesis is to assess sudden stratospheric warmings and {{their place in the}} coupled climate system. Portions of this work are dedicated to algorithm development with the aim of quickly and accurately isolating and subcategorising events. A method is successfully created that is computationally cheap, easy to implement, based on dynamically relevant criteria and has error rates clearly outlined. Impacts on the surface and ocean are assessed with focus on specific subclasses of sudden stratospheric warmings. It is found that there is, on average, stronger surface and oceanic impacts following events that split the polar vortex. The ocean system is impacted via modifications to the implied Ekman heat transport and the net atmosphere-surface heat flux. Furthermore, there is a relationship between the initial location of the disturbed polar vortex and the strength of anomalous flow regime at the surface. Analysis is conducted predominantly using general circulation model output, with direct comparison between an atmosphere-only model and a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. For the coupled model there is a {{reduction in the number of}} simulated sudden stratospheric warmings, a result of altered atmospheric wave dynamics. This is partially attributed to a cold bias over the equatorial Pacific. The frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings is found to be insensitive to North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies...|$|E

In the unique winter 2015 / 16, cold and persistent areas with temperatures below the ice frost point T ice developed in the Arctic stratosphere, caused by reduced perturbations of the polar vortex through planetary waves. Due to these extreme conditions, unprecedented and widespread ice PSCs formed and persisted {{for more than a}} month in the Arctic. These ice PSCs were repeatedly detected by lidars on the CALIPSO satellite and on the high altitude long range research aircraft HALO. A new lower threshold of the backscatter ratio − 1 of 0. 3 for ice PSCs derived from high-resolution lidar measurements at 532 nm wavelength leads to enhanced ice PSC coverage compared to previous analysis. The ice PSCs were generally surrounded by nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and supercooled ternary solution (STS) clouds. By combining optical PSC data and trajectory analysis, we investigate ice formation pathways. In addition to ice nucleation in STSm with meteoric dust, we find that ice nucleation on pre-existing NAT may play an important role in polar winter. Persistent synoptic-scale Arctic ice PSCs have not been observed so far. Hence, ice PSCs are a sensitive marker for cold <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> temperatures modulated by natural variability and climate change...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{evolution of}} the relatively warm <b>stratospheric</b> <b>winter</b> season 2002 – 2003 in the Northern Hemisphere was studied and compared with the cold winter 2004 – 2005 based on NCEP-Reanalyses. Record low temperatures were observed in the lower and middle stratosphere over the Arctic region only {{at the beginning of}} the 2002 – 2003 winter. Six sudden stratospheric warming events, including the major warming event with a splitting of the polar vortex in mid-January 2003, have been identified. This led to a very high vacillation of the zonal mean circulation and a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex over the whole winter season. An estimate of the mean chemical ozone destruction inside the polar vortex showed a total ozone loss of about 45 DU in winter 2002 – 2003; that is about 2. 5 times smaller than in winter 2004 – 2005. Embedded in a winter with high wave activity, we found two subtropical Rossby wave trains in the troposphere before the major sudden stratospheric warming event in January 2003. These Rossby waves propagated north-eastwards and maintained two upper tropospheric anticyclones. At the same time, the amplification of an upward propagating planetary wave 2 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere was observed, which could be caused primarily by those two wave trains. Furthermore, two extratropical Rossby wave trains over the North Pacific Ocean and North America were identified a couple of days later, which contribute mainly to the vertical planetary wave activity flux just before and during the major warming event. It is shown that these different tropospheric forcing processes caused the major warming event and contributed to the splitting of the polar vortex...|$|E
30|$|One {{study by}} Hegy et al. (2014) was {{performed}} using the Community Earth System Model 1 (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model) (CESM 1 (WACCM)) version 1.0. 2 {{to investigate the}} initial transient response of the boreal <b>winter</b> <b>stratospheric</b> polar vortex to localised SST warming events. They conducted 20 perpetual winter simulations. According to their results, the polar vortex was weakened by changes in the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation and negative anomalies appeared in the eddy momentum flux convergence. They also demonstrated that the initial state and subsequent internal variation of the extratropical atmosphere is equally important {{to the type of}} SST forcing in determining the response of the stratospheric polar vortex. Furthermore, they found that the interactions between the internal variability of the vortex and the SST-driven wave anomalies govern the nature of the polar vortex response to the forcing.|$|R
40|$|Inter-hemispheric {{coupling}} {{between the}} polar summer mesosphere and planetary-wave {{activity in the}} extra-tropical winter stratosphere has recently been inferred using Polar Mesospheric Cloud (PMC) properties {{as a proxy for}} mesospheric temperature (Karlsson et al., 2007). Here we confirm these results using a ten-year time series of July mesospheric temperatures near 60 &deg; N derived from the hydroxyl (OH) nightglow. In addition, we show that the time/lagged correlation between these summer mesospheric temperatures and the ECMWF <b>winter</b> <b>stratospheric</b> temperatures displays a strong Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). The sign and phase of the correlation is consistent with the QBO modulation of the extra-tropical stratospheric dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere via the Holton-Tan mechanism (Holton and Tan, 1980). This lends strength to the identification of synoptic and planetary waves as the driver of the inter-hemispheric coupling, and results in a strong QBO modulation of the polar summer mesospheric temperatures...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{mechanisms}} linking Arctic sea-ice loss {{to changes in}} mid-latitude surface temperatures, we conduct idealized modeling experiments using an intermediate general circulation model and with sea-ice loss confined to the Atlantic or Pacific sectors of the Arctic (Barents-Kara or Chukchi-Bering Seas). Extending previous findings, there are opposite effects on the <b>winter</b> <b>stratospheric</b> polar vortex for both large-magnitude (late twenty-first century) and moderate-magnitude sea-ice loss. Accordingly, there are opposite tropospheric Arctic Oscillation (AO) responses for moderate-magnitude sea-ice loss. However, there are similar strength negative AO responses for large magnitude sea-ice loss, suggesting that tropospheric mechanisms become relatively more important than stratospheric mechanisms as the sea-ice loss magnitude increases. The mid-latitude surface temperature response for each loss region and magnitude {{can be understood as}} the combination of an ‘indirect’ part induced by the large-scale circulation (AO) response, and a residual ‘direct’ part that is local to the loss region...|$|R
