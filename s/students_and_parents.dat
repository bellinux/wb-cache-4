500|$|The {{next year}} Tunis {{took a break}} from {{baseball}} stories to release two novels that again received starred reviews from Kirkus. Million Miler, based {{on the life of}} TWA and U.S. Air Corps pilot Jack Zimmerman, was overshadowed by his other 1942 release, All American, called by Simon Certner in The English Journal [...] "the most superb novel produced in its genre". All American centers on football star Ronald Perry, who in protest over anti-Semitic activity and guilt for his part in it, leaves his prep school to play football for the local public high school, which does not exactly welcome him. Perry ultimately adjusts and becomes accepted, leading his new team to a postseason playoff. However, the team is invited only if they agree not to bring their one African-American player. Initially Perry {{is the only one who}} objects to this, but his refusal eventually stirs other <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> to protest as well. Kirkus Reviews said of Tunis' only football novel, [...] "This is one of the BIG books of the Fall, and should not be pigeonholed for junior reading." [...] It further praised the book for illustrating [...] "the whole rounded picture of race and color problems facing young and old today". Sixty-eight years later D.G. Myers, in [...] "About the Manliest Sport", his 2010 article for Commentary magazine, decries the lack of good novels about football, calling All American [...] "the best of a bad harvest... No one is better at describing the action on the field", though Myers warns that [...] "readers will find Tunis dated". In a chapter titled [...] "John R. Tunis: The Best of the Best", Michelle Nolan's 2010 book Ball Tales praises All American as [...] "a perceptive novel of character, of morals, and it's far ahead of its time". Just how ahead of its time may be seen when Nolan points out that Hans Walleen's illustrations [...] "may be the first of an African American football player in action in an American sports novel." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{changes in}} <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors resulting from {{participation in the}} Michigan Safe Routes to School program. All 50 states are receiving federal funds to implement programs and build infrastructure that encourages school-aged children to walk or bike to school. This research applies a modified model of the Theory of Planned Behavior, which aims to explain the relationship between beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. Specifically, 20 schools were evaluated pre-program and post-program using attitudinal and behavioral data collected from <b>students</b> <b>and</b> their <b>parents,</b> as well as classroom tallies for daily transportation behaviors. Findings show positive changes in <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> attitudes <b>and</b> beliefs, while changes in intentions or behaviors were minimal. These results represent an early step forward in improving the ability of school-age <b>students</b> to walk <b>and</b> bike to school safely. We believe that affecting intentions and behaviors is a long-term process that requires the continued collaboration of <b>students,</b> <b>parents,</b> school officials, <b>and</b> community leaders...|$|R
