In the early 1980s, Lakeview worked at full capacity after problems at Pickering in August 1983 resulted in a brief power shortage. In the early 1990s the station was partially overhauled. A <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> led to the mothballing of four units.

This role was especially critical on hot days when air conditioning use drove up electricity demand.|$|E
40|$|A case of {{selection}} and adaptation of weekly work schedules is presented. Weekly work schedules in two franchises {{of an important}} retail clothing chain have to be established. Working time accounts are used: each week, an employee can owe the company {{a certain number of}} hours or vice versa. Nevertheless, over a certain threshold, the hours have to be paid for by the company and the account balance returns to zero. A minimum and desired level of capacity of employees is contemplated. Hierarchically, the planned capacity must attempt to reach the minimum level; then it must fit a desired level as much as possible. At present, the task of allocation and the final adjustment of schedules is done manually, which is difficult, ineffective and often inaccurate. The procedure proposed is divided into two phases. Firstly, a work schedule, selected from a list, is assigned to each worker; a mixed linear program, followed by a local optimization process, is used. In the second phase, the work schedules are modified according to predefined rules: if there is a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity,</b> work schedules are reduced, {{and if there is a}} shortage, work schedules are extended. The company considers the results to be satisfactory. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{regulatory}} {{reforms have}} led to several novel spectrum sharing models under the general umbrella of dynamic spectrum sharing. The private commons model introduced by FCC in 2004 allows spectrum licensees to provide secondary access to spectrum on an opportunistic basis while retaining ownership. Since wireless communication systems are typically overprovisioned in order to deliver service-level guarantees to (primary) users under short-term load variations, this model bears significant potential by facilitating utilization of temporal <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> through serving secondary users at possibly different service level. A potential barrier to adoption of the private commons model is the uncertainty about secondary price-demand relationship which is difficult to predict in an emerging market: A selected price for secondary access may be profitable for some values of secondary demand but not for others, leading to a profound uncertainty about ultimate benefit of spectrum sharing. This paper aims to eliminate such uncertainty by devising concrete guidelines and methods for profitability. The paper establishes {{that the price of}} secondary spectrum access can be chosen to guarantee profitability for any value of secondary demand: It is shown that for both the coordinated and uncoordinated commons regimes a profitable price should exceed a threshold value, which can be calculated. Hence profitability of private commons is insensitive to the relationship between price and demand. The paper also leverages the insensitivity property and provides a technique to further enhance revenue via iterative spectrum offerings. 1...|$|E

The secondary data recorded in 2012 were collected from the power policy bureau in Thailand. Two concepts of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) were adopted to analyze a group of 57 biomass power plants. The results indicated that a SFA model exhibited the highest score of 0. 877, followed by a Constant Return to Scale- DEA (CRS-DEA) and Variable Return to Scale-DEA (VRS-DEA) at 0. 841 and 0. 722, respectively.

50|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, weaving was {{a manual}} craft and wool was the {{principal}} staple. In the great wool districts a form of factory system had been introduced but in the uplands weavers worked from home on a putting-out system. The wooden looms of that time might be broad or narrow; broad looms were those too wide for the weaver to pass the shuttle through the shed, so that the weaver needed an expensive assistant (often an apprentice). This ceased to be necessary after John Kay invented the flying shuttle in 1733. The shuttle and the picking stick sped up the process of weaving. There was thus a shortage of thread or a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> weaving <b>capacity.</b> The opening <b>of</b> the Bridgewater Canal in June 1761 allowed cotton to be brought into Manchester, an area rich in fast flowing streams {{that could be used}} to power machinery.

In this paper we propose the selective truncating internetwork protocol (STRIP) supporting layered data transfer, and capable of handling congestion at a finer level of granularity by truncating packets, i. e., stripping off less important data. STRIP inter-operates with the traditional IP infrastructure and can be introduced in a step-by-step fashion, starting where the benefits are obvious, for example with routers which are connected to bandwidth constrained links and which have a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> processing <b>capacity.</b> We describe the design and architecture of STRIP and compare it with solutions for differentiated forwarding on a per-packet basis.

It {{continued}} to be to provider of electrical power for the railways which by 1937 consisted of {{the whole of the}} Natal section of the Durban - Johannesburg line (516 route km) and the 229 km spur to Bethlehem in the Orange Free State. Between 1944 and 1959 a series of new generators were commissioned resulting in the power station's capacity being increased to 160 MW. [...] However, in the 1960s, changes in technology led to a change in the economics of power production. New power stations such as Ingagane [...] were built at the coal fields themselves and the use 400 kVA power lines from 1972 onwards reduced the cost of transporting electricity. In the early 1980s Eskom initiated a massive development program: in 1980 new large power stations at Kriel (3,000 MW), Hendrina (2,000 MW) and Camden (1,600 MW) had been commissioned and {{in the next few years}} a number of other new power stations gave South Africa a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> generating <b>capacity</b> and many <b>of</b> the 1960's vintage power stations (including Colenso's refurbishment) had become uneconomic.This meant that the continued use of the Colenso power station was no longer economically viable.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master Thesis is {{to study}} the {{development}} of the energy system in Aragón and analyze some options for its future development. A systems approach is applied. The report is divided in two parts. The first part studies in the historical evolution of the ener-gy system, analyzing the electrical system in detail. The second part focuses in energy model-ing. The first step is a literature review to find historical data about the energy system, and more in detail about the electrical system. The second part includes three different models: logistic curves of the electrical system, energy balance flow diagram and Long range Energy Alterna-tives Planning system (LEAP). Four scenarios are built using LEAP: the business as usual (BAU), coal priority (COAL), renewable electricity (REN) and electric cars (ELECAR). During {{the development of the}} project an important quantity of data about the energy system in Aragón has been found. However, when detailed data is needed, it is difficult to find. Ener-gy planning at national level, public and private, does not have a good quality. LEAP is an easy program to use and with little requirements, although there were some prob-lems when using it.

COAL is the cheapest scenario, but with more emissions. One of the important conclusions of the study {{is that there is a}} <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> installed <b>capacity</b> in Aragón.

For the outsourced parts, the vendor can choose between different models <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> supply (MCS) that are offered by external providers differentiating with respect to elasticity <b>of</b> provided <b>capacity</b> and the underlying pricing model.
