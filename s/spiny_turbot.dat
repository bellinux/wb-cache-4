5000|$|Psettodes belcheri E. T. Bennett, 1831 (spottail <b>spiny</b> <b>turbot)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The flounders and <b>spiny</b> <b>turbots</b> eat smaller fish, {{and have}} {{well-developed}} teeth. They sometimes seek prey in the midwater, {{away from the}} bottom, and show fewer extreme adaptations than other families. The soles, by contrast, are almost exclusively bottom-dwellers, and feed on invertebrates. They show a more extreme asymmetry, and may lack teeth {{on one side of}} the jaw.|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{characteristic}} of flatfish, {{other than their}} flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes {{are on the same}} side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive <b>spiny</b> <b>turbots</b> include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.|$|R
50|$|The <b>spiny</b> <b>turbots</b> are a family, Psettodidae, of {{relatively}} large, primitive flatfish {{found in the}} tropical waters of the east Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. The family contains just three species, {{all in the same}} genus, Psettodes. The common name comes from the presence of spines in the dorsal and anal fins, which may indicate an evolutionary relationship with the Perciformes. They are less asymmetrical than other flatfish, although the region around the eyes is twisted. They reach lengths of 55 - 80 cm.|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{characteristic}} of the flatfish is its asymmetry, with both eyes lying {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families, the eyes are usually on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are usually on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive <b>spiny</b> <b>turbots</b> include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|R
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish).
