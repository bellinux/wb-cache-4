500|$|The seventh track, [...] "Freakshow", {{is built}} around the [...] "wobbler" [...] effect of dubstep. Spears sings about dancing and being in the {{spotlight}} in lyrics such as [...] "Make them other chicks so mad / I'm 'bout to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> ass / Watch that boy". During the bridge, her vocals are pitched down low, making her sound masculine. Nearly {{a decade after the}} release of Blackout, Spears stated [...] "Freakshow" [...] is one of her favorite tracks that weren't released as singles, describing it as [...] "sassy".|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E
500|$|URBs Dan Vidal {{called the}} album [...] "a {{spectrum}} of sound — packed and arranged perfectly into a masterfully composed (debut) full-length body of work... genre-defying masterpiece". Comparing it to singer Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), Brentin Mock of The Atlantic called The ArchAndroid [...] "a smothered funk, though perhaps at times too thick, too inaccessible, {{but not so}} much I didn't want to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> ass" [...] and viewed it as musically progressive, stating [...] "Monáe has given pop music its first Toni Morrison moment, where fantasy, funk, and the ancestors come together for an experience that evolves one's soul... You really don't know whether you want to diagram it, dance to it, or just be dumbstruck. It owes as much to Parliament-Funkadelic as it does to Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler. She is finally doing what a number of artists—particularly black artists—have not been able to do in years, and that's move pop music forward". Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Barnes & Noble Review, deeming it [...] "the most overrated album of the year" [...] while writing that Monáe's [...] "songwriting is 60th percentile, her singing technical, her sci-fi plot the usual rot".|$|E

500|$|Harvey was {{regarded}} as a mercurial batsman of great artistry and style. A short man at 172cm (5ft;8in), he batted with aggression, and was known for his timing of the ball. His batting against spin bowling in particular was a crowd pleaser, highlighted by his extravagant footwork in charging the bowlers. Harvey often charged five paces down the pitch to spinners, with one bowler quipping [...] "He kept coming so far along the track toward me that I thought he must want to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> hands". Despite running out of the crease so much, Harvey was never stumped in a Test match. He was of the time belief that any bowling could and should be hit, and gave the impression that the balls were reaching the boundary with a minimum of power. According to Johnnie Moyes, [...] "the sight of his slim figure, neat and trim-looking, always capless, coming to bat brought new hope for spectators. He will never prod a half volley or decline the challenge of a long hop...he will go looking for the ball which he can hit for four." [...] Following the retirement of Sir Donald Bradman, he was seen as Australia's leading batsman, noted by critics for a similar ability to change the mood of matches with his attacking play. Ashley Mallett said that Harvey is Australia's best batsman since Bradman. This was {{despite the fact that he}} was found to have faulty eyesight. With the global expansion of cricket, Harvey was the first Australian to make Test centuries in 15 different cities, succeeding in a variety of conditions. Harvey made 67 first-class centuries spread across 35 venues in six countries. He scored 38 of these overseas, where his average was higher. He was the first batsman to score more than 10,000 runs for Australian teams at home and abroad.|$|E

2500|$|Avery's tactics {{during that}} {{series against the}} Devils earned {{multiple}} power plays, and he scored {{in each of the}} first three games. His controversial yet effective antics helped lead the Rangers to a 4–1 series win. At the end of the series, Brodeur refused to shake Avery's hand.

The Blues, if anything, are deeply sexual. You know, 'my car doesn't run, I'm gonna check my oil'... 'if you don't like my apples, don't <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> tree'.

[...] "I remember when the gravity of the situation dawned on me. It was during the 2006 July war, I was 14 then… but it didn't really <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> view of Lebanon as effectively a second home, a place where I come to and I have family."

Oh, it causes me to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world." [...] In a {{discussion}} with Donohue on CBS's Early Show, Ellen Johnson, president of American Atheists, said that rather than promote atheism, the film would encourage children to question authority, saying {{that would not be}} a bad thing for children to learn. Director Weitz says that he believes His Dark Materials is [...] "not an atheistic work, but a highly spiritual and reverent piece of writing," [...] and Nicole Kidman defended her decision to star in the film, saying that [...] "I wouldn't {{be able to do this}} film if I thought it were at all anti-Catholic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shatskaya {{said she}} never cared for being pigeon-holed. [...] "People do not come to my concerts for genre-picking. It is not {{to me that they}} listen, but to their own selves," [...] she remarked. [...] "My aim is not to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> {{listener}} up, but just to tell a story and then hope that this story helps a person to evoke something intimate and important in their own memory", she said in another interview. According to the singer, one is not supposed to sing romance seriously, though: irony here is essential. [...] "Not sarcasm, but irony. Like – 'those were the cruel times, when I lost my heart, but those were good times, too'. The audience should not suffer in the theater. Neither drama nor tragedy, but pleasantly sweet melancholy is what they should carry away with them," [...] she argued.|$|E
2500|$|Director Gareth Edwards {{has said}} that he [...] "intentionally placed humans in shots to give the scene a sense of scale, as {{everyone}} knows the size of a human, so we know the size of a creature or a building." [...] He has also claimed that [...] "We said that we wouldn't place a camera anywhere {{it would be impossible to}} get one. We would say [...] "Imagine it was a news story, or a sports event, cameramen would put cameras where they could in a hurry, and get any shot they could." [...] This is what we wanted [...] to feel like, as if people were filming glimpses at any chance they could." [...] He also found himself [...] "Doing things [...] think are cliche; panning up just as a roar happens, or getting the perfect shot, things I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> head at when watching other people's films. Especially when [...] is first seen, we wanted a build up, and then pan up, we see him, and then we don't see him. I love that." ...|$|E

He was the first active coach inducted into the UCLA and Volleyball Halls of Fame. In retirement, he offered [...] "It is a privilege to coach the fine men that have participated and continue to compete for UCLA volleyball. I have enjoyed being a continuous member of UCLA volleyball since I walked onto the team as a junior in 1959." [...] Said Penn State's Russ Rose “I look at the 19 national championships and <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> head. I can understand 50 years at UCLA because they don’t have winter. But the number of great players who have played at UCLA and the bond they all have for each other and the university is the greatest contribution he has made to the sport.

2500|$|Tommy Jones, {{a former}} member of the Royal Military Police special {{investigations}} branch, became well known as a guide for Western journalists and visitors to the inner German border. Although he escorted around 4,000-5,000 visitors a year along the border, he averred that he [...] "never [...] frustrated. It is important to show people this border. It is impossible to imagine it or to describe it." [...] Jones arrived in Germany in 1945 during the British advance to the Elbe in the closing months of the Second World War and remained there for the next 45 years. He joined the BFS in 1960, moved to Helmstedt in 1974 and became the head of the BFS in 1983, by which time it had only four personnel left. In January 1990, he was awarded an MBE and retired to become a Chelsea Pensioner. His departure was noted not just by the West Germans with whom he had worked for so long, but by the East German border guards as well; as he put it, [...] "For 16 years at Helmstedt, the East German border guards never spoke to me... All they did was take pictures of me from behind bushes. When the border was opened, suddenly the East German guards decided they wanted to try and <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> hand.
