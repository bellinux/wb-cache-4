In 1990, a merger between Newmont Australia Limited and BHP Gold Limited {{resulted}} in the creation of Newcrest Mining, with ownership of the Telfer Mine now lying with Newcrest. The Telfer gold mine was expanded in 1991, and in June 1995, the mine reserves were 3.8 million troy ounces, with resources at 7.3 million troy ounces. The annual production was 370,000 to 380,000 troy ounces of ore. In 1997, the mine reached the milestone of having produced 5 million ounces of gold. Open cut mining was suspended in August 2000 due to high operating costs. The closure of the mine came one year ahead of schedule as production of underground ore was well below mill capacity and therefore not viable. High production costs were primarily caused by the presence of cyanide <b>soluble</b> <b>copper</b> in the open pit ore. Newcrest then focused on exploratory drilling for new minerals.|$|E

40|$|While the {{influence}} of the grinding media alloy composition on the flotation performances of sulphide ores has been widely studied, its role in the flotation of mixed (oxide and sulphide) ores is poorly documented. For some deposits, the mixed ores zone is well developed and can be of great importance for the economics of a mining project. These ore types often present technical challenges for their beneficiation such as sulphides tarnishment, slimes generation, presence of hydrophobic gangue or presence of acid consuming gangue. This study highlights the importance of matching the right grinding media alloy to the mineralogy of the ore, particularly its degree of weathering and to the subsequent flotation scheme. Shifting the grinding media towards less electrochemically active alloys significantly enhanced the grade-recovery curves and the flotation kinetics of the sulphides fraction, particularly when high degrees of sulphides oxidation were induced within the orebody or during stockpiling. For ores with high acid consuming gangue and medium acid <b>soluble</b> <b>copper</b> content that require a preconcentration of the oxide fraction by flotation through activation by sulphidisation, the higher sulphides flotation rates achieved with the use of high chromium alloys limited the amount of sulphides entering the sulphidisation stages and led to a better selectivity between acid insoluble and acid <b>soluble</b> <b>copper</b> allowing better downstream extractive metallurgy performances...|$|E

Addition of ferric iron (1 to 20 microM) to an actively transforming culture inhibited CT transformation, {{and the degree of}} inhibition increased with increasing iron concentration.
