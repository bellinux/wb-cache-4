50|$|With {{such a large}} opening, the ELT dome {{requires}} {{the presence of a}} windscreen to protect the telescope's mirrors (apart from the secondary), from direct exposure to the wind. The baseline design of the windscreen minimises the volume required to house it. Two <b>spherical</b> <b>blades,</b> either side of the observing slit doors, slide in front of the telescope aperture to restrict the wind.|$|E
5000|$|Universal {{micrometer}} sets {{come with}} interchangeable anvils, such as flat, <b>spherical,</b> spline, disk, <b>blade,</b> point, and knife-edge. The term universal micrometer may also {{refer to a}} type of micrometer whose frame has modular components, allowing one micrometer to function as outside mic, depth mic, step mic, etc. (often known by the brand names Mul-T-Anvil and Uni-Mike).|$|R
40|$|According to {{the working}} {{principle}} of spherical hob, computing formulae of normal and axial profile of the spherical hob are deduced, and calculation methods of other main parameters are introduced in the paper. Then the computer aided design and calculation of spherical hob is realized by Visual Basic programming language, which increases the calculation speed and accuracy. And the new manufacturing process of making <b>spherical</b> hob <b>blade</b> by using gear shaper cutter is put forward which can be finished on universal machine tool, so the application and popularization of spherical of hob can be promoted. At last the experiment proves that the internal gear machined by spherical hob meets the demand of precision. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The Excello Shale {{is one of}} {{the best}} exposed and most {{laterally}} continuous of the Pennsylvanian cyclothemic black shales in the midcontinent region of the United States. Its petrology and paleoenvi-ronmental significance were studied to understand the nature of cyclic black shales in general and how they relate to the habitat of hydrocarbon source beds. The Excello is thinly laminated, fissile where weathered, and rich in organic matter and phosphate nodules; it is 90 - 120 cm thick. Its thin laminations, fine particle size, and high total organic carbon (TOC) content suggest that it was deposited in a quiet water environment ofan epeiric sea having anaerobic bottom water. The Excello Shale consists of two lithofacies: non-bioturbated black shale and bioturbated yellow-brown shale. Petrographic studies how that the black shale contains wavy to straight laminations and that the yellow-brown shale contains discontinuous and random laminae and mottled stratification. The close association of organic matter and phosphate-controlled nodule morphology (<b>spherical,</b> elongated, <b>bladed,</b> and platy) appear to be related to progressive decreases in nutrient supply of the sea water from the ancient ocean (Panthalassa). Clay-mineral ssemblages consist mainly of detrital illite, kaolinite, chlorite, and illite/smecfite (I/S). Grain size and amount of these clays increase and TOC decreases shoreward towards the probable source areas of the clay minerals in the northern Ouachita region and northern Iowa.

40|$|We are {{describing}} a new optimized method for {{the preparation of}} single-sized crystalline lead sulphide (PbS) nanoparticles (NPs). The optimized solvothermal method uses a mixture of octadecene and oleic acid as a reaction media and MBTS as a reducing agent. Systematic investigation was performed on various synthesis parameters, such as acid to lead (Pb) and lead to sulphur(S) feed molar ratios, feed amounts of various phosphine compounds, reducing agent, total concentrations of reaction media, growth temperature, as well as different sulphur source compounds. We optimized the amount of 2, 2 -dithiobis(benzothiazole) (MBTS) in the reaction mixture to produce about 100 nm size and <b>spherical</b> shape zinc <b>blade</b> type PbS NPs. A broad UV absorption spectrum was observed when the MBTS amount was increased in the reaction mixture. The excellent organic solvent dispersion properties, along with near-IR emission spectrum window make these NPs a great choice in optoelectronics applications, especially for photovoltaic devices.
