5|$|Zeta Tucanae is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years {{away from the}} Solar System. Despite having a <b>slightly</b> <b>lower</b> mass, this star is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of this star {{are very similar to}} the Sun, with a <b>slightly</b> <b>lower</b> mass and an estimated age of three billion years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet. It appears to have a debris disk orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2.3 astronomical units. As of 2009, no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star.|$|E

5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only <b>slightly</b> <b>lower</b> and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
