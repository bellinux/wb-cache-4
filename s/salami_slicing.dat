5000|$|There is no {{consensus}} among academics about whether people should seek to make their publications least publishable units, and {{it has long been}} resisted by some journal editors. [...] Particularly for people just getting started in academic publication, writing a few small papers provides a way of getting used to how the system of peer review and professional publication works, and it does indeed help to boost publication count. [...] But publishing too many LPUs is thought not to impress peers {{when it comes time to}} seek promotion beyond the assistant professor (or equivalent) level. Also, LPUs may not always be the most efficient way to pass on knowledge, because they break up ideas into small pieces, sometimes forcing people to look up many cross-references. Multiple <b>salami</b> <b>slices</b> also occupy more journal pages than a single synthetic paper that contains the same information. On the other hand, a small piece of information is easily digestible, and the reader may not need more information than what is in the LPU.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{detrimental}} processes in fatty foodstuffs is lipid oxidation, which occurs during production and storage, and influences food composition and safety. Through the analysis of volatile lipid oxidation products we can have an insight into the oxidation, and some volatiles, such as hexanal, which can be markers of undergoing oxidation processes. Hexanal is formed when fatty acids are oxidized {{and is one of}} many well-documented aromatic components that contributes to flavour and aroma in common food products containing fatty acids. During the last decade, the interest in polymer layered silicate (PLS) nanocomposites has rapidly increased due to their potential for enhancing physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of conventional materials. Polymer nanocomposites are represented by a polymeric matrix reinforced with nanoscale fillers, among them the most common silicate clays are represented by montmorillonite (MMT), which is naturally occurring and readily available in large quantities. The presence of MMT can lead to materials which generally exhibit great property enhancements, mainly due to its intercalation or exfoliation into the polymer chains. In this work natural MMT Cloisite Na+ was incorporated in PLA. The PLA/Cloisite® Na+ films were prepared through a two-step process. In the first step, PLA pellets were fed into a corotating laboratory twin-screw extruder at 170 °C and 50 rpm for 2 min. Subsequently, Cloisite® Na+ powder (5 %, w/w) were added and mixed. After extrusion, the melted matter was then pressed with a P 300 P hot press at 170 °C and 100 bar to obtain the PLA/Cloisite® Na+ films. <b>Salami</b> <b>slices</b> were packaged with PLA-OMMT film and with a control film (PLA). After different storage times (0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days), <b>salami</b> <b>slices</b> were analysed regarding their hexanal content. The hexanal derivatization was performed in a solution of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine in sulfuric acid during 4 h in the dark, and the hexanal extraction was performed with n-hexane and evaporation till dryness. The residue was dissolved in methanol, filtered and analysed. The quantification of hexanal was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Diode Array Detector at 365 nm, with a Pre-column AcquityTM UPLC® BEH C 18 (2. 1 x 5 mm, 1. 7 μm particle size) and a column AcquityTM UPLC® BEH C 18 (2. 1 × 50 mm, 1. 7 μm particle size), the mobile-phase was acetonitrile-water (75 : 25, v/v). The amount of hexanal in packaged salami decreased in the first 60 days of storage. In this period of time the hexanal content of the salami packaged with the PLA/Cloisite® Na+ films was lower than the salami packaged with control film, except after 15 days of storage, where {{there was no difference between}} two films. After 90 days of storage, the amount of hexanal in the samples increased, although it was higher in the samples packaged with control film (94. 7 ± 6. 02 μg/ 100 g salami) than salami packaged with PLA/Cloisite® Na+ films (65. 1 ± 6. 12 μg/ 100 g salami). The presence of MMT in the polymer film can reduce the lipid oxidation of processed meat products, extending their shelf life. Further studies to evaluate differences between PLA and the nanocomposite (PLA- 5 %Cloisite®Na+) in what regards to the mechanical and barrier properties are in progress. This work was supported by the research project “Labelling and tracking of nanoclay from food packaging nanocomposites: a food safety issue – NanoPack 4 Food” (2014 DAN 1019) under the Cooperative Programme of the Agreement on Scientific Cooperation between National Research Council of Italy (CNR) and Foundation for Science and Technology of Portugal (FCT) N/...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Polylactic acid or {{polylactide}} (PLA, Poly) is a biodegradable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester {{derived from}} renewable resources, such as corn starch, tapioca roots, chips or starch, or sugarcane. Biopolymer nanocomposites are {{of great interest}} to the packaging industry as they can overcome the limitations of biopolymers compared to synthetic polymers. In the last two decades, the nanocomposites have been studied intensively, once the addition of fillers such as organoclays, in particular, montmorillonite (MMT), can improve rheological, thermal and mechanical properties of the biopolymers (Jollands M. et al. 2010). The presence of MMT can lead to materials which generally exhibit great property enhancements, mainly due to its intercalation or exfoliation into the polymer chains. In this work, PLA was incorporated with 5 % (w/w) Cloisite Na+ prepared through a two-step process: first extrusion of pellets and secondly melted matter was pressed. The nanocomposite was used to pack a model food (salami) in order to evaluate of the ability of the new packaging to inhibit lipid oxidation. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) assay was used to evaluate the lipid oxidation stage. This assay allows to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) content, which is formed in the lipid oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Material and Methods: Packaged salami was homogenized with trichloroacetic acid (10 %) in 0. 02 M of orthophosphoric acid and the solution was filtered. The filtered solution was homogenized with thiobarbituric acid aqueous solution (0. 02 M) and heated at 100 °C for 40 min. Solutions were cooled down and absorbance was measured at 530 nm. Results were expressed as mg MDA per kg of salami. Results and Discussion: <b>Salami</b> <b>slices</b> were packaged with a control film and with the nanocomposite and analysed at initial time and after 15, 30, 60 and 90 days of contact. Results showed that salami packaged with the nanocomposite presented lower amount of MDA after all contact periods, except after 60 days, where there were no differences between control and nanofilm. Conclusion: Although the results showed that the new nanocomposite tends to reduce the production of MDA, further studies should be carried out to confirm the inhibition of lipid oxidation, such as the peroxide index, p-anisidine value, or the monitorization of a lipid oxidation indicator like hexanal.

The main goal {{of the study is}} to increase the sensitivity of researchers to breaches of publication ethics and to contribute to cultivating the publication environment in the Czech educational science and research. In the first part, the authors analyse the reasons that usually lead researchers to breachpublication ethics. They also highlight the possibility that the current system of financing and evaluating science and research in the Czech Republic might represent one of the causes. Further on, following an analysis of available literature, the typicalinstances of inappropriate publishing behaviour are discussed. In doing so, the authors make use of the analogy with biblical Ten Commandments.
