He briefly co-hosted Candid Camera with creator Allen Funt, but that relationship, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> ended acrimoniously; Godfrey hosted at least one broadcast without Funt. Godfrey also made various guest appearances, and he and Lucille Ball co-hosted the CBS special 50 Years of Television (1978). He also made a cameo appearance in the 1979 B-movie Angels Revenge.|$|E

The founding of Nicomedia is placed by Eusebius in 264 BC.|$|E

25|$|Hoffecker was {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Whig Party, but like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> became a Republican in 1856. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1876 and 1884. He was also president of the Smyrna town council from 1878 until 1898. Elected to the State House in 1888, he served in the 1889/90 session and was chosen to be the Speaker. He ran for Governor in 1896 as the candidate of the Union (Addicks) Republicans and the National Prohibition Party. However, enough votes went to the Regular Republican candidate, John C. Higgins, that the Democrat, Ebe W. Tunnell was elected.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1944, Ōoka {{was drafted}} into the Imperial Japanese Army, given only three months of {{rudimentary}} training {{and sent to the}} front line at Mindoro Island in the Philippines, where he served as his battalion's communications technician until his battalion was routed and numerous men killed. In January 1945, he was captured by the American forces in the Philippine defeat and sent to a prisoner of war camp on Leyte Island. Survival was very traumatic for Ōoka, who was troubled that he, a middle-aged and unworthy soldier, had survived when <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> had not. He returned to Japan {{at the end of the}} year and lived at Akashi, Hyōgo.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> Étienne was {{eventually}} {{forced to flee}} Paris because of {{his opposition to the}} fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.|$|E

25|$|John Payne Bankhead {{was born}} on August 3, 1821, at Fort Johnson on James Island, South Carolina. His father was General James Bankhead, a brigadier general who {{distinguished}} himself in the Mexican–American War. His mother was Ann Smith Pyne. Bankhead's family were prominent citizens from both Virginia and South Carolina. As the Civil War approached secession badly divided his family as it did with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> in these states. Bankhead's two brothers, Henry C., a regular army officer who also sided with the Union and Smith Pyne, a lawyer in Memphis, Tennessee, who joined the Confederate army became a colonel. Major General John Bankhead Magruder was a cousin who left the Union and served under the Confederate flag.|$|E
25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
25|$|William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang {{during the}} {{extraordinary}} {{events of the}} Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, great pain, nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when they suddenly felt accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and singing. It was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch was a strange person {{to be at the}} centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to have experienced the strong feelings of sin or conversion that <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> had reported.|$|E

25|$|The next {{victim was}} a young nomadic Sephardic Jew, Vitali Hakim, whose burnt body {{was found on the}} road to the Pattaya resort, where Sobhraj and his growing clan were staying. Dutch {{students}} Henk Bintanja, 29, and his fiancée Cornelia Hemker, 25, were invited to Thailand after meeting Sobhraj in Hong Kong. They, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> were poisoned by Sobhraj, who then nurtured them back to health in order to gain their obedience. As they recovered, Sobhraj was visited by his previous victim Hakim's French girlfriend, Charmayne Carrou, who had come to investigate her boyfriend's disappearance. Fearing exposure, Sobhraj and Chowdhury quickly hustled the couple out. Their bodies were found strangled and burned on 16 December 1975. Soon after, Carrou was found drowned and wearing a similar-styled swimsuit to that of Sobhraj's earlier victim, Teresa Knowlton. Although the murders of both women were not connected by investigations at the time, they would later earn Sobhraj the nickname The Bikini Killer.|$|E
25|$|Lady Isle was at {{one time}} {{connected}} with an ancient ecclesiastical establishment near Adamton, called Lady Kirk, and situated about four miles north of Ayr. As stated, a chapel was built, here dedicated to the Virgin Mary and endowed by John Blair in 1446 with the common land of Adamton. John Adair's map indicates a religious building as being located in {{the centre of the}} island and Pont also indicates a structure of some sort, well before any beacons were built. John Adair uses the name Mary Isle for the island, suggesting that this pre-reformation (c.1560s) 'chapel', like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> was dedicated to Saint Mary. It is more than likely that the beacons were built using stones from this chapel or 'cell' and no signs now remain of this ecclesiastical structure. When the bird observatory and warden's post was being built, the architect noted that there were signs of some sort of ancient ecclesiastical building on the island.|$|E
25|$|Chief Fani-Kayode {{witnessed}} {{the killing of}} his friend S.L.

However, luckily for him, on arrival at the Ikeja military cantonment in Lagos the mutineers were overpowered, overwhelmed and killed by loyalist troops under the command of Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon (who later became Nigeria's Head of State). Fani-Kayode was freed by the loyalists and kept by them in a safe house until law and order was restored in the country. The coup attempt was effectively quelled by the loyalist forces and all its ringleaders were either killed or captured and detained. Out of all the key government officials and senior military figures that were attacked in their homes and that were apprehended by the mutineers and coup plotters that night, including Sir Ahmadu Bello (the Premier of the Northern Region), Sir Tafawa Balewa (the Prime Minister), Chief Okotie-Eboh (the Minister of Finance), General Maimalari (the Chief of Army Staff), Brigadier Ademulegun(Commander of the Northern Garrison) and <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> Chief Remi Fani-Kayode, together with Sir Kashim Ibrahim (the Governor of the Northern Region) were the only ones that were not killed.|$|E

500|$|When he was seven, Ravel started {{piano lessons}} with Henry Ghys, {{a friend of}} Emmanuel Chabrier; five years later, in 1887, he began {{studying}} harmony, counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes. Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy. Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him [...] "and not, {{as in the case}} of <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> the result of effort". Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann, variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata. They survive only in fragmentary form.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Pound has shaken {{the dust}} of London from his feet with not too {{emphatic}} a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.... has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon {{more than one of}} the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E

[...] Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, [...] "Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie.

[...] Ochona also said that, [...] "Without such an accurate soundtrack, the film wouldn't have made such a big impact, and both the visual and aural aspects work together to create a beautiful story of a man fighting for the right to live his life." ...|$|E
