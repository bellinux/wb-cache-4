40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{elaborate}} a <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> in the cadastral territory of Milenovice. For {{the production of the}} <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> was used the methodology processed by Dumbrovský. This methodology divides <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> into the research of the climatic, hydrological and aquiculturing rates, the research of the transport system and the current situation of the cadastral territory, the research of the agricultural land utilization and the protection of the agricultural land resources and the research of ecological stability of the territory. The result of this thesis was the discovering of the problems concerning the process of the complex land adjustments in the mentioned territory. The <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> refers mainly to the problems regarding the erosion, the flood-protection, the ecological stability and the drainage...|$|R
30|$|We {{chose to}} use <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> to empirically test our {{hypotheses}} for two reasons. First, survey research {{has the ability to}} generalize theoretically developed models to a larger population of interest with a known degree of accuracy [64]. Since our model is both theoretically supported by previous literature and structural contingency theory, the use of <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> to quantitatively examine the empirically questionable relationships is appropriate. Secondly, <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> allows us to gather sensitive information about organizational innovation and managerial ethical evaluation through an anonymous means.|$|R

But SAS ® has tools to handle more complex problems. And, now that SAS has <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> procedures, there's no longer a need to pretend that survey samples should be analyzed using non-survey design tools. Now that large databases are commonly sampled for marketing, data mining, and scientific research, the need to use <b>survey</b> <b>analysis</b> procedures is increasing. In this paper, we'll look at several common situations and illustrate how the data are usually analyzed.
