40|$|Purpose: The {{aims of the}} {{research}} are studies safety and exploitation conditions of weld structure reparation of car <b>body</b> <b>truck</b> frames. Design/methodology/approach: Structure of car <b>body</b> <b>truck</b> frames are the main object of {{the research}}. Impact toughness, fatigue properties were measured, fractographic analyses were made. Subject scopes are experimental research about weld structure reparation of car <b>body</b> <b>truck</b> frames. Theoretical calculations should {{be used as the}} hint automotive welding reparations. Findings: Optimization of operational properties of steel welded structures might be done in terms of the chemical composition (amount Mo, Mn) in WMD. Molybdenum should be treated as the element very positively influencing impact toughness and fatigue properties of low alloy WMD. The cause of damages and deformation of steel car body frame structures is often connected with no proper choice of welding materials, their joining technology, and chemical composition of WMD. Research limitations/implications: Studies on the effect of other important alloying elements on the properties of the frame of a vehicle should be continued. Practical implications: Practical implications might be improving of the passive safety of the vehicle by quality of the car structures reparations. Originality/value: A novelty is the analysis of the impact of major alloying elements in the weld on the quality of repair structural components of the vehicle...|$|R

A movement to standard service terms would not be seen as a barrier to competition, particularly if the standard setting committee were broad based. Instead, regulators would perceive that it provides a platform for conformance and for cooperation among stakeholders, and a basis for consumers to evaluate carrier and handler performance, offering transparency and promoting competition.|$|R
