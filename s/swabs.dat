In this study, we have developed a simple sandwich ELISA based on commercial components to quantify BSA (used as a surrogate for ricin) with a detection range of 1. 32 - 80 ng/mL. We used the ELISA to evaluate different protein <b>swabbing</b> procedures (<b>swabbing</b> techniques and after-swabbing treatments) for two <b>swab</b> types: a cotton gauze <b>swab</b> and a flocked nylon <b>swab.</b> The optimal <b>swabbing</b> procedure for each <b>swab</b> type was used to obtain recovery efficiencies from different surface materials. The surface recoveries using the optimal <b>swabbing</b> procedure ranged from 0 - 60 % and were significantly higher from nonporous surfaces compared to porous surfaces. In conclusion, this study presents a <b>swabbing</b> procedure evaluation and a simple BSA ELISA based on commercial components, which are easy to perform in a laboratory with basic facilities. The data indicate that different <b>swabbing</b> procedures were optimal for each of the tested <b>swab</b> types, and the particular <b>swab</b> preference depends on the surface material to be <b>swabbed...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Conjunctival <b>swab</b> PCR was {{evaluated}} {{as a tool}} to diagnose visceral leishmaniasis in dogs. METHODS: Conjunctival <b>swab</b> PCR was compared to indirect immunofluorescence antibody test and blood PCR. RESULTS: Indirect immunofluorescence was significantly correlated with conjunctival <b>swab</b> PCR (p 0. 05). In addition, conjunctival <b>swab</b> PCR was significantly associated with presence of clinical symptoms (p < 0. 05), whereas blood PCR was associated with absence of clinical symptoms (p < 0. 05).

5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and <b>swabs</b> soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain.

40|$|<b>Swab</b> {{cultures}} of wounds are noninvasive and most laboratories {{are capable of}} semiquantitatively processing these specimens. This study examined the diagnostic validity of semiquantitative <b>swab</b> cultures obtained using Levine 2 ̆ 7 s technique and compared semiquantitative and quantitative <b>swab</b> cultures. Two <b>swab</b> specimens were obtained from a sample of 44 chronic wounds using Levine 2 ̆ 7 s technique. One was processed using quantitative laboratory procedures and the other using semiquantitative laboratory procedures. The diagnostic validity of the findings from each <b>swab</b> culture process was determined by associating the culture findings of each with quantitative tissue cultures (reference standard) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and by evaluating concordance. The area under the curve (AUC) of the semiquantitative <b>swab</b> culture was 0. 639, which was not significantly higher than the. 50 diagonal chance (P = 0. 0501), suggesting a non-informative test.

40|$|Vaginal <b>swab</b> {{specimens}} may {{be preferable}} to cervical <b>swab</b> or urine specimens {{for the detection}} of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae because of the ease of specimen collection and transport. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether vaginal <b>swab</b> specimens are equivalent to cervical <b>swab</b> specimens {{for the detection of}} N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis by the Becton Dickinson strand displacement amplification assay (SDA) with the BDProbeTec ET instrument and then to evaluate the use of the amplification control in a clinical research setting. In the first phase, vaginal and cervical <b>swab</b> specimens were obtained from 455 symptomatic women aged 18 to 40 attending primary health care and sexually transmitted disease clinics. Thirty-nine specimens (8. 6 %) had true-positive results for N. gonorrhoeae and 37 specimens (8. 1 %) had true-positive results for C. trachomatis. The sensitivity of SDA was superior to that of culture for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae with vaginal <b>swab</b> specimens and equivalent to that of the Roche PCR for the detection of C. trachomatis with cervical <b>swab</b> specimens. In the second phase of the study, 1, 411 consecutively collected vaginal <b>swab</b> specimens were evaluated, with 357 (25. 3 %) specimens giving indeterminate readings on the basis of the result for the amplification control. The prevalences of sexually transmitted pathogens in vaginal <b>swab</b> specimens with and without use of the amplification control were 6. 0 and 5. 8 %, respectively, for C. trachomatis and 3. 1 and 3. 0 %, respectively, for N. gonorrhoeae. Although, vaginal <b>swab</b> specimens were equivalent to cervical <b>swab</b> specimens for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis by SDA with respect to sensitivity, one in four vaginal <b>swab</b> specimens yielded an indeterminate result when the amplification control was used.

The identity of each matched pair was confirmed biochemically and serologically. The similarity of the isolates obtained from a nasal <b>swab</b> and from a transtracheal <b>swab</b> was compared by using ribotyping and antibiotic susceptibility analyses. Although the calves were sampled only once with a nasal and a transtracheal <b>swab,</b> when both samples were bacteriologically positive the nasal <b>swab</b> identified the same bacterial species as the transtracheal <b>swab</b> 96 % of the time. The nasal <b>swab</b> isolate was genetically identical to the transtracheal isolate in 70 % of the matched pairs. Six different ribotypes were observed for the P. haemolytica isolates, while only one ribotype was observed for {{the limited number of}} P. multocida isolates. Of the six P. haemolytica ribotypes, two ribotypes predominated. All the paired isolates displayed similar susceptibility to ceftiofur, erythromycin, tilmicosin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and florfenicol, with some minor variations for ampicillin and spectinomycin. These results suggest that a nasal <b>swab</b> culture can be predictive of the bacterial pathogen within the lung when the isolates are from an acutely ill animal and can be used to determine antibiotic susceptibility...|$|R
50|$|<b>Swabbing</b> is as {{a result}} of the upward {{movement}} of pipe in a well and results in a decrease in bottomhole pressure. In some cases, the bottomhole pressure reduction can be large enough to cause the well to go underbalanced and allow formation fluids to enter the wellbore. The initial <b>swabbing</b> action compounded by the reduction in hydrostatic pressure(from formation fluids entering the well) can lead to a significant reduction in bottomhole pressure and a larger influx of formation fluids. Therefore, early detection of <b>swabbing</b> on trips is critical to minimizing the size of a kick.Many wellbore conditions increase the likelihood of <b>swabbing</b> on a trip. <b>Swabbing</b> (piston) action is enhanced when pipe is pulled too fast. Poor fluid properties, such as high viscosity and gel strengths, also increase the chances of <b>swabbing</b> a well in. Additionally, large outside diameter (OD) tools (packers, scrapers, fishing tools, etc.) enhance the piston effect.These conditions need to be recognized in order to decrease the likelihood of <b>swabbing</b> a well in during completion/workover operations. As mentioned earlier, there are several computer and calculator programs that can estimate surge and <b>swab</b> pressures. <b>Swabbing</b> is detected by closely monitoring hole fill-up volumes during trips. For example, if three barrels of steel (tubing) are removed from the well and it takes only two barrels of fluid to fill the hole, then a one barrel kick has probably been <b>swabbed</b> into the wellbore. Special attention should be paid to hole fill-up volumes since statistics indicate that most kicks occur on trips.|$|R
