Large landslide deposits are common at the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to confuse the Russians, the {{combined}} fleet made a feint westward toward Odessa on 8 October before turning east to Kinburn. The combined French and British fleet arrived off Kinburn on 14 October. That night, a force of nine gunboats escorted transports carrying 8,000 men, led by François Achille Bazaine, who were landed behind the forts, further up the peninsula. The gunboat force was commanded by Rear Admiral Houston Stewart, who ordered his crews to hold their fire in the darkness unless {{they were able to}} clearly see a Russian target. The Russians did not launch a counterattack on the landing, allowing the French and British soldiers to dig trench positions while the gunboats shelled the main fort, albeit ineffectively. By the morning of the 17th, the soldiers had completed significant entrenchments, with French troops facing the fortifications and British troops manning the outward defences against a possible Russian attempt to relieve the garrison. By this time, the French had begun building <b>sapping</b> trenches, which then came under fire from the Russian fortress.

40|$|For the {{pathogenic}} yeast Candida albicans, secreted aspartyl proteinase (<b>Sap)</b> {{activity has}} been correlated with virulence. A family consisting {{of at least}} eight <b>SAP</b> genes can be drawn upon to produce <b>Sap</b> enzymatic activity. In this study, the levels of <b>Sap</b> 1, <b>Sap</b> 2, and <b>Sap</b> 3 isoenzymes were monitored {{under a variety of}} growth conditions for several strains, including strain WO- 1, which alternates between two switch phenotypes, white (W) and opaque (O). When cultured under proteinase-inducing conditions, most strains and W cells produce <b>Sap</b> 2, while O cells produce <b>Sap</b> 1, <b>Sap</b> 2, and <b>Sap</b> 3. Both W and O cells of strain WO- 1 produce <b>Saps</b> in enriched and defined media that do not induce <b>Saps</b> from other strains. The specific <b>Sap</b> isoenzyme that is produced is determined by the cell type, while the level of <b>Sap</b> production is determined by environmental factors. The levels and temporal regulation of the <b>SAP</b> mRNAs as determined by Northern (RNA) analysis were consistent with <b>Sap</b> protein levels and with previous results. S 1 analysis showed that <b>SAP</b> 6 is the predominant <b>SAP</b> gene transcribed during hyphal induction at neutral pH.

25|$|On 23 August 1179, Saladin {{arrived at}} Jacob’s Ford and ordered his troops to shoot arrows at the castle, thus {{initiating}} the siege.

Once the tunnel was dug, Saladin’s forces placed large amounts of wood inside and set it alight. This process, called <b>sapping,</b> was a method in which the tunnel's supports were burnt away forcing the walls to eventually collapse under their own weight. <b>Sapping</b> initially failed for Saladin and his troops, so the troops were forced {{to put out the}} fire with buckets of water and were paid one gold piece per bucket to do so. After the fire was extinguished, the miners were instructed to relight the fire. At the same time, Baldwin, having learned of this attack, called for reinforcements from Jerusalem.

40|$|Secreted aspartyl proteinases (<b>Saps)</b> {{contribute}} {{to the ability of}} Candida albicans to cause mucosal and disseminated infections. A model of vaginal candidiasis based on reconstituted human vaginal epithelium (RHVE) was used to study the expression and role of these C. albicans proteinases during infection and tissue damage of vaginal epithelium. Colonization of the RHVE by C. albicans SC 5314 did not cause any visible epithelial damage 6 h after inoculation, although expression of <b>SAP</b> 2, <b>SAP</b> 9, and <b>SAP</b> 10 was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR. However, significant epithelial damage was observed after 12 h, concomitant with the additional expression of <b>SAP</b> 1, <b>SAP</b> 4, and <b>SAP</b> 5. Additional transcripts of <b>SAP</b> 6 and <b>SAP</b> 7 were detected at a later stage of the artificial infection (24 h). Similar <b>SAP</b> expression profiles were observed in three samples isolated from human patients with vaginal candidiasis. In experimental infection, secretion of antigens <b>Sap</b> 1 to <b>Sap</b> 6 by C. albicans was confirmed at the ultrastructural level by using polyclonal antisera raised against <b>Sap</b> 1 to <b>Sap</b> 6. Addition of the aspartyl proteinase inhibitors pepstatin A and the human immunodeficiency virus proteinase inhibitors ritonavir and amprenavir strongly reduced the tissue damage of the vaginal epithelia by C. albicans cells. Furthermore, <b>SAP</b> null mutants lacking either <b>SAP</b> 1 or <b>SAP</b> 2 had a drastically reduced potential to cause tissue damage even though <b>SAP</b> 3, <b>SAP</b> 4, and <b>SAP</b> 7 were up-regulated in these mutants.

40|$|The yeast Candida albicans {{possesses}} a gene family that encodes secreted aspartic proteases (<b>Saps),</b> which {{are important for}} the virulence of this human fungal pathogen. Inhibitors of the <b>Saps</b> could therefore be used as novel antimycotic agents {{for the treatment of}} C. albicans infections. In the present study, we established a bioassay which allows testing of the activity of potential protease inhibitors against specific <b>Sap</b> isoenzymes by their ability to inhibit protease-dependent growth of C. albicans. In a medium containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the sole source of nitrogen, C. albicans specifically expresses the <b>Sap</b> 2 p isoenzyme, which degrades the BSA and thereby enables the fungus to grow. As the other <b>SAP</b> genes are not significantly expressed under these conditions, mutants lacking <b>SAP</b> 2 are unable to utilize BSA as a nitrogen source and cannot grow in such a medium. To investigate whether forced expression of <b>SAP</b> genes other than <b>SAP</b> 2 would also allow growth on BSA, we constructed a set of strains expressing each of the 10 <b>SAP</b> genes from a tetracycline-inducible promoter in a <b>sap</b> 2 Delta mutant background. Expression of <b>Sap</b> 1 p, <b>Sap</b> 2 p, <b>Sap</b> 3 p, <b>Sap</b> 4 p, <b>Sap</b> 5 p, <b>Sap</b> 6 p, <b>Sap</b> 8 p, and a C-terminally truncated, secreted <b>Sap</b> 9 p restored the growth of the <b>sap</b> 2 Delta mutant with different efficiencies.
