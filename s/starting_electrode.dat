50|$|A {{very closely}} related lamp design called the {{metal halide lamp}} uses various {{compounds}} in an amalgam with the mercury. Sodium iodide and scandium iodide are commonly in use. These lamps can produce much better quality light without resorting to phosphors. If they use a <b>starting</b> <b>electrode,</b> {{there is always a}} thermal shorting switch to eliminate any electrical potential between the main electrode and the <b>starting</b> <b>electrode</b> once the lamp is lit. (This electrical potential {{in the presence of the}} halides can cause the failure of the glass/metal seal). More modern metal halide systems do not use a separate starting electrode; instead, the lamp is started using high voltage pulses as with high-pressure sodium vapor lamps.|$|E
50|$|As of 2012, several {{companies}} {{have started to}} offer self-ballasted metal-halide lamps as a direct replacement for incandescent and self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps. These lamps include an arc tube with a <b>starting</b> <b>electrode</b> {{as well as a}} tubular halogen lamp which is connected in series and used to regulate the current in the arc tube. A resistor provides the current limiting for the <b>starting</b> <b>electrode.</b> Like self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps, self-ballasted metal-halide lamps are connected directly to mains power and do not require an external ballast. In contrast to the former, these lamps usually have a clear outer bulb without a coating, making the arc tube and the halogen lamp tube clearly visible from the outside.|$|E

American National Standards Institute (ANSI) lamp-ballast system standards establish parameters for all metal-halide components (with the exception of some newer products).|$|E
40|$|A device, that is {{used for}} {{biomedical}} operation or safety-critical applications like point-of-care health assessment, massive parallel DNA analysis, automated drug discovery, air-quality monitoring and food-safety testing, must have the attributes like reliability, dependability and correctness. As the biochips are used for these purposes; therefore, these devices must be fault free all the time. Naturally before using these chips, they must be well tested. We are proposing a novel technique that can detect multiple faults, locate the fault positions within the biochip, as well as calculate the traversal time if the biochip is fault free. The proposed technique also highlights a new idea how to select the appropriate base node or pseudo source (<b>start</b> <b>electrode).</b> The main idea of the proposed technique is to form multiple loops with the neighboring electrode arrays and then test each loop by traversing test droplet to check whether there is any fault. If a fault is detected then the proposed technique also locates it by backtracking the test droplet. In case, no fault is detected, the biochip is fault free then the proposed technique also calculates the time to traverse the chip. The result suggests that the proposed technique is efficient and shows significant improvement to calculate fault-free biochip traversal time over existing method...|$|R

50|$|The {{mercury in}} the tube is a liquid at normal temperatures. It {{needs to be}} vaporized and ionized before the tube will conduct {{electricity}} and the arc can start. So, like fluorescent tubes, mercury vapor lamps require a starter, which is usually contained within the mercury vapor lamp itself. A third electrode is mounted {{near one of the}} main electrodes and connected through a resistor to the other main electrode. In addition to the mercury, the tube is filled with argon gas at low pressure. When power is applied, there is sufficient voltage to ionize the argon and strike a small arc between the <b>starting</b> <b>electrode</b> and the adjacent main electrode. This starting arc discharge heats the mercury and eventually provides enough ionized mercury to strike an arc between the main electrodes. This process takes from 4 to 7 minutes, so mercury lamps are slow starting. Some bulbs include a thermal switch which shorts the <b>starting</b> <b>electrode</b> to the adjacent main electrode, extinguishing the starting arc once the main arc strikes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{avalanche}} can {{be triggered}} by any charged particle hitting the <b>starting</b> <b>electrode</b> with sufficient energy to cause secondary emission.

In a photomultiplier tube, a photo-emissive surface is followed by an electron multiplier with several sequential multiplying electrodes called dynodes. Because these electrodes are separate from each other, this might be called a [...] "discrete-dynode" [...] multiplier. A voltage divider chain of resistors is usually used to place each dynode at a potential 100-200V more positive than the previous one.|$|E

The mechanical elements {{consist of a}} single crystal silicon film. The realized scan frequency of the resonantly excited actuator devices ranges from 0. 14 kHz up to 20 kHz while the mirror area ranges from 0. 5 x 0. 5 mm 2 up to 3. 0 x 3. 0 mm 2. Due to a special configuration of the driving electrodes small gaps of typically 5 mu m can be used resulting in large electrostatic moments for the actuation of the mirror plate. Scan angles up to 60 deg (+- 15 deg mechanical) at a driving voltage of only 20 V are achieved. The starting of the oscillation is possible because of asymmetries induced during fabrication.

40|$|International audienceThe {{cathodic}} {{reduction of}} propargyl bromide in regular polar solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide or acetonitrile (ACN) {{results in a}} two-electron scission of the Csingle bondBr bond. In contrast to this, the use of solvents of higher dielectric permittivity like propylene carbonate (PC) containing tetraalkylammonium iodide as electrolyte permits the quasi instantaneous formation of the corresponding iodide that can be electrochemically cleaved in a different way. Using gold, platinum, palladium or copper under those conditions allows obtaining the propargyl radical at quite low potentials. Unexpectedly, glassy carbon (GC) as cathode material causes a neat splitting of two one-electron transfers (ET) usually observed for most of organic halides as a single two-electron step. A dense propargylation of these solid surfaces was noticed.

40|$|Alloys of {{titanium}} with {{refractory metals}} are attractive materials for applications requiring {{high temperature strength}} and corrosion resistance. However, the widely different characteristics of the component elements have {{made it difficult to}} produce sound, compositionally homogeneous ingots using traditional melting techniques. This is particularly critical because the compositional ranges spanned by the micro- and macrosegregation in theses systems can easily encompass a number of microconstituents which are detrimental to mechanical properties. This paper presents results of a study of plasma (PAM) and vacuum-arc (VAR) melting of a 60 wt% tantalum, 40 wt% titanium binary alloy. The structural and compositional homogeneity of both PAM consolidated + PAM remelted, and PAM consolidated + VAR remelted ingots were characterized and compared using optical and electron microscopy and x-ray fluorescence microanalysis. Additionally, the effect of melting parameter, including melt rate and magnetic stirring, was studied. Results indicate that PAM remelting achieves more complete dissolution of lie <b>starting</b> <b>electrode,</b> due to greater local superheat, than does VAR remelting. PAM remelting also produces a finer as-solidified grain structure, due to the smaller molten pool and lower local solidification times. Conversely, VAR remelting produces an ingot with a more uniform macrostructure, due to the more stable movement of the solidification interface and more uniform material feed rate. Based on these results, a three-step process of PAM consolidation, followed by a PAM intermediate melt and a VAR final melt, has been selected for further development of the alloy and processing sequence...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{starting}} auxiliary electrode {{were used for}} the investigation that the hot cathode type fluorescent discharge lamps were started on the low voltage. The ring type electrode or the strip type electrode, as the <b>starting</b> <b>electrode,</b> was positioned near the 20 W fluorescent lamp wall, and the starting characteristics of the discharge lamp were measured for the source frequency region between commercial frequencies and 500 Hz. For commercial frequencies and 500 Hz, the relation between the main restriking voltage and the ring location and also the preheating current of electrodes were obtaind. Using the strip electrode, the relation between the main restriking voltage and the frequency and also the preheating current of electrodes were obtained. When the ring electrode location was on the discharge lamp center and on its both end, the starting voltage was the minimum value and the maximum value respectively, that is it showed V-curve. Using the ring electrode, the minimum restriking voltage dropped to about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and about 90 % (215 V) at 500 Hz as compared with the normal type-Using the strip electrode, the minimum restriking voltage dropped to less than about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and less than 50 % (120 V) at high frequencies as compared with the normal type. Generaly, the starting voltage decreases as the preheating current increases, but the degree of preheating current region between 300 mA and 350 mA is neccesary to accelerate the starting. It is thought that the effect of the starting auxiliary electrodes resultes essentially in shortening of the electrode gap. When the reflector was earthed, the starting characteristics were not affected by the earthing effect for the strip electrode, but those were made random by the earthing effect for the ring electrode. Thus, it is concluded that as the strip type and the ring type electrode can be dropped the restriking voltage of the long type discharge lamps, using those are succesful in case of the low voltage starting in frequency region between commercial frequencies and high frequencies...|$|E

In a spatial task, subjects decided whether an angle was acute or obtuse. A behavioural experiment showed that performance improved when cues predicted the upcoming task (80 % validity), compared to when neutral cues did not afford selective task sets. Event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed brain activity related to forming selective task expectations, to switching tasks, and to the modulation of target processing {{as a function of}} such expectations and switches.

40|$|Anodic {{oxidation}} can be {{a catastrophic}} failure mechanism for MEMS devices that operate in high humidity environments. Shea and coworkers 1 have shown that positively charged polysilicon traces can fail through a progressive silicon oxidation reaction whose rate depends critically on the surface conductivity over the silicon nitride. We have found a related anodic oxidation-based failure mechanism: progressive delamination of Poly 0 electrodes from silicon nitride layers, which then mechanically interfere with device function well before the electrode is fully oxidized. To explain this effect, we propose that the silicon oxide which initially forms at the electrode edge has insufficient strength to hold the local Poly 0 / silicon nitride interface together. This low-density silicon oxide also creates a bilayer system, which curls {{the edge of the}} 300 nm thick Poly 0 electrode away from the nitride. As delamination progresses more nitride surface is exposed and more of the interface is then attacked. This process continues cyclically until the electrode edge pushes against other device components, catastrophically and irreversibly interfering with normal operation. Additionally, we observe that the delamination only <b>starts</b> at <b>electrode</b> edges directly under cantilevers, suggesting the oxidation rate also depends on the perpendicular electric field strength...|$|R
