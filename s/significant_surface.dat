5|$|On August14, 2015, a {{well-defined}} tropical wave, accompanied by <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> pressure falls, traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening. A broad surface low developed along the wave on August15. Embedded within monsoon flow, various environmental factors enabled gradual {{development of the}} disturbance, including low wind shear, above-average sea surface temperatures, moderate moisture content, and favorable diffluence. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system generally west-northwest throughout its entire existence. On August17, the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent. It subsequently acquired enough organization to be classified a tropical depression—the fourth of the 2015season—at 06:00UTC on August18. At this time, it was situated about 825mi (1,325km) west-southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E

25|$|A {{more recent}} {{damaging}} event that also occurred near the Alborz mountain range was the 1953 Torud earthquake, {{in which more}} than 900 perished. Like that shock, the 2010 Damghan event took place in a rural area that exposed relatively few villages to strong shaking. It occurred at 11:53 local time in the north-central desert region of Iran on a fault that dipped 78° to the northwest. Fault motion occurred on a NE-SW striking fault that was almost pure left-lateral strike-slip. A Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong) was observed in Kuh Zar and the nearby villages of Tuchahi, Kelu, and Shimi. In Hoseynian, Moalleman, Satveh, and Torud, the intensity was VI (Strong). Some surface cracks and fissures were present near Tuchahi and Kelu villages, but no <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> faulting occurred.|$|E
25|$|Impact craters provide {{evidence}} of past impacts on other planets in the Solar System, including possible interplanetary terrestrial impacts. Without carbon dating, other points of reference are used to estimate the timing of these impact events. Mars provides some significant evidence of possible interplanetary collisions. The North Polar Basin on Mars is speculated {{by some to be}} evidence for a planet-sized impact on the surface of Mars between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago, while Utopia Planitia is the largest confirmed impact and Hellas Planitia is the largest visible crater in the Solar System. The Moon provides similar evidence of massive impacts, with the South Pole–Aitken basin being the biggest. Mercury's Caloris Basin is another example of a crater formed by a massive impact event. Rheasilvia on Vesta {{is an example of a}} crater formed by an impact capable of, based on ratio of impact to size, severely deforming a planetary-mass object. Impact craters on the moons of Saturn such as Engelier and Gerin on Iapetus, Mamaldi on Rhea and Odysseus on Tethys and Herschel on Mimas form <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> features.|$|E
500|$|The {{availability}} of water varies significantly throughout the region. The area between Rijeka and Vinodol contains numerous freshwater springs that are largely tapped for water supply systems. Water significantly {{contributed to the}} geomorphology of the area, especially in the Bay of Bakar, a ria located between Rijeka and Kraljevica. At the seaward slopes of Velebit, in areas near Senj and Karlobag, surface watercourses are sparse. They form losing streams flowing to the sea, while springs of lower yield dry up during summer. The most significant watercourse {{in the region is}} the [...] long Rječina River, flowing into the Adriatic Sea in the city of Rijeka. The islands of Cres, Krk, and Lošinj have <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> water that is used as the primary water supply source on those islands.

50|$|Sequence {{boundaries}} are deemed the most <b>significant</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Sequence {{boundaries are}} defined as unconformities or their correlative conformities. Sequence boundaries are formed due to the sea level fall. For example, multi-story fluvial sandstone packages often infill incised valleys formed by the sea level drop associated with sequence boundaries. The incised valleys of sequence boundaries correlate laterally with interfluves, palaeosols formed {{on the margins of}} incised valleys. The valley infills are not genetically related to underlying depositional systems as previous interpretations thought. There are four criteria distinguishing incised valley fills from other types of multi-story sandstone deposits: a widespread correlation with a regional, high relief erosional surface that is more widespread than the erosional bases of individual channels within the valley; facies associations reflect a basinward shift in facies when compared with underlying units; erosional base of the valley removes preceding systems tracts and marine bands producing a time gap, the removed units will be preserved beneath the interfluves; increasing channel fill and fine grained units upwards or changes in the character of the fluvial systems reflecting increasing accommodation space. Sandstone bodies associated with incised valleys can be good hydrocarbon reservoirs. There have been problems in the correlation and distribution of these bodies. Sequence stratigraphic principles and identification of <b>significant</b> <b>surfaces</b> have resolved some issues.|$|R
40|$|Facially {{amphiphilic}} dendrimers {{have been}} shown to provide <b>significant</b> difference in <b>surface</b> behavior due to subtle changes in structure. The monodendrons are capable of providing hydrophobic surfaces, while the didendrons provide superhydrophobic surfaces. This provides an example of how a molecular level change could result in <b>significant</b> changes in <b>surface</b> behavior. This difference is attributed to the conformational differences exhibited by these dendrimers on surfaces...|$|R
2500|$|The Central Highlands, also {{referred}} to as Los Altos, are mountains oriented from northwest to southeast with altitudes ranging from twelve to sixteen hundred meters above sea level. The western highlands are displaced faults, while the eastern highlands are mainly folds of sedimentary formationsmainly limestone, shale, and sandstone. These mountains, along the Sierra Madre of Chiapas become the Cuchumatanes where they extend over the border into Guatemala. Its topography is mountainous with many narrow valleys and karst formations called uvalas or poljés, depending on the size. Most of the rock is limestone allowing for a number of formations such as caves and sinkholes. There are also some isolated pockets of volcanic rock with the tallest peaks being the Tzontehuitz and Huitepec volcanos. There are no <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> water systems as they are almost all underground. The original vegetation was forest of oak and pine but these have been heavily damaged. The highlands climate in the Koeppen modified classification system for Mexico is humid temperate C(m) and subhumid temperate C (w 2 [...] ) (w). This climate exhibits a summer rainy season and a dry winter, with possibilities of frost from December to March. The Central Highlands have been the population center of Chiapas since the Conquest. European epidemics were hindered by the tierra fría climate, allowing the indigenous peoples in the highlands to retain their large numbers.|$|E

40|$|Salient {{features}} in 3 D meshes such as small high-curvature {{details in the}} middle of largely flat regions are easily ignored by most mesh simplification methods. Nevertheless, these features can be perceived by human observers as perceptually important in CAD models. Recently, mesh saliency has been introduced to identify those visually interesting regions. In this paper, we apply view-based mesh saliency to a purely visual method for surface simplification from two approaches. In the first one, we propose a new simplification error metric that considers polygonal saliency. In the second approach, we use viewpoint saliency as a weighting factor of the quality of a viewpoint in the simplification algorithm. Our results show that saliency can improve the preservation of small but visually <b>significant</b> <b>surfaces</b> even in visual algorithms for surface simplification. However, this comes at a price, because logically some other low-saliency regions in the mesh are simplified further...|$|R

50|$|Cooking {{techniques}} {{can be broken}} down into two major categories: Oil based and water based cooking techniques. Both oil and water based techniques rely on the vaporization of water to cook the food. Oil based cooking techniques have <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> interactions that greatly affect the quality of the food they produce. These interactions stem from the polar oil molecules interacting with the surface of the food. Water based techniques have far less surface interactions that affect the quality of the food.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Trace fossils {{represent}} both sedimentological and palaeontological entities, {{providing a}} unique blending of potential environmental indicators {{in the rock}} record. Trace fossils and trace fossil suites can be employed effectively {{to aid in the}} recognition of various discontinuity types and to assist in their genetic interpretation. Ichnology may be employed to resolve surfaces of stratigraphic significance in two main ways: (1) through the identification of discontinuities using substrate-controlled ichnofacies (the firmground Glossifungites ichnofacies, thehardground Trypanites ichnofacies and the woodground Teredolites ichnofacies); and (2) through careful analysis of trace fossils in vertical (soft-ground) successions (analogous to facies successions). Integrating the data derived from substrate-controlled ichnofacies (so-called omission suites) w h palaeoecological data from vertically and laterally juxtaposed softground ichnological successions greatly enhances the recognition and interpretation {{of a wide variety of}} stratigraphically <b>significant</b> <b>surfaces.</b> When this is coupled with conventional sedimentary facies analysis and sequence stratigra-phy, a powerful approach to the interpretation of the rock record is generated.

50|$|Treatment {{facilities}} resembling {{natural purification}} processes: their application requires <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> area, {{because of the}} slow pace of the biological processes applied. For the same reason they are more suitable for warmer climates, because the rate of the purification process is temperature dependent. These technologies are more resilient to fluctuating loads and do not require complex maintenance and operation. Constructed wetlands are more suitable for applications at on-site or at neighbourhood level, while stabilization ponds could be a viable alternative for decentralized systems at the level of small towns or rural communities.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} cooking {{techniques}} {{that do not}} use oil {{as part of the}} process such as steaming or boiling. Water based techniques are typically used to cook vegetables or other plants which can be consumed as food. When no oil is present the method of heat transfer to the food is typically water vapor. Water vapor molecules do not have any <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> interactions with the food surface. Since food, including vegetables, is cooked by the vaporization of water within the food, the use of water vapor as the mode of heat transfer has no effect on the chemical interactions {{on the surface of the}} food.|$|E

40|$|For {{electroplating}} articles with {{a complex}} shape, {{it is essential}} that the plating bath should (1) cover the contoured surface in a short time and (2) produce a uniform thickness preferably over the entire surface or at least over the <b>significant</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The former is decided by the covering power of the bath and the latter by the 13; throwing power of the bath. Throwing power refers to the thickness distribution of the deposit, whereas covering power is concerned with the ability of the bath to cover the entire cathode surface in the least possible time, even in low current density areas. Though quantitative methods (Haring and Blum cell, Hull cell, etc.) are available for measuring the throwing power of the bath, there are no such methods for covering power.
