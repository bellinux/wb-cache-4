5|$|By 1940, at {{the dawn}} of the freeway era, the state was making plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a ten-lane Bayshore Freeway between San Francisco and Palo Alto. The first piece built was from Peninsula Avenue at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to South San Francisco. This six-lane freeway, {{completed}} in 1949, followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport,</b> and crossed the old road at South San Francisco, running just east of it to near the south end of the cut at Sierra Point. Construction began inside San Francisco in 1950 and was completed in 1958; the new causeway across Candlestick Cove, connecting the completed section in South San Francisco with San Francisco, was dedicated in mid-1957.

5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring strong {{economic growth in}} the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport,</b> and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E

The $1.5 billion ($ billion adjusted for inflation) extension of BART southward to <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport's</b> (SFO) Garage G, adjacent to the International Terminal, was opened to the public on June 22, 2003. The right of way had been served by Muni's 40 San Mateo interurban (previously the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> and <b>San</b> Mateo Electric Railway) streetcar line until 1949. The airport extension between SFO and Millbrae station was initially hosted a shuttle service which operated with two train operators—one on each end of the train—between the San Bruno and Millbrae stations to reduce dwell time at SFO during peak hours. The train entered the SFO stub-end station under the control of the primary operator and exited in the opposite direction towards Millbrae controlled by the secondary. Since SFO is now the terminus of the line that serves it, this practice was discontinued as it would not reduce the in-transit time for any trips.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two supervised-learning models, {{logistic}} regression and decision tree, to predict occurrence of a ground delay program {{at an airport}} based on meteorological conditions and scheduled traffic demand. Predicting the occurrence of ground delay programs can help the Federal Aviation Administration traffic man-agers and airline dispatchers prepare mitigation strategies to reduce impact of adverse weather. The models are developed for two major U.

The decision tree model, on the other hand, classifies {{whether or not a}} ground delay program is likely during an hour based on the input variables. Results indicate both models perform sig-nificantly better than a purely random prediction of ground delay program occurrence at the two airports. The degree to which various input variables impact the probability of ground delay program vary between the two airports. While the enroute convective weather is a dominant factor causing ground delay programs at Newark Liberty Intl. airport, poor visibility and low cloud ceiling caused by marine stratus are major driver...|$|R
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{statistical}} and {{integer programming}} methods {{are used to}} calibrate models to estimate airport arrival capacity distributions. These distributions are an essential input to decision models used to regulate flow into congested airports when demand for arrival resources exceeds the available capacity. The techniques developed make contributions {{to the body of}} knowledge on air traffic flow management. On a more general level, the approach developed {{can be viewed as a}} clustering technique that maintains the time order of imbedded time series data. During instances of capacityﬤemand imbalances, efficient planning and decisionשּׂaking is contingent upon the "goodness" of the models that estimate airport capacity over time. Airport capacities are subject to substantial uncertainty as they depend on stochastic weather conditions. The models developed in this thesis are required inputs into a class of stochastic ground holding models that determine the amount of ground delay to assign to incoming flights to balance assigned ground delay and expected airborne delay optimally while minimizing total delay. The models are judged by the amount of total weighted delay incurred in comparison to the amount of total weighted delay that would have been realized under current operational procedures. (Airborne delay is weighted more heavily than ground delay). Based on comparisons between the decision models that employ the estimates developed in this thesis and current models, the results of this thesis reduce the total amount of weighted delay. Another contribution is the development of a new, simple decision model that more accurately estimates the amount of delay incurred in a ground delay program as it dynamically changes. The statistical models calibrated in this thesis use empirical historical data to generate (arrival capacity) probability distribution functions (vectors of capacity scenarios). In the case considered in this thesis, the capacity scenarios (oneאּarameter arrival capacity distributions) are used to model morning fog at <b>San</b> <b>Francisco's</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport.</b> To determine seasonal capacity probabilistic distribution functions (distributions that vary in time), a set partitioning integer programming model is utilized...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{development}} of aviation in the cities around <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> Bay as it progressed from an uncertain novelty in 1849 to a full-fledged transportation industry, complete with Federal regulation and subsidies, by 1934. The genesis of the study lies in a suggestion by Gary Kurutz of the California State Library that a void exists in knowledge of early Bay Area aviation history and the sites of its significant events. Consulting Kenneth Johnson's, "Aerial California: An Account of Early Flight in Northern & Southern California 1849 -World War I," the best available overall coverage[of] the subject, I concluded that {{not only does the}} void exist, but it is also larger than I expected. Moreover, my research unearthed additional inadequately covered areas. First is the civic competition in {{the development of}} the Oakland Airport and Mills Field, now Oakland and <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airports.</b> The second is the unabashed solicitation by local cities of a partnership with the War and Navy Departments resulting in construction of the major military fields around the perimeter of the Bay. Roger Lotchin's "Fortress California" corroborates my independently-derived concept of deliberate courtship of the Federal government construction and contracts by California cities seeking revenue and business stimulation. A third area, related to the second is the contributions made by military aviators and organizations to the development of Bay Area aviation. Geography played a large part in the timing of significant steps in the development of an aviation industry in California and in the eventual form taken by the industry itself in 1934. The isolation of California's gold fields spawned the earliest efforts to produce commercially viable aircraft. It created logistics and communications problems for Bay Area pioneers affecting and motivating the extraordinary contributions of aerodynamicist John Montgomery and engine design genius E. J. Hall of the Hall-Scott Motor Car Company. The same isolation attracted the efforts of the Post Office Department to forge the long air mail link from New York to <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> And once the effects of Federal contracts became appreciated, Bay Area citizens and their local government molded an aviation partnership with the Military and Commerce Departments, and the expanding airline that is still firmly in place today...|$|R
5000|$|With a {{cross-border}} facility {{connecting the}} terminals, Tijuana and San Diego passengers {{would have been}} able to easily connect between Mexican and U.S. domestic and international destinations/flights, which in effect would have created a regional hub airport between Mexican, U.S., and international airlines and made the Tijuana-San Diego trans-border airport competitive and an alternative to the congested Los Angeles (LAX) and <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> (SFO) <b>international</b> <b>airports.</b> Coupled with Mexico's underutilized international and corresponding routes and time slots, the initial stage would have attracted co-investments and concessions to the Tijuana airport by airlines seeking to develop Pacific and U.S. West Coast destinations, and companies providing services to support commercial, charter and cargo operations. The construction of a 12,000-foot runway on the San Diego side separated by 5280 feet from Tijuana's runways would also have allowed for simultaneous operations between the two airports while the cross-border aircraft taxiway would have given Tijuana access to an east approach, all weather, 12,000-foot reinforced runway with a 3 degree glide slope capable of handling fully loaded super jumbo jets weighing over 600 tons. Having designed the Tijuana airport, Gilberto Valenzuela also disclosed that the Tijuana runway was built over landfill and a seasonal stream which through water saturation over the years had caused cracks and settlement on the runways' center, creating a dip that could stress the wheel suspension of fully loaded and landing aircraft. In addition, not having been designed to support heavy aircraft, the added volume of such aircraft would accelerate the Tijuana runway's decay creating a safety hazard through added asphalt and concrete debris which could damage turbine blades. Runway safety and airline operations would also be impacted by a reduction of both the runway's capacity and length as sections would have to be closed for repairs at increased and unscheduled intervals. Access to San Diego's proposed TwinPorts runway would have allowed Tijuana to completely rebuild its main runway without affecting operations or safety. The counter-proposal was officially presented as a [...] "third option" [...] on September 2, 1992, before the San Diego-Mexico airport working group and to keep with ASA's planned development schedule, a $130 million U.S. dollar first phase expansion was proposed that included lengthening the Tijuana airport's main runway to 12,000 and the construction of a cross-border terminal with a second phase $190 million U.S. dollar expansion of the Tijuana airport that would have developed a second runway 700 feet (210 meters) south of the existing runway, and completed the Matrix aircraft maintenance center.|$|R
