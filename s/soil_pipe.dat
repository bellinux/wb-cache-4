The mean frequency of piping was 69 per kilometer of surveyed transect. Land management (moorland gripping) appears to exert the most important control on hillslope pipe frequency in blanket peats. Management practice in peatlands may therefore induce more rapid subsurface erosion, carbon loss and landform denudation via enhanced preferential flow. Topographic position is also important, with topslopes having greater pipe frequencies than footslopes, followed by midslopes with lowest frequencies. Slope gradient, however, is not {{a significant factor in}} controlling blanket peat pipe frequency. I propose that peat structural properties inherited from the way a blanket peat develops on a hillslope strongly control pipe network development. This is manifested in the way slope position appears to control pipe frequency.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In 1987, a 0. 83 -ha zero-order swale was {{instrumented}} with 58 pierometers and 25 tensiometers along several hillslope transects. Through 1993, {{soil moisture}} conditions were measured by pressure transducers {{connected to a}} digital data logger recording at 15 -minute intervals. In August 1989, the 100 -year-old second-growth forest in the swale was felled. Logs were removed by cable yarding and heavy logging equipment was excluded from the hillslopes. Increases in peak piezometric levels and soil moisture were observed following logging. In the shallower, unsaturated portion of the soil profile, the increase was short-lived due to the rapid resprouting of redwood stumps. At the soil-bedrock interface, increased pore pressures persisted during winter periods throughout the 4 -yr post-harvest period. In addition to changes in evapotranspiration, pore pressure increases {{may be explained by}} reduced canopy interception, compaction, or the collapse of <b>soil</b> <b>pipes.</b> At the base of the swale, pipeflow accounted for virtually all of the stormflow.

Sinkholes, swallow-holes, and <b>soil</b> <b>pipes</b> are important groundwater recharge points for shallow karst aquifers. They are also sites of subsidence and may indicate deeper hydraulically-active conduits. The thickness of the protective soil cover, macropores, and openings within the soil cover {{and the nature of the}} weathered bedrock surface all influence infiltration. In the Perry Farm Park study site, some sinkholes are filled with sediment or debris and have no topographic expression. In other areas, swallow-holes and <b>soil</b> <b>pipes</b> are clearly visible at the surface. This dissertation tests the hypothesis that geophysical techniques may be used to characterize conduits and fractures that act as groundwater recharge pathways for surface waters and sediments entering the karst bedrock aquifer. Seismic refraction and electrical resistivity soundings suggest Silurian dolomite bedrock lies at a depth of approximately 4 m across most of the park, beneath alluvial sands, silts, and clays. Electromagnetic conductivity profiling identified high conductivity anomalies over the locations of buried sinkholes in the eastern part of the park, possibly due to infilling by clayey sediments or elevated soil moisture. A zone of elevated conductivity trends WSW from the sinkholes and may indicate a conduit linked to other sinkholes in a ravine approximately 0. 5 km away. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles also identified an epikarstal air-filled cave adjacent to Bourbonnais Creek and shallow <b>soil</b> <b>pipes</b> in the western part of the park. Soil borings confirmed the resistivity surveys' prediction of a 3 [...] 5 m unconsolidated sediment thickness overlying dolomite bedrock. Borings also confirmed a heavily weathered and enlarged bedrock fracture, initially imaged by 2 D resistivity tomography, that contains a clay-filled cave lying below filled sinkholes in the eastern portion of the park. Soil cores from borings also indicate topsoil is transported to depths of over 7 m in this location, suggesting an active natural plumbing system connects the surface to openings in the bedrock. Integrating geophysical surveys with results from borings and water-level measurements provide a comprehensive approach to delineating these karst recharge features (and contaminant pathways) in three-dimensions. The proposed hypothesis has thus been confirmed by these measurements at Perry Farm Park...|$|R

However, there has been no detailed, long-term monitoring study of the evolution of pipe networks to indicate how permanent they are or how readily they may develop into open channels. This paper reports a resurvey of a section of stream bank in the English Peak District and compares it with the original survey 35 years previous. Comparison of the distribution, size, and shape of pipes on both banks of a 250 m stretch of the stream reveals significant changes. There were no cases of roof collapse forming new open channels. However, there has been a significant change in land use within the basin, with afforestation of the east bank. The resurvey shows a marked reduction in the number and size of pipes on the forested bank, but no significant change on the opposite bank that has remained moorland. The number of pipe outlets on the afforested bank halved over the period, and their mean diameter has reduced by 30 %. In combination with the reduced number the smaller size resulted in a 71 % reduction in the total area of stream bank occupied by pipe outlets on the forested bank. It is postulated that the change is primarily due to a change in the amount of throughflow beneath the forest caused by an increase in evapotranspiration. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Soil pipes are {{considered}} to drain off water from a hillslope and {{play an important role}} in the subsurface runoff generation process, thus reducing the slope failure susceptibility. However, soil pipes are also often detected on the collapsed slope suggesting that they might act to induce slope instability. To examine how the soil pipes act on pore-water pressure generation and on a slope failure processes, a numerical model was developed. The model was used to test the response of pore-water pressure in a hillslope with soil pipes of different cross-sectional areas, lengths, distances from the impermeable bed, roughness, and hillslope angles. The model was also tested to find the response of open <b>soil</b> <b>pipe</b> if blocked. The study reveals that pipes reduce pore-water pressure (measured closed to bed) around its upstream end and increase around its downstream end if compared with no pipe case. Pore-water pressure at downstream end is increased with increase in hillslope angle, pipe cross-sectional area, pipe length, or depth of <b>soil</b> <b>pipe.</b> <b>Soil</b> <b>pipe,</b> even if it is ended within the hillslope, increases the total discharge from hillslope. Location of rough soil also affects the discharge and pressure within the hillslope. If the less rough pipe is close to the source of water, discharge from hillslope matrix is greater regardless of its downstream pipe roughness. Blockage of small portion of open <b>soil</b> <b>pipe</b> increases the soil pressure around the region but not beyond the case if there is no <b>soil</b> <b>pipe.</b> However, complete collapse of <b>soil</b> <b>pipe</b> from a point to all along the downstream end of hillslope increases the pore-water pressure beyond the pressure if there were no soil pipes.

Silicon (Si) and specific conductance (EC) in various runoff components were also measured to identify their sources. ZOB flow response was dependent on antecedent precipitation amount; runoff increased linearly with precipitation during events > 20 mm in relatively wet antecedent moisture conditions. Runoff derived from direct precipitation falling onto saturated areas accounted for < 0. 2 % of total ZOB flow volume during the study period, indicating the predominance of subsurface pathways in ZOB flow. ZOB flow (high EC and low Si) was distinct from perennial baseflow via bedrock seepage (low EC and high Si) 5 m downstream of the ZOB outlet. Pipe flow responded quickly to ZOB flow rate and was characterized by a threshold flow capacity unique to each pipe. Piezometric data and pipe flow records demonstrated that pipes located deeper in the soil initiated first, followed by those at shallower depths; initiation of pipe flow corresponded to shallow groundwater rise above the saprolite-soil interface. Chemical signatures of pipe flow were similar {{to each other and}} to the ZOB flow, suggesting that the sources were well-mixed soil-derived shallow groundwater. Based upon the volume of pipe flow during storms, the combined contribution of the pipes monitored accounted for 48 % of total ZOB flow during the study period.
