We describe a novel Raman dynamic probe of hydrogen-isotope exchange to investigate directly these protein folding/assembly pathways.

The molecular mechanism of <b>shell</b> <b>expansion</b> involves unfolding of metastable tertiary structure to form more stable quaternary contacts and is governed by a surprisingly high activation energy.

We use a semi-analytic method and numerical simulations to explore {{expansion of}} spherical dusty H II regions and surrounding neutral shells and the resulting cloud disruption. Our model for <b>shell</b> <b>expansion</b> adopts the static solutions of Draine (2011) for dusty H II regions and considers the contact outward forces on the shell due to radiation and thermal pressures as well as the inward gravity from the central star and the shell itself. We show that the internal structure we adopt and the shell evolution from the semi-analytic approach are in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations. Strong radiation pressure in the interior controls the <b>shell</b> <b>expansion</b> indirectly by enhancing the density and pressure at the ionization front.

40|$|The {{basic type}} of rock mass {{reinforcement}} method for both preparatory and operational workings in underground metal ore mines, both in Poland {{and in different}} countries across the world, is the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> or adhesive-bonded rock bolt. The article discusses results of static loading test of the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> rock bolts equipped with originally developed deformable component. This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two disk springs, and three guide bars. The disk spring and disk washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed. The rock bolts tested were installed in blocks simulating a rock mass with rock compressive strength of 80 MPa. The rock bolt was loaded statically until its ultimate loading capacity was exceeded. The study presents the results obtained under laboratory conditions in the test rig allowing testing of the rock bolts at their natural size, as used in underground metal ore mines. The stress-strain/displacement characteristics of the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> rock bolt with the deformable component were determined experimentally. The relationships between the geometric parameters and specific strains or displacements of the bolt rod were described, and the percentage contribution of those values in total displacements, resulting from the deformation of rock bolt support components (washer, thread) and the <b>expansion</b> <b>shell</b> head displacements, were estimated. The stiffness of the yielded and stiff bolts was empirically determined, including stiffness parameters of every individual part (deformable component, steel rod).

The CO observations confirm that dense molecular material has been collected along the shell detected in Spitzer IRAC images. The CO distribution shows that the shell is blown out toward a lower density region to the northwest. Total hydrogen column density around the shell is high enough to form new stars.

We identify two YSOs in early evolutionary stages (Stage 0 /I) within the densest molecular condensation.

Using the recent approx. 1 min resolution IGA (Infrared Galaxy Atlas) and DRAO (Dominion Royal Astrophysical Observatory) CGPS (Canadian Galactic Plane Survey) galactic plane surveys we analyze the far-infrared and radio structure of the W 4 chimney/supershell.

We present expressions for the maximum line-of-sight velocity from a complete, expanding shell and for its projected major and minor axes, in terms of the intrinsic axis ratio and the inclination of the polar axis to the line of sight. For six distinct definitions of “angular size”, we tabulate the error in distance that is introduced under the assumption of spherical symmetry (i. e., without correcting for inclination and axis ratio).
