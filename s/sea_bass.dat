5|$|Bouillabaisse is a {{substantial}} dish from the French port of Marseille, capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish, gurnard, weever, John Dory, monkfish, conger eel, whiting, <b>sea</b> <b>bass,</b> and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{intertidal}} mud flats {{of the bay}} have a {{long history}} of use for fishing, with structures on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, <b>sea</b> <b>bass,</b> and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for fishing in the bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E
40|$|Top predators have {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the structure and dynamics of marine ecosystems. These organisms have been largely used as indicators {{of the effectiveness of}} marine protected areas (MPAs). In Brazil, the impact of fisheries on reef species, such as groupers and <b>sea</b> <b>basses,</b> and the importance of local marine reserves in the maintenance of these fish communities are still poorly understood. Here we assessed the assemblage of groupers and <b>sea</b> <b>basses</b> (Epinephelidae and Serranidae) inside and outside the Arvoredo Marine Reserve (AR), a MPA in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. Density and biomass of 13 fish species (7 Epinephelidae and 6 Serranidae) were recorded. The most abundant groupers were Epinephelus marginatus and Mycteroperca acutirostris, while Serranus flaviventris and S. balwini were the most abundant <b>sea</b> <b>basses.</b> Grouper biomass was significantly higher inside the reserve, indicating the effectiveness of this MPA for target and threatened species, such as E. marginatus. In contrast, biomass of <b>sea</b> <b>basses</b> was higher outside the MPA, as a possible result of prey release effect. Despite the higher biomass of groupers inside AR, spearfishing records from the 1960 s indicate that there {{is still a long way}} to a full recovery of the biomass of top predators, especially groupers and sharks. Thus, a more effective enforcement and longer-term protection are necessary to restore fish stocks and ecosystem health in these reefs. 9 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The {{coastline}} supplies many crustaceans, <b>sea</b> <b>bass,</b> monkfish and herring. Normandy has {{top quality}} seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has {{a supply of}} lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E
5|$|The {{passing of}} the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean <b>Sea</b> <b>Bass</b> in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, <b>sea</b> <b>bass,</b> flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E

The <b>sea</b> <b>basses</b> used in the trial were captured from the fishes living in wildlife or differently farm raised. The organoleptic differences were evaluated through the study of different samples: the fishes boiled or cooked in oven, and the fish cooking waters. Every judge had to discover {{differences between}} each couple of sample of meat or water-extract in the orthogonal tests with the hidden controls.

5000|$|The Serranidae are a {{large family}} of fishes {{belonging}} to the order Perciformes. The family contains about 450 species in 65 genera, including the <b>sea</b> <b>basses</b> and the groupers (subfamily Epinephelinae). Although many species are small, in some cases less than 10 cm, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) {{is one of the}} largest bony fishes in the world, growing to 2.7 m in length and 400 kg in weight.

25|$|Salmon {{aquaculture}} is a {{major contributor}} to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10billion annually. Other commonly cultured fish species include: tilapia, catfish, <b>sea</b> <b>bass,</b> carp and bream. Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe. Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and the island of Tasmania, Australia.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, <b>sea</b> <b>basses,</b> flatheads, <b>sea</b> breams and lightfishes.|$|R
