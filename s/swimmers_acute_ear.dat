Recreational water illness can result from ingesting, inhaling aerosols of, or having contact with contaminated water in swimming pools, hot tubs, water parks, water play areas, interactive fountains, lakes, rivers, or oceans. These illnesses also {{can be caused by}} chemicals in the water or chemicals that evaporate from the water. This year’s observance focuses on preventing <b>swimmer’s</b> <b>ear</b> (<b>acute</b> otitis externa), a common and painful infection of the outer ear canal that results in 2. 4 million healthcare visits and nearly half a billion dollars in health-care costs every year (1). Simple steps, such as keeping ears as dry as possible, can help prevent this illness. More information on preventing swimmer’s ear is available a...|$|R

40|$|Summary: We {{present the}} case of a scuba diver who expe-rienced <b>acute</b> <b>ear</b> pain during ascent from a dive. CT imaging was {{performed}} because of severe unrelenting headache. Blood and gas was identified within the epidural space of the middle fossa and over the petrous bone, as well as hemorrhage within the adjacent temporal lobe. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of CT-docu-mented barotrauma affecting the brain as a result of mid-dle-ear gas rupturing through the tegmen tympani. Middle-ear barotrauma may occur with a rapid change of ambient pressure. A pressure gradient can develop when there is compromise of airflow through the Eustachian tube.

40|$|Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), {{originally}} {{restricted to}} hospitals, {{has emerged as}} a significant pathogen in the community. Although MRSA accounts for over 60 % of S. aureus in tertiary hospitals in Korea, {{little is known about the}} epidemiology of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). Methods: From January to July 2005, a hospital laboratory-based survey was conducted in seven community-based or tertiary hospitals. The medical records and Health Insurance Review Agency data-bases were reviewed and MRSA isolated from patients without apparent risk factors was defined as CA-MRSA. Susceptibilities to 12 antibiotics were tested by the disc diffusion method. SCCmec typing, Panton–Valentine leucocidin (PVL) gene detection and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were per-formed according to published protocols. Results: Of 3251 S. aureus, 1900 (58. 4 %) were MRSA. CA-MRSA accounted for 112 (5. 9 %) of the MRSA. Of the 112 CA-MRSA isolates, 27 and 33 were found to be pathogens and colonizers, respectively. Fifty-two isolates from the patients with chronic otitis media were classified as ‘undetermined’.

60|$|This quickness of {{eyesight}} was altogether exceptional. Standing {{behind a}} gun--and knowing, therefore, the exact course the shot will take--it is comparatively {{easy for a}} quick-sighted man to follow it; but there are few, indeed, who can see a shot coming towards them. In this respect, the ear is a far better index than the eye. A person possessed of {{a fair amount of}} nerve can judge, to within a few yards, the line that a shot coming towards him will take. When first heard, the sound is as a faint murmur; increasing, as it approaches, to a sound resembling the blowing off of steam by an express engine, as it rushes through a station. At first, the keenest ear could not tell the direction in which the shot is travelling but, as it approaches, the difference in the angle becomes perceptible to the ear, and a calm listener will distinguish whether it will pass within twenty or thirty yards, to the right or left. It would require an extraordinary <b>acute</b> <b>ear</b> to determine more closely than this, the angle of flight being so very small, until the shot approaches almost within striking distance.|$|R

This work aims {{to evaluate the}} topical anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of the methanolic extract of C. pachystachya (CPM) and to perform its chemical fingerprint by HPLC-DAD. The topical anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using the mouse models of <b>acute</b> <b>ear</b> inflammation induced by croton oil, arachidonic acid, capsaicin, EPP, phenol, and chronic inflammation induced by multiple application of croton oil. The in vitro antioxidant effect of CPM was investigated using DPPH, reducing power, β-carotene bleaching, and TBARS assays. HPLC analysis was performed to quantify the antioxidant phenolics orientin, isoorientin, and chlorogenic acid previously identified in CPM. CPM exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effect in the acute models, in some cases comparable to the reference drugs. Histopathological analysis showed a moderate chronic skin anti-inflammatory effect with decrease in vasodilation, edema, cell infiltration, and epidermal hyperproliferation. It also showed strong in vitro antioxidant activity. The contents of orientin, isoorientin, and chlorogenic acid were 66. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 8, 118. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 7, and 5. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 2 [*]µg/mg extract, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Acute {{otitis media}} with {{perforation}} (AOMwiP) affects 40 % of remote Indigenous children {{during the first}} 18 months of life. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the primary bacterial pathogens of otitis media and their loads predict clinical ear state. Our hypothesis is that antecedent respiratory viral infection increases bacterial density and progression to perforation. Methods A total of 366 nasopharyngeal swabs from 114 Indigenous children were retrospectively examined. A panel of 17 respiratory viruses was screened by PCR, and densities of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were estimated by quantitative real time PCR. Data are reported by clinical ear state. Results M. catarrhalis (96 %), H. influenzae (91 %), S. pneumoniae (89 %) and respiratory viruses (59 %) were common; including rhinovirus (HRV) (38 %), polyomavirus (HPyV) (14 %), adenovirus (HAdV) (13 %), bocavirus (HBoV) (8 %) and coronavirus (HCoV) (4 %). Geometric mean bacterial loads were significantly higher in children with acute otitis media (AOM) compared to children without evidence of otitis media.

40|$|SummaryThe case {{of acute}} {{acoustic}} and burn ear trauma caused by mobile phone failure is presented. A woman aged 24 after dialling {{a phone number}} and putting a phone into the ear heard a sound of high frequency and intensity. At {{the same time she}} felt a pain and heat and there was also a smoke from the phone. With otoscopic examination a burn of external acoustic duct (I 0) and sensitive hearing loss (examination made with tuning forks) were stated. The patient did not agree to stay in hospital and she was administered prednizone, trimetazidin and xantylol nicotinate. Audiometric examination, which was made on another day, showed hearing loss of 30 dB for frequency 4000 Hz. After 2 days she started to hear a sound like a sea noise in her right ear. In the control examination, made 2 weeks after injury, no abnormalities in audiogram were stated but the patient steal heard ear noise. She continued to take trimetazidin and betahistin and after one month all symptoms of ear injury relieved. Patient is still under control of otolaryngologist. Unfortunately our efforts to explain the cause of such accident from phone producer were ineffective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} the magnitude of the selected sports medicine problems (i. e. cauliflower ear and skin infections) among wrestlers in Tehran. A number of 411 wrestlers were randomly selected from wrestling clubs in Tehran employing cluster sample setting method. The participants were interviewed using a specially designed and validated questionnaire. Nearly half of the participants (44 %) had "cauliflower ears". Only 23 % of these participants had received any kind of treatment for their <b>acute</b> <b>ear</b> haematomas that are known to result in "cauliflower ears". The prevalence of reported hearing loss among participants with cauliflower ears (11. 5 %, 95 %CI: 6. 9 to 16. 2) was significantly more than this prevalence among those participants without cauliflower ears (1. 8 %, 95 %CI: 0. 1 to 3. 5) (p < 0. 05).
