40|$|We {{present a}} variational {{treatment}} of the ground state of the two-leg t-J ladder, which combines the dimer and the hard-core boson models into one effective model. This model allows us to study the local structure of the hole pairs {{as a function of}} doping. A second-order recursion relation is used to generate the variational wave function, which substantially simplifies the computations. We obtain good agreement with numerical density matrix renormalization group results for the ground state energy in the strong-coupling regime. We find that the local structure of the pairs depends upon whether the ladder is slightly or strongly dopped. © 1998 The American Physical SocietyGS acknowledges <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> NSF under Grant No. PHY 94 - 07194 and the Direcci´on General de Ense˜nanza Superior, MAMD acknowledges <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CICYT under contract AEN 93 - 0776, JD acknowledges <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> DIGICYT under contract No. PB 95 / 0123, SRW acknowledges <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> NSF under Grant No. DMR- 9509945, and DJS acknowledges <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> NSF under Grant numbers PHY- 9407194 and DMR- 9527304.
