5|$|Angkor, {{the seat}} of the Khmer Empire was {{subjected}} to Vietnamese influence as early as the 13th century.

In 1813, Nak Ong Chan gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam, and under his rule Cambodia became a protectorate. Following his death in 1834, Vietnam colonised Cambodia; it was governed under a Vietnamese administration and termed a Vietnamese ‘province’. Throughout the 1830s, Vietnam attempted to erase Khmer culture, which had derived the basis of Cambodian society, dress and religion from India rather than China. The trend of Vietnamese dominance continued during French colonization, under which Cambodia was forced to cede much of its <b>southern</b> <b>cone</b> (which would later be Saigon, the Mekong Delta and Tây Ninh) to the Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge later justified their incursions into Vietnam as an attempt to regain the territories which Cambodia had lost during the previous centuries.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{this period}} the pro-independence forces made two {{important}} advances. In the <b>Southern</b> <b>Cone,</b> a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, José de San Martín, became the governor of the Province of Cuyo. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru. San Martín's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes, which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan Martín de Pueyrredón became Supreme Director of the United Provinces. In January 1817, San Martín was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the Río de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Martín together with General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Martín had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a war with no quarter, the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane, Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Martín and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{mapping of}} {{volcanic}} stratigraphy {{in conjunction with}} 41 new K-Ar ages {{have been used to}} constrain a petrological model of Tongariro Volcanic Complex within a time-space framework. Over 400 samples form an extensive geochemical data base comprising whole-rock major and trace element data, together with whole-rock REE and isotopic analyses and mineral compositions for selected samples. These data have been used to investigate the complex interplay between magma batches on a variety of time scales and the time-space relationships of the subvolcanic plumbing system. This new integrated approach to the study of Tongariro has not been applied to many other composite volcanoes but is crucial in linking petrological models to realistic geological relationships. Tongariro is a large (c. 60 km 3), active, basaltic andesite to dacite composite cone complex situated near {{the southern end of the}} Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. A virtually continuous eruptive history of the Tongariro complex has been divided into 17 small (< 2 km 3) to large (12 km 3) nested and overlapping volcano-stratigraphic or cone-forming units which represent the products (aa and block lava flows, welded scoria-spatter deposits, volcaniclastic tuff breccias) of many recurrent styles of eruptions from at least 30 discrete vents, active for varying periods of time (a few to tens of thousands of years) throughout Tongariro's known lifetime from c. 275 ka to the present. Episodes of rapid cone growth have occurred at 210 - 200 ka (Tama 2 cone eruptive rate = 1 km 3 /ka) and 130 - 80 ka (NE Oturere, SW Oturere and Tongariro Trig cones under construction), with development of the complex most recently dominated by the rapid growth (0. 9 km 3 /ka) of Ngauruhoe cone since 2. 5 ka. There is no orderly time-space relationship between cone-building events; the locus of activity shifted non-systematically over the lifetime of the complex within a 13 km-long and 5 km-wide SW-NE aligned vent corridor. Tongariro eruptive products vary in composition almost continuously from 53. 0 to 64. 2 wt% SiO 2 and 1. 1 to 9. 2 wt% MgO, forming a calc-alkaline, medium-K suite. Two-pyroxene andesites are volumetrically dominant, but hornblende is a significant phase confined to the older <b>southern</b> <b>cones</b> of Tama 1 and 2 and Pukekaikiore, and olivine is particularly prominent in the young (post- 25 ka) eruptives, suggesting an overall time-space relationship with petrography and mineralogy. Tongariro rocks exhibit features typical of subduction-related magmas such as light-REE enriched patterns ([Ce/Yb]N= 1. 8 - 3. 9), relatively low high field strength abundances (e. g. Nb= 2. 7 - 6. 7), and strongly spiked patterns on incompatible element spider diagrams. A wide range in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 704442 - 0. 706193) is accompanied by less variability in 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 512629 - 0. 512862), Pb isotopic ratios (206 Pb/ 204 Pb= 18. 781 - 18. 854, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb= 15. 594 - 15. 645, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb= 3 8. 5 88 - 38. 802), and δ 18 O (+ 6. 16 - 6. 59). Variation diagrams for the Tongariro cone-forming units reveal major diversity in the absolute elemental abundances for given SiO 2 contents, in the length, steepness and shape of chemical trends, and in the distribution of chemical groups within compositional space. However, certain volcano-stratigraphic units (e. g. the amphibole-bearing andesites of the older <b>southern</b> <b>cones)</b> do share similar patterns of chemical ordering which suggest derivation from a common 'parental' magma reservoir and a similar early history. Nonetheless, considerable chemical variability in closely-related samples is common, and provides strong evidence for a higher level influence on magma compositions. Nonsystematic relationships with age (compositional breaks, reversals and loops) along geoche mical trends on variation diagrams and chemical stratigraphy plots cannot be modelled by fractional crystallization. These coincide with petrographic and mineralogical evidence for disequilibrium including plagioclase sieve textures, strong reverse zoning, coexisting high-temperature and low-temperature phases exhibiting reaction rims or corrosion, olivine phenocrysts with much higher Fo contents than expected from wholerock Mg#, and bimodal or very widely ranging crystallization temperature estimates for some samples. These features suggest the involvement of multiple small batches of magma, rising from the various 'parental' reservoirs by differing ascent paths, within a complex subvolcanic plumbing system which has allowed varying degrees of interaction and magma mixing. As indicated by the presence of quartzite xenoliths of the Torlesse metasedimentary basement, these magmas have also interacted with the crust, which represents an important means of introducing often wide compositional diversity of magmas on time scales as short as decades or centuries. A considerable variation in incompatible trace element ratios (e. g. Ba/Zr, Nb/Ta, La/Yb, Zr/Hf) and radiogenic isotopic compositions (e. g. Ngauruhoe 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios increase from 0. 705470 in 1954 to 0. 706165 in 1975) for closely-related samples, and the marked scatter of data evident on assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process diagrams indicate that magmas have not evolved along a unique AFC trend but can more aptly be characterised as forming a 'family' of AFC trends or perhaps a series of 'one-off AFC 'events' produced by contamination of numerous small and frequent Tongariro magma batches with varying amounts of compositionally heterogeneous Torlesse crust. This investigation of chemically and isotopically diverse lavas related on time scales of 100 years (historic Ngauruhoe eruptives), 1000 years (Ngauruhoe, Red Crater and Te Mari Crater vents) and 10 000 years (0 - 10 ka young eruptives, 120 - 130 ka NE Oturere, 200 - 210 ka Tama 2) has demonstrated that the observed compositional variability is mainly developed at comparatively high crustal levels within a complex subvolcanic plumbing system by fractional crystallization and the mixing of numerous, small (<< 0. 1 km 3), short-lived (c. 1 ka) magma batches coupled with variable amounts of crustal assimilation of a compositionally diverse Torlesse metasedimentary contaminant. These processes have been operating to similar effect throughout the lifetime of the Tongariro complex, although subtle differences in geochemical patterns suggest that the regularity or rate of magma batch production may have varied slightly. The young Ngauruhoe cone has been highlighted as a cameo study for which the well-constrained stratigraphy, enabled by the preservation of numerous young lava flows erupted over the last thousand years, provides a unique opportunity for detailed petrological modelling paying careful attention to age relationships. Five geochemically and isotopically distinct groups of magma reflect variable crustal contamination of many discrete magma batches within several independent shallow plumbing systems beneath Ngauruhoe...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study on the}} {{practice}} of mass grave exhumation in the context of international criminal law, and more specifically as employed by international criminal tribunals. The primary institutions of focus are the International Military Tribunal held in Nuremberg, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The study locates the genesis of the phenomenon of mass grave exhumation for international criminal justice purposes at a historical point in time, contending that the emergence of this experience parallels with the development of international criminal law during and after the Second World War, and with the growing movement against impunity for the most serious of international crimes. It is argued that this process represents a shift in how the remains of the deceased in armed conflict are viewed. The legal framework relevant to the treatment of the dead in war is outlined in Chapter I and the relevance of rules of international humanitarian law pertaining to the deceased to forensic exhumations is discussed in the first chapter. The core aim of Chapter II is to detail the modus operandi of mass grave exhumations from an international criminal justice perspective. Chapter III examines the presentation of forensic evidence at the International Military Tribunal held in Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946. The second half of the chapter explores the crime of enforced disappearance and explains how the practice of forensic exhumation, in an international criminal justice context, re-emerged after a four decade long interval between the close of the Second World War and the growing movement against impunity that emerged in the <b>Southern</b> American <b>cone</b> in the 1980 s. Thus, Chapter III places the work of the ad hoc Tribunals, vis-Ã -vis forensic investigations, into a historical context. The fourth Chapter explores the dynamics of the forensic programme at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, whilst Chapter V examines the forensic programme operated on behalf of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. A further core question that arises in the study of mass grave exhumations is whether the practice of forensic exhumation of the graves of victims killed during armed conflict, for the purposes of criminal justice, can be viewed as problematic or undesirable in some circumstances. This issue explored in the final Section Chapter V, which examines the question of why forensic evidence was not relied upon more extensively at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystem {{invasion}} by non-native, nitrogen-fixing species {{is a global}} phenomenon with serious ecological consequences. However, in the Mediterranean basin few studies addressed the impact of {{invasion by}} nitrogen-fixing shrubs on soil quality and hydrological properties at local scale, and the possible effects on succession dynamics and ecosystem invasibility by further species. In this multidisciplinary study we investigated the impact of Genista aetnensis (Biv.) DC., an exotic nitrogen-fixing shrub, on the Vesuvius Grand <b>Cone</b> (<b>Southern</b> Italy). Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that the invasion of G. aetnensis has {{a significant impact on}} soil quality, soil hydrological regime, local microclimate and plant community structure, and that its impact increases during the plant ontogenetic cycle. We showed that G. aetnensis, in a relatively short time-span (i. e. ~ 40 years), has been able to build-up an island of fertility under its canopy, by accumulating considerable stocks of C, N, and P in the soil, and by also improving the soil hydrological properties. Moreover, G. aetnensis mitigates the daily range of soil temperature, reducing the exposure of coexisting plants to extremely high temperatures and water loss by soil evaporation, particularly during the growing season. Such amelioration of soil quality, coupled with the mitigation of below-canopy microclimatic conditions, has enhanced plant colonization of the barren Grand Cone slopes, by both herbaceous and woody species. These results suggest that the invasion of G. aetnensis could eventually drive to the spread of other, more resource-demanding exotic species, promoting alternative successional trajectories that may dramatically affect the local landscape. Our study is the first record of the invasion of G. aetnensis, an additional example of the regime shifts driven by N-fixing shrubs in Mediterranean region. Further studies are needed to identity specific management practices that can limit the spread and impacts of this species...|$|R

Thus my poor sketch, faint as its colors are, may acquire some little value in the reader's eyes from the consideration that no observer of the coming time will ever {{have an opportunity to}} give a better. I should find it difficult to believe, however, that the queer pastime just described, or any moral mischief to which that and other customs might pave the way, can have led to the overthrow of Greenwich Fair; for it has often seemed to me that Englishmen of station and respectability, unless of a peculiarly philanthropic turn, have neither any faith in the feminine purity of the lower orders of their countrywomen, nor the slightest value for it, allowing its possible existence.

40|$|Responsive load is {{the most}} underutilized {{reliability}} resource available to the power system today. It is currently not used at all to provide spinning reserve. Historically there were good reasons for this, but recent technological advances in communications and controls have provided new capabilities and eliminated {{many of the old}} obstacles. North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC), New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC), and New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) rules are beginning to recognize these changes and are starting to encourage responsive load provision of reliability services. The Carrier ComfortChoice responsive thermostats provide an example of these technological advances. This is a technology aimed at reducing summer peak demand through central control of residential and small commercial air-conditioning loads. It is being utilized by Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), Consolidated Edison (<b>ConEd),</b> <b>Southern</b> California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). The technology is capable of delivering even greater response in the faster spinning reserve time frame (while still providing peak reduction). Analysis of demand reduction testing results from LIPA during the summer of 2002 provides evidence to back up this claim. It also demonstrates that loads are different from generators and that the conventional wisdom, which advocates for starting with large loads as better ancillary service providers, is flawed. The tempting approach of incrementally adapting ancillary service requirements, which were established when generators were the only available resources, will not work. While it is easier for most generators to provide replacement power and non-spinning reserve (the slower response services) than it is to supply spinning reserve (the fastest service), the opposite is true for many loads. Also, there is more financial reward for supplying spinning reserve than for supplying the other reserve services {{as a result of the}} higher spinning reserve prices. The LIPAedge program (LIPA's demand reduction program using Carrier ComfortChoice thermostats) provides an opportunity to test the use of responsive load for spinning reserve. With potentially 75 MW of spinning reserve capability already installed, this test program can also make an important contribution to the capacity needs of Long Island during the summer of 2003. Testing could also be done at ConEd ({approx} 30 MW), SCE ({approx} 15 MW), and/or SDG&E ({approx} 15 MW). This paper is divided into six chapters. Chapter 2 discusses the contingency reserve ancillary services, their functions in supporting power system reliability, and their technical requirements. It also discusses the policy and tariff requirements and attempts to distinguish between ones that are genuinely necessary and ones that are artifacts of the technologies that were historically used to provide the services. Chapter 3 discusses how responsive load could provide contingency reserves (especially spinning reserve) for the power system. Chapter 4 specifically discusses the Carrier ComfortChoice responsive thermostat technology, the LIPAedge experience with that technology, and how the technology could be used to supply spinning reserve. Chapter 5 discusses a number of unresolved issues and suggests areas for further research. Chapter 6 offers conclusions and recommendations...|$|R
