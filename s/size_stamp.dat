40|$|The {{electron}} beam writer Tesla BS 600 {{works with a}} thermal-field electron emitter, fixed electron energy of 15 keV and a rectangular shaped variable-size {{electron beam}}. The size of the shaped beam (stamp) {{can be set from}} 50 to 6300 nm in standard mode and from 16 to 2100 nm in high-resolution mode. The basic increment of the <b>stamp</b> <b>size</b> is 50 nm, resp. 16 nm. Electron current density inhomogeneity and long-term instability in stamps can have negative impact on the exposure quality. Therefore, we focused on a study of the current time instability. The current density in variously <b>sized</b> <b>stamps</b> was measured by a picoammeter and a PIN diode video channel as a function of time. We analyzed short-term and long-term current instabilities using filtering techniques, as well as the Fourier analysis. Based on the results, we could be able to find reasons of the current instabilities and to propose improvements to achieve higher exposure quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In current study, {{molecular}} dynamics simulations are performed to investigate nanoimprint processes on single crystal aluminium thin films with silicon stamp. An EAM potential developed for aluminium is adopted {{to describe the}} Al-Al interaction in the aluminium thin film, and the Lennard-Jones potential is {{used to describe the}} Al-Si atomic interaction. Simulations show that dislocation events are the main plastic deformation mode of Al thin film in nanoimprint. It is found that <b>stamp</b> <b>size</b> and <b>stamp</b> shape have significant influence on the dislocation events and imprint forces during the nanoimprint processes.

50|$|The {{circular}} {{forms of}} wire gauge measurement devices {{are the most}} popular, and are generally 3¾ in. (95 mm) in diameter, with thirty-six notches; many have the decimal equivalents of the <b>sizes</b> <b>stamped</b> on the back. Oblong plates are similarly notched. Rolling mill gauges are also oblong in form. Many gauges are made with a wedge-like slot into which the wire is thrust; one edge being graduated, {{the point at which}} the movement of the wire is arrested gives its size. The graduations are those of standard wire, or in thousandths of an inch. In some cases both edges are graduated differently in order to allow comparison between two systems of measurement. A few gauges are made with holes into which the wire has to be thrust. All gauges are hardened and ground to dimensions.|$|R

5000|$|The David Plates are {{a set of}} nine silver plates, {{in three}} <b>sizes,</b> <b>stamped</b> between 613 and 630. The plates were created in Constantinople, each {{depicting}} {{a scene from the}} life of the Hebrew king David, and associated with the reign of Emperor Heraclius (610-641). [...] Following their discovery in Karavas (northern Cyprus) in 1902, the David Plates have been considered key additions to early Byzantine secular art. It is also noted that the David Plates were found amongst the Second Cyprus Treasure. Casual laborers from the village of Karavas found the David Plates as they were quarrying the ruins for construction stones. The finders, however, failed to report what they had discovered to the Cypriot authorities. When authorities learned of their taking they confiscated three of the David Plates alongside a pair of cross-monogram plates, and other jewelry held today in the Museum of Antiquities in Nicosia. The rest of the discovery was smuggled from Cyprus and traded to a dealer located in Paris. Most of this hoard was bought by J. Pierpont Morgan and was later given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City by his heirs in 1917, where they currently remain.|$|R
30|$|Analysis of the {{velocity}} behavior at the different distances from macrofracture zone {{shown that it}} is complex {{and it is difficult}} to define the deformation stage using interval velocity only. The above results show that in real rock mass the main deformations are localized within zone (named active zone), which is characterized by heightened velocity and geomechanic parameter variations. It could be supposed that integral characters of this zone have to reflect deformation process, which is not homogeneous within this zone. It was established using statistical analysis that the active zone sizes in rupture zone is 0.3 – 0.4  m (or 30 – 40 % of the <b>stamp</b> <b>size)</b> and in shear zone it is 0.5  m (or 50 % of the <b>stamp</b> <b>size).</b>|$|R
50|$|The PDMS stamp, in most applications, is a 10:1 {{ratio of}} {{silicone}} elastomer and a silicone elastomer curing agent.

40|$|Electromyography {{data were}} {{collected}} on three muscle groups of the arm while subjects performed a task with two-hand control buttons mounted at eye level and at waist level. It was found that EMG energy, an indicator of muscular effort expended, was 4. 7 times higher with the eye-level buttons for all three muscle groups. Ergonomic and safety engineering practices occasionally {{appear to be in}} conflict in the design of a safe and healthful workplace. Al-though the safety of the operator is of paramount importance, the design of an "ul-trasafe " workplace might require postures and motions that could have unfavorable long-term health consequences. For example, sheet metal fabrication requires a multitude of various <b>size</b> <b>stamping</b> and weld presses that must be equipped with guards or devices to assure operator safety. Some operations can be safeguarded with fixed barrier guards and slide feeds. However, as the metal-forming process continues through a press line, it becomes increasingly more difficult to design feed systems to assure proper place-ment of part to fixture. When operators must use their hands or a hand tool to orient parts directly on the dies, other means of safe-guarding must be employed.

40|$|We have {{successfully}} incorporated high surface area particles of titanate ion exchange materials (monosodium titanate and crystalline silicotitanate) with acceptable {{particle size distribution}} into porous and inert support membrane fibrils consisting of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon{reg_sign}), polyethylene and cellulose materials. The resulting membrane sheets, under laboratory conditions, were {{used to evaluate the}} removal of surrogate radioactive materials for cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 from high caustic nuclear waste simulants. These membrane supports met the nominal requirement for nonchemical interaction with the embedded ion exchange materials and were porous enough to allow sufficient liquid flow. Some of this 47 -mm <b>size</b> <b>stamped</b> out prototype titanium impregnated ion exchange membrane discs was found to remove more than 96 % of dissolved cesium- 133 and strontium- 88 from a caustic nuclear waste salt simulants. Since in traditional ion exchange based column technology monosodium titanate (MST) is known to have great affinity for the sorbing of other actinides like plutonium, neptunium and even uranium, we expect that the MST-based membranes developed here, although not directly evaluated for uptake of these three actinides because of costs associated with working with actinides which do not have 'true' experimental surrogates, would also show significant affinity for these actinides in aqueous media. It was also observed that crystalline silicotitanate impregnated polytetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene membranes became less selective and sorbed both cesium and strontium from the caustic aqueous salt simulants...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The present paper {{describes}} a knowledge-based system (KBS) developed for selection of progressivedie components to automate {{the design process}} of progressive dies in stamping industries. Design/methodology/approach: The production rule based KBS approach of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hasbeen utilized for constructing the proposed system. The system has been structured into seven KBS modules. Modules are user interactive and designed to be loaded in to the prompt area of AutoCAD. Findings: The output of system modules includes the type and proper dimensions of progressive die componentsnamely die block, die gages (front spacer and back gage), stripper, punches, punch plate, back plate, die-set andfasteners. The system has been designed {{in such a way}} that the expert advices imparted by its modules areautomatically stored in different output data files. These data files can be further utilized for automatic modelingof die components and die assembly. Research limitations/implications: Although the system is limited to the design of progressive dies only, yet itcan be extended further for the design of other types of dies also. Practical implications: The proposed system is ready for use in sheet metal industries for quick selection ofprogressive die components. The system can be implemented on a PC having AutoCAD software and thereforeits low cost of implementation makes it affordable by small and medium <b>sized</b> <b>stamping</b> industries. Originality/value: The proposed system is capable of accomplishing the time-consuming task of selection ofprogressive die components in a very short time period...|$|R
