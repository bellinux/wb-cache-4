25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel <b>steering</b> <b>tiller</b> but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E

50|$|The Duryea {{was used}} as the basis of the Davidson-Duryea car of 1898, which has the {{distinction}} of being the first American armored car. The car, which was photographed by the Chicago Tribune, was adapted from the commercial passenger model by installing a forward-firing M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun with armoured shield between the front wheel and <b>steering</b> <b>tiller,</b> operated by the front passenger, the conversion was devised by inventor Major (later Colonel) R.P. Davidson, of the Illinois National Guard, then commandant of the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy, Highland Park, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, European automakers, once {{steering}} wheels had replaced centrally positioned <b>steering</b> <b>tillers,</b> tended to place the driver and his steering wheel on the right side of the car regardless of local regulations or conventions concerning which side of the road cars should be driven. By the 1920s, as the number of motorized vehicles on the roads increased, clearer consensus had become necessary in the more populous parts of Italy about the need for everyone to drive along the right side of the road. The 1927 Fiat 520 was one of the first cars, presumably in recognition of this trend, to place the steering wheel on the left side of the car.|$|R
50|$|On December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami {{veered off}} the runway during takeoff in a {{snowstorm}} resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage {{and had to be}} written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel <b>steering</b> <b>tiller</b> inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.|$|E
50|$|Assistive {{and small}} sit-down {{electric}} mobility scooters provide important advantages {{to people with}} mobility problems throughout the world. A scooter is useful for persons without the stamina or arm/shoulder flexibility necessary to use a manual wheelchair. Also, swiveling the seat of an electric scooter is generally easier than moving the foot supports on most conventional wheelchairs. A mobility scooter is very helpful for persons with systemic or whole-body disabling conditions (coronary or lung issues, some forms of arthritis, obesity, etc.) who are still able to stand and walk a few steps, sit upright without torso support, and control the <b>steering</b> <b>tiller.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{the first}} officer began the takeoff on runway 31, the {{airplane}} started to drift to the left. The captain attempted to correct that drift {{with the use of}} the nosewheel tiller. Moments later, they heard a [...] "bang" [...] and then a rumbling noise. The bang was most likely due to the nose tire flying off its rim, after being damaged by the captain's improper use of the nosewheel <b>steering</b> <b>tiller.</b> The captain took over control from {{the first officer}} and aborted the takeoff, but he was unable to stop the plane before it ran off the end of the runway into Bowery Bay.|$|E
50|$|On earlier models <b>tiller</b> <b>steering</b> was {{standard}} with {{wheel steering}} optional, but wheel steering later became standard.|$|R

50|$|Another {{successful}} {{product line}} were the battery-electric factory flat trucks, small vehicles designed for transporting goods inside factories, where the exhaust fumes {{of an internal}} combustion engine could not be tolerated. The truck consisted of a flat load bed, with a battery box and wheels underneath. One set of wheels was driven, and the other steered, with the motor positioned between them. The prop-shaft went {{down the middle of}} the two battery boxes to the driven wheels. At the steered end was a driver's platform, with a <b>steering</b> <b>tiller</b> (like a narrowboat) and controller, with foot pedal operating brake and on/off switch. A 3/4 ton example can be found on the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Railway.|$|E

50|$|RAMI {{models were}} made of diecast zamac metal alloy - only wheels and tires were plastic (Rixon 2005, p. 72). Some early models, like the Marne Taxi are made in diecast halves joining {{down the middle of}} the car - this faux pas was avoided on most other models. Seats and thin fenders were diecast metal on R.A.M.I. models, which is a bit rare as many diecast {{manufacturers}} of early brass era vehicles (like French Minialuxe) often use plastic. Plastic is easier to work with for 'spidery' parts such as wheel spokes, thin fenders, <b>steering</b> <b>tillers,</b> and long gearshift and brake levers (Sinclair 1979, p. 391). Occasionally, a dab of glue can be spied at the base of a lever or a tiller (Rixon 2005, p. 72). RAMI tops, even those purportedly of cloth were diecast in metal as well. Thus models were heavy, especially if one was used to handling plastic Minialuxe vehicles (Gibson 1971, 23).|$|R
50|$|One of Canada's first {{automobiles}} was manufactured at Hopewell, Nova Scotia in 1898, named 'The Victorian'. The {{car was a}} two passenger buggy {{with iron}} tires, chain drive, and <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Hobbie Accessible was an American {{automobile}} {{manufactured in}} Hampton, Iowa from 1908 until 1909. One of many High wheeler cars produced at the time, it featured a twin-cylinder air-cooled engine, <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> and solid tires.|$|R
50|$|Atari, Inc.'s '1978 coin-op Fire Truck {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be the first arcade coin-op to feature co-op play. As its title suggests the game involves a large fire truck, and in two-player mode both players are required to cooperatively steer the vehicle along a winding road, with one driving and steering the tractor of the truck and the other <b>steering</b> the <b>tiller</b> for the rear wheels, controlling the swing of the trailer.|$|R
50|$|Some vehicle {{were driven}} by a driver riding or {{standing}} on-board with direct <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> others were pedestrian controlled by walking alongside. All were highly manoeuvrable, the full swivel of the self-contained engine unit allowing them to turn within their own length.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{they built}} {{was a small}} vehicle with a water-cooled, single-cylinder engine of own {{development}} that delivered [...] This engine was sold to other manufacturers, too. Buyers could choose from three models, all prized at US$750, with a wheelbase of 52 in., and with <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Hudson was an {{automobile}} built in Hudson, Michigan by the Bean-Chamberlain Manufacturing Company from 1901-02. It had no {{relationship to the}} Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan. The Hudson was a light steamer, with a vertical two-cylinder engine, single chain drive, and <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{this system}} seems {{confusing}} and contradictory today, to generations of sailors trained on sailing vessels with <b>tiller</b> <b>steering</b> it seemed perfectly logical and was understood by all seafarers. Only when new generations of sailors trained on ships with wheel-and-tiller steering {{came into the}} industry was the system replaced.|$|R
50|$|The motor {{was mounted}} {{directly}} to the frame and drove the rear wheels through gears. Electric braking was allowed, and both hand- and foot-brakes operated on rear wheel drums. Four forward speeds were available, and the vehicle could accelerate to 28 km/h (17.4 mph). <b>Steering</b> was by <b>tiller.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} model evolved in 1898; {{it was a}} gasoline-fuel buggy-style automobile with a one-cylinder engine (horizontal under the floor), <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> wire wheels, planetary transmission, and chain drive. In the same year, F. B. Stearns & Company was organized with his partners, brothers Raymond M. and Ralph L. Owen.|$|R
50|$|Puckridge {{took the}} three-wheeler apart {{and built a}} four-wheel vehicle, using the {{original}} 2.75 hp single cylinder De Dion engine. He added a two-speed belt-drive transmission, <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> gas lighting, and fan cooling. An unusual feature was the starter system, which involved pulling a chain {{through a hole in}} the floorboards to rotate the engine.|$|R
50|$|Lottie Blossom II {{followed}} {{early the}} next year, using the same design of hull, but with aft cockpit and <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b> They had two very happy seasons in her, sailing her comfortably on their own, including two voyages to Cherbourg. The second voyage, in 1954, {{at the age of}} 70, was to be Ransome’s last long passage.|$|R
50|$|The winning 8 hp Panhard et Levassor of Mayade {{had been}} {{extensively}} upgraded for 1896, using their first four-cylinder engine, doubling the horsepower from the 1895 model. It {{was equipped with}} <b>tiller</b> <b>steering</b> and candle lamps. The brakes were a spoon-lever pressing on the solid rubber back tyre plus a belt that tightened onto a drum on the transmission.|$|R
5000|$|In 1900 Gurley {{launched}} a two-seater buggy with a single-cylinder engine, tubular frame, bicycle wheels and <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> which Gurley built in his bicycle shop. Gurley {{thought that he}} could make a profit by selling them at $600, but had to raise the price to $1,000. Very few were made and Gurley ended manufacture in 1901.|$|R
5000|$|The McIntyre Company {{started as}} the W. H. Kiblinger Company in 1887, {{manufacturing}} buggies. After W. H. Kiblinger's death in 1894, William H. McIntyre purchased {{the company and}} began experimenting with automobiles as early as 1897. In 1906 they began selling high-wheelers with <b>tiller</b> <b>steering</b> and one-cylinder engines under the Kiblinger name. Prices were as low as $250.|$|R
5000|$|... “The SKUD 18 is very {{versatile}} {{and can be}} handled {{by a variety of}} crew configurations. The helmsperson can transfer manually and be <b>steering</b> with <b>tillers,</b> or be in a fixed seat on the centreline using a manual joystick, push/pull rods, or a servo assist joystick with full control of all functions. The forward crew can either be seated on the centreline, transferring manually, or on trapeze. As the name reflects, the SKUD 18 is a SKiff of Universal Design and can be sailed for fun or serous competition by people of all levels of physical ability.” - Chris Mitchell, designer of a range of accessible sailcraft ...|$|R
50|$|In 1901, in Camden, New Jersey, the Automobile and Marine Power Company {{decided to}} move from just {{producing}} engines to building whole cars. Their cars were basic, with the engine underneath the seat, <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> and a side crank. Base price was $700, but with options the price was raised to $850. Just one year later, the car ceased production.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{equipped}} with a double opposed under the hood 2-cylinder engine of 101 cubic inches that developed 10-horsepower. It was capable of a maximum speed of 25 mi/h km/h. Final drive was a direct shaft drive with a transmission of two speeds forward and reverse. Other features included <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> artillery wheels, brass lamps and 3 in-wide [...] "clincher" [...] tires.|$|R
50|$|The American Juvenile Electric {{was a car}} made by the American Metal Wheel & Auto Co of Toledo, Ohio, in 1907. Its {{wheelbase}} was a mere 3 ft, but {{was complete}} with ‘lights, bells, etc.’ and had <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b> Its top speed was 10 mph (16 km/h). It was very expensive; selling for $800. People still preferred to use mules instead of this car.|$|R
50|$|Between 1899 and 1902, two {{prototype}} {{vehicles were}} built in Detroit, Michigan by Walter Lorenzo Marr. Some documentation exists of the 1901 or 1902 prototype with <b>tiller</b> <b>steering</b> similar to the Oldsmobile Curved Dash.In mid-1904, another prototype was constructed for an endurance run, which convinced James H. Whiting to authorize production of the first models offered to the public. The architecture of this prototype {{was the basis for}} the Model B.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 Autocar was {{equipped}} with a tonneau, it could seat 4 passengers and sold for US$1700. The horizontal-mounted flat twin engine, situated {{at the front of}} the car, produced 11 hp (8.2 kW). This was a somewhat unusual engine design for the time, with most companies producing inline designs. A 3-speed transmission was fitted. The steel and wood-framed car weighed 1675 lb (760 kg). The early cars had <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
