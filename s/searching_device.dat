It {{was created}} {{as a type of}} <b>searching</b> <b>device</b> similar to Archie but for Gopher files. Another Gopher search service, called Jughead, appeared a little later, probably {{for the sole purpose of}} rounding out the comic-strip triumvirate. Jughead is an acronym for Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation and Display, although, like Veronica, it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym. Jughead's functionality was pretty much identical to Veronica's, although it appears to be a little rougher around the edges.|$|E
