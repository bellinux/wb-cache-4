As part of the improvement of the bending angle forward operator at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), additional quality controls aimed to detect and reject observations that might have been affected by <b>super-refraction</b> conditions have been implemented and tested. The updated quality control procedures also address the situation where the model detects atmospheric <b>super-refraction</b> conditions.

40|$|Abstract—The {{availability}} of fixed radio links, especially at latitudes below 40 degrees, can be severely affected by sub-refractive events that {{may only be}} present {{for an hour or}} two each year, or around the 99. 98 % point of the refractivity gradient distribution. This tail point is beyond the highest per-centile currently available from world-wide meteorological model predictions. In many countries radiosonde data is too sparsely distributed for useful accuracy, so a more densely distributed data source is required. This suggests the use of surface meteorological data, which is generally available from many automatic weather stations at good time resolution. This paper reviews empirical models for surface refractivity gradient cumulative distribution that use surface meteorological data, and presents a new model, which uses a new variable, surface refractivity anomaly.

3000|$|In this connection, it is {{interesting}} to consider that the detection footprints of the various techniques may have a counterintuitive trend—that higher-altitude surveys may sample a smaller area. Specifically, the extremely low frequency (ELF) (~[*] 100  Hz) whistler-mode electromagnetic detections from orbit sample only an area connected to the spacecraft by appropriate ionospheric and magnetic field conditions and so may sense a range of only a couple of hundred kilometers from the subspacecraft point. However, very low frequency (VLF) (10 – 80  kHz) measurements by descent probes at low altitude may detect discharges at ranges of thousands of kilometers, due to ducted propagation by <b>super-refraction</b> in the lower atmosphere (Croft 1983) and/or by “skybounce”—reflection from the ionosphere (e.g., Simões et al. 2008)—see also discussion in Ksanfomality et al.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a further {{investigation of the}} capabilities of the satellite radio-occultation system for monitoring of the Earth's atmosphere (started at Report No. 119). Refractometric sounding of the Earth's atmosphere using a multi-orbit satellite system close to real GPS-LEO satellite system is simulated using data from the ECHAM 3 (T 106) model. The direct model of the refraction measurements and its linearization, which are necessary for assimilation of refractometric data, are formulated. Computational simulations of pressure and temperature retrieval from the refractometric data, including usage of the ''first guess'' of the meteorological fields, are performed. A method of retrieval of the tropospheric humidity from the radio-occultation data, using the T 106 model fields is considered. The problems of processing of the satellite phase observation data, and ionospheric correction is also discussed. A special attention is dedicated to investigation of the residual ionospheric errors and to methods of their reduction.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Marginal Ice Zone Experiment (MIZEX- 83) {{conducted in the}} Arctic {{during the summer of}} 1983 is summarized and the mesoscale features and atmospheric refraction conditions described. The three case studies examined are: warm air advection over dense pack ice causing strong elevated ducting and subrefraction, cold air advection over relatively open water causing shallow convection and normal refraction condi­tions, large scale subsidence in the western quadrants of an anticyclone leading to <b>super-refraction</b> and weak ducting. Developing synoptic scale cyclones adjacent to the MIZEX- 83 area often determined the airflow over the region. The observed large horizontal SST gradients were the dominant forcing mechanisms on surface layer stability. Trapping layers associated with subsidence inversions can be located on satellite imagery by assuming that stratiform clouds form immediately below the inversion. Uniform cloud and refraction layers were not common during MIZEX- 83 due to strong mesoscale variability. Factors affecting inversion height include subsidence and entrainment mixing. Bulk Richardson number values for locations over the open water and pack ice show significant variability in stability conditions across the MIZ. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

COSMIC-retrieved atmospheric wet profiles from 2014 to 2015 are compared to the contemporaneous radiosonde profiles from 120 stations, and the vertical mean differences are used. The results show that the vertical mean biases of temperature, pressure and vapor pressure are − 0. 10 K, 0. 69 hPa and − 0. 01 hPa, respectively, and that for refractivity is 0. 17 N. Moreover, the temperature differences are positively correlated with station altitude, yet both the pressure and vapor pressure differences are negatively correlated with station latitude, as is the refractivity difference. The large temperature difference arising from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) region may be associated with the complex topography of the area and the limitations in the background model used in the COSMIC profile retrieval. Furthermore, negative refractivity bias between COSMIC and radiosonde data occurs below 5 km and is large in wet southern China, with a value of less than 1 %. This result may be related to more humid conditions and <b>super-refraction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} signal propagation studies for {{wireless sensor network}} planning in aquaculture environment for water quality and changes in water characteristics monitoring. Some water pollutants can cause widespread damage to marine life within {{a very short time}} period and thus wireless sensor network reliability is more critical than in crop farming. This paper shows that network coverage models and assumptions over land do not readily apply in tropical aquaculture environment where high temperatures are experienced during the day. More specifically, due to high humidity caused by evaporation, network coverage at 15 cm antenna height is better than at 5 m antenna heights due to the presence of a <b>super-refraction</b> (ducting) layer. For a 69 m link, the difference between the signal strength measured over several days is more than 7 dBm except under anomaly conditions. In this environment, the two-ray model has been found to provide high accuracy for signal propagation over water where there are no objects in close proximity to the propagation path. However, with vegetation in close proximity, accurate signal variation predication must consider contributions from scattered and diffused components, taking into account frequency selective fading characteristics to represent the temporal and spatial signal variations...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} anomalous, over-sea {{propagation}} have been either focused on single links employing space/antenna diversity or on point-to-multipoint links, usually involving single frequency. Measurements on two co-linear, trans-horizon paths (50 km and 140 km long) over the English Channel {{have been made}} over periods in excess of a year in order to investigate the propagation characteristics of VHF and UHF signals propagating over the sea. The setup comprises a transmitter located on Jersey and receivers on Alderney and Portland. Signal strengths, meteorological factors within the lowest 1 km {{as well as their}} mutual relationships have been studied. Signal strength enhancements have been observed on both paths, primarily in the late afternoon and evening periods, {{in the spring and summer}} months. These enhancements occur for different percentages of time between 12 % and 21 %. It was observed that the enhancements at both receiving sites and both frequencies may/may not be concurrent, leading to a probability of interference. The values of median lapse rate of refractivity in lowest 1 km of atmosphere, effective earth radius factor and surface refractivity significantly less than those used by ITU have been observed. Refractivity gradients indicative of <b>super-refraction</b> and ducting are observed between heights of 52 m and 84 m for considerable amounts of time. Different current propagation models have been used to predict the median propagation loss values, which do not always clearly point out the dominant propagation mechanisms. This study has made available further results regarding enhanced signal strength events, has improved the values of some critical parameters linked to tropospheric propagation and has identified certain trends relating weather to signal level enhancements.

40|$|Three {{long-range}} 2 GHz radio paths {{have been}} established in the British Channel Islands in order to investigate the characteristics of long-range propagation of UHF radio waves over the sea {{as part of a}} project supported by Ofcom, UK. The relationship between specific over-sea propagation mechanisms (such as evaporation ducting and <b>super-refraction)</b> in the lower troposphere and signal strength distribution patterns has been examined, modelled and correlated with meteorological parameters. A number of radio meteorological statistics specifically related to evaporation duct propagation in a temperate region such as the English Channel has been presented to confirm the capability of this key propagation mechanism to guide radio waves to distances well beyond the normal radio horizon. Evaporation ducting and diffraction appear to be the dominant propagation mechanisms at most times. Signal strength enhancements have been observed on all three radio paths, primarily in the late afternoon and evening periods, {{in the spring and summer}} months. During periods of enhanced propagation, which occur approximately 8 % of the time of a 50 km path, the presence of additional higher-level ducting/super-refractive structures has been verified and their influence has been modelled with reasonable success. Additionally, the statistical variation of bulk meteorological parameters in the context of enhanced signal propagation has also been examined. The relatively long-term observations made during this study confirm the fact that the constantly changing weather patterns in the troposphere (e. g. the occurrence of anticyclonic weather) are directly responsible for the occurrence of enhanced signals at certain periods of time. The various issues under investigation are of direct relevance in the planning of radio communication systems operating in the UHF band (e. g. GSM and UMTS) in marine and coastal regions...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} carried out to {{classify}} possible combinations of refractivity conditions for RF and IR {{over a wide range}} of meteorological conditions using different micrometeorological bulk models. The calculated refractivity profiles are analyzed for evaporation duct height (EDH), mainly relevant for RF propagation, and for gradients of the modified refractivity at different heights, relevant for both RF and IR propagation. These refractivity gradients are a direct indicator for the occurrence of sub- or super refraction at the height of interest. The present study reveals that under humid and unstable conditions evaporation ducts are found at approximately 3 ± 2 m above cold (5 °C) waters and at approximately 8 ± 5 m over warm waters (25 °C). Under dry conditions, these duct heights are approximately 9 ± 5 m and 20 ± 10 m, respectively. Duct heights decrease with increasing wind speed. Under humid and near-neutral conditions, duct heights range from 1 to 25 m, and decrease with increasing air temperature and/or wind speed. On the other hand, for dry and near-neutral conditions, and also for neutral conditions, the duct height is not well defined. Values between 1 m and 100 m are found, with an irregular dependence on air temperature and wind speed. Reliable modeling of duct height under these conditions remains questionable {{due to a lack of}} vertical mixing in the surface layer. The paper also shows that all four combinations of RF and IR sub- and <b>super-refraction</b> can occur in the atmosphere. The occurrence of a specific combination depends predominantly on temperature and humidity, and to a relatively minor part on wind speed. The magnitude of refraction effects in the two spectral bands is not necessarily coupled but varies with environmental conditions and height. Sub-sub refraction is generally weak and occurs under neutral conditions or at large heights. Super-super refraction occurs under warm and dry conditions and can reach medium strengths. RF-super refraction in combination with IR-sub refraction occurs under strong unstable conditions (e. g., surface temperature higher than air temperature) and can reach medium strengths. RF-sub refraction in combination with IR-super refraction occurs under stable and warm conditions. The magnitude of refraction can be very large, especially at low altitude...|$|E
40|$|The marine {{boundary}} layer (MBL) is {{the region where}} energy, momentum and masses are exchanged between the ocean surface and the free troposphere. The lack of observations with high vertical resolution over the ocean significantly restricts {{the understanding of the}} complex physical processes that occur inside the MBL. The relatively short vertical extent of the MBL (average about 1 ~ 2 km) and the frequent cloudiness at its top make probing the MBL extremely difficult from the space. Several features of the Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) technique suggest that it has a great potential for sensing the MBL. These features include global coverage, high vertical resolution, and the ability of GPS signals to penetrate clouds. Over moist marine areas, a large negative moisture gradient often exists across the thermal inversion capping the MBL, which can cause <b>super-refraction</b> (SR) or ducting. A large number of high-resolution soundings have shown that SR occurs about 90 % of the time in a year over the subtropical and tropical oceans and even 50 % at high-latitudes during the summer. In the presence of SR, the reconstruction of refractivity from RO data becomes an ill-posed inverse problem, i. e., a given RO bending angle profile is consistent with a continuum (an infinite number) of refractivity profiles. The standard Abel retrieval gives the minimum refractivity solution of the continuum and thus produces the largest negative bias, consistent with a negative bias that is often present in the retrieved refractivity profiles in the moist lower troposphere. Simulation studies indicate a large variation of the negative refractivity biases (could be over - 15 %). The impact of diffraction effects and the open-loop receiver tracking on the bending angle and refractivity retrievals are assessed. A novel approach is developed and tested to reconstruct the vertical refractivity structure within and below the SR layer, which yields a much-improved retrieval, especially below the SR layer (less than 0. 5 % error). Such a reconstruction method should greatly enhance our ability to measure the MBL globally using the GPS RO technique as well as to improve the MBL parameterizations used in weather and climate models...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{refraction}} {{tends to}} occur {{frequently in the}} atmospheric boundary layer. Due to a gradient in the temperature as function of height, rays are bending down towards the earth (<b>super-refraction),</b> or up towards to the sky (sub-refraction). As a consequence, images of targets at long range may be distorted and mirages may occur, while the maximum detection range may be affected. In addition the irradiance, received from a point target at a sensor pupil, may increase or decrease due to atmospheric focusing effects. Sub-refraction tends to occur more frequently over sea-paths, as the air is normally cooler than the water. Currently available propagation models, like IRBLEM [1] and EOSTAR [2] adequately describe the mentioned effects for this condition. However sparse data are available for model validation in super-refractive conditions, when the air is warmer than the water. For this reason, the SAPPHIRE trial, (Ship and Atmospheric Propagation Phenomena Infrared Experiment), was organized in the Chesapeake Bay near Washington DC by NATO Task Group TG 51 in June 2006. At this location and {{in this time of}} the year, the probability for having positive ASTD (Air to Sea Temperature Difference) conditions is high. In the bay a buoy was positioned, on which a set of precision temperature sensors was mounted. They provided as well ASTD values as temperature gradients at a height of 3. 7 m. By means of a geodetic theodolite, absolute AOA's (Angle Of Arrival) were measured for a set of lights at various altitudes, located {{on the other side of}} the bay at a distance of 16. 2 km. The buoy was located at about mid-path position. Positive ASTD conditions did occur on a number of days allowing validation of the values of the AOA, predicted by the models, based upon the meteorological data, simultaneously collected at the buoy. It was found, that the temperature profile, generated by the bulk model for the marine surface layer [3] is incorrect, resulting in deviations in the AOA, compared to the data from the theodolite. A set of empirical temperature profiles has been created, using the ASTD and the gradient in the temperature as function of height as input. One of them provides of predicted AOA values, which fit well with the measurements during the trials period. Errors in the prediction are resulting from the variability of the meteorological conditions, causing inhomogeneities along the path. Furthermore the measurement accuracy was limited due to image blur by atmospheric turbulence in a number of occasions...|$|E
