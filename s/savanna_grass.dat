40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of African tropical grassland history {{during the late}} Holocene {{can be carried out}} using phytolith analysis. Fossil phytolith assemblages from Lake Guiers, in the Sahelian region of Senegal, and from Lake Sinnda, in the Guineo-Congolian region of Congo were investigated. The results are interpreted on the basis of modern phytolith assemblages from the same regions and compared to pollen data previously obtained. Tall or short grass associations are discriminated by their phytolith index Iph(%) = saddle/(cross+dumbel+saddle), while the density of shrubs and trees is indicated by relative proportions of the dicotyledon phytoliths. The phytolith data emphasize that, in the Guineo-Congolian region around Lake Sinnda, the driest phase of the late Holocene occurred between 4000 and 1200 yr B. P., commencing {{with the opening of the}} dense forest and its replacement by a short <b>grass</b> <b>savanna.</b> From ca. 1000 yr B.

50|$|Since the 1970s, cattle pasture {{has been}} {{the leading cause of}} {{deforestation}} in the Brazilian Amazon. Land is often cleared for investment purposes due to pastureland prices exceeding forest land prices. In this case, large amounts of forest are torn down and replaced with <b>savanna</b> <b>grasses</b> for cattle feeding. This situation is continually becoming worse as Brazil grows as a producer of beef. Poor farmers are encouraged to settle on rainforest lands by government land policies in Brazil. The process of clearing land includes removing the understory shrubbery and then cutting down the trees. After the area has been left to dry for a few months, the rest is burned. Once the land is cleared, {{it can be used to}} plant crops. However, the productivity of the soil declines after a year or two of farming. When this occurs, farmers clear new forest for more short-term agricultural land.|$|R

40|$|Environmental factors {{influencing}} grass establishment {{and performance in}} tropical savannas are poorly understood, particularly in relation to disturbance. We describe a seed sowing experiment that {{examined the effects of}} fire regime, canopy cover and litter cover on the emergence, establishment, height and fecundity (seed production) of the regionally dominant annual grass Sorghum intrans in northern Australia. Establishment was significantly lower under the woody canopy compared with canopy gaps, and where seeds were sown on a layer of litter compared with bare soil. However, variation in fire regime had no significant effect on establishment or seed production. Additionally, a shade-house experiment was conducted to test the effects of litter on seedling emergence of S. intrans and six other grass species representative of the local flora (Pseudopogonatherum contortum, Sorghum plumosum, Chrysopogon latifolius, Eriachne triseta, Heteropogon triticeus and Alloteropsis semialata). All species showed reduced emergence when sown either above or below litter, compared with bare soil. Our results demonstrate the importance of the overstorey as a determinant of S. intrans abundance and <b>savanna</b> <b>grass</b> composition more generally, through its effect on establishment. The aversion of savanna grasses to litter (and S. intrans to canopy shading) supports the notion of savanna species being highly adapted to disturbance...|$|E
50|$|At Shum Laka, over 1,000 ceramic sherds, nearly 500,000 {{pieces of}} lithic materials, and 18 human skeletons were {{recovered}}. Radiocarbon dating {{of the bone}} and plant remains recovered demonstrated multiple occupations spanning from 30,000 BP to around 400 BP. Bone preservation from the early occupations is poor, {{with only a few}} surviving faunal remains and no bone tools. Later occupations depict common exploitation of medium-sized fauna from the forest. These remains include those from several gorillas and chimpanzees, and various artiodactyla. Based upon the small amounts of materials found in individual strata, it is proposed that the site was occupied for numerous short periods of time. Macrobotanical remains recovered included both <b>savanna</b> <b>grasses</b> and forest trees. These indicate that for a period of occupation during the Holocene, Shum Laka was located within an ecotone. Ceramic assemblages recovered from the site date from 7000 BP onward and are indicative of continued longer occupation by semi-agricultural populations.

Heavily grazed communal land was compared with a lightly grazed area and a mowed airstrip, in adjacent protected land, in the Mpumalanga lowveld, South Africa. Plant species composition, height, aerial cover and greenness of grass in the herbaceous stratum were measured in representative sites. Total grasshopper abundance and relative abundance of grasshopper species were also assessed in each site. Grasshoppers were assigned to feeding and habitat functional groups for comparison among the three areas. The heavily grazed area, characterised by short vegetation and low aerial cover, high greenness of grass, and high frequency of forbs, was inhabited by grasshopper species associated with bare ground or short and/or sparse grass, that were non-graminivorous or soft grass feeders. The lightly grazed area, characterised by tall vegetation and high aerial cover, low greenness of grass, and low frequency of forbs, was inhabited by grasshopper species associated with long and/or thick grass, that were mixed feeders or tough grass feeders. The mowed area, characterised by short vegetation and low aerial cover, low greenness of grass, and low frequency of forbs, exhibited lower grasshopper abundance, species richness, and diversity than either of the grazed areas...|$|E

We also sought to ascertain the key wavelengths for phosphorus prediction using hyperspectral remote sensing. The remote sensing of foliar phosphorus has received very little attention as compared to nitrogen, yet it plays an equally important role in explaining the distribution and feeding patterns of herbivores. Band depths from two continuum-removed absorption features {{as well as the}} red edge position (REP) were input into a backpropagation neural network. Following a series of experiments to ascertain the optimum wavelengths, the best trained neural network was used to predict and ultimately to map grass phosphorus concentration in the Kruger National Park. The results indicate that the best trained neural network could predict phosphorus distribution with a coefficient of determination of 0. 63 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0. 07 (28 % of the mean observed phosphorus concentration) on an independent test data set. Our results also show that the absorption feature located in the shortwave infrared (R 2015 - 2199) contains more information on phosphorus distribution, a region that has hardly been explored before in most spectroscopic experiments for phosphorus as compared to the visible bands. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of imaging spectroscopy in mapping grass phosphorus concentration in savanna rangelands...|$|E
40|$|Savannas {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} biomes of the world and are subject to intense pressures due to large human populations using this ecosystem, even though it is characterized by low crop yields and poor nutritional quality of natural pastures. Conversion to agriculture and fragmentation of Neotropical savannas, and increasing population pressures are promoting the extent and use of anthropogenic fire. In this paper we develop a mathematical model to account for spatial dynamics of the <b>savanna</b> <b>grass</b> community. This model is based on a matrix model of growth of three dominant grasses of the Neotropical savanna (Elyonurus adustus, Leptocoryphium lanatum and Andropogon semiberbis). The model integrates plant architecture and competition to simulate the dynamics of this system. Our model focuses on fire as an essential event in the dynamics of the savanna community, especially frequency of occurrence. We study the current frequency of one fire a year and how changes in fire frequency tend to destabilize the system. The phenology of the species is a key point to understand the behaviour of these species on relation to fire. Late growth species (i. e. A. semiberbis) are more adapted to the current frequency than early ones, showing a higher competitive ability. Our results suggest that if there is a change of the actual fire frequency this system could undergo a decrease of phenological and plant form diversity...|$|E
