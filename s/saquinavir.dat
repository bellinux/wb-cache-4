2500|$|A {{metallic}} taste may {{be caused}} by food and drink, certain medicines or amalgam dental fillings. It is generally considered an off flavor when present in food and drink. A metallic taste {{may be caused}} by galvanic reactions in the mouth. In the case where it is caused by dental work, the dissimilar metals used may produce a measurable current. Some artificial sweeteners are perceived to have a metallic taste, which is detected by the TRPV1 receptors. [...] Blood is considered by many people to have a metallic taste. A metallic taste in the mouth is also a symptom of various medical conditions, in which case it may be classified under the symptoms dysgeusia or parageusia, referring to distortions of the sense of taste, and can be caused by various kinds of medication, including <b>saquinavir</b> and zonisamide, and occupational hazards, such as working with pesticides.|$|E
50|$|In the clinic, it {{was found}} that the oral {{bioavailability}} of <b>saquinavir</b> in both formulations significantly increases when patients also receive the PI ritonavir. For patients, this has the major benefit that they can take less <b>saquinavir,</b> while maintaining sufficient <b>saquinavir</b> blood plasma levels to efficiently suppress the replication of HIV.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saquinavir</b> is a {{protease}} inhibitor. Proteases are {{enzymes that}} cleave protein molecules into smaller fragments. HIV protease {{is vital for}} both viral replication within the cell and release of mature viral particles from an infected cell. <b>Saquinavir</b> binds to the active site of the viral protease and prevents cleavage of viral polyproteins, preventing maturation of the virus. <b>Saquinavir</b> inhibits both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases.|$|E

50|$|The first HIV {{protease}} inhibitor, <b>saquinavir,</b> is a peptidomimetic hydroxyethylamine and was marketed in 1995. It is {{a transition}} state analogue {{of a native}} substrate of the protease. The observation that HIV-1 protease cleaves the sequences containing the dipeptides Tyr-Pro or Phe-Pro was the basic design criterion. Addition of the decahydroisoquinoline (DIQ) group {{was one of the}} most significant modifications that led to the discovery of <b>saquinavir.</b> This substituent improves aqueous solubility and potency by limiting the conformational freedom of the inhibitor. <b>Saquinavir</b> is effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and is usually well tolerated but high serum concentration is not achieved.|$|E
50|$|In <b>saquinavir</b> synthesis, the half-acid is {{resolved}} as its salt with l-ephedrine.|$|E
50|$|Though the {{difference}} between OX1001 and <b>saquinavir</b> lies {{in the presence of}} a nitrate ester, it is not clear how exactly this modification directly affects the function of the drug. It can be hypothesized that the presence of the nitrate ester plays a role in inhibiting the activity of cytochrome P450, which is an enzyme that normally deactivates <b>saquinavir.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{behind this}} welcome observation was not directly known, but {{later it was}} determined that ritonavir inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme. Normally, this enzyme metabolizes <b>saquinavir</b> to an inactive form, but with the ritonavir inhibiting this enzyme, the <b>saquinavir</b> blood plasma levels increased considerably. Additionally, ritonavir also inhibits multidrug transporters, although to a much lower extent.|$|E
5000|$|The drugs <b>saquinavir,</b> ritonavir, and {{lopinavir}} {{have been}} found to have anti-malarial properties.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{protease}} inhibitors, {{the absorption}} of <b>saquinavir</b> seems to be improved by omeprazole.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from having}} {{superior}} anti-tumor properties, OX1001 {{also has a}} much lower toxicity profile than <b>saquinavir.</b> In one experiment, {{it was determined that}} at a dose where <b>Saquinavir</b> produced 100% toxicity, OX1001 showed no signs of inducing any toxicity. This might be due to the drug’s ability to produce a powerful, yet short-lived stimulus to normal cells’ Akt signaling pathways which protects them.|$|E

50|$|The most {{frequent}} adverse events with <b>saquinavir</b> in either formulation are mild gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, loose stools & abdominal discomfort. Invirase is better tolerated than Fortovase.|$|E
5000|$|Until 2013, censavudine {{has been}} known as festinavir, but the name was changed to avoid {{confusion}} with HIV protease inhibitors which all bear class suffix [...] "-navir" [...] (e.g. tipranavir, lopinavir, <b>saquinavir</b> etc.).|$|E
50|$|<b>Saquinavir,</b> in the Invirase formulation, {{has a low}} and {{variable}} oral bioavailability, when given alone. The Fortovase formulation at the standard dosage delivers approximately eightfold more active drug than Invirase, also at the standard dosage.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of first-generation clinical inhibitors {{was founded on}} creating more protease-ligand interactions through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The first HIV protease inhibitor approved by the FDA was <b>saquinavir,</b> {{which was designed to}} target wild-type HIV-1 protease. However, this inhibitor is no longer effective due to resistance-causing mutations on the HIV-1 protease structure. The HIV genome has high plasticity, so has been able to become resistant to multiple HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Since <b>saquinavir,</b> the FDA has approved several PIs, including darunavir. Darunavir was granted approval by the FDA on June 23, 2006, {{and is one of the}} most recently developed protease inhibitors approved for treatment of HIV.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Saquinavir</b> was {{developed}} by the pharmaceutical company Roche. <b>Saquinavir</b> was the first protease inhibitor (and sixth antiretroviral) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Within 2 years of its approval, and that of ritonavir 4 months later, annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000. The manufacturer, Roche, requested and received approval of Invirase via the FDA's [...] "Accelerated Approval" [...] program, a process designed to speed drugs to market for the treatment of serious diseases. This decision was controversial, amid disagreement between AIDS activists over the benefits of thorough testing versus early access to new drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saquinavir</b> {{was first}} sold in 1995. As of 2015 {{it is not}} {{available}} as a generic medication in the United States and is expensive. The wholesale cost {{in the developing world}} is about 4.50 USD per day.|$|E

50|$|Berry {{served as}} {{principal}} investigator {{on more than}} 50 phase II-IV HIV-1 clinical studies providing consistent, reliable data leading to FDA approval of lamivudine, indinavir, ritonavir and <b>saquinavir.</b> Dr. Berry was also the host of MedTalk and HearTalk radio talk show.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saquinavir,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Invirase and Fortovase, is an {{antiretroviral}} drug used {{together with other}} medications to treat or prevent HIV/AIDS. Typically it is used with ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir to increase its effect. It is taken by mouth.|$|E

50|$|Vorapaxar is {{eliminated}} primarily by metabolism by the CYP3A enzymes. It {{is best to}} avoid any strong CYP3A4 inhibitors(ex: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, <b>saquinavir,</b> nelfinavir, indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and conivaptan). CYP3A4 inducers(Carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John's Wort, and Phenytoin) should also be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Grazoprevir is {{transported by}} the solute carrier {{proteins}} SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. Drugs that inhibit this proteins, such as rifampicin, ciclosporin, {{and a number}} of AIDS medications (atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, <b>saquinavir,</b> tipranavir, cobicistat), can cause a significant increase in grazoprevir blood plasma levels. Combination of elbasvir/grazoprevir with these drugs is therefore contraindicated.|$|E

Garlic may interact with warfarin, antiplatelets, <b>saquinavir,</b> antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, the quinolone family of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, and hypoglycemic drugs, as well as other medications.Alliums might be toxic to cats or dogs.|$|E
5000|$|Because OX1001 {{is still}} in pre-clinical testing, its {{mechanism}} of action is unclear. However, {{it can be said}} that as opposed to <b>saquinavir,</b> OX1001 likely works by slowing the growth rate of tumor cells rather than by causing apoptosis, or cell death. [...] Studies suggest that this stoppage of cell proliferation is permanent.|$|E
50|$|Loperamide is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein; therefore, {{the concentration}} of loperamide will increase when given with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Common P-glycoprotein inhibitors include quinidine, ritonavir, and ketoconazole, among others. Loperamide is capable of decreasing the absorption of some other drugs. As an example, when <b>saquinavir</b> concentrations can decrease by half when given with loperamide.|$|E
50|$|Protease inhibitors {{were the}} second class of {{antiretroviral}} drugs developed. The first {{members of this}} class, <b>saquinavir</b> and ritonavir, were approved in late 1995-1996. Within 2 years, annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 Prior to this the annual death rate had been increasing by approximately 20% each year.|$|E
