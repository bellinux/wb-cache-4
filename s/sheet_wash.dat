50|$|The Bungle Bungle Range {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} and impressive occurrences of sandstone tower (or cone) karst terrain in the world. The Bungle Bungles were a plateau of Devonian sandstone, carved into a mass of beehive-shaped towers with regularly alternating, dark gray bands of cynobacterial crust (single cell photosynthetic organisms). The plateau is dissected by a 100 - 200 m deep, sheer-sided gorges and slot canyons. The cone-towers are steep-sided, with an abrupt break of slope at the base and have domed summits. How they were formed is not yet completely understood. Their surface is fragile but stabilized by crusts of iron oxide and bacteria. They provide an outstanding example of land formation by dissolutional weathering of sandstone, with removal of sand grains by wind, rain and <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> on slopes.|$|E
50|$|Streams {{typically}} derive most {{of their}} water from precipitation {{in the form of}} rain and snow. Most of this water re-enters the atmosphere by evaporation from soil and water bodies, or by the evapotranspiration of plants. Some of the water proceeds to sink into the earth by infiltration and becomes groundwater, much of which eventually enters streams. Some precipitated water is temporarily locked up in snow fields and glaciers, to be released later by evaporation or melting. The rest of the water flows off the land as runoff, the proportion of which varies according to many factors, such as wind, humidity, vegetation, rock types, and relief. This runoff starts as a thin film called <b>sheet</b> <b>wash,</b> combined with a network of tiny rills, together constituting sheet runoff; when this water is concentrated in a channel, a stream has its birth. Some creeks may start from ponds or lakes.|$|E

40|$|Erosion {{rates and}} {{processes}} define how mountainous landscapes evolve. This study determines {{the range of}} erosion rates in a semi-arid landscape over decadal time spans and defines the dominant processes controlling variability in erosion rates. The varying topography and climatic regimes of the Xiying Basin (Qilian Shan Mountains, China) enables us to examine the relative roles of <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> versus rainsplash and the influence vegetation on soil erosion and deposition. Soil erosion rates since 1954 were determined using 137 Cs along 21 transects at 4 sites with varying gradient, rainfall, and vegetation cover. The mean 137 Cs derived soil erosion rate ~ 0. 42 [*]mm/a, consistent with the catchment level erosion rate derived from total sediment yield for a 44 [*]year record. However, there is considerable variability in 137 Cs erosion rates both between transects and along transects. Perhaps reflecting variation {{not only in the}} effectiveness of individual processes but also in their relative roles. We compare the 137 Cs-derived erosion rates with 1 -D models for sediment flux that incorporate <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> and rainsplash processes, testing them over a previously untested 60 [*]year timescale. The variability in 137 Cs erosion rates along transects is best replicated by <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> dominated simulations, suggesting that this is the dominant erosion process in this semi-arid landscape. The functional form of the sheetwash model can also explain our observations that 137 Cs erosion rates decrease with upslope length (i. e. distance down slope) while its variability increases. However, sparsely vegetated sites, located in slightly drier locations, have higher erosion rates, and are not as accurately modeled as densely vegetated sites, suggesting that patchiness of vegetation introduces fine scale variability in erosion rates on these slopes...|$|E
40|$|Desert {{pavement}} is {{a general}} term describing a surface that typically consists of {{a thin layer of}} cm-sized rock fragments set on top of a layer of finer material in which no fragments are found. An understanding of desert pavement is important to planetary geology because they may {{play a major role in}} the formation and visibility of various aeolian features such as wind streaks, which are important on Mars and may be important on Venus. A field study was conducted in Amboy, California to determine the formation mechanism of desert pavements. The probable sequence of events for the formation and evolution of a typical desert pavement surface, based on this experiment and the work of others, is as follows. Starting with a layer of surface material consisting of both fine particles and rock fragments, aeolian deflation will rapidly erode the surface until an armored lag is developed, after which aeolian processes become less important. The concentration of fragments then slowly increases as new fragments are brought to the surface from the subsurface and as fragments move downslope by <b>sheet</b> <b>wash.</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>wash</b> would be responsible for removing very fine particles from the surface and for moving the fragments relative to one another, forming interlocks...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{soil erosion}} through water being a {{ubiquitous}} process and its environmental consequences being well understood, its effects upon the global carbon cycle still remain largely uncertain. How much soil organic carbon (SOC) is removed {{each year from}} soils by <b>sheet</b> <b>wash,</b> an important if not the most efficient mechanism of detachment and transport of surficial soil material? What are the main environnemental controls worldwide? These are important questions which largely remain unanswered. Empirical data from 240 runoff plots studied over entire rainy seasons from {{different regions of the}} world were analysed to estimate particulate organic carbon (POC) losses (POCL), and POC enrichment in the sediments compared to the bulk soil (ER), which {{can be used as a}} proxy of the fate of the eroded POC. The median POCL was 9. 9 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) with highest values observed for semi-arid soils (POCL= 10. 8 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)), followed by tropical soils (POCL= 6. 4 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)) and temperate soils (POCL= 1. 7 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)). Considering the mean POCL of 27. 2 g C m(- 2) y(- 1), the total amount of SOC displaced annually by sheet erosion from its source would be 1. 32 +/- 0. 20 Gt C, i. e. 14. 6 % of the net annual fossil fuel induced C emissions of 9 Gt C. Because of low sediment enrichment in POC, erosion-induced CO 2 emissions are likely to be limited in clayey environments while POC burial within hillslopes is likely to constitute an important carbon sink. In contrast, most of the POC displaced from sandy soils is likely to be emitted to the atmosphere. These results underpin the major role <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> plays in the displacement of SOC from its source and in the fate of the eroded SOC, with large variations across the different pedo-climatic regions of the world...|$|E

These volcanic vent structures are prime sources of groundwater because sedimentary formations in the Hopi Buttes area yield only limited amounts of water or yield poor quality water.

Surface geologic investigations and analysis of drillers' logs indicate that structural relationships and diatreme lithology provide a means to project the hydrologic properties of the vent.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} natural {{disturbances}} {{and their impact}} on vascular plant enrichment at two climatically contrasting Andean ranges, i. e. the perhumid Cordillera Real in southern Ecuador and the arid Cordillera de Atacama in northern Chile. In the first case, main triggers for an additional input of pioneer species during succession stages initiated by perturbations are landslides, mudflows, and, to a lesser extent, cohort mortality, floods, and wildlife damages. Droughts and wind are stressors, which reduce plant growth but hardly plant diversity, in contrast to enhanced UV radiation with its mutagen effect. Though stress effects are similar in the Atacama, disturbance regimes differ considerably in this dry mountain environment. Here, most perturbations are of small dimension such as nitrogen inputs by feces of Lamoids and burrow activities of tuco-tuco mice, both of them fostering nitrophilous plant communities. Flooding, gelifluction, and other denudation processes such as <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> occur too, however, do not charge species enrichment in the dry Andes. Although the perhumid study site represents one of the world's plant diversity "hotspots" and, by contrast, the arid one a comparatively "coldspot", pioneer species during successive stages after natural disturbances contribute in a similar percentage to the total plant inventories (appr. 10 % of the species numbers). Relatively seen, natural disturbances are most important for species enrichment in the Atacama (200 – 500 species per 10 000 km 2 ), while most other ecological factors delimit plant survival. Instead, plant life at the Ecuadorian study area benefits from many climatic and edaphic site conditions, and consequently, disturbances are considered only one of many driving forces for its hotspot status (> 5000 species per 10 000 km 2 ) ...|$|E

The last source, channel incision, was derived from geomorphological mapping and lichenomery and provided 3 · 8 % (0 · 17 t ha- 1 y- 1) of the sediment input. The river transports its suspended sediment mainly during high-flow events (sampled with automated water samplers). About 27 % (1 · 2 t ha- 1 y- 1) of the sediment delivered to the channel is deposited on floodplains and low terraces downstream (estimated with geomorphological mapping, coring and cesium- 137 measurements). The sediment transported as bedload disintegrates during transport to the outlet due to the softness of the bedrock material. As a result, the river carries no bedload when it reaches the sea.

40|$|The Maastrichtian Lameta Beds {{of central}} India are intimately {{associated}} with the Deccan lavas and are critical to determining Upper Cretaceous palaeoenvironments and palaeogeography of the area. In the type Jabalpur sub-region, four mappable units of the Lameta Beds are recognised. The basal Green Sandstone is interpreted as a braided stream deposit. The Lower Limestone, characterised by brecciation and shrinkage cracks, is interpreted as a sub-aerially exposed palustrine flat with calcrete formation occurring on topographic highs of low relief plains. The overlying Mottled Nodular Beds exhibit a variable range of calcrete fabrics and morphologies including circum-granular and linear cracks, root casts and nodules. These are interpreted as pedogenically modified <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> deposits of a semiarid alluvial plain. The Upper Sandstone is a sheet flood deposit, again pedogenically modified before arrival of the basal lava flows. Overall the Lameta beds are considered to represent a regionally extensive Maastrichtian regolith. Carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of calcareous components are entirely consistent with soil-zone environments. The d 13 C values are low, typically - 8 to - 9 ‰ PDB, demonstrating a strong input of carbon from the decay of terrestrial land plants.

The Lameta Beds are well known for sauropod nesting sites and sedimentological analyses of these sites suggest that the animals selected topographic highs, usually in marly or sandy, soft sediment.

40|$|This archive {{contains}} material {{relating to}} the photo-mechanical printing process invented by Walter Woodbury in 1865. Like the collotype process this also {{takes advantage of the}} changing nature of bichromated gelatine after exposure to light to produce a continuous tone print. Unlike the collotype process the bichromated gelatine layer does not form the printing plate. A negative is placed upon a sheet of bichromated gelatine and exposed to a light source, the <b>sheet</b> is then <b>washed</b> to flush out the excess bichromate. Where the light has passed through the negative the gelatine is no longer absorbent but where the negative blocked the light the gelatine will accept the water and swell. After the <b>sheet</b> has been <b>washed</b> it will be seen to have a relief surface, raised in the areas that represent the dark areas in the finished print and flat in the areas that represent the light areas of the print. Once dried, the gelatine sheet is placed on a steel plate in a hydraulic press and a sheet of lead that is half an inch thick and half an inch larger than the layer of gelatine is placed on top. The whole is then placed under pressure, and the relief surface of the gelatine sheet is embossed into the lead. The lead sheet produced forms the printing matrix used to make the print. It is placed face downwards in a press of Woodbury’s invention. A mixture of liquid gelatine and a colouring agent is then poured into the mould, a sheet of paper placed on the surface and the press closed. The press is then left for a few minutes allowing the liquid gelatine to set and adhere to the paper, which is then carefully lifted out of the press and placed in a drying rack. As the gelatine contracts slightly upon drying, causing the paper to curl inwards, these prints had to then be mounted. The archive contains journal articles taken from contemporary photographic journals describing this process and its potential amateur and commercial use as well as describing further refinements to the process. Also included are detailed descriptions of how the process was carried out at two contemporary commercial studios as well as a photographically illustrated description of how the process can be adapted for use in the digital age.

The main wetland plant assemblages colonising the wetlands include sedges - Baumea articulata (R. Br.) S. T. Blake;. TyphaL. spp.; mixed Baumea articulata and Typha spp.; Isolepis nodosa (Rottb.) R. Br.; Baumea juncea(R. Br.) Palla; Lepidosperma gladiatum Labill.; rushes - Juncus krausii Hochst.; grasses - Sporobolus virginicus (L.) Kunth.; shrubs - Melaleuca viminea Lindley; Melaleuca teretifolia Endl.; grass trees - Xanthorrhoea preissii Endl.; trees and shrubs - Melaleuca rhaphiophylla Schauer,Melaleuca cuticularis Labill. The pollen assemblages recovered from the surface sediments were separated into six categories as related to extant vegetation: that generated in situ from wetland basin vegetation; that derived from in situ wetland margin vegetation; that derived allochthonously from wetland vegetation; that from ridge vegetation (inhabiting the beachridges) and transportedto the wetland basin; that from distal vegetation in the region; and uncategorised pollen. Of the plants extant in modern wetland centres and their margins, the following key species were commonly detected as pollen grains in the surface sediment: Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, Baumeaarticulata, Baumea juncea, Isolepis nodosa, Lepidosperma gladiatum, Melaleuca cuticularis, Melaleuca viminea, Melaleuca rhaphiophylla, Melaleuca teretifolia, Sporobolus virginicus, Typhadomingensis Pers. /T. orientalis C. Presl, and Xanthorrhoea preissii. In most wetlands, {{the majority of the}} surface pollen in the wetlands was derived from the local wetland and upland ridge vegetation (i. e., that inhabiting the beachridges) of the cuspate foreland. Generally, in situ wetland pollen constituted a moderate proportion of the total pollen. Wetland margin pollen was abundant in only half the wetlands. Pollen from ridges was sub-dominant to pollen from allochthonous wetland species in about half the wetlands, and dominant in the remainder. The contribution of distal pollen varied from low in most wetlands to relatively high numbers and significant in others. The potential dispersal mechanisms for pollen in this area are insects, avifauna, local processes of in situ generation, and easterly and westerly winds, and transport agents include wind, rain, <b>sheet</b> <b>wash,</b> and water transport. The differential effect of wind in transporting pollen was explored using local wetland species of Melaleuca as a signature, and the occurrence of upland species, such as Casuarinaceae spp., Olearia axillaris (DC.) F. Muell. ex Benth., and Eucalyptus marginata Donnex Smith pollen. The patterns show that delivery of pollen to the wetland basins is heterogeneous...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this geomorphologic study was to analyse thc recent morphologic {{evolution}} of calanchi badlands over a SO years' period (1955 - 2006) and to evaluate the mean erosion rate in areas situated in Southern Tuscany. These areas are characterised by Pliocene marine claystone which have undergone and continue to undergo erosion processes and a rapid morphologic evolution. Our morphodynamic investigation was based on systematic field surveys conducted over a 12 years' period (1994 - 2006) and photogeological analysis of a 30 km 2 wide area. The systematic field surveys demonstrated that in the calanchi badland areas, erosion processes due to sheet-wash and channelled water act together gravitational processes, mainly represented by landslides and solifluction. Our research indicated {{that the effects of}} gravitational processes have increased over the last 10 years while sheet-wash action has been less intense over that same period. This is demonstrated by the progressive increase of flows {{at the top of the}} calanchi badland slopes which determined the general rounding of sharp crests and the partial filling of several cuttings. In addition, our morphodynamic analys is strongly suggests that anthropogenic action should not be overlooked or underestimated as a major force in shaping the landscape in the study area over the last so years. Quantitative evaluation of the morphodynamic evolution based over a 50 years' period, was carried out in the "Torrente Cacarello" sample area, chosen as representative of the whole study area. The comparison between 1955, 1976 and 2006 detailed geomorphologic maps (scale 1 : 5, 000), obtained from the aerial photographs and from the recent (2006) field survey, allowed us to estimate the morphological differences which occurred in this period. Detailed analysis of the three geomorphological maps of the sample area obtained for eaeh peri od, were compared through a GIS software and enabled us to quantify the following different morphological processes that influenced the variation found in these areas: 1) the calanchi badland area increased over the last 50 years; 2) mass movements prevail over <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> erosion; 3) calanchi badlands in their most recent morphological state are shaped by numerous scattered small landslides. The geomorphological study in the sample area was completed by direct morphodynamic analysis: measurements of erosion were taken in order to quantify the mean erosion rate. The sample area was monitored during the period JuI. OO-Jan. 06. Morphographic and morphometric analyses showed that the calanchi badlands are characterised by constant and quick shrinking of their edges eaused by landslides. Selected measurement stations located on slopes indicated an erosion rate ranging from 6 to 6. 5 cm/y. The mean erosion rate measured in the sample area of this study was comparable to the mean crosion rate indicated in our earlier studies of neighbouring areas of Southern Tuscany; the mean erosion rate in both of these studies was significantly higher than those indicated by other authors who have studied ltalian badlands...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] Intense erosion processes are {{widespread in the}} Mediterranean region, and include <b>sheet</b> <b>wash</b> erosion, rilling, gullying, shallow landsliding, {{and the development of}} large and active badlands in both subhumid and semi-arid areas. This review analyses the main environmental and human features related to soil erosion processes, and the main factors that explain the extreme variability of factors influencing soil erosion, particularly recent land use changes. The importance of erosion in the Mediterranean is related to the long history of human activity in a region characterized by low levels of annual precipitation, the occurrence of intense rainstorms and long-lasting droughts, high evapotranspiration, the presence of steep slopes and the occurrence of recent tectonic activity, together with the recurrent use of fire, overgrazing and farming. These factors have resulted in a complex landscape in which intensification and abandonment, wealth and poverty can co-exist. The changing conditions of national and international markets and the evolution of population pressure are now the main drivers explaining land use changes, including farmland abandonment in mountain areas, the expansion of some subsidized crops to marginal lands, and the development of new terraces affected by landslides and intense soil erosion during extreme rainstorm events. The occurrence of human-related forest fires affecting thousands of hectares each year is a significant problem in both the northern and southern areas of the Mediterranean basin. Here, we highlight the rise of new scientific challenges in controlling the negative consequences of soil erosion in the Mediterranean region: 1) to reduce the effects and extent of forest fires, and restructure the spatial organization of abandoned landscapes; 2) to provide guidance for making the EU agricultural policy more adapted to the complexity and fragility of Mediterranean environments; 3) to develop field methods and models to improve the identification of runoff and sediment contributing areas; 4) to contribute to the conservation of landscapes (i. e. bench-terraced fields) having high cultural and productivity values; 5) to improve knowledge of the hydrological and geomorphological functioning of badlands, with the aim of reducing sediment yield and accessibility; 6) to better understand the effect of climate change on soil erosion in the Mediterranean region; and 7) to improve quantitative information on long-term soil erosion.

40|$|Background: Sepsis {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 15 % of an estimated 3. 3 million annual neonatal deaths globally. We used data collected from the control arms of three previously conducted cluster-randomised controlled trials in rural Bangladesh, India, and Nepal to examine the association between clean delivery kit use or clean delivery practices and neonatal mortality among home births. Methods and Findings: Hierarchical, logistic regression models were used to explore the association between neonatal mortality and clean delivery kit use or clean delivery practices in 19, 754 home births, controlling for confounders common to all study sites. We tested the association between kit use and neonatal mortality using a pooled dataset from all three sites and separately for each site. We then examined the association between individual clean delivery practices addressed in {{the contents of the}} kit (boiled blade and thread, plastic <b>sheet,</b> gloves, hand <b>washing,</b> and appropriate cord care) and neonatal mortality. Finally, we examined the combined association between mortality and four specific clean delivery practices (boiled blade and thread, hand <b>washing,</b> and plastic <b>sheet).</b> Using the pooled dataset, we found that kit use was associated with a relative reduction in neonatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 39 – 0. 68). While use of a clean delivery kit was not always accompanied by clean delivery practices, using a plastic sheet during delivery, a boiled blade to cut the cord, a boiled thread to tie the cord, and antiseptic to clean the umbilicus were each significantly associated wit...|$|R
40|$|Indoor {{environmental}} triggers {{can increase}} asthma morbidity. National guidelines recommend comprehensive use of environmental control practices (ECPs) {{as a component}} of asthma management. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the association between preventive asthma care and comprehensive ECP use among children with asthma. We used data from the National Asthma Survey, including 1, 921 children with asthma. Comprehensive use was defined as using at least five of eight ECPs: (i) air filter, (ii) dehumidifier, (iii) mattress cover, (iv) pillow cover, (v) pet avoidance, (vi) smoke avoidance, (vii) removing carpets, and (viii) <b>washing</b> <b>sheets</b> in hot water. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between comprehensive use of ECPs and receipt of preventive asthma care, as measured by number of routine asthma visits in the prior year and physician advice to modify the environment. Overall, 17 % (95 % CI: 14 - 19 %) of participants had comprehensive ECP use. The most commonly used practices were 'smoke avoidance' (85 %), 'pet avoidance' (59 %), and 'washing sheets in hot water' (46 %). Comprehensive use of ECPs was associated with having received physician advice [odds ratio (OR) 3. 1, 95 % CI: 2. 2 - 4. 4] and increased asthma visits (1 - 2 visits: OR 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 2. 4; 3 - 4 visits: OR 2. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 3. 8; = 5 visits: OR 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 5 - 4. 8). Only a minority of parents implement comprehensive ECPs, and receipt of preventive asthma care is associated with comprehensive use. Further research is needed to determine the factors mediating these associations in order to inform more effective asthma counseling. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Cytopathic changes induced in tissue {{cultures}} by {{a variety}} of enteroviruses have been observed in the light microscope (1 - 5). Furthermore, detailed analysis by means of electron microscopy has revealed the presence of intracytoplasmic crystalline viral aggregates (6 - 11) as well as alterations in the fine structure of cells infected by some of these agents (12). A preliminary study of type 9 ECHO virus (1) has demonstrated viral particles in a regular, although non-crystalline, arrangement upon a series of parallel filaments within the cytoplasm of cells manifesting the characteristic enteroviral cytopathic effect. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the structure of ECHO 9 virus, the manner in which it develops and the mechanism whereby it gains egress from the infected tissue culture cells. Methods and Materials Virus. [...] Type 9 ECHO (Hill strain) virus was kindly supplied by Dr. Albert B. Sabin. Cell Culture~. [...] Rl~us kidney epithelial cells, obtained by trypsinization of normal kidney tissue, were propagated in Meluick's medium (13), a week to 10 days usually sufficing for the development of confluent cell sheets. These were retrypsinized, washed, suspended in fresh medium and dispensed into 25 ml plastic plaque bottles. Fully grown cell <b>sheets</b> were then <b>washed</b> with balanced salt solution, inoculated with 10 s TCID virus in 0. 2 ml of balanced salt solution. After incubation for an hour at 37 °C, maintenance medium was added and incubation at 37 °C continued. When the desired degree of cytopathic effect was observed the cells were scraped from the bottles into balanced salt solution, centrifuged into pellets, fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded dilutions of ethyl alcohol, embedded in methacrylate, and sectioned as previously described (14).
