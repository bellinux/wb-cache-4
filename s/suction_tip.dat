40|$|Presently, problem-free {{diagnosis}} and therapy for diseases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are not available. Particularly challenging is {{the treatment of}} diseases deep within the small intestine. Endoscopy is {{the most commonly used}} method for accessing the GI tract. However, the endoscope cannot reach much of the small intestines 25 feet of length. Techniques used currently are demanding on doctors and painful for their patients. In order to decrease trauma to patients and demands on physicians researchers have been focused on the development of minimally invasive endoscopy techniques. This dissertation presents the development and evaluation of a novel endoscopy method utilizing suction for locomotion within the small bowel. Several <b>suction</b> <b>tips</b> were designed and tested. Testing consisted of inserting <b>suction</b> <b>tips</b> in the small intestine of swine and allowing them to attach to the intestinal wall using vacuum alone, followed by the pulling of the tip parallel (longitudinal) to the intestine. Damage to the intestine was determined by histology and visual inspection. Data collected consisted of applied vacuum, the force required to pull the tip along the intestine and the position. Vacuum forces of 86 kPa were used to generate maximum pull forces of 4. 7 N. Results indicate locomotion by means of <b>suction</b> <b>tips</b> similar to those used in this study are safe and pose no significant harm to the intestinal wall. Additionally, forces of these magnitudes have significant potential in the locomotion of various therapeutic devices. Finally, the analyses and resultant data are presented.

In addition, the optimum suction jet length was determined. In this study, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations were employed {{in conjunction with a}} k–ω SST turbulent model. Perpendicular suction was applied at {{the leading edge of the}} wing's upper surface, with two different types of slot distributions: i. e., center <b>suction</b> and <b>tip</b> <b>suction.</b> The suction jet lengths were varied by 0. 25 – 2 of the chord length, and the jet velocity was selected to be 0. 5 times the freestream velocity. Most importantly, in both cases, the results indicated that the lift-to-drag ratio increased as the suction jet length rose. However, the improvement in aerodynamic characteristics was more pronounced with center suction, and these characteristics were extremely close to those of the case considering suction over the entire wing such that the jet length was equal to wingspan. Moreover, in the center suction case, vortexes frequently abated or moved downstream. Interestingly, under similar conditions, a greater number of vortexes were removed with center <b>suction</b> than with <b>tip</b> <b>suction.</b> Ultimately, when the jet length is less than half the wingspan, <b>tip</b> <b>suction</b> is the better of the two alternatives, and when the jet length is greater than half the wingspan, center suction is better suited...|$|R

The present study was undertaken to detect resistance mediated by ESBL’s. Multidrug resistance in isolates producing ESBL was also studied. Methods: The study included a total of 200 clinical specimens which include 95 urine, 45 pus, 32 sputum, 11 blood, 9 throat swabs, 6 <b>suction</b> <b>tips</b> and 2 vaginal swabs. The E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates which were screen positive were studied for ESBL production by DDST method. Results: Culture of 200 samples yielded 200 isolates (117 E. coli and 83 K. pneumoniae). Out of these, 98 (49 %) were screen positive for ESBL. Among them 79 (53 E. coli and 26 K. pneumoniae) were found to produce ESBL. Among them, 4 (7. 6 %) isolates of E. coli and 4 (15. 3 %) isolates of K. pneumoniae were positive by DDST method. The prevalence of 39. 5 % of ESBL production was noted in the present study. Among ESBL positive isolates, 98. 1 % were resistant to cefoxitin, however {{all of them were}} susceptible to imipenem.

40|$|Summary The report {{comprises}} two contrasting and complementary {{approaches to}} {{the evaluation of the}} second-order aerodynamic side force and yawing moment on lifting wings when leading-edge and side-edge forces play an important r 61 e. In Part I the asual lifting-surface model, in which the vorticity is placed on a planar surface, is shown to lead to inconsistent results; consistent results are obtained when the vorticity is placed on the camber surface while the standard lifting-surface integral equation takes its usual form. In a further supplementary momentum analysis involving the Trefftz plane, the side force and yawing moment are derived from approximate expressions which avoid calculation of any edge forces. In Part II the analysis oflinearised subsonic lifting-surface theory is extended to provide expressions for the leading-edge and side-edge forces. The side force and yawing moment under conditions of asymmetric spanwise loading are obtained as the sum of three contributions, from normal pressures, leading-edge <b>suction</b> and <b>tip</b> <b>suction.</b> These quantities are used to treat lifting wings in roll, and from a few numerical examples some general trends in the theoretical derivatives are observed. The related evidence from experiment and from semi-empirical methods is discussed, and one such method is transcribed for use in conjunction with the theoretical computations...|$|R

Spatial {{perceptions}} by {{the naked}} eye and under the surgical microscope were compared between groups of experienced and inexperienced neurosurgeons to understand distortion in the three-dimensional recognition of the surgical field. Methods. A phantom surgical field containing a start point, arbitrarily set virtual gate, and a target point was fixed under a video-see-through microscope which allows projection of navigational image into microscopic view. The surgical navigator was used to record the spatial position of the <b>suction</b> <b>tip.</b> Examinees were first shown {{the position of the}} invisible virtual gate. Then they were asked to point consecutively to three points with the <b>suction</b> <b>tip</b> under four different visual conditions; by {{the naked eye}}, under the microscope, while watching a navigator monitor, and under the microscope with projection of navigational image. The pointing deviation from the <b>suction</b> <b>tip</b> to the virtual gate, the trajectory of <b>suction</b> <b>tip</b> and the operation time were evaluated. By the naked eye, pointing accuracy did not differ between the two groups. However, accuracy under the microscope was significantly worse in inexperienced group. Further analysis demonstrated that these differences were attributable to inaccurate depth perception. With the navigational image projection, the accuracy and the operation time were significantly improved in both groups. Conclusions. Under the microscope, the spatial perception was considerably distorted, especially in the depth component. Application of the navigator improved this perception considerably.

40|$|Background: Three {{kinds of}} {{conditions}} {{should be considered}} to reduce free hemoglobin production using an autologous cell salvage device. They are the negative suction pressure, the size of <b>suction</b> <b>tip,</b> and the air contact during suction. We want to examine which condition {{is the most important}} factor to produce free hemoglobin. Methods: One pack of red blood cell and one pack of fresh frozen plasma with the same blood type were mixed. They were aspirated based on the two suction pressure (- 150 mmHg or- 300 mmHg), three sizes of suction tips, and the two conditions of air contact, in which the <b>suction</b> <b>tip</b> was located in the surface of blood or {{in the middle of the}} blood. Seven ml sized EDTA tube was used to collect 5 ml blood. All the procedure repeated ten times. Free hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and hematocrit were measured. Hemolysis ratio was calculated with following formula. Hemolysis ratio = (new free hemoglobin production) × (100 -hematocrit) / (total hemoglobin). Results: Free hemoglobin production and hemolysis ratio were increased when the <b>suction</b> <b>tip</b> was positioned in the surface than when it was in the middle of the blood. The pressure of negative suction and three kinds of the suction tips did not influence the production of free hemoglobin nor the hemolysis ratio.

40|$|A {{low scale}} wind tunnel {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} rolling flow {{to determine the effects}} of aspect ratio and sweep (when varied independently) on the rolling stability derivatives for a series of untapered wings. Test results indicate that when the aspect ratio was held constant, an increase in the sweepback angle caused a significant reduction in the damping in roll at low lift coefficients for only the higher aspect ratios that were tested. This result was in agreement with available swept wing theory which indicated no effect of sweep for aspect ratios near zero. The result of the linear theory that the damping in roll is independent of lift coefficient and that the yawing moment and lateral force due to rolling are directly proportional to the lift coefficient was found to be valid for only a very limited lift coefficient range when the wings were highly swept. For such wings, the damping was found to increase in magnitude and the yawing moment due to rolling, to change from negative to positive at moderate lift coefficients. The effect of wing <b>tip</b> <b>suction,</b> not acounted for by present theory, was found to be very important with regard to the yawing moment due to rolling, particularly for low aspect ratio swept wings.

Methods Surgical procedures were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) continuous (n = 25) or (2) intermittent suction (n = 25). A control suction was operated in each surgery. Samples for aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic examination were collected from the surgical suction at 0, 20, 60 minutes, {{and at the end of}} surgery, and from the control suction at the end of the surgery only. Comparison of continuous and intermittent suction data, and the effect of surgical time on contamination rate were analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by a Cox proportional hazards model.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used otoscopes—those used in emergency rooms, pediatric offices, general practice, and by internists- are monocular devices. They provide only a two-dimensional view of the ear canal, its contents, and usually at least {{a portion of the}} eardrum, depending on what is within the ear canal and its status. Another method of performing otoscopy (visualization of the ear) is use of a binocular microscope, in conjunction with a larger metal ear speculum, with the patient supine and the head tilted, which provides a much larger field of view and the added advantages of a stable head, far superior lighting, and most importantly, depth perception. A binocular (two-eyed) view is required in order to judge depth. If wax or another material obstructs the canal and/or a view of the entire eardrum, it can easily and confidently be removed with specialized <b>suction</b> <b>tips</b> and other microscopic ear instruments, whereas the absence of depth perception with the one-eyed view of a common otoscope makes removal of anything more laborious and hazardous. Another major advantage of the binocular microscope is that both of the examiner's hands are free, since the microscope is suspended from a stand. The microscope has up to 40x power magnification, which allows much more detailed viewing of the entire ear canal, and of the entire eardrum unless edema of the canal skin prevents it. Subtle changes in the anatomy are much more easily detected and interpreted than with a monocular view otoscope. Traditionally only ENT specialists (otolaryngologists) and otologists (subspecialty ear doctors) acquire binocular microscopes and the necessary skills and training to use them, and incorporate their routine use in evaluating patient's ear complaints. Studies have shown that reliance on a monocular otoscope to diagnose ear disease results in a more than 50% chance of misdiagnosis, as compared to binocular microscopic otoscopy. The expense of acquiring a binocular microscope is only one obstacle to its being more widely adapted to general medicine. The low level of familiarity with binocular otoscopy among pediatric and general medicine professors in physician training programs is probably a more difficult obstacle to overcome. Thus, the standard of general otologic diagnosis and ear care remains, for the most part, the largely antiquated monocular otoscope.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{describe}} an innovative 1. 7 -mm-diameter, latex-free aspirator tip attachment (Circle Medical B. V. Wijchen, The Netherlands). This tip {{is designed to}} be used during tumor resection to avoid surgical trauma to the spinal cord surrounding an intramedullary tumor and the associated blood vessels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, we have used a this device during tumor dissection for 36 patients with intramedullary spinal cord tumors (21 ependymomas, 7 astrocytomas, 6 hemangioblastomas, and 2 cavernomas) and 1 patient with an arteriovenous malformation. The innovative feature of this attachment is the removable and disposable, soft, thermoplastic elastomer tip that is fenestrated to keep air flowing and prevent a vacuum. RESULTS: During its use, this aspirator tip did not adhere to tissue, including swollen spinal cord tissue that surrounded the tumors. We found that the tip is used more as a dissector than an aspirator. It must be cleaned two or three times per intervention; however, it was never necessary to change it. CONCLUSION: This new, safe, soft-tipped <b>suction</b> <b>tip</b> attachment can increase surgical safety during intramedullary tumor removal and its use may be extended to other neurosurgical indications such as cauda equina tumors and any lesion that requires nerve and vessel dissection.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a transonic compressor rotor {{is known to}} depend by a large amount on the flow at the rotor tip {{and on the way}} the flow interacts with the shock system at the casing. To further extend off-design capability and loading limits, several compressor rotors have been investigated at the single stage transonic compressor rig at Darmstadt University of Technology. The rotor leading edge shapes may be characterised by forward sweep, standard and backward sweep / backward lean. On the basis of 3 D Navier-Stokes simulations the leading edge shape at the rotor tip is demonstrated to have a pronounced impact on the shock situation. A critical sweep angle may be deduced from the present investigations for backward swept rotor designs. The orientation of the passage shock at the casing is shown to depend not only on the tip leakage vortex and the way it displaces the undisturbed flow but also on the interaction of the bow shock at the leading edge with the casing. Close to the <b>suction</b> surface <b>tip</b> region for all rotors an approximately normal shock situation is found. For a backward swept rotor leading edge, however, the normal shock condition at the casing is demonstrated to be not only valid within the blade passage but more important, for the flow in front of the leading edge...|$|R
30|$|The intra-abdominal {{irrigation}} via current {{flexible endoscope}} is feasible; however, it is technically demanding {{due to its}} one-direction spray {{from the tip of}} the endoscope. The use of sterile saline solution via built-in air/water channel requires specific and cumbersome preparation and setting. The <b>suction</b> from the <b>tip</b> of the endoscope is further challenging, since conventional technique requires “diving” of the endoscope beneath the fluid. While diving the endoscope, the visualization is temporally lost. This is acceptable in the gut lumen where no other organs exist; however, this is not acceptable in the abdominal cavity where blind mis-suction may lead to serious organ damage.

With this device, sterile irrigation and safe suction under endoscopic visual control were feasible in the present case.|$|R

Postoperative headache is not uncommon after retrosigmoid vestibular schwannoma removal. Bone dust dispersed into the subarachnoid space during drilling may be responsible. If dispersion could be reduced, headache inci-dence might be decreased. An ultrasonic bone aspirator (UBA) containing an integrated <b>suction</b> at the <b>tip</b> may more effectively suction bone dust created during bone removal. The objective is to determine whether a UBA results in less bone dust dispersion than a standard otologic drill. Study Design. Cadaveric temporal bone quantitative model. Setting. Laboratory. Subjects and Methods. Temporal bone blocks were placed in a watertight enclosure. Under irrigation, bone was removed by use of either a drill or a UBA. The settings of the UBA were varied. The irrigant containing bone dust was microfil-tered, and bone dust was weighed. Differences were com-pared across groups (n = 2 - 9 per group). Ablation times were also recorded (n = 3 per group). Results. Only 3...|$|R
