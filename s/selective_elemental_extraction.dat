40|$|The {{focus of}} this study {{includes}} the investigation of sampling technologies used in industry and their potential application to nuclear fuel processing. The goal is to identify innovative sampling methods using {{state of the art}} techniques that could evolve into the next generation sampling and analysis system for metallic elements. Sampling and analysis of nuclear fuel recycling plant processes is required both to monitor the operations and ensure Safeguards and Security goals are met. In addition, environmental regulations lead to additional samples and analysis to meet licensing requirements. The volume of samples taken by conventional means, can restrain productivity while results samples are analyzed, require process holding tanks that are sized to meet analytical issues rather than process issues (and that create a larger facility footprint), or, in some cases, simply overwhelm analytical laboratory capabilities. These issues only grow when process flowsheets propose new separations systems and new byproduct material for transmutation purposes. Novel means of streamlining both sampling and analysis are being evaluated to increase the efficiency while meeting all requirements for information. This report addresses just a part of the effort to develop and study novel methods by focusing on the sampling and analysis of aqueous samples for metallic elements. It presents an overview of the sampling requirements, including frequency, sensitivity, accuracy, and programmatic drivers, to demonstrate the magnitude of the task. The sampling and analysis system needed for metallic element measurements is then discussed, and novel options being applied to other industrial analytical needs are presented. Inductively coupled mass spectrometry instruments are the most versatile for metallic element analyses and are thus chosen as the focus for the study. Candidate novel means of process sampling, as well as modifications that are necessary to couple such instruments to introduce these samples, are discussed. A suggested path forward based on an automated microchip capillary based sampling system interfaced to the analysis spectrometer is presented. The ability to obtain micro liter volume samples coupled with remote automated means of sample tracking and transport to the instrument would greatly improve analytical efficiency while reducing both personnel exposure and radioactive waste. Application of this sampling technique to new types of mass spectrometers for <b>selective</b> <b>elemental</b> isotopic analysis could also provide significant improvements in safeguards and security analyses...|$|R

This study {{examines}} the physicochemical interactions that occur when interbedded limestone-shale systems and kimberlitic rocks weather to form soils. Fast weathering processes with extensive soil loss {{have been a}} major environmental concern in the Flint Hills for decades. Knowledge of soil formation processes, rates of formation and subsequent loss, and understanding how these processes differ in different systems are critical for managing soil as a resource. Kimberlites are CO₂-rich igneous rocks that are high in Mg and Fe; they are compositionally distinct from the Paleozoic limestones and shales found {{throughout the rest of the}} region. This study will compare the geochemistry and mineralogy of the Stockdale Kimberlite in Riley county to that of interbedded limestone-shale system typical of the Flint Hills as sampled from Konza Prairie LTER. Bulk composition and mineralogy of the soils overlying these different bedrock types have been analyzed using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), bulk <b>elemental</b> <b>extractions,</b> and particle size analyses. Results show that the kimberlitic soils have higher concentrations of Fe, Mg, Ca, K and some trace elements in greater proportions (e. g. Ti, Ni, Cu). The weathering products differ mineralogically as well, e. g. lizardite is abundant in kimberlitic soils and absent from the limestone terranes. Kimberlite derived soils also contain minerals as well such as kleberite (an alteration product of illminite), phlogopite, and magnetite. Kimberlite-sourced soils have different physical properties than the thin limestone-sourced soils surrounding them. Particle size analysis shows that the limestone-shale soils have different proportions of the clay size fraction in different core locations (~ 47 % in highlands, ~ 51 % at watershed base, ~ 41 % in lowlands) whereas kimberlitic soils have a larger sand fraction than Konza (~ 19 % vs. 10 %). Clay minerals from the limestone-shale system reveals clay micas, kaolinite, and some expandable 2 : 1 layer silicates. Clay minerals from kimberlite-sourced soils are identified as primarily smectites with clay micas and kaolinites. Similarities between the kimberlite and limestone-shale soils are primarily seen in the shallower portions of the soil profile, suggesting that loess/wind-blown dust make a significant contribution to the soils in both areas. It could be concluded that kimberlite-sourced and limestone-shale-sourced soils produce weathering products that differ both chemically and mineralogically and could potentially have agricultural significance in terms of water retention as well as ionic and nutrient mobilities in these soils...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of this thesis was to investigate and produce an MFC with self-sustainable cathode {{so it could be}} implemented in real world applications. Using methods previously employed [polarisation curve experiments, power output measurements, chemical assays for determining COD in wastewater and other elements present in anolyte or catholyte, biomass assessments] and with a focus on the cathode, experiments were conducted to compare and contrast different designs, materials and nutrient input to microbial fuel cells with appropriate experimental control systems. Results from these experiments show that: Firstly, the choice of polymeric PEM membrane showed that the most effective materials in terms of power performance were cation exchange membranes. In terms of cost effectiveness the most promising was CM-I, which was the preferred separator for later experiments. Secondly, a completely biotic MFC with the algal cathode was shown to produce higher power output (7. 00 mW/m 2) than the abiotic control (1. 52 mW/m 2). At the scale of the experimental system, the reservoir of algal culture produced sufficient dissolved oxygen to serve the MFCs in light or dark conditions. To demonstrate usable power, 16 algal cathode-designed MFCs were used to power a dc pump as a practical application. It has been presented that the more power the MFC generates, the more algal biomass will be harvested in the connected photoreactor. The biomass grown was demonstrated to be a suitable carbon-energy resource for the same MFC units in a closed loop scenario, whereby the only energy into the system was light. In the open to air cathode configuration various modifications to the carbon electrode materials including Microporous Layer (MPL) and Activated Carbon (AC) showed catholyte synthesis directly {{on the surface of the}} electrode and <b>elemental</b> <b>extraction</b> such as Na, K, Mg, from wastewater in a power dependent manner. Cathode flooding has been identified as an important and beneficial factor for the first time in MFCs, and has been demonstrated as a carbon capture system through wet scrubbing of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The captures carbon dioxide was mineralised into carbonate and bicarbonate of soda (trona). The novel inverted, tubular MFC configuration integrates design and operational simplicity showing significantly improved performance rendering the MFC system feasible for electricity recovery from waste. The improved power (2. 58 mW) from an individual MFC was increased by 5 -fold compared to the control unit, and 2 -fold to similar sized tubular systems reported in the literature; moreover it was able to continuously power a LED light, charge a mobile phone and run a windmill motor, which was not possible before...|$|R
30|$|Analytical imaging {{techniques}} are {{of great value}} for the investigation of old master paintings. Currently, macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) scanning {{is one of the}} most important methods for visualizing the elemental distribution of a painting in a non-invasive way. With separate comprehensive elemental distribution images from the entire paint surface, the technique makes it possible to characterize a painting’s surface and subsurface layers, which may include grounds, underdrawing, underpainting, compositional changes (pentimenti) and even abandoned compositions [1 – 4]. This offers an insight into a painting’s creation process and the modus operandi of artists. Moreover, since its development, the technique contributed to elucidate art historical, art theoretical and conservation related questions [5]. In spite of its benefits, the technique has limitations as well. The most important drawback of MA-XRF scanning is the fact that the technique is not depth <b>selective,</b> with <b>elemental</b> images that can show contributions from different levels in the stratigraphy [6]. MA-XRF on its own does not reveal the exact number of strata and it is not always clear from which layer the detected signals are stemming. In addition, there is a variable degree of attenuation of the signal, depending on the thickness, atomic number and density of superimposed materials, that has to be taken into account while interpreting the chemical maps.|$|R

40|$|Like most of {{the cities}} around the world Chihuahua City suffers {{atmospheric}} and soil pollution. This {{is a problem that}} requires immediate attention from both public authorities and the scientific community. Although it is known that high levels of heavy metals are present in the airborne particulate matter, soil and dust in many urban regions, the information about personal exposure to these pollutants in Chihuahua City is nonexistent. This study focuses on the analysis and characterization of lead and arsenic in the airborne and soil particulate matter present in the interiors of households and their surrounding outdoor environments {{in the southern part of}} Chihuahua City. The sampling area chosen for this study was located in the southern part of Chihuahua City. An atmospheric sampling point selected by the Centro de Investigación en Materiales Avanzados (CIMAV) was selected as a geographical center, with a 2 km radius forming the sampling area. The households selected for analyses were located on Lombardo Toledano Street, a high-traffic street. The main objectives of this study were to establish the maximum exposure level in outdoor and indoor environments for particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM 10), Pb, and As, to determine the background level of Chihuahua City for these same elements, to determine the isotopic ratios of Pb 206 and Pb 207 in the indoor and outdoor atmospheric samples, and to verify if the source of the pollution is from anthropogenic and/or natural sources. Additionally, a comparison of the analytical data from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) versus the analytical data from inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was conducted. The comparison of these techniques was based on sample preparation, speed of analysis, and accuracy of results. In the case of sample preparation, two extraction techniques were performed for a comparison of the extraction/leaching of Pb and As from the samples. These microwave-assisted extraction techniques used either concentrated nitric acid (HNO 3) or aqua regia (a mixture of HNO 3 and HCl, in 1 : 4 ratio) for <b>elemental</b> <b>extraction.</b> Statistical tools such as F-test, paired-data test, t-test and ANOVA were used to compare the analytical results between ICP-OES and XRF and the indoor/outdoor sampling study. ^ This study concluded that no statistical differences existed between the indoor and outdoor levels in the studied households for Pb and As concentrations. The results also showed that the most important sources of PM 10 and Pb in the indoor environment were the transport and resuspension of external dust. The result further indicated that the inorganic As is associated with the fine particulate matter and is for the most part naturally occurring. In general the hypothesis that the exposure to environmental particulate matter, Pb and As is the same for indoor and outdoor environments can be accepted for the majority of the sampling houses. The isotopic ratios for the indoor samples were somewhat larger than the corresponding outdoor isotopic Pb sample ratios, reaching background levels from several regions around the world. The outdoor Pb isotopic ratios are similar to those found in the polluted-zones from smelting activities. The digestion of soil using HNO 3 and aqua regia did not affect the extraction of Pb and As. The analytical techniques XRF and ICP-OES produced similar results for the determination of As in soil samples. However, these techniques produced different results for Pb determinations. These differences were, more than likely, associated to the digestion/extraction methodology. XRF techniques can successfully substitute other analytical techniques such as ICP-OES in the quantification of some trace elements in soil samples. ...|$|R

With the very hydrophilic anion-exchange column and steep gradient of sodium hydroxide, the nine HAAs could be well separated in 15 min. After suppression with an ASRS suppressor that was introduced in between IC and ICP-MS, the background was much decreased, the interference caused by sodium ion present in eluent was removed, and the sensitivities of HAAs were greatly improved. The chlorinated and brominated HAAs could be detected as (CIO) -C- 35 and Br- 79 without interference of the matrix due to the <b>elemental</b> <b>selective</b> ICP-MS.

Efforts for the development of good separation systems for both Sb and Cr compounds, for the improvement of the sensitivity of HPLC-ICP-MS, and for the preservation of Sb species, especially the prevention of Sb(III) from the oxidation to Sb(V) during the extraction process, will be discussed.

To evaluate the methodology, distributions of Cd in high-pressure-frozen Lotus japonicus—Rhizophagus irregularis mycorrhizal roots were compared between two treatments; Cd was exposed either to the roots or to the extraradical hyphae. Results showed that, in the latter treatment, Cd was restricted to fungal structures, whereas in the former, Cd was detected in cell walls of the two organisms. Plunge-frozen extraradical mycelium of Gigaspora margarita exposed to Cd showed high signals of Cd in the cell walls and vacuoles, and low in the cytoplasm.

By using initial reactivity data, priority is given to the study of intrinsic kinetics i. e. to avoid interactions with ligand degradation and the presence of sulfur. A wetted wall gas-liquid reactor was employed under a batch-recycle regime. The conversion of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + chelate was determined over the pH range ca. 3 - 6, temperature range ca. 30 - 60 degrees C and a short overall per run contact time of phases. The penetration theory was used for the evaluation of intrinsic reaction rate constant and enhancement factor. Activation energy values determined from the pertinent Arrhenius plots fall in the range, Ea= 17. 2 - 22. 8 kcal mol(- 1). These values compare satisfactorily with the value Ea= 24 kcal mol- 1 obtained from a similar kinetic study performed in a bubble column reactor and indicates a chemical reaction control of the overall gas absorption phenomenon.

To analyze macronutrient content, commercial infrared milk analyzers have been proposed as efficient and practical tools in terms of efficiency and practicality. Since milk analyzers were originally developed for the dairy industry, they must be validated using a significant number of human milk samples that represent the broad range of variation in macronutrient content in preterm and term milk. Aim {{of this study was to}} validate two milk analyzers for breast milk analysis with reference methods and to determine an effective sample pretreatment. Current evidence for the influence of (i) aliquoting, (ii) storage time and (iii) temperature, and (iv) vessel wall adsorption on stability and availability of macronutrients in frozen breast milk is reviewed. MethodsBreast milk samples (n =  1188) were collected from 63 mothers of preterm and term infants. Milk analyzers: (A) Near-infrared milk analyzer (Unity SpectraStar, USA) and (B) Mid-infrared milk analyzer (Miris, Sweden) were compared to reference methods, e. g. ether <b>extraction,</b> <b>elemental</b> analysis, and UPLC-MS/MS for fat, protein, and lactose, respectively. ResultsFor fat analysis, (A) measured precisely but not accurately (y =  0. 55 x +  1. 25, r 2  =  0. 85), whereas (B) measured precisely and accurately (y =  0. 93 x +  0. 18, r 2  =  0. 86). For protein analysis, (A) was precise but not accurate (y =  0. 55 x +  0. 54, r 2  =  0. 67) while (B) was both precise and accurate (y =  0. 78 x +  0. 05, r 2  =  0. 73). For lactose analysis, both devices (A) and (B) showed two distinct concentration levels and measured therefore neither accurately nor precisely (y =  0. 02 x +  5. 69, r 2  =  0. 01 and y = − 0. 09 x +  6. 62, r 2  =  0. 02 respectively).

HettiarachchiConstructed wetland {{treatment}} systems (CWTSs) are {{an alternative}} adaptation for flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater purification. A series of laboratory-based soil column studies mimicking a pilot-scale CWTS {{was carried out}} to evaluate {{the performance of the}} treatment system in detail. The main objectives of studies were to (1) understand the transport characteristics, retention capacity and transformation of selenium and other FGD constituents in the CWTS, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of soil treatments and influent flow rate on the performance of the CWTS, and (3) develop a mechanistic understanding of the CWTS performance through monitoring interrelationships of selenium (Se), arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and sulfur (S). Ferrihydrite (1 % w/w), and labile organic carbon (OC) were used as soil treatments. Different influent flow rates, X (1. 42 mL/hour), 2 X, or 1 / 2 X were used depending on the objectives of each study. Deoxygenated 1 : 1 mixture of FGD: raw water was the influent. It was delivered to the saturated columns with an upward flow. Effluent samples were collected continuously, and analyzed for constituents of concern. End of these experiments, soil from sectioned columns were used for total <b>elemental</b> analysis, sequential <b>extraction</b> procedure (SEP) for Se, and synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy analyses. Results indicated a complete Se retention by the columns. Boron, and fluorine partially retained whereas sodium, sulfur, and chlorine retention was weak, agreeing with field observations. Some of the initially-retained Se (~ 4 to 5 %) was mobilized by changing redox conditions in the soil. Selenium fed with the wastewater accumulated in the bottom 1 / 3 (inlet) of the soil columns and was mainly sequestrated as stable forms revealed by SEP. Bulk-, and micro-XANES analyses suggested the retention mechanism of Se from the FGD wastewater was via the transformation of Se into reduced/stable forms [Se(IV), organic Se, and Se(0) ]. Under wetland conditions, native soil As was mobilized by reductive dissolution of As associated minerals. However, the ferrihydrite amendment suppressed the native soil As mobility. Micro-XRF mapping integrated with As, and Fe-XANES suggested that the mechanism of native soil As retention was the sequestration of released As with newly precipitated secondary Fe minerals. A long-term study carried out with X, 1 / 2 X flow rates, and OC source indicated enhanced S retention by the slow flow rate (1 / 2 X), most likely due to the time dependency of biogenic S reduction. Further, bulk S-, As-, and Fe-XANES revealed that long submergence period and the slow flow rate increased the formation of reduced and/or biogenic S, realgar-like, and greigite-like species. These observations indicated that modified flow rates could {{have a significant impact on}} the long-term trace element (such as As) sequestration in the CWTS.
