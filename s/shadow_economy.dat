As an example, he cites flaws in Thai statistics, who discount men from their official numbers because by law they cannot be considered trafficking victims due to their gender.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how European {{countries}} {{have responded to}} the issue of irregular migrant labor in recent decades. The European Union has declared that jobs in <b>shadow</b> <b>economies</b> are a major pull for undocumented migrants, and since the 1990 s, a number of individual states and the EU have ramped up efforts to combat irregular migrant work. This paper charts and characterizes trends in these policy initiatives over time, and across countries, in an effort to un-derstand both how states concretely go about trying to control irregular migration, and to shed light on the political economy of labor migration. I argue that European integration and asylum crises help explain the common trend toward hardening labor market controls, as well as the growing EU emphasis on the issue. Cross-national differences remain, however, in the level of effort expended on rooting out and repressing irregular migrant work; these differences reflect varying political dynamics over <b>shadow</b> <b>economies</b> and the institutionalized power of economic interest groups...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to examine, from {{a global}} macro perspective, the {{relationships}} between commercial sex, regulatory system and <b>shadow</b> <b>economies.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on eight years {{of research in the}} sex industries and literature from other sources that explore the nuances of the economic and social organisation of the sex markets in different countries. Findings – First, a four point continuum is presented, based on the following types of economies: legal formal; legal informal; illegal informal and illegal criminal. Second, challenging principles that the sex industry is only “demand” driven, this paper looks at the nature of the sex industry, examining the dynamics of supply {{in the context of a}} prolific global <b>shadow</b> sex <b>economy.</b> Third, the concept of “supply” is broadened out to refer not only to women involved in selling direct and indirect sexual services but the legitimate and illegitimate service industries that are ancillary to the sex industry: namely: advertising, marketing, leisure industries, security, policing and welfare. Originality/value – Contributing to the cultural analysis of the sex industry and drawing on original ethnographic observations, this paper stresses the relevance of the “supply” side of the sex industry, including ancillary industries that support the sex markets in the <b>shadow</b> <b>economies.</b> Business analysis, Regulation, Sex and gender issues, Supply and demand...|$|R

The first paper "Labor Market Institutions and Their Effect on Labor Market Performance in the New EU Member Countries" estimates the effects of labor market institutions on various performance indicators (unemployment, long-term unemployment, employment, activity rate) in European countries. The results confirm that high taxes increase unemployment, whereas active labor market policies tend to reduce it. The paper also shows that stricter employment protection, higher taxes, and a larger economic burden represented by the minimum wage decrease employment and activity rates. The second paper "Labor Market Institutions and Their Impact on <b>Shadow</b> <b>Economies</b> in Europe" analyzes the role of labor market institutions in explaining developments of <b>shadow</b> <b>economies</b> in European countries using several alternative measures of the shadow sector.

40|$|How {{do people}} access movies today? What {{are the most}} popular and {{powerful}} channels for media distribution on a global scale? How are film industries changing in the face of media convergence and digitisation? To answer questions such as these, argues Ramon Lobato, we must shift our gaze away from the legal film business and toward cinema's <b>shadow</b> <b>economies.</b> All around the world, films are bought from roadside stalls, local markets, and grocery stores; they are illegally downloaded and streamed; they are watched in makeshift video clubs, on street corners, and in restaurants, shops and bars. International film culture in its actually-existing forms is a messy affair, and it relies to a great extent on black and grey media markets. Examining the industrial dynamics of these subterranean film networks across a number of different sites – from Los Angeles to Lagos, Melbourne to Mexico City – this book shows how they constitute a central rather than marginal part of audiovisual culture and commerce. Combining film industry analysis with cultural theory, <b>Shadow</b> <b>Economies</b> of Cinema opens up a new area of inquiry for cinema studies, putting industry research into dialogue with wider debates about economic informality and commodity circulation. Written in an accessible style, this book offers an original 'bottom-up' perspective on the global cinema industry for researchers and students in film studies, cultural studies, and media and communications...|$|R
