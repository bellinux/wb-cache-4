50|$|Gold is {{unaffected}} by most acids. It does not react with hydrofluoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, sulfuric, or nitric acid. It does react with <b>selenic</b> <b>acid,</b> and is dissolved by aqua regia, a 1:3 mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. Nitric acid oxidizes the metal to +3 ions, {{but only in}} minute amounts, typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. However, the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid, forming AuCl4− ions, or chloroauric acid, thereby enabling further oxidation.|$|E

5000|$|Mathews {{was raised}} on a dairy farm near the unincorporated {{community}} of Auroraville, Wisconsin in Waushara County, Wisconsin. As a youth, he {{had little interest in}} farm life or in the cheese factory operated by his older brother. His parents sent Joseph to public school in nearby Berlin, a city that straddles the boundary between Waushara and Green Lake counties. He graduated from Omro High School (Omro, Winnebago County). Mathews studied briefly at Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin, and then transferred to the University of Wisconsin. Mathews earned the B.S. in chemistry in 1903, writing a senior thesis on nitrosyl <b>selenic</b> <b>acid,</b> based on research under the supervision of Victor Lenher (1873-1927).|$|E
5000|$|In 1833 Mitscherlich made {{a series}} of careful {{determinations}} of the vapor densities {{of a large number of}} volatile substances, confirming the law of Gay-Lussac. In 1833-34, Mitscherlich investigated the synthesis of diethyl ether from ethanol and sulfuric acid. [...] Through his careful studies, he realized that the acid was not being consumed during the production of the ether, although the reaction would not proceed unless the acid was present. After reviewing Mitscherlich's findings, Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius was led to coin the term [...] "catalysis" [...] for the acceleration or enablement of a chemical reaction by a substance that itself was not consumed in the reaction. [...] He obtained <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> in 1827 and showed that its salts are isomorphous with the sulphates, while a few years later he proved that the same thing is true of the manganates and the sulfates, and of the permanganates and the perchlorates. He investigated the relation of benzene to benzoic acid and to other derivatives. As related by Gustav Rose [...] Mitscherlich turned away from inorganic chemistry (crystallography) and devoted his attention to organic chemistry, starting out with an investigation of fuel and oil. Mitscherlich kept working on problems of organic chemistry until 1845. His interest in mineralogy led him to study the geology of volcanic regions, and he made frequent visits to the Eifel in an attempt to develop a theory on the cause of volcanism. He did not, however, publish any papers on the subject, though after his death his notes were arranged and published by J. L. A. Roth in the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy (Ueber die vulkanischen Erscheinungen in der Eifel und über die Metamorphie der Gesteine durch erhöhte Temperatur, Berlin, 1865).|$|E
40|$|The self-ordering {{behavior}} of anodic porous alumina that {{was formed by}} anodizing in <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> elec-trolyte (H 2 SeO 4) at various concentrations and voltages was investigated with SEM and AFM imaging. A high purity aluminum foil was anodized in 0. 1 - 3. 0 M <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions at 273 K and at constantcell voltages {{in the range of}} 37 to 51 V. The regularity of the cell arrangement increased with increas-ing anodizing voltage and <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration under conditions of steady oxide growth withoutburning. Anodizing at 42 - 46 V in 3. 0 M <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> produced highly ordered porous alumina. By selec-tive dissolution of the anodic porous alumina, highly ordered convex nanostructures of aluminum withdiameters of 20 nm and heights of 40 nm were exposed at the apexes of each hexagonal dimple array. Highly ordered anodic porous alumina with a cell size of 102 nm from top to bottom can be fabricatedby a two-step <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> anodizing process, that includes the first anodizing step, the selective oxidedissolution, and the second anodizing step...|$|E
40|$|Improvements of the {{regularity}} of {{the arrangement}} of anodic porous alumina formed by <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> anodizing were investigated under various operating conditions. The oxide burning voltage increased with the stirring rate of the <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> solution, and the high applied voltage without oxide burning was achieved by vigorously stirring the solution. The regularity of the porous alumina was improved as the anodizing time and surface flatness increased. Conversely, {{the purity of the}} 99. 5 – 99. 9999 wt % aluminum specimens without second phases of metals and metallic compounds was not affected by the regularity of the porous alumina formed by <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> anodizing. The porous alumina was also self-ordered on/around a defect, such as a grain boundary, under self-ordering high voltage anodizing conditions.

40|$|Anodic porous alumina {{has been}} widely {{investigated}} and used as a nanostructure template in various nanoapplications. The porous structure consists of numerous hexagonal cells perpendicular to the aluminum substrate and each cell has several tens or hundreds of nanoscale pores at its center.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{formation of}} polyaniline (PAn) {{was investigated in}} <b>selenic</b> <b>acid.</b> The cyclic voltammetry of sele-nate in the potential window from — 0. 15 to 0. 8 V, indicates that the electropolymerization of aniline is not affected by the oxidizing ability of <b>selenic</b> <b>acid.</b> The growth rate of PAn observed at a potential of 0. 8 V in a solution of 0. 1 M aniline in 0. 2 M H 2 SeO 4 was comparable with that in 0. 2 M H 2 S 04. However, the PAn growth in H 2 SeO 4 during successive potential cycles between — 0. 15 and 0. 8 V was much lower than that in H 2 S 04. In cyclic voltammograms, the first reduction peak for PAn was enhanced {{by the presence of}} selenate ions, possibly due to the deposition of elemental selenium catalyzed by the polymer film. The deposition of metallic selenium on the PAn film greatly inhibited the growth of the polymer dur— ing successive potential cycling between — 0. 15 and 0. 8 V.

40|$|Na+, K+-ATPase, or the Na+ pump, {{is a key}} {{component}} in {{the maintenance of the}} epithelial phenotype. In most epithelia, the pump is located in the basolateral domain. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the β 1 subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase {{plays an important role in}} this mechanism because homotypic β 1 -β 1 interactions between neighboring cells stabilize the pump in the lateral membrane. However, in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the Na+ pump is located in the apical domain. The mechanism of polarization in this epithelium is unclear. We hypothesized that the apical polarization of the pump in RPE cells depends on the expression of its β 2 subunit. ARPE- 19 cells cultured for up to 8 weeks on inserts did not polarize, and Na+, K+-ATPase was expressed in the basolateral membrane. In the presence of insulin, transferrin and <b>selenic</b> <b>acid</b> (ITS), ARPE- 19 cells cultured for 4 weeks acquired an RPE phenotype, and the Na+ pump was visible in the apical domain. Under these conditions, Western blot analysis was employed to detect the β 2 isoform and immunofluorescence analysis revealed an apparent apical distribution of the β 2 subunit. qPCR results showed a time-dependent increase in the level of β 2 isoform mRNA, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. Moreover, silencing the expression of the β 2 isoform in ARPE- 19 cells resulted in a decrease in the apical localization of the pump, as assessed by the mislocalization of the α 2 subunit in that domain. Our results demonstrate that the apical polarization of Na+, K+-ATPase in RPE cells depends on the expression of the β 2 subunit...|$|E
