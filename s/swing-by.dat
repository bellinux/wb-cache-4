5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This <b>swing-by</b> maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} of high-thrust interplanetary trajectories {{continues to}} draw attention. Especially when both Multiple Gravity Assists (MGA) {{as well as}} Deep Space Maneuvers (DSMs) are included, the optimization is typically very difficult. The search space may be characterized by {{a large number of}} minima and is furthermore very sensitive to small deviations in the decision vector. Various options are available to model these high-thrust trajectories. The trajectory may be modeled using a simple MGA trajectory model as well as using models including DSMs. Both a position and a velocity formulation variant may be adopted and also unpowered or powered <b>swing-bys</b> may be used. These trajectory models were implemented to study the effect of both DSM as well as powered <b>swing-bys.</b> Especially the option to perform DSMs proved to be vital for obtaining good trajectories. Also powered <b>swing-bys</b> may improve the efficiency of the trajectory. The velocity formulation variant proved to be much easier to optimize than the position formulation model. By analyzing the sensitivity and dependency of the various parameters in both models, a proposal for an even better trajectory model is suggested. Also regarding the optimization of these trajectories many options are available. Especially metaheuristics have proven to be very successful in optimizing these trajectories. Various studies have shown the importance of proper tuning of the basic versions of these metaheuristics, which is however often overlooked. This study applied a very rigorous tuning scheme to find the optimal settings for DE, GA and PSO. The results clearly reveal the superiority of DE above other methods. The tuned variants of DE outperformed other settings by one or multiple orders of magnitude, revealing the importance of this tuning scheme. The tuned variants of DE helped to improve a large number of instances in the Global Optimization Trajectory Problem (GTOP) database of ESA. Also the efficiency of these DE variants was shown to be competitive with, and sometimes better than, the best algorithms encountered in literature.

40|$|Mars Sample Return is {{the highest}} {{priority}} science mission {{for the next decade}} as recommended by the 2011 Decadal Survey of Planetary Science. This article presents the results of a feasibility study for a Mars Sample Return mission that efficiently uses emerging commercial capabilities expected to be available in the near future. The motivation of our study was the recognition that emerging commercial capabilities might be used to perform Mars Sample Return with an Earth-direct architecture, and that this may offer a desirable simpler and lower cost approach. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether these capabilities can be used to optimize the number of mission systems and launches required to return the samples, with the goal of achieving the desired simplicity. All of the major element required for the Mars Sample Return mission are described. Mission system elements were analyzed with either direct techniques or by using parametric mass estimating relationships. The analysis shows the feasibility of a complete and closed Mars Sample Return mission design based on the following scenario: A SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch vehicle places a modified version of a SpaceX Dragon capsule, referred to as "Red Dragon", onto a Trans Mars Injection trajectory. The capsule carries all the hardware needed to return to Earth Orbit samples collected by a prior mission, such as the planned NASA Mars 2020 sample collection rover. The payload includes a fully fueled Mars Ascent Vehicle; a fueled Earth Return Vehicle, support equipment, and a mechanism to transfer samples from the sample cache system onboard the rover to the Earth Return Vehicle. The Red Dragon descends to land on the surface of Mars using Supersonic Retropropulsion. After collected samples are transferred to the Earth Return Vehicle, the single-stage Mars Ascent Vehicle launches the Earth Return Vehicle from the surface of Mars to a Mars phasing orbit. After a brief phasing period, the Earth Return Vehicle performs a Trans Earth Injection burn. Once near Earth, the Earth Return Vehicle performs Earth and lunar <b>swing-bys</b> and is placed into a Lunar Trailing Orbit - an Earth orbit, at lunar distance. A retrieval mission then performs a rendezvous with the Earth Return Vehicle, retrieves the sample container, and breaks the chain of contact with Mars by transferring the sample into a sterile and secure container. With the sample contained, the retrieving spacecraft makes a controlled Earth re-entry preventing any unintended release of Martian materials into the Earth's biosphere.

40|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{has recently}} become a viable technology for spacecraft, enabling shorter flight times, fewer required planetary gravity assists, larger payloads, and/or smaller launch vehicles. With the maturation of this technology, however, comes {{a new set}} of challenges in the area of trajectory design. Because low-thrust trajectory optimization has historically required long run-times and significant user-manipulation, mission design has relied on expert-based knowledge for selecting departure and arrival dates, times of flight, and/or target bodies and gravitational <b>swing-bys.</b> These choices are generally based on known configurations that have worked well in previous analyses or simply on trial and error. At the conceptual design level, however, the ability to explore {{the full extent of the}} design space is imperative to locating the best solutions in terms of mass and/or flight times. Beginning in 2005, the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition posed a series of difficult mission design problems, all requiring low-thrust propulsion and visiting one or more asteroids. These problems all had large ranges on the continuous variables - launch date, time of flight, and asteroid stay times (when applicable) - as well as being characterized by millions or even billions of possible asteroid sequences. Even with recent advances in low-thrust trajectory optimization, full enumeration of these problems was not possible within the stringent time limits of the competition. This investigation develops a systematic methodology for determining a broad suite of good solutions to the combinatorial, low-thrust, asteroid tour problem. The target application is for conceptual design, where broad exploration of the design space is critical, with the goal being to rapidly identify a reasonable number of promising solutions for future analysis. The proposed methodology has two steps. The first step applies a three-level heuristic sequence developed from the physics of the problem, which allows for efficient pruning of the design space. The second phase applies a global optimization scheme to locate a broad suite of good solutions to the reduced problem. The global optimization scheme developed combines a novel branch-and-bound algorithm with a genetic algorithm and an industry-standard low-thrust trajectory optimization program to solve for the following design variables: asteroid sequence, launch date, times of flight, and asteroid stay times. The methodology is developed based on a small sample problem, which is enumerated and solved so that all possible discretized solutions are known. The methodology is then validated by applying it to a larger intermediate sample problem, which also has a known solution. Next, the methodology is applied to several larger combinatorial asteroid rendezvous problems, using previously identified good solutions as validation benchmarks. These problems include the 2 nd and 3 rd Global Trajectory Optimization Competition problems. The methodology is shown to be capable of achieving a reduction in the number of asteroid sequences of 6 - 7 orders of magnitude, in terms of the number of sequences that require low-thrust optimization as compared to the number of sequences in the original problem. More than 70 % of the previously known good solutions are identified, along with several new solutions that were not previously reported by any of the competitors. Overall, the methodology developed in this investigation provides an organized search technique for the low-thrust mission design of asteroid rendezvous problems. Ph. D.

40|$|Mars Sample Return (MSR) is {{the highest}} {{priority}} science mission {{for the next decade}} as recommended by the recent Decadal Survey of Planetary Science. This paper presents an overview of a feasibility study for a MSR mission. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether emerging commercial capabilities can be used to reduce the number of mission systems and launches required to return the samples, with the goal of reducing mission cost. The major element required for the MSR mission are described and include an integration of the emerging commercial capabilities with small spacecraft design techniques; new utilizations of traditional aerospace technologies; and recent technological developments. We report the feasibility of a complete and closed MSR mission design using the following scenario that covers three synodic launch opportunities, beginning with the 2022 opportunity: A Falcon Heavy injects a SpaceX Red Dragon capsule and trunk onto a Trans Mars Injection (TMI) trajectory. The capsule is modified to carry all the hardware needed to return samples collected on Mars including a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV); an Earth Return Vehicle (ERV); and hardware to transfer a sample collected in a previously landed rover mission to the ERV. The Red Dragon descends to land on the surface of Mars using Supersonic Retro Propulsion (SRP). After previously collected samples are transferred to the ERV, the single-stage MAV launches the ERV from the surface of Mars to a Mars phasing orbit. The MAV uses a storable liquid, pump fed bi-propellant propulsion system. After a brief phasing period, the ERV, which also uses a storable bi-propellant system, performs a Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn. Once near Earth the ERV performs Earth and lunar <b>swing-bys</b> and is placed into a Lunar Trailing Orbit (LTO 0 - an Earth orbit, at lunar distance. A later mission, using a Dragon and launched by a Falcon Heavy, performs a rendezvous with the ERV in the lunar trailing orbit, retrieves the sample container and breaks the chain of contact with Mars by transferring the sample into a sterile and secure container. With the sample contained, the retrieving spacecraft, makes a controlled Earth re-entry preventing any unintended release of pristine Martian materials into the Earth's biosphere. Other capsule type vehicles and associated launchers may be applicable. The analysis methods employed standard and specialized aerospace engineering tools. Mission system elements were analyzed with either direct techniques or by using parametric mass estimating relationships (MERs). The architecture was iterated until overall mission convergence was achieved on at least one path. Subsystems analyzed in this study include support structures, power system, nose fairing, thermal insulation, actuation devices, MAV exhaust venting, and GN&C. Best practice application of loads, mass growth contingencies, and resource margins were used. For Falcon Heavy capabilities and Dragon subsystems we utilized publically available data from SpaceX; published analyses from other sources; as well as our own engineering and aerodynamic estimates. Earth Launch mass is under 11 mt, which is within the estimated capability of a Falcon Heavy, with margin. Total entry masses between 7 and 10 mt were considered with closure occurring between 9 and 10 mt. Propellant mass fractions for each major phase of the EDL - Entry, Terminal Descent, and Hazard Avoidance - have been derived. An assessment of the entry conditions on the thermal protection system (TPS), currently in use for Dragon missions, has been made. And shows no significant stressors. A useful mass of 2. 0 mt is provided and includes mass growth allowances for the MAV, the ERV, and mission unique equipment. We also report on alternate propellant options for the MAV and options for the ERV, including propulsion systems; crewed versus robotic retrieval mission; as well as direct Earth entry. International Planetary Protection Policies as well as verifiable means of compliance will have a large impact on any MSR mission design. We identify areas within our architecture where such impacts occur.
