5|$|On 31 January 2007, Autolink—Norways largest {{distributor}} of automobiles—bought 40% of Ofotbanen, and transferred their train haulage contract to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Autolink ordered an additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. In June 2007, {{a new report}} from the Rail Inspectorate showed that Ofotbanen had severe safety problems—the company was using engineers without necessary licenses, and was not performing <b>safety</b> <b>analysis.</b> Director of the inspectorate, Erik Ø. Johnsen, stated that the inspectorate {{did not believe that}} Ofotbanen was taking safety seriously. CEO of Ofotbanen, Terje Østensen, felt that the issues taken up by the inspectorate were mere formalities, and that it was difficult to make necessary documentation, stating that in his opinion, none of the procedures criticized actually influenced safety.|$|E

500|$|Drawing from {{research}} performed {{to assess the}} safety of the RHIC collisions, the LHC Safety Study Group, a group of independent scientists, performed a <b>safety</b> <b>analysis</b> of the LHC, and released their findings in the 2003 report Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC. The report concluded that there is [...] "no basis for any conceivable threat". Several of its arguments were based on the predicted evaporation of hypothetical micro black holes by Hawking radiation and on the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model with regard to the outcome of events to be studied in the LHC. One argument raised against doomsday fears was that collisions at energies equivalent to and higher than those of the LHC have been happening in nature for billions of years apparently without hazardous effects, as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays impact Earth's atmosphere and other bodies in the universe.|$|E
40|$|Safety-critical Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) in {{vehicles}} {{are becoming more}} and more complex and interconnected. There is a pressing need for holistic approaches for <b>safety</b> and security <b>analysis</b> to address the challenges. System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a top-down <b>safety</b> hazard <b>analysis</b> method, based on systems theory especially aimed at such systems. In contrast to established approaches, hazards are treated as a control problem rather than a reliability problem. STPA-Sec extends this approach to also include security analysis. However, when we applied STPA-Sec to real world use cases for joint <b>safety</b> and security <b>analysis,</b> a Battery Management System for a hybrid vehicle, we observed several limitations of the security extension. We propose improvements to address these limitations for a combined <b>safety</b> and security <b>analysis.</b> Our improvements lead to a better identi cation of high level security scenarios. We evaluate the feasibility of the improved co-analysis method in a self-optimizing battery management system. We also discuss the general applicability of STPA-Sec to high level <b>safety</b> and security <b>analysis</b> and the relation to automotive cybersecurity standards...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Event tree {{analysis}} {{is a most}} commonly used method in dam <b>safety</b> risk <b>analysis</b> modeling. Available software tools for performing event tree analyses lack the flexibility to efficiently address many important factors in dam <b>safety</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> As {{a result of these}} practical limitations, spreadsheets have been used, sometimes including Visual Basic macros, to perform these analyses. However, this approach lacks generality and can require significant effort to apply to a specific dam or to modify the event tree structure. In response to these limitations, here a generalized event tree analysis tool, DAMRAE (DAM <b>safety</b> Risk <b>Analysis</b> Engine), has been developed. It includes a graphical interface for developing and populating an event tree, and a tool for calculating and post-processing an event tree risk model for dam safety risk assessment in a highly flexible manner. This thesis describes the underlying theoretical and computational logic employed in the current version of DAMRAE, and provides a detailed example of the calculations in the current version of DAMRAE for an application to a US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) dam. The thesis closes with some conclusions about the capabilities of DAMRAE and a summary of plans for its further development...|$|R
