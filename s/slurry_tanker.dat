40|$|Soil {{compaction}} negatively affects soil productivity, fertilizer use {{efficiency and}} water infiltration. The extent of compaction is dependant on soil strength, which {{is influenced by}} the soil moisture content. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the extent of soil compaction (measured by changes in soil bulk density and shear strength) and soil deformation incurred due to a single pass of a tractor and a fully loaded <b>slurry</b> <b>tanker</b> over grassland soils at a range of soil moisture deficits (SMD). The study should identify threshold values of SMD at which adverse soil compaction becomes significant for the soil-crop system. These values may be incorporated into the forecasting and decision making process for slurry spreading. SMD was used as a proxy for volumetric water content. Treatments of a single pass by a Landini Vision 105 tractor and a loaded 7. 2 m³ single axle <b>slurry</b> <b>tanker</b> (total weight of c. 18 tonnes) were conducted on well, moderate and poorly drained grassland soils at forecasted SMD of 0, 5, 10 and 20 mm. The moderately drained soil was classified as a loam, while the well and poorly drained sites were classified as sandy loams. Changes in soil bulk density and torsional shear strength were used as indicators of compaction, with rut profile measurements taken to measure the extent of surface deformation, which is often the most visible indicator of compaction on the soil surface. Grass yields were measured at 30 and 60 days subsequent to trafficking. Results showed that SMD at the time of traffic had an effect on the changes in bulk density, shear strength and the extent of soil rutting following wheel traffic. Preliminary results indicate that higher SMD at the time of trafficking resulted in smaller changes to soil characteristics and more rapid recovery from surface deformation than when trafficking occurred at lower SMD. Trafficking at an SMD of 20 mm led to mean increases in soil bulk density of 8 % and formation of ruts with cross sectional areas in the range of 29. 4 cm² to 98. 3 cm². Trafficking at 0 SMD (field capacity) led to mean increases in bulk density of 15 % and the formation of rut profiles in the range of 91. 6 cm² to 197. 9 cm². These preliminary results indicate that forecasted SMD provides a valuable tool to determine the suitability of the soil for supporting farm vehicle operations such as slurry spreading. This study is still ongoing, with more detailed results and analysis to be forthcoming. ...|$|E
40|$|Hog manure is a {{heterogeneous}} suspension of solid particles (dug) in a liquid matrix (urine), {{which tends to}} separate during storage. Therefore, rapid analysis at haul-out time is necessary to obtain a good nutrient management using manure. In this study, the effectiveness of near-infrared (NIR) technology for rapid, on-site analysis of the nutrient content in hog manure was evaluated. A Zeiss Corona 1. 7 VISNIR diode array instrument with an OMK measuring head, was calibrated against wet chemistry data using 169 diverse hog manure samples collected from farms {{in the northern part}} of Belgium. Dry matter content (DM), organic matter content (OM), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 -N), total phosphorous (P), potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and pH were measured. Correlation coefficients (r) between predicted and measured concentration values ranged from 0. 367 for pH to 0. 834 for K. Ratios of data range to standard error of prediction (SEP) varied from 6. 6 for Na to 10. 3 for TKN. Based on the individual correlation coefficients and ratios we conclude that NIR techniques will allow us to make valuable quantitative predictions for total N, NH 4 -N, K and OM, and approximate predictions for DM, Ca, P and Mg. However, prediction of Na and pH requires further investigation. Mounting this diode array instrument on a <b>slurry</b> <b>tanker</b> might enable environmentally and economically sound nutrient management. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe French {{stock of}} organic {{spreader}} evolves and presents differences by their users. Cuma and agricultural work companies {{are the main}} operators which buy machines and provide spreading services for farmers. Individual sales are currently at a low level. The market decreases in units sold but prices increase. In this context, operators renew spreaders after 7 - 8 years and over 10 years for tankers, replacing small machines with bigger ones. Cuma use mostly vertical rotors spreaders for solid organic fertilisers and big <b>slurry</b> <b>tankers</b> for liquid organic fertilisers. Application rate equipment is {{at a level of}} confidential use. Agricultural work companies, when they are specialized in spreading, use mostly spreading table spreader, the biggest <b>slurry</b> <b>tankers</b> on the market and also all type of self-propelled machines. They adopt more easily application rate equipment as they have to respect more constraints for spreading than farmers and the possibility to get easier cost amortization due to a high intensive activity...|$|R
40|$|Shallow {{injection}} of slurry on grassland can reduce ammonia emissions compared to surface spreading and increase plant nitrogen utilisation. Other advantages include enhanced silage quality and lower odour. Disadvantages include higher investment costs, increased draught requirements and potential crop damage. The {{objective of this}} thesis was to determine appropriate techniques for slurry injection into ley that would minimise ammonia emissions, contamination of crops and energy inputs, while resulting in high plant utilisation of slurry nitrogen. Slurry injector performance was validated in field trials. Conventional <b>slurry</b> <b>tankers</b> with different types of injectors were used to shallow-inject (less than 0. 05 m) slurry into open slots after the first cut. Slurry placement after spreading, ammonia volatilisation, yield and crop nitrogen uptake were measured and compared {{to the results of}} band spreading. In the first year, silage quality and an economic analysis were also included. Only one injector, with double disc tines, could place the slurry below the soil surface in all three soils tested. Ammonia release was on average 39 % of the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) applied, half the level with band spreading, but this did not result in higher dry matter (DM) yield o...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLand {{application}} of manures and slurries {{are a major}} source of pollution such as water contamination by nitrates and greenhouse gas emissions. NH 3 and N 2 O emissions can be lowered by suitable spreading techniques. However, a comprehensive review of the impact of slurry spreading techniques is lacking. For that we developed a model, named OSEEP, that simulates the effect of slurry incorporation, slurry spatial distribution, and soil compaction on NH 3 and N 2 O emissions. OSEEP integrates a soil compaction model, a hydraulic pedotransfer function, a NH 3 volatilization model, and a crop model. We ran OSEEP for five sites in France for 7  years. Four techniques were simulated: broadcast spreading, band spreading, incorporation after surface spreading, and injection. We tested various sizes of <b>slurry</b> <b>tankers</b> and tractors. We calculated NH 3 and N 2 O relative emissions from various spreading techniques with respect to band spreading. Results show good agreement between model calculation and published field data. We found that slurry applied by a self-propelled 15 -m 3 tanker with extra large tires led to an increase of 20  % in N 2 O emission, by comparison with a 15 -m 3 tanker trailed by a tractor. Hence, we show that soil compaction should be taken into account to optimize trade-offs between NH 3 and N 2 O emissions...|$|R
40|$|Shallow slurry {{injection}} {{is considered}} to be {{the most efficient way to}} reduce the ammonia emission by agriculture, but its performance is highly dependent on the injection depth. An automatic electro-hydraulic depth control system was developed to maintain the injection depth within narrow margins around the desired value. it utilised the hydraulic system of the four-point linkage of the <b>slurry</b> <b>tanker</b> to change the position of the injector with respect to the tanker in order to minimise the difference between the desired height of the supporting frame of the injector and the height measured by means of an ultrasonic sensor. Based on a grey-box model, the performance of different control algorithms was compared by simulation with this model. Although the bandwidth of the system with a lead compensator was slightly larger than with a proportional controller for a linearised model structure, the performance of both controllers was comparable when actuator saturation was taken into account. Because of its simplicity, the proportional controller was implemented. Comparison of the performance of the depth control system with the commercially available pressure control system on two fields with a high and a low soil penetration resistance showed that the depth control system outperforms the pressure control system in terms of overall mean error (51 - 78 % more accurate) and standard deviation (16 - 44 % less variation) for all parallel runs.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the extent of soil damage caused by field traffic associated with different levels of soil moisture deficit (SMD). The hybrid SMD model was used for computing temporal patterns of SMD which can be accurately predicted {{for a range of}} soil types in Ireland. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine SMD threshold limits to trafficability for incorporation into a decision support system for safe slurry spreading. A tractor and a fully loaded single-axle <b>slurry</b> <b>tanker</b> (total weight ca. 18 tonnes) were driven over well, moderate and poorly drained soils at SMD values of 0, 5, 10 and 20 mm during drying phases. The change in soil bulk density (SBD) was used as an indicator of soil compaction, and rut profile measurements were taken to determine soil deformation indicative of surface damage. The effect of traffic on the grass crop was determined by measuring dry matter yield at 30 and 60 days posttraffic in the wheel-rut and nontrafficked area. Results showed that the SMD at the time of traffic had a significant (P < 0. 05) effect on the magnitude of the changes in SBD on soils of different drainage status, and on rut dimensions following traffic. DMY was significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced on the wheeled compared with the nonwheeled soil. No differences in the magnitude of DMY loss were identified between the sites having different drainage status. An SMD value of 10 mm was suggested as an SMD threshold for trafficability for safe slurry spreading purposes. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{diode array}} near {{infrared}} (NIR) spectrometer {{that can be}} mounted on a mobile agricultural machine was tested under lab conditions for its effectiveness as a rapid, on-site hog (Sus domesticus) manure composition sensor. One hundred and sixty nine diverse hog manures, collected from farms {{in the northern part}} of Belgium, were assayed by conventional wet chemical analysis and spectroscopy for the following constituents: dry matter content, organic matter content, pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, calcium, sodium and magnesium. Samples were scanned (two fills, three measurements each) on a Zeiss Corona 1. 7 VisNIR diode array instrument equipped with an OMK measuring head, ranging between 400 and 1700 nm (five scans per measurement) using a sample cell (50 mm diameter) for diffuse reflectance scanning from the bottom. Based on the absorbance-constituent and constituent-constituent correlations, the constituents were divided into two groups: one for those in the solids (dung) and one for those in the liquid (urine). The pH was not correlated to any other constituent and, therefore, treated separately. Partial least squares calibrations were developed for the constituent groups and for each of the constituents separately using leave-one-out cross-validation, showing a common spectral basis for each constituent group. To investigate the possibility of developing a cost-effective sensor, regression calibrations were developed using a few wavelengths selected based on the partial least squares regression and validated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results demonstrated that: (1) approximate quantitative predictions can be made for total N, NH 4 -N and K, (2) a discrimination between high and low values can be made for DM, OM, P and Mg, (3) prediction of Ca, Na and pH are not possible (yet), (4) one measurement and one filling of the cup give a reliable measurement, (5) a cost-effective sensor measuring only a few appropriately selected wavelengths might be able to give comparable results, (6) further work will be necessary to optimise sample presentation and calibration procedures and (7) mounting a diode array instrument on a <b>slurry</b> <b>tanker</b> can make environmentally and economically sound nutrient management possible. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In 1991 the European Commission stated its {{directive}} (91 / 676 /EEC) {{to protect}} the ground and surface water from pollution with nitrate from agricultural sources. This directive states that a limit of 50 mg NO 3 - per L ground or surface water should not be exceeded. To reach this objective limits have {{been placed on the}} amount of fertilizer that {{can be applied to the}} soil (170 kg/ha in vulnerable zones). This places serious pressure on the animal producing farmers. On the other hand, crop producing farmers still need good nutrient availability in the soil to obtain high crop productivities. Therefore, this research focusses on the development of a precise manure application system, which could make manure a viable alternative for a large part of the current artificial fertiliser use. For this purpose an on-line manure composition sensor is developed based on VIS/NIR spectroscopy. Since other researchers have used different sample presentation modes for the spectroscopic analysis of manure, the effect of the transflectance and reflectance sample presentation modes on the performance of the spectroscopic manure composition measurement has been investigated in the lab. Although the transflectance performs slightly better, it was concluded that the reflectance mode is the best choice for on-line manure composition measurement. Apart from the different sample presentation modes, there are also different types of sensors available with different wavelength ranges and measurement principles. Therefore, the performance of four different instruments has been compared for the spectroscopic manure analysis. A mobile diode array instrument ranging from 306 to 1710 nm has been selected for the on-line manure analysis. This sensor has then been calibrated by means of partial least squares regression (PLS) in cross-validation on a set of 420 pig manure samples and the prediction performance has been evaluated for an independent set of 164 pig manures. The measurement accuracy was compared to the accuracy of the lab analysis and to the variation of the composition with the depth in the storage facility. Although the spectroscopic sensor was 3 to 8 times less precise than the lab analysis, it was concluded that the composition measured at a certain depth in the storage facility by means of the spectroscopic sensor would be 2 to 4 times more representative for the true composition than using one lab value for the complete storage facility and thus useful for precise manure application. The sensor will have to work during manure injection in the field under varying conditions of ambient and sample temperature. Therefore, the significance of these temperature effects on the different parts of the spectrum has been investigated by means of a functional analysis of variance approach (FANOVA). Based on this analysis the significantly temperature sensitive regions have been removed and the feasibility of a more temperature robust calibration has been investigated. It was concluded that the sensor can be made more robust to temperature variations with a minimal loss of prediction power. Now that the sensor had been calibrated in the lab and made robust to temperature variations, it has been mounted on a <b>slurry</b> <b>tanker</b> and some preliminary experiments with on-line manure composition measurement have been performed. The on-line sensor is now being combined with a newly developed manure injection control system. In this way, a composition-dependent precise manure application system is being developed. status: publishe...|$|E
