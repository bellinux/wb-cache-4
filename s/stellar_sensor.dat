40|$|This {{projects}} {{is part of}} a national project, co-ordinated by the University of Rome, concerning the use of micro and nanotechnologies for small aerospace vehicles. In this framework, the specific project of the research unit at the University of Naples “Federico II” is the design, prototype development and preliminary test of an autonomous navigation system for small aerospace vehicles based on the use of microtechnology (MEMS Technology). In particular, a strapdown navigation system based on the integration of miniature inertial sensors with an advanced <b>stellar</b> <b>sensor</b> will be analysed for application on board microsatellites and UAVs. In addition, the MEMS technology trend will be analysed to assess the possibilities of such a system to perform the navigation of future nanosatellites and microUAVs...|$|E
40|$|Nano Star Tracker on Chip (STC) {{is under}} {{development}} by Azmerit ltd. and Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Lomonosov Moscow State University (SAI MSU). This <b>stellar</b> <b>sensor</b> is designed {{first of all}} for micro and nano satellites, but {{can also be used}} on larger spacecrafts. Its dimensions, which are 73 × 57 × 23 mm (or about 30 × 30 × 50 mm in another embodiment), its weight, which is less than 65 g, and its average power consumption of 250 mW (1 W peak) enable to use it in a CubeSat satellites. The STC offers a set of standard interfaces (RS 485, RS 232, etc.) and accepts input voltages of 3. 3 V to 5 V. The features of STC are: 1) focus mainly on the Russian market of small satellites, thus it is assumed to use mostly the Russian electronic components while manufacturing, 2) STC has a high attitude accuracy, which is achieved through a more complicated image processing, allowing of taking into account the systematic errors. It is expected that the use of CMOS photo sensor with size of 128 × 128 pixels and with an update rate of 10 Hz gives the attitude error σXY 102 ̆ 2. For a sensor of 768 × 768 pixels size error drops to σXY 12 ̆ 2. Attitude accuracy improvement technique was developed in the SAI MSU. Azmerit ltd. is engaged in the manufacture and commercialization of STC...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} analysis and preliminary design of an integrated system for autonomous attitude state determination of spacecrafts based on the fusion of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System) gyros with an advanced CMOS-based star sensor. In the integration scheme the star sensor is used as aiding sensor. Sensor data fusion is performed by means of Kalman filtering, following {{a detailed analysis of}} star trackers and gyros measurement errors. As a consequence, the integrated system performances are estimated by covariance propagation. In particular, the steady state error covariance for different inertial and <b>stellar</b> <b>sensor</b> typologies and aiding sensor update intervals is numerically analysed, in order to evaluate different sensor configurations considering the performances of sensors available in the market. Analysis results will help in selecting the star sensor data rate and the updating frequency to be used for the inertial sensor aiding. The study is performed considering the following sensor physical parameters: gyros drift rate, resolution and bias stability; star sensor sensitivity, detection limit, field-of-view and instantaneous field of view; star catalogue size and coverage. The above parameters are modelled with reference to state-of-art MEMS gyros and MOS and CMOS-based star sensors. Results show that stellar-inertial sensors for coarse/medium (0. 01 °) and high (< 0. 001 °) attitude accuracy applications can be obtained by integrating, respectively, MEMS silicon vibrating gyros with CMOS-based star sensor and fyber optic gyros with MOS-based star sensors. Finally, preliminary analysis also shows that integrated systems with mass of about 2 kg and power consumption lower than 15 W can be realised, that are adequate for microsatellite applications.

40|$|A {{compilation}} of analytical and experimental data is presented concerning the <b>stellar</b> figure <b>sensor.</b> The sensor is an interferometric device {{which is located}} in the focal plane of an orbiting large space telescope (LST). The device was designed to perform interferometry on the optical wavefront of a single star after it has propagated through the LST. An analytical model of the device was developed and its accuracy was verified by an operating laboratory breadboard. A series of linear independent control equations were derived which define the operations required for utilizing a focal plane figure sensor in the control loop for the secondary mirror position and for active control of the primary mirror...|$|R
40|$|Charge {{transfer}} devices (CTDs) {{are superior}} to the image dissector as <b>stellar</b> tracking <b>sensors,</b> considering their low voltage requirements, insensitivity to magnetic fields, good linearity, and low weight and power. An analysis of one type of CTD, called the charge injection device (CID), revealed an X-Y addressing capability which provides exceptional flexibility in array readout and results in enhanced S/N capability, a surface channel device which produces a larger dynamic range of operation, and exceptional and unique tolerance to optical overloads. A 128 row by 128 column CID array processed on silicon was evaluated in a cooled breadboard camera, and measured results indicate projected performance parameters of a large area CID array as follows: 20 micron square sensing site, noise not greater than 25 carriers per pixel, quantum yield of approximately 40 % from 0. 4 to 1. 0 micron, and cooling requirements {{on the order of}} 0 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|The large lunar {{telescope}} is a proposed moon-based telescope which incorporates a sixteen-meter segmented primary mirror. An error budget is {{developed for the}} active control system of the primary mirror. A control methodology for the primary mirror is then described which utilizes piston sensors for measuring the relative piston error between adjacent segments {{as well as a}} separate sensor which measures the tilt of each segment with respect to the pointing direction of the telescope. A trade study is conducted in which the following types of tilt sensors are examined to determine their applicability to this program: <b>stellar</b> wavefront <b>sensors,</b> such as a Hartmann-Shack or a shearing interferometer; holographic optical elements; interferometers; scanning systems; and some nonoptical systems which electronically measure the relative tilt between adjacent segments. In addition, two independent methods of quantitatively verifying the performance of the telescope using either a phase retrieval algorithm or an image sharpening technique, both of which are based on the quality of a stellar image, are presented...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} Charge Injection Device (CID) <b>stellar</b> tracking <b>sensor</b> and {{an operating}} sensor in a control/readout electronics board were developed. The sensor {{consists of a}} shift register scanned, 256 x 256 CID array organized for readout of 4 x 4 subarrays. The 4 x 4 subarrays can be positioned anywhere within the 256 x 256 array with a 2 pixel resolution. This allows continuous tracking {{of a number of}} stars simultaneously since nine pixels (3 x 3) centered on any star can always be read out. Organization and operation of this sensor and the improvements in design and semiconductor processing are described. A hermetic package incorporating an internal thermoelectric cooler assembled using low temperature solders was developed. The electronics board, which contains the sensor drivers, amplifiers, sample hold circuits, multiplexer, analog to digital converter, and the sensor temperature control circuits, is also described. Packaged sensors were evaluated for readout efficiency, spectral quantum efficiency, temporal noise, fixed pattern noise, and dark current.
