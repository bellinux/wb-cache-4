5|$|In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, {{told his}} son {{that not only}} must he gain {{admission}} to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also gain a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that {{it was on the}} <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{interaction}} can {{be measured}} by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} {{a strong and}} varied reaction from reviewers. Most heaped praise on the scenes featuring Karofsky, both the {{events leading up to}} his suicide attempt and when Kurt (Chris Colfer) visited him in the hospital. However, many felt the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> storyline unbalanced the episode, {{and the rest of the}} episode, particularly the Regionals competition and the Rachel and Finn wedding storyline, did not measure up. The final scene, which ended with Quinn (Dianna Agron) being in a potentially fatal car crash, was controversial.|$|E
50|$|Overall <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> missile {{are long}} range, speed, sea-skimming {{capabilities}} {{and a powerful}} warhead.|$|R
30|$|<b>Strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{systematic}} review are {{the large number}} of patients studied in the selected studies (n = 10, 060) and the structured analysis and appraisal of the available literature.|$|R
30|$|The <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{study design}} were the {{supervision}} of epidemiological and microbiological data in NHs and the usefulness of molecular typing techniques to elucidate the epidemiology of influenza cross-contamination.|$|R
5|$|The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> report {{subsequently}} gained Harvey {{a position}} as senior marine officer aboard , the 27,000ton flagship of the British battlecruiser fleet. Lion had eight 13.5-inch guns and Harvey was stationed in an office under Q turret directing their operation and fire. Under her new commander, Rear-Admiral David Beatty, Harvey served as the senior marine officer on board into the First World War, his first military campaign.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{indications}} that the other detainees being held at facilities throughout the world (e.g., Bagram Air Base and black sites), might use the Supreme Court's ruling to challenge their treatment. Their reasoning may be that since the Geneva Conventions afforded protection to Hamdan, its other protections might be effective for them as well. Commentators expressed mixed opinions about the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> argument.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
30|$|Discussion: <b>Strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{series are}} (1) the similar {{severity}} of SIRS and sepsis groups, (2) a multicenter design and (3) {{the use of}} a multivariate method adapted to the high number of independent variables.|$|R
50|$|The <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{procedure}} {{are that}} participants {{have a limited}} time to think, so if they are more aware/alert, they should make more correct responses. It has also been hypothesized to be impacted by alertness, but resilient to practice effects.|$|R
30|$|<b>Strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study include its nested case–control design, {{which allowed}} for the {{identification}} of statin use before the diagnosis of OID. Additionally, an electronic prescription record was utilized, obviating the need to rely on self-reported medication use which may be historically inaccurate.|$|R
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other radical Marxist policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. However, he ruled over a nation with a deep Islamic religious culture and {{a long history of}} resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control, and consequently many of these reforms were not actually implemented nationwide. Popular resentment of Taraki's drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout the country, reducing government control to only a limited area. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan civil war.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its weakness is that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E

50|$|The main <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> trilogy are {{considered}} by many writer admirers and critics — notably Graham Greene, Alan Judd and William Gass — to be its impressionistic qualities, its creation of a believable approximation of Tudor English and its successful creation of atmosphere.|$|R
30|$|Discussion Our {{study is}} {{sufficiently}} powered {{to detect a}} significant difference in microaspiration of gastric contents between patients intubated with conical-cuffed tracheal tubes and standard-cuffed tracheal tubes. One <b>of</b> the <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study is the use of quantitative measurement of pepsin as a marker of microaspiration.|$|R
5|$|Up till now, the Muslim {{army had}} adopted a largely {{defensive}} strategy, but {{knowing that the}} Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now {{decided to take the}} offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All the cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cavalry group was now about 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, Wadi-ur-Ruqqad at west, Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site {{from year to year}} is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E
30|$|<b>Strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study {{include the}} {{condensed}} time frame with minimal time investment in an already overcrowded curriculum, demonstration of knowledge retention that persisted after the immediate post-training assessment, and {{relative lack of}} expense to recreate {{with the use of}} volunteer faculty instructors and volunteer ultrasound scanning models.|$|R
30|$|This paper makes {{significant}} contributions {{to the understanding of}} entrepreneurial perceptions among students. One <b>of</b> the key <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study is that it is based {{on a wide range of}} data for students from 10 different countries. Thus, the results are not culturally related but reflect more globally oriented intentions.|$|R
50|$|Sanam is a 1997 Hindi drama film {{directed}} and produced by Aziz Sejawal. While written by Anees Bazmee, it starred Sanjay Dutt, Manisha Koirala, Vivek Mushran, Anupam Kher, Dalip Tahil, Kader Khan, Anjan Srivastav, Gulshan Grover and Shakti Kapoor. The music, composed by Anand-Milind, {{was the biggest}} <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> film.|$|R
5|$|The Ellesmere Canal {{company had}} been {{constructing}} canals to the west, linking Llangollen to Frankton, but the route from there to Chester had not been decided. In 1796, they obtained an Act of Parliament, authorising a line from near the great aqueduct at Pontcysyllte running roughly northwards through Ruabon, Bersham, Gwersyllt and Pulford to join the River Dee opposite the canal basin at Chester. The Chester company, {{who were trying to}} put their financial affairs into order, noticed that the 1796 Act failed to mention a connection with their canal. They decided to obtain an Act to enforce a connection, and to stop supplying water to the Wirral line. The Ellesmere company responded quickly, agreeing to make changes to their Act, and the Chester company continued to supply water. On the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> they were also able to raise some money to put the canal into good order and to repay some of their debts. The Ellesmere company extended their canal eastwards from Frankton to Whitchurch, and in 1802, the two companies reached agreement on a line from near Whitchurch to Hurleston Junction, just to the north of Nantwich. It opened on 25 March 1805, and water supply was enhanced by the construction of a navigable feeder through Llangollen to Horseshoe Falls on the River Dee at Llantisilio.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} pilot {{episode was}} made, with a refined format, {{although it was}} never broadcast. A new British television channel, Channel 4, was due to launch in November 1982, and bought the newly renamed Countdown on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> additional episode. Countdown was the first programme to be broadcast on the new channel.|$|E
25|$|Ceremony gained {{immediate}} and long-term acceptance when returning Vietnam war veterans {{took to the}} novel's theme of coping, healing and reconciliation between races and people that share the trauma of military actions. It was largely on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work that critic Alan Velie named Silko one of his Four Native American Literary Masters, along with N. Scott Momaday, Gerald Vizenor and James Welch.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{contribution}} that village appraisals can make to sustainable development in local communities in rural areas. Based upon {{an evaluation of}} the JIGSO initiative, it both outlines the <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> approach and argues for the necessity of proper community infrastructure if most benefit is to be gained from it...|$|R
30|$|The <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{systematic}} review consist of the registration of its a priori protocol in PROSPERO [38, 39], its exhaustive literature search, its improved analytical methods [22], {{the use of}} the GRADE approach [25] to assess the quality of the meta-evidence, and the transparent provision of the study’s data [24, 40].|$|R
30|$|Ultimate shear <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> {{concrete}} <b>This</b> study {{uses the}} results of tests on specimens to determine the modification coefficient of the shear-span to depth ratio (Eq. (18)) for use in Eq. (17). The recommended equation for the ultimate shear <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> concrete in <b>this</b> study considers {{the effect of the}} shear-span to depth ratio to provide accurate forecasting results.|$|R
25|$|In early 1931, James {{auditioned for}} the record shop owner and talent scout H. C. Speir in Jackson, Mississippi. Speir placed blues {{performers}} with various record labels, including Paramount Records. On the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> audition, James traveled to Grafton, Wisconsin, to record for Paramount. His 1931 records are considered idiosyncratic among prewar blues recordings and {{formed the basis of}} his reputation as a musician.|$|E
25|$|The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> artistic {{movement}} {{was such that}} it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico’s identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having {{an effect on the}} global stage.|$|E
25|$|All {{tarantula}} hawks derive {{protection from}} their convergent coloration. Female tarantula hawks benefit from fellow females educating potential predators {{to stay away}} with their painful stings. Male tarantula hawks, which are stingless, benefit from their resemblance to females. Other species also gain protection through both Müllerian and Batesian mimicry of tarantula hawks. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mimicry speaks to the defensive power of the Hemipepsis sting.|$|E

50|$|One <b>of</b> the <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> code {{is that it}} handles non-periodic {{boundary}} conditions in a natural way, {{without the use of}} super-cells, but can equally well handle periodic and partially periodic {{boundary conditions}}. Another key strength is that it is readily amenable to efficient massive parallelization, making it highly effective for very large systems.|$|R
30|$|The <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{evaluation}} are {{the high}} number of patients treated over 18  years, the completeness of treatment data and the fact that no patients were excluded from the analysis. Potential drawbacks of the study are that this is a retrospective unicenter analysis and that we have no standardized data concerning best response and progression-free-survival.|$|R
