5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793.

Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E

Through the pressure from these colonists, in October the same year the National Assembly adopted new draft constitutions for the overseas territories (which were in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ones adopted by the National Assembly in April 1946).|$|R
40|$|First-principles {{study of}} BO 2 complex in B-doped Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) reveals a novel, self-trapping-enhanced carrier {{recombination}} mechanism, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard fixed-level Shockley-Read-Hall theory for carrier recombination. We {{found that an}} O 2 dimer, distant from any B, would cause only weak carrier recombination under illumination [...] only enough to drive its diffusion to find B and form the BO 2 complexes. Surprisingly, BO 2 and O 2 produce nearly identical defect gap states. Despite this, recombination at BO 2 is substantially faster than that at O 2, because the charge state of the latter inhibits hole capture, the key step for such recombination...|$|R

5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, {{as part of his}} doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E
5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earl, Fisher was a {{teetotaler}} and a vegetarian, and he hoped {{she would be a}} calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, {{an explanation of}} almost 200 glyphs. His work {{was believed to be}} authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E

The poems from the second period of his career, which includes all the work after Snow Grains (Ssarangnun) until the published collection of Foxtails (Gangajipul), focus upon the purity of natural phenomena, celebrating it as such devoid from the artifice and pretense that contaminates the world constructed by man. Park’s poetry from his third stage of writing, after the publication of Foxtails (Gangajipul) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publication of Baekbarui Kkotdaegung, provides a <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poems of the two previous stages of Park’s career.
