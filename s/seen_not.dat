5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus {{published}} Species Plantarum, {{the work}} {{which is now}} internationally accepted {{as the starting point}} of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753. The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year. The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species. The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> wearing the order's insignia.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children {{would not be allowed to}} go with her.|$|E

25|$|If {{religious}} {{exercises are}} held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage....

25|$|In 1951, the {{proportion}} of adult women who were (or had been) married was 75%; more specifically, 84.8% of {{women between the ages}} of 45 and 49 were married. At that time: “marriage was more popular than ever before.” In 1953, a popular book of advice for women states: “A happy marriage may be <b>seen,</b> <b>not</b> as a holy state or something to which a few may luckily attain, but rather as the best course, the simplest, and the easiest way of life for us all”.|$|E

25|$|Examples of {{the public}} service model include BBC in Britain, and the ABC and SBS in Australia. The {{political}} function and effect of modes of public communication has traditionally continued with the dichotomy between Hegelian State and civil society. The dominant theory of this mode includes the liberal theory of the free press. However, the public service, state-regulated model, whether publicly or privately funded, has always been <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> as a positive good but as an unfortunate necessity imposed by the technical limitations of frequency scarcity.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{response}} to the SDI during the period March 1983 through November 1985 provided indications of {{their view of the}} program both as a threat and as an opportunity to weaken NATO. SDI was likely <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> only {{as a threat to the}} physical security of the Soviet Union, but also as part of an effort by the United States to seize the strategic initiative in arms controls by neutralizing the military component of Soviet strategy. The Kremlin, however, masked their real concerns, advocating that space-based missile defenses would make nuclear war inevitable.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of ATG {{can easily be}} <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> only during day-night-day transitions, but also under dynamic lighting conditions when rapidly changing from low light to high light conditions (above 1 lx), such as sudden illumination of dark room. A typical advantage of ATG is best felt when using a weapon sight which experiences a flame burst during shooting (see figures below showing pictures taken at the impact zone of a dropped bomb). ATG would reduce the temporary blindness that a standard BSP tube would introduce, allowing them to continuously maintain “eyes on target”.|$|E

25|$|Particle physics codified {{the basic}} laws of {{dynamics}} into the standard model. This is formulated as a {{quantum field theory}} that has CPT symmetry, i.e., the laws are invariant under simultaneous operation of time reversal, parity and charge conjugation. However, time reversal itself is <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> to be a symmetry (this is usually called CP violation). There are two possible origins of this asymmetry, one through the mixing of different flavours of quarks in their weak decays, the second through a direct CP violation in strong interactions. The first is seen in experiments, the second is strongly constrained by the non-observation of the EDM of a neutron.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of younger dramatists such as John Marston and Ben Jonson is <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> {{only in the}} problem plays, which dramatise intractable human problems of greed and lust, {{but also in the}} darker tone of the Jacobean tragedies. The Marlovian, heroic mode of the Elizabethan tragedies is gone, replaced by a darker vision of heroic natures caught in environments of pervasive corruption. As a sharer in both the Globe and in the King's Men, Shakespeare never wrote for the boys' companies; however, his early Jacobean work is markedly influenced by the techniques of the new, satiric dramatists. One play, Troilus and Cressida, may even have been inspired by the War of the Theatres.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he was not}} {{eager to}} cling to his {{position}} in government, Buenaventura nonetheless stated that the stability of a fixed six-year term for a central bank governor {{was more important than}} the actual person sitting on the chair. Philippine governance was already under attack from the international community; it was <b>seen</b> <b>not</b> merely as unstable, but downright whimsical, depending on the mood of whoever was wielding the power at any given moment. Buenaventura thus refused to resign, even as a courtesy to the new president. It was at this time that he made public his second career: counting the years, months, weeks, days and minutes {{to the end of his}} six-year term.|$|E
