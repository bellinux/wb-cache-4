40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{experimental}} evaluation of different friction factor correlations for water flow through packed beds of spherical and non-spherical particles at ambient temperature. The experiments were performed by measuring the pressure drop across the bed. Packed beds made of monosized glass spherical particles of seven different diameters were used, as well as beds made of 16 fractions of quartz filtration sand obtained by sieving (polydisperse non-spherical particles). The range of bed voidages was 0. 359 – 0. 486, while the range of bed particle Reynolds numbers was from 0. 3 to 286 for spherical particles and from 0. 1 to 50 for non-spherical particles. The obtained results were compared using a number of available literature correlations. In order to improve the correlation results for spherical particles, a new simple equation was proposed {{in the form of}} Ergun’s equation, with modified coefficients. The new correlation had a mean absolute deviation between experimental and calculated values of pressure drop of 9. 04 %. For non-spherical quartz filtration sand particles the best fit was obtained using Ergun’s equation, with a mean absolute deviation of 10. 36 %. <b>Surface-volume</b> <b>diameter</b> (dSV) necessary for correlating the data for filtration sand particles was calculated based on correlations for dV = f(dm) and Ψ = f(dm).

40|$|Powders are {{important}} commodities across different industries, {{such as the}} food and pharmaceutical industries. In these industries, powders are usually made, mixed, milled, packaged, and stored; these operations require the powders to move and flow under desired conditions and different stress levels. Failure to flow will cause hindrances to production; therefore knowledge of powder flow or flowability is important. There is a constant demand for accurate, reliable, and robust measurement and characterization methods for powder flowability. Powders behave differently under varying conditions; the behaviour of a powder is influenced by particle size distribution, and powder handling and processing conditions. There is to date no one “standard” method to characterize powder flowability; {{it is common to}} use a variety of methods and devices to measure flow properties and provide insight into the behaviour and flow characteristics of powders under different conditions. The flow properties of model food and mineral powders were measured and assessed by shear testing, compression via tapping, fluidization, and powder tumbling. Shear testing was done with an annular shear cell following Jenike (1964) and Berry, Bradley and McGregor (2014). Compression via tapping was performed according to a procedure in the dairy industry (Niro, 1978) and the European Pharmacopoeia (Schüssele & Bauer-Brandl, 2003). Fluidization was used to measure powder bed expansion and bed collapse following the powder classification framework provided by Geldart and co-workers (Geldart, 1973; Geldart, Harnby, & Wong, 1984; Geldart & Wong, 1984, 1985). Powder tumbling was performed in a novel Gravitational Displacement Rheometer, GDR, which measured the motion and avalanche activity of powders that moved under their own weight when rotated in a cylinder at different drum speed levels. The flow data from each characterization method were evaluated individually with regards to particle size distribution and then assessed collectively. The findings presented and discussed include the i) demonstration of the dominant influence of <b>surface-volume</b> mean particle <b>diameter</b> on powder flow properties, ii) characterization of flowability based on Jenike’s arbitrary flow divisions, iii) development of new correlations for the estimation of powder cohesion and bulk density at low preconsolidation stresses, iv) demonstration of hopper outlet diameter as a measure of flowability, v) demonstration of the limited utility of Hausner ratio as a flowability index, vi) substantiation of von Neumann ratio as a sensitive and useful indicator for identifying the onset of bubbling in fluidized beds using bed pressure fluctuation data, and vii) demonstration of the utility of standard deviation of the GDR load cell signal as an indicator of powder avalanche activity. These findings provide improved understanding and knowledge of powder flowability; they can be used to assist and facilitate the development of new techniques and solutions relevant to the handling and processing of powders especially in the food and pharmaceutical industries...|$|R
