25|$|Any <b>single</b> <b>card</b> may be lead. Players {{must follow}} suit {{if they have}} cards in the same suit; if a trump card is lead, other players must play a trump card, if they still have any. The highest trump, or, if no trump is played, the highest-ordered card of the suit lead takes the trick. In case of ties, the first highest card played wins the trick.|$|E
25|$|Cards are dealt {{either from}} one or two {{handheld}} decks, from a dealer's shoe, or from a shuffling machine. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a <b>single</b> <b>card</b> to the dealer, followed by an additional card {{to each of the}} positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in single-deck games).|$|E
25|$|The {{new system}} was {{announced}} as a touch on / touch off system, where two validations are required per journey; one when boarding and again when alighting, {{similar to the}} London Underground's Oyster card system. This means passengers would have a <b>single</b> <b>card</b> and be charged for the actual fare used (flat rate fare). This is unlike Metcard where passengers who travel into different zones at different days and times may need to buy several types of Metcards beforehand.|$|E

25|$|The dealer {{leads the}} first trick with any <b>single</b> <b>card</b> or {{combinations}} of cards, {{and the game}} proceeds like most trick-taking games, where players take turn to play their cards in a counter-clockwise direction, and the player who plays the highest-ordered card or combination of cards take the trick and leads the next round. All cards taken by the declarers may be discarded {{for the rest of}} the round; point cards taken by the opponents count towards their number of points collected, and should be kept, but other cards may be similarly discarded.|$|E
25|$|Each hand {{consists}} {{of a number of}} tricks (the 4-handed game contains 13 tricks using all 52 cards). The player on the dealer's left makes the opening lead by playing a <b>single</b> <b>card</b> of their choice. Players in clockwise fashion then play a card of their choice; they must follow suit, if they can, otherwise they may play any card, including a trump Spade. Once a card has left the hand of a player, it stands and cannot be retrieved unless the player who threw the card makes an effort to correct his mistake before the next player lays down a card.|$|E
25|$|Misdeal: A misdeal is a deal {{in which}} all players have not {{received}} {{the same number of}} cards or a player has dealt out of turn. A misdeal may be discovered immediately by counting the cards after they are dealt, or it may be discovered during play of a hand. If a <b>single</b> <b>card</b> is misdealt and discovered before players in question have seen their cards the player that is short a card can pull a card at random from the player with an extra card. Otherwise a hand is misdealt, the hand is considered void and the hand must be redealt by the same dealer (unless the reason for the redeal is the hand was dealt out of turn).|$|E
50|$|The second {{series of}} <b>single</b> <b>carded</b> figures {{continued}} under the Fury Files label, but were based around Marvel's Dark Reign storyline, where Norman Osborn has dissolved S.H.I.E.L.D. {{and replaced it}} with H.A.M.M.E.R., his own organization. As such, he replaced Nick Fury {{on the back of the}} packaging. Artwork was now done by Mike Deodato. Starting with this series, all <b>single</b> <b>carded</b> figures included figure stands.|$|R

Players may use {{no more than four}} copies of any named card, with the exception of [...] "basic lands", which act as a standard resource in Magic, and some specific cards that state otherwise. [...] For example, the card Relentless Rats states that a deck may contain any number of itself. Certain formats such as Commander may limit the number of iterations of a <b>single</b> <b>card</b> players may have in their decks. These are colloquially known as singleton formats.|$|E

2500|$|For example, when {{drawing a}} <b>single</b> <b>card</b> at random from a regular deck of cards, {{the chance of}} getting a heart or a face card (J,Q,K) (or one that is both) is , because of the 52 cards of a deck 13 are hearts, 12 are face cards, and 3 are both: here the {{possibilities}} included in the [...] "3 that are both" [...] are included {{in each of the}} [...] "13 hearts" [...] and the [...] "12 face cards" [...] but should only be counted once.|$|E
2500|$|... 2007 was the 25th Anniversary of the {{original}} launch of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. To celebrate, Hasbro created three boxed sets of brand new figures, featuring modern sculpt and updated and increased articulation (including the replacement of G.I. Joe's trademark O-Ring construction). Cobra Commander {{was included in the}} inaugural Cobra set, along with Destro, Baroness, Storm Shadow, and a Cobra Trooper. The figure was rereleased on a <b>single</b> <b>card,</b> and repainted in black and gold for the [...] "Cobra Legions" [...] 5-pack, and in comic accurate colors for a Comic 2-Pack. Mirroring the vintage line, Cobra Commander was released with a hooded head sculpt in the first wave of single carded figures.|$|E
2500|$|The players cut {{for first}} deal, {{and the person}} who cuts the lowest card deals. The dealer shuffles and deals five or six cards to each player, {{depending}} on the number of players. For two players, each is dealt six cards; for three or four players, each is dealt five cards. In the case of three players, a <b>single</b> <b>card</b> is dealt face down in the centre of the table to start the crib. Once the cards have been dealt, each player chooses four cards to retain, then discards the other one or two face-down to form the [...] "crib" [...] (also called the box), which will be used later by the dealer. At this point, each player's hand and the crib will contain exactly four cards. The player on the dealer's left cuts the deck and the dealer reveals the top card, called the [...] "starter" [...] or the [...] "cut". If this card is a Jack, the dealer scores two points for [...] "his heels." ...|$|E

25|$|After the flop betting round ends, a <b>single</b> {{community}} <b>card</b> (called {{the turn}} or fourth street) is dealt, {{followed by a}} third betting round. A final <b>single</b> community <b>card</b> (called the river or fifth street) is then dealt, followed by a fourth betting round and the showdown, if necessary. In {{the third and fourth}} betting rounds, the stakes double.|$|R
50|$|In the two-player game, only 5 {{cards are}} dealt to each player. After eldest hand has {{declared}} trumps, each player discards 3 cards face down. Players then alternate drawing <b>single</b> <b>cards</b> from the stock {{until they have}} 13 cards each. Any card drawn may be discarded face down and replaced by the next card from the stock, which must then be kept.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{twenty years}} later, a folk legend about the ace of spades {{being used by}} American {{soldiers}} during the Vietnam War was popularized. Supposedly, US troops believed that Vietnamese traditions held {{the symbolism of the}} spade to mean death and ill-fortune and in a bid to frighten and demoralize Viet Cong soldiers, it was common practice to mockingly leave an ace of spades on the bodies of killed Vietnamese and even to litter the forested grounds and fields with the card. This custom was said to be so effective that the United States Playing Card Company was asked by Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment to supply crates of that <b>single</b> <b>card</b> in bulk. The crates were often marked with [...] "Bicycle Secret Weapon". However, no evidence of this practice actually being used during the war exists. The ace of spades, while not a symbol of superstitious fear to the Viet Cong forces, did help the morale of American soldiers. It was not unheard of for US soldiers and Marines to stick this card in their helmet band as a sort of anti-peace sign.|$|E
2500|$|Texas hold 'em (also {{known as}} Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a {{variation}} of the card game of poker. [...] Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional <b>single</b> <b>card</b> ("the turn" [...] or [...] "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" [...] or [...] "fifth street"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards. (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called [...] "playing the board". If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.) Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.|$|E
2500|$|The players' {{object is}} to win money by {{creating}} card totals that {{turn out to be}} higher than the dealer's hand but do not exceed 21 ("busting"/"breaking"), or alternatively by allowing the dealer to take additional cards until he/she busts. On their turn, players must choose whether to [...] "hit" [...] (take a card), [...] "stand" [...] (end their turn), [...] "double" [...] (double wager, take a <b>single</b> <b>card</b> and finish), [...] "split" [...] (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or [...] "surrender" [...] (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as [...] "face cards" [...] or [...] "pictures") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace, or [...] "soft 17", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a [...] "natural" [...] or [...] "blackjack" [...] and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as [...] "push" [...] or [...] "standoff", [...] bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for winning, player blackjacks, which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet), or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.|$|E
50|$|Many other {{card games}} have been {{designed}} and published on a commercial or amateur basis. In some cases, the game uses the standard 52-card deck, but the object is unique. In Eleusis, for example, players play <b>single</b> <b>cards,</b> and are told whether the play was legal or illegal, {{in an attempt to}} discover the underlying rules made up by the dealer.|$|R
50|$|The larger {{chips are}} issued {{to the players}} with the highest <b>single</b> <b>cards</b> showing (poker hands do not count). No player is issued more than one chip. Ties (cards of the same rank) are broken by suit, using the same bridge (ascending alphabetical) order of the suits: Spades are highest, {{followed}} by Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs. All remaining lesser-value chips are removed from play.|$|R
50|$|An {{unsubstantiated}} {{but often}} repeated folk tale about this game, common among Filipino and some Latino people, {{is that this}} game is actually a very old (centuries old) fortune-telling method, akin to Tarot. There is speculation that the game {{may have come from}} Roma in Europe and then through Spanish exploration. Each time the player gets down to a <b>single</b> showing <b>card,</b> the suit and status is noted, and if the game is won, the player notes the final card, which is the most important to the player's fortunes. The <b>single</b> <b>cards,</b> read by one knowledgeable in their meaning, provide a limited look at the future, particularly people the player may come into contact with, or is involved with.|$|R
