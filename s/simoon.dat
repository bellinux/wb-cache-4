Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.

50|$|According to Frederick <b>Simoons,</b> cattle {{smuggling}} was prevalent {{during the}} colonial era such as to the Portuguese Goa. It supplied the urban Goan demand for beef. In the post-colonial era, the reports and scale of cattle smuggling is astounding, where cattle is transported every day in thousand of trucks from Ganges Valley region to slaughterhouses in West Bengal {{in order to produce}} beef for exports.

In contrast, other scholars such as J. A. B. van Buitenen and Daniel Sheridan state that the theology and the most popular texts related to Krishna, such as the Bhagavad Gita was composed by about 2nd century BCE, and the Bhagavata Purana was composed between 500 and 1000 CE.|$|R

60|$|The {{wind was}} not a Sirocco or <b>Simoon,</b> such as we {{associate}} with the desert, but a New England northeaster,--and we sought shelter in vain under the sand-hills, for it blew all about them, rounding them into cones, and was sure to find us out on whichever side we sat. From time to time we lay down and drank at little pools in the sand, filled with pure fresh water, all that was left, probably, of a pond or swamp. The air was filled with dust like snow, and cutting sand which made the face tingle, and we saw {{what it must be}} to face it when the weather was drier, and, if possible, windier still,--to face a migrating sand-bar in the air, which has picked up its duds and is off,--to be whipped with a cat, not o' nine-tails, but of a myriad of tails, and each one a sting to it.

50|$|The {{prevalence}} of coeliac disease genotypes {{in the modern}} population is not completely understood. Given {{the characteristics of the}} disease and its apparent strong heritability, it would normally be expected that the genotypes would undergo negative selection and to be absent in societies where agriculture has been practised the longest (compare with a similar condition, Lactose intolerance, which has been negatively selected so strongly that its prevalence went from ~100% in ancestral populations to less than 5% in some European countries). This expectation was first proposed by <b>Simoons</b> (1981). By now, however, it is apparent {{that this is not the}} case; on the contrary, there is evidence of positive selection in coeliac disease genotypes.

5000|$|Deryck Lodrick states, for example, “beef-eating {{is common}} among low caste Hindus", and vegetarianism is an upper caste phenomenon. In contrast, cow-cherishing, Krishna-worshipping rustic piety, state Susan Bayly and others, has been popular among agriculture-driven, cattle husbandry, farm laboring and {{merchant}} castes. These have typically been considered the low-castes in Hinduism. According to Bayly, {{reverence for the}} cow is widely shared in India across castes. The traditional belief has also associated death or the dead with being unclean, polluting or defiling, such as those who handle corpse, carrion and animal remains. However, the tradition differentiates between natural or accidental death, and intentional slaughter. According to Frederick J. <b>Simoons,</b> many members of low castes and tribal groups in India reject [...] "cow slaughter and beef eating, some of them quite strongly", while others support beef eating and cattle slaughter.|$|R

Who can be more solitary even in a crowd than one whose history and the never ending feelings and remembrances arising from it is [sic] known to no living soul. There was too deep a horror in my tale for confidence; I was on earth the sole depository of my own secret. I might tell it to the winds and to the desart heaths but I must never among my fellow creatures, either by word or look give allowance to the smallest conjecture of the dread reality: I must shrink before the eye of man lest he should read my father's guilt in my glazed eyes: I must be silent lest my faltering voice should betray unimagined horrors. Over the deep grave of my secret I must heap an impenetrable heap of false smiles and words: cunning frauds, treacherous laughter and a mixture of all light deceits would form a mist to blind others and be as the poisonous <b>simoon</b> to me.[44] I, the offspring of love, the child of the woods, the nursling of Nature's bright self was to submit to this?

The Ashanti force here was not a large one, the main body being nearly twenty miles away {{in the neighborhood of}} Dunquah, which was held by a small body of Houssas and natives under Captain Gordon. At six in the morning a messenger ran in with the news that two of the English war steamers from Cape Coast were lying off Elmina, and that a number of troops had been landed in boats. The Ashanti general was furious, and poured out threats against his spies in Cape Coast for not having warned him of the movement, but in fact these were not to blame. So quietly had the arrangements been made that, until late in the previous afternoon, no one, with the exception of three or four of the principal officers, knew that an expedition was intended. Even then it was given out that the expedition was going down the coast, and {{it was not until the}} ships anchored off Elmina at three in the morning that the officers and troops were aware of their destination. All the West Indian troops at Cape Coast had been taken, Captain Peel of the <b>Simoon</b> landing fifty sailors to hold the fort in case the Ashantis should attack it in their absence. The expedition consisted of the Houssas, two hundred men of the 2d West India regiment, fifty sailors, and two companies of marines and marine artillery, each fifty strong, and a large number of natives carrying a small Armstrong gun, two rocket tubes, rockets, spare ammunition, and hammocks for wounded.|$|E
40|$|The {{falling number}} of ST {{elevation}} myocar-dial infarctions (STEMI) c A cross sectional study {{of more than}} 10, 000 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) admitted to 103 hospitals in 25 countries in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin has demonstrated a strong association between STEMI and smoking. Patients who have non-STEMI presentations of ACS tended to have more hypertension and obesity. The welcome decline in smoking may be beginning to manifest in what the authors refer to as ‘‘less severe AMIs’’. In this study 43 % of patients with an ACS diagnosis had a STEMI and the remaining 57 % were non-STEMI. These findings provide further confirmation that the balance between STEMI and non-STEMI presentations is shifting: STEMI is on the decline. This has clear implications for provision of emergency cardiac care, including in the pre-hospital setting. There is a need, moreover, to highlight to emergency care personnel the high mortality in non-STEMI patients (and indeed in those who do have STEMI but are ineligible for thrombolytic treatment) so that patients can receive appropriate care at an appropriate facility. m Rosengren A, Wallentin L, <b>Simoons</b> M, et al.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} model of gene-culture coevolution, {{suggested by the}} "culture historical hypothesis" of <b>Simoons</b> and McCracken, is presented. According to this hypothesis, adult lactose absorption, believed to be an autosomal dominant trait, attained a high frequency in some human populations due to the positive selection pressure induced by culturally determined milk use in those populations. Two-dimensional Kolmogorov backward equations with appropriate boundary conditions are derived for the ultimate fixation probability of milk users, of the gene for adult lactose absorption, and of both jointly, and for the average time until fixation of the gene. These boundary value problems are solved numerically by the Gauss-Seidel method. I define a theoretical measure of the correlation between gene and culture {{in terms of the}} three ultimate fixation probabilities. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to check and extend the numerical results and also to obtain the first arrival time at gene frequency 0. 70, which is approximately the highest observed frequency in any population. Two results that pertain to the culture historical hypothesis are obtained. First, the incomplete correlation observed between adult lactose absorption and milk use does not necessarily constitute evidence against the hypothesis. Second, for the postulated genetic change to have occurred within the 6000 -year period since the advent of dairying, either the effective population size was of the order of 100, or, if it was of larger order, the selection coefficient probably had to exceed 5 %...|$|R
5000|$|The {{middle of}} the 20th century saw a turn away from {{zoogeography}} (while never fully relinquishing it) towards questions about and interest in the impact of humans on wildlife and in human relations with livestock. Two key geographers shaping this wave of animal geography were Carl Sauer and Charles Bennett. Sauer’s interest in the cultural landscape - or cultural ecology (how human cultures are shaped and are shaped by their environment) - necessarily involved addressing the topic of animal domestication. In Sauer’s research he focused {{on the history of}} domestication, and how human uses of livestock shaped the landscape (via fencing, grazing, and shelters). [...] Bennett called for a ‘cultural animal geography’ that focused on the interactions of animals and human cultures such as subsistence hunting and fishing. [...] The shift from the first wave to the second wave of animal geography {{had to do with the}} species being studied. Second wave animal geography brought domesticated livestock into the view instead of just focusing on wildlife. For the next several decades animal geography, as cultural ecology, was dominated by research into the origins of domestication, cultural rituals around domestication, and different cultures livestock relations (sedentary versus nomadic herding). Key works include <b>Simoons</b> and Simoons’ A Ceremonial Ox of India, Gades’ work on the guinea pig, and Cansdale’s Animals and Man.
