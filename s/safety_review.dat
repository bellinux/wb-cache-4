5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a <b>safety</b> <b>review</b> of the Apollo program. In {{response to this}} review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule {{to make room for}} the three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost any point whilst they were at the Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon.

25|$|Safety {{of rural}} mobile {{delivery}} personnel on busy roads {{has been an}} ongoing concern. Canada Post launched the Rural Mail <b>Safety</b> <b>Review</b> as rural and suburban mail carriers across the country, supported by their union, raised complaints about workplace safety. As of March 2008, {{there have been more}} than 1,400 such complaints. In some cases, the union staged protests in delivering mail, even after Canada Post tests showed there was no undue traffic safety risk at a particular mail box. Such cases were referred to Labour Canada, who in several instances asked Canada Post to cease delivery to mailboxes. In December 2006, the Canadian government ordered that Canada Post maintain rural delivery wherever possible. On January 1, 2004 rural route contractors became employees of Canada Post and joined the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) conducts {{human factors}} {{engineering}} (HFE) <b>safety</b> <b>reviews</b> of applicant submittals for new plants and for changes to existing plants. The reviews include {{the evaluation of}} the methods and tools (M&T) used by applicants as part of their HFE program. The technology used to perform HFE activities has been rapidly evolving, resulting in a whole new generation of HFE M&Ts. The objectives of this research were to identify the current trends in HFE methods and tools, determine their applicability to NRC <b>safety</b> <b>reviews,</b> and identify topics for which the NRC may need additional guidance to support the NRC's <b>safety</b> <b>reviews.</b> We conducted a survey that identified over 100 new HFE M&Ts. The M&Ts were assessed to identify general trends. Seven trends were identified: Computer Applications for Performing Traditional Analyses, Computer-Aided Design, Integration of HFE Methods and Tools, Rapid Development Engineering, Analysis of Cognitive Tasks, Use of Virtual Environments and Visualizations, and Application of Human Performance Models. We assessed each trend to determine its applicability to the NRC's review by considering (1) whether the nuclear industry is making use of M&Ts for each trend, and (2) whether M&Ts reflecting the trend can be reviewed using the current design review guidance. We concluded that M&T trends that are applicable to the commercial nuclear industry and are expected to impact <b>safety</b> <b>reviews</b> may be considered for review guidance development. Three trends fell into this category: Analysis of Cognitive Tasks, Use of Virtual Environments and Visualizations, and Application of Human Performance Models.

500|$|Soon {{after its}} {{approval}} natalizumab was {{withdrawn from the}} market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a <b>safety</b> <b>review</b> the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all [...] in patients who had taken natalizumab {{for more than a}} year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.|$|E

40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>reviews</b> of {{existing}} roads are becoming an accepted practice in many agencies around the world. These reviews {{can be highly}} cost-effective, but the subjective nature of the process can give rise to inconsistencies that limit their effectiveness. To address this issue, a technique to support <b>safety</b> <b>reviews</b> to quantify the safety gains that could be achieved by addressing the problems identified in the review process is presented. The approach is based on known accident relationships. A systematic process to determine which road features should be investigated and how each feature should be evaluated during the review is described. The procedure addresses rural two-lane highways at nonintersections. From the process, a potential for a safety improvement index (PFI) was calculated. Validation of the procedure {{was carried out by}} a comparison of the PFI values with the expected collision frequency. PFI was assessed in 406 km of rural two-lane rolling highways in Italy. Collision frequency was determined by application of a collision prediction model, calibrated in the study network, and was refined by application of the empirical Bayes (EB) technique. Correlation between EB safety estimates and PFI values is highly significant, with 93 % of the variation in the estimated number of accidents explained by the PFI value. Because of the validation and quantitative nature of the PFI, the procedure can be used to support <b>safety</b> <b>reviews</b> and decision making...|$|R
