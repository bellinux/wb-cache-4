TRPV1 was the first mammalian member to be discovered and is a non-selective cation channel permeable for calcium.

This region forms the channel conductive pore and contains the N- and C-termini on the cytosolic side of the cell membrane.Capsaicin and RTX, elicit burning pain by activating a non-selective cation channel expressed on sensory nerve endings.

TRPV1 is also subject to regulation by changes in membrane potential and this intrinsic voltage-dependence is thought to underlie the gating mechanism of this non-selective cation channel which leads to the influx of sodium and calcium ions. Importantly, TRPV1 activity is also subject to regulation by a host of intracellular signaling cascades such as G-protein coupled receptor signaling, that are implicated in the responses to algogenic agents, inflammatory mediators and injury.|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} views {{on the origins of}} gas reservoirs of Ordovician Majiagou Fm in the Ordos Basin, but none of them supports the opinion that there are scale source rocks (TOC> 0. 5 %) in the Majiagou Fm. In this paper, a series of analysis was made on cores and cutting samples taken from recent newly-drilled wells in the Ordovician reservoirs in the central–eastern areas of the Ordos Basin. Accordingly, the organic abundance features of different types of source rocks in the Majiagou Fm were presented, and for the first time, it was discovered and verified that there are effective scale source rocks with high organic abundance. Based on these analysis and studies, the following results were achieved. First, the effective source rocks of Majiagou Fm are composed of thin–thick layered dark dolomite-bearing mudstones, dolomitic mudstones and argillaceous dolomites, and their enrichment and distribution are obviously controlled by sedimentary facies. During the sedimentation of Majiagou Fm, the effective scale source rocks developed better at the regressive stage than at the transgressive stage. The effective source rocks are primarily distributed in the upper part of Ma 5 Member (especially concentrated in the third and fourth <b>sub-members)</b> and secondly in Ma 3 Member, Ma 1 Member and the middle–lower part of Ma 5 Member. Second, the effective source rocks are areally distributed in a dual-girdle form around the Mizhi Salt Depression, and those in the secondary depressions are medium–thick layered, with a large total thickness and high organic abundance. Third, the effective source rocks in the center of Mizhi Depression and the secondary uplifts are thin-layered, with a small total thickness and low organic abundance. And fourth, the organic abundance of the effective source rocks varies from 0. 30 % to 8. 45 %. Phytoplankton and Acritarchs are the main parent materials of hydrocarbon, and organic matters are of sapropel or sapropel prone type. To sum up, the Ordovician effective source rocks in the Ordos Basin are generally at an over-mature stage and they contribute greatly to the natural gas in the Majiagou Fm. In these effective source rocks, dry gas is mainly generated at a high rate...|$|R

During the depositional period of the Es 4 x [...] <b>sub-member,</b> the Dongying Depression in this early rift stage was {{characterized}} by an arid climate, a small lake-water area, and high salinity. The northern steep slope zone of the Minfeng Sag is a structural belt in the steep slope zone that {{is controlled by the}} Chennan boundary fault, which is located near the subsidence center with deeper water. Terrigenous clastic sediments were transported by seasonal floods to the deep lake, leading to the deposition of the nearshore subaqueous fans in the downthrown side of the Chennan fault. These fans were distributed close to lacustrine source rocks (Sui et al. 2010). During flood stagnation, the water evaporated rapidly, and thick gypsum and halite were deposited. In vertical profile view, the strata show a sedimentary assemblage of interbedded gypsum and clastic rocks.|$|E
3000|$|The {{reservoirs}} in the Es 4 x [...] <b>sub-member</b> {{could potentially}} form abundant secondary pores during shallow burial because the organic matter in Es 4 x ’s source rocks could supply organic acids {{in a shallow}} open system. However, all the deep SPDZs in the Paleogene sandstones in the Dongying Depression are simply interpreted as having formed from deep burial mineral dissolution (Yuan and Wang 2001; Zhu et al. 2007). Some questions require further studies, such as whether these deep secondary pore development zones were originally shallow secondary pore development zones that were preserved effectively during deep burial and how these shallow secondary pore development zones were preserved during deep burial. These unresolved problems produce great difficulties and risks for the exploration and development of hydrocarbons in these reservoirs. For instance, the drilling of the Fengshen 2 and Fengshen 3 wells close to the Fengshen 1 well was not successful (the former were dry wells and the latter only produced 2.64  ×  104 m 3 of gas daily) (Zhong et al. 2004).|$|E

Sandstone-mudstone rhythmite, tidal structures and bimodal cross-bedding are common in these deposits, indicating that tides {{played a significant role in}} generating the sedimentary structures and the estuary type was tide-dominated. Five depositional facies were grouped: tidal river, sandy and muddy subtidal flat, tidal flat, tidal bar, tidal channel on the basis of lithology, electric properties, rhythmicity, sedimentary structure, fossil and the contact relationship. The sediment distribution showing first fining seaward and subsequent coarsening seaward from head to mouth, implies the two sediment sources in the paleo-estuary. The paleo-estuary of the Tarim Basin is very different from other representative estuaries. The most important distinction is that there are two adjacent estuaries joined by tidal flat onshore and by sandy and muddy subtidal fl at in the sea at the same time, while the others only have one. So the Tazhong paleo-estuary shows a good architecture model for the tide-dominated estuary.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{progressive}} {{exploration of the}} Jingbian Gas Field in the Ordos Basin, multiple gas-bearing regions have been discovered in the dolomite reservoirs in the Middle Ordovician assemblages of Lower Paleozoic in Jingxi area, but these gas-bearing regions and intervals are significantly different in terms of gas enrichment degrees. So far, however, {{the reasons for the}} difference have not been figured out. In this paper, the origin and source of natural gas in the Middle Ordovician assemblages in Jingxi area was investigated on the basis of geochemical data (e. g. natural gas composition and carbon isotope), and then the main factors controlling the gas accumulation were analyzed. It is shown that the natural gas in the Middle Ordovician assemblages in the Middle Ordovician assemblages in Jingxi area is similar to that in the Upper Ordovician assemblages and Upper Paleozoic reservoir in terms of genesis and sources, and they are mainly the Upper Paleozoic coaliferous gas with some oil-derived gas. Under the influence of hydrocarbon generation center of coal source rocks and the source–rock–reservoir contact relationship, the proportion of coaliferous gas increases areally from the north to the south and vertically from Ma 55 <b>sub-member</b> of the Lower Ordovician Majiagou Fm. It is concluded that the natural gas enrichment degree is controlled by the gas charging capacity at the hydrocarbon-supplying windows. Second, the vertical migration and distribution of natural gas is dominated by the differences of Ma 55 −Ma 510 transport pathways. And third, the lateral migration direction of natural gas and the range of gas accumulation are controlled by the superimposition relationship between structures and reservoirs...|$|E
3000|$|From the {{deposition}} of the Es 4 x [...] <b>sub-member</b> to 44  Ma before the present (the end of {{the deposition}} of Es 4 s [...]), the top boundary of the Es 4 x [...] was buried to a depth shallower than 750  m at formation temperatures below 50  °C, and the bottom boundary was buried less than 1400  m at temperatures below 75  °C. The main diagenesis during this period was compaction, {{which led to the}} drainage of formation water. At this time, the salinity of the water in the pore spaces increased, which resulted in the early precipitation of gypsum and halite. Anaerobic bacteria broke down organic matter and SO 4 2 − in the pore water, releasing organic acids, H 2 S, CO 2, and other gases. Under these conditions, the Fe 3 + in the sediments was reduced to Fe 2 + and formed spherulitic pyrite and agglomerate siderite cement (Curtis 1978). Because the organic acids that formed during this period were mostly destroyed by bacteria, the formation water remained alkaline, and the formation exhibited normal fluid pressure. The conglomerate bodies of the nearshore subaqueous fans were similar to dome-shaped anticlines, with a flat bottom and convex top in a cross-section and was defined by Zhong et al. (2004) as “fan-anticlines” that formed by sedimentation. The inner fans of the nearshore subaqueous fans are mainly composed of matrix-supported conglomerates, whose resistance to compaction is weak. The middle fans mainly consist of pebbly sandstones and sandstones in braided channels, whose resistance to compaction is relatively strong. The high part of the conglomerate fans had an anticlinal attitude and formed dome traps as a result of differential compaction (Wang 2003). During this period, the reservoir spaces were dominated by primary pores after compaction and early cementation (Fig.  6).|$|E
30|$|Abundant in oil, Yanchang Formation in {{the east}} of Ordos Basin {{has been one of}} the most {{important}} targets in the ultra-low permeability and tight sandstone reservoir development. Specifically, the third <b>sub-member</b> of the sixth member of Yanchang Formation (Chang 63) is the most representative (Gao et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2015 a; Shi et al. 2016) (Fig.  1). Previous studies demonstrate the strong microscopic heterogeneity of Chang 63 reservoir sand body in Huaqing oilfield, which leads to prominent Jamin effect in the late water flooding, difficult development process, low productivity, and massive residual oil, thereby significantly restricting the effective development of Huaqing oilfield (Qu et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015 a, b). The water flooding efficiency is found to be closely related to the microscopic pore structure of the reservoir, which has not been sufficiently addressed in the previous studies (Zhao et al. 2012). Moreover, fluid flow and migration in the reservoir pore space can be intuitively observed in the water flooding experiment in the microscopic real sandstone model under the microscope, which can help analyze the rule of water flooding and the controlling factors of water flooding efficiency in conditions with different types of microscopic pore structures (Bai et al. 2016; Halim et al. 2015). With regard to the microscopic real sandstone model, it is a patented technology of the National Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics of Northwest University, China. Its delicate microscopic model production technology enables the reservoir rock to retain not only the initial pore structures but also the rock surface physical properties and interstitials, thereby greatly increasing the model credibility and application range (Zhao et al. 2017). The coupling of microscopic real sandstone model and full information scan video can realistically and intuitively reshow the fluid motion and residual oil distribution in the oil–water two-phase displacement process, so that the displacement characteristics of the fluids in the rock pore space can be directly observed (Cao et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2008; Yadali and Kharrat 2009; Yan et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Iminosugars {{are known}} to behave as {{carbohydrate}} mimics in biological systems {{by virtue of their}} similar structures. However as the ring nitrogen prevents metabolism it means that iminosugars have the potential to become inhibitors of these systems. It is known, for example, that iminosugars can behave as mimics in the hydrolysis mechanism. This leads to possible medicinal applications of iminosugars. One such case is lysosomal storage disorders which arise {{as a result of a}} genetic defect which causes missense mutations coding for the N-acetylhexosaminidase enzymatic protein. N-Acetylhexosaminidases are a <b>sub-member</b> of the class of glycosidase enzymes. They are responsible for the cleavage of N-acetylhexosamine residues from glycoconjugates in the lysosome. Mutations in the gene coding for this protein lead to a deficiency in the enzymatic activity resulting in accumulation of unhydrolysed substrate in the lysosome. Lysosomal storage disorders have a phenotype of poor motor development and neurological problems. The infantile form usually leads to death before the age of five. An iminosugar mimic could give rise to a possible treatment for lysosomal storage disorders by acting as a molecular chaperone during protein folding, promoting correct folding by its intrinsic affinity for the native fold of the enzyme. Likewise in the treatment of cancer, the inhibitory ability of iminosugars has potential applications. In cancer, extracellular hydrolysis occurs which favours cancer cell survival. Macrophages, which attack and eliminate cancer cells, can be activated by macrophage activating factor (MAF) which displays an α-N-acetylgalactosamine residue that appears essential for the activation cascade. Cancer cells secrete an α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme that acts to decrease the potency of MAF, thus promoting cancer cell survival. Inhibition of cancer cell α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase may restore macrophage activation and generate potential therapeutics. Chapter 1 of this thesis contains extended discussion of the aforementioned, and related, diseases and the therapeutic applications of iminosugars. Some historically and biologically important iminosugars are described along with some current iminosugar drugs. Chapter 2 describes the synthetic strategies explored in an attempt to synthesise all the members of the 2 -acetamido pyrrolidine iminosugars. An overview of the compounds synthesised towards this end by a past group member is given along with the work performed as part of this thesis to complete this goal. Both enantiomers with arabino - and ribo - stereochemistry and D- lyxo - were previously synthesised. The syntheses of both enantiomers with xylo - stereochemistry along with the L- lyxo - compound were completed as part of this thesis, from either D- or L-glucuronolactone and D-ribose, respectively. Chapter 3 details the synthetic strategy adopted to synthesise the enantiomer of D-DNJNAc, the first potent α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase inhibitor to be found.

40|$|Transcendental {{stiffness}} matrices for vibration (or buckling) analysis {{have long}} been available {{for a range of}} structural members. Such stiffness matrices are exact {{in the sense that they}} are obtained from an analytical solution of the governing differential equations of the member. Hence, assembly of the member stiffnesses to obtain the overall stiffness matrix of the structure results in a transcendental eigenproblem that yields exact solutions and which can be solved with certainty using the Wittrick-Williams algorithm. Convergence is commonly achieved by bisection, despite the fact that the method is known to be relatively slow. Quicker methods are available, but their implementation is hampered by the highly volatile nature of the determinant of the structure's transcendental stiffness matrix, particularly in the vicinity of the poles, which may or may not correspond to eigenvalues. However, when the exact solution exists, the member has a recently discovered property that can also be expressed analytically and is called its member stiffness determinant. The member stiffness determinant is a property of the member when fully clamped boundary conditions are imposed upon it. It is then defined as the determinant of the member stiffness matrix when the member is sub-divided into an infinite number of identical sub-members. Each <b>sub-member</b> is therefore of infinitely small length so that its clamped-ended natural frequencies are infinitely large. Hence the contribution from the member stiffness matrix to the Jq count of the W-W algorithm will be zero. In general, the member stiffness determinant is normalised by dividing by its value when the eigenparameter (i. e. the frequency or buckling load factor) is zero, as otherwise it would become infinite. Part A of this thesis develops the first two applications of member stiffness determinants to the calculation of natural frequencies or elastic buckling loads of prismatic assemblies of isotropic and orthotopic plates subject to in-plane axial and transverse loads. A major advantage of the member stiffness determinant is that, when its values for all members of a structure are multiplied together and are also multiplied by the determinant of the transcendental overall stiffness matrix of the structure, the result is a determinant which has no poles and is substantially less volatile when plotted against the eigenparameter. Such plots provide a significantly better platform for the development of efficient, computer-based routines for convergence on eigenvalues by curve prediction techniques. On the other hand, Part B presents the development of exact dynamic stiffness matrices for three models of sandwich beams. The simplest one is only able to model the flexural vibration of asymmetric sandwich beams. Extending the first model to include axial and rotary inertia makes it possible to predict the axial and shear thickness modes of vibration in addition to those corresponding to flexure. This process culminates in a unique model for a three layer Timoshenko beam. The crucial difference of including axial inertia in the second model, enables the resulting member dynamic stiffness matrix (exact finite element) to be included in a general model of two dimensional structures for the first time. Although the developed element is straight, it can also be used to model curved structures by using an appropriate number of straight elements to model the geometry of the curve. Finally, it has been shown that considering a homogeneous deep beam as an equivalent three-layer beam allows the beam to have additional shear modes, besides the flexural, axial and fundamental shear thickness modes. Also for every combination of layer thickness, the frequencies of the three-layer beam are less than the corresponding frequencies calculated for the equivalent beam model with only one layer, since it is equivalent to providing additional flexibility to the system. However, a suitable combination of layer thicknesses for any mode may be found that yields the minimum frequency. It is anticipated that these frequencies would probably be generated by a single layer model of the homogeneous beam if at least a third order shear deformation theory was incorporated. Numerous examples have been given to validate the theories and to indicate their range of application. The results presented in these examples are identical to those that are available from alternative exact theories and otherwise show good correlation with a selection of comparable approximate results that are available in the literature. In the latter case, the differences in the results are attributable to many factors that vary widely from different solution techniques to differences in basic assumptions.

40|$|I. Glacigenic {{deposits}} in the Death Valley region occur within the Neoproterozoic Kingston Peak Formation. In the Panamint Range, immediately west of Death Valley, these strata are ≥ 1000 m thick and are continuously exposed for nearly 100 km along the strike of the range. Although these strata are variably metamorphosed and locally exhibit pronounced ductile strain, original sedimentary textures are well preserved throughout the range. Diamictic strata occur in two distinct intervals, a lower one comprising the Limekiln Spring and Surprise Members, and an upper one {{known as the}} Wildrose <b>Sub-member</b> of the South Park Member. Each of these intervals are succeeded by well defined cap carbonates, which, from oldest to youngest, are the Sourdough Member of the Kingston Peak and the Sentinel Peak Member of the overlying Noonday Formation. Between the two glacial successions, the Sourdough and sub-Wildrose South Park units comprise a 300 m thick interglacial succession that includes platform carbonate deposition. Sparse lonestones and striated clasts, along with the impressive lateral continuity of diamictic units, support a glacial origin. Chemostratigraphic profiles of δ 13 C through the Sourdough (- 3 ‰ to + 2 ‰, increasing upward) and Sentinel Peak (- 3 ‰ +/- 1 ‰) suggest correlation with the Sturtian and Marinoan caps, respectively. Potentially economic U deposits (secondary brannerite) occur in graphitic schists of the Limekiln Spring Member and sub-economic U and Th (hosted by detrital monazite) occur within quartz-pebble conglomerates in the South Park Member. The strata contain no fossils, radiometric age control, or primary magnetizations. II. The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian succession in the Death Valley region of SW Laurentia is among the best exposed and easily accessible in the world, and comprises {{one of the most}} complete sections in Laurentia. The largest single exposure of these strata occurs in the Panamint Range on the west flank of Death Valley, but this area has received little attention in comparison to numerous exposures to the east of Death Valley, primarily because of structural complexity and metamorphism. The eastern strata, although unmetamorphosed, occur in isolated fault-bounded exposures and are relatively thin and incomplete compared to the Panamint stratigraphy. These factors, combined with a lack of fossil or radiometric age control, has hindered confident regional correlation, as well as placement in the context of hallmark Neoproterozoic events observed in the South Australian, Namibian and other successions around the globe. New geological mapping, measured sections and high-resolution C-isotope data reported here from the Noonday Formation in the Panamint Range delineate its regional stratigraphic architecture and establish its age through correlation with section with radiometric age control. Carbon isotopic trends in the Panamint Range match to within 1 - 2 ‰ reproducibility previous results obtained for correlative strata in the eastern sections, indicating that metamorphism did not significantly alter C isotopic ratios. The combined lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data form the basis for a revised, more complete stratigraphic framework for the Noonday Formation. A composite section shows that, where most complete, the Noonday consists of three members, from the base upward, the Sentinel Peak, Radcliff, and Mahogany Flats members. New mapping and chemostratigraphic data permit robust regional correlation of a thin dolostone marker horizon {{at the base of the}} Noonday in the Panamint Range as little as 2 m thick (Sentinel Peak Member) with a tube-bearing microbial dolostone in the eastern Death Valley region more than 200 m thick. The data also reveal that the Radcliff Member is bounded by disconformable surfaces and their correlative conformities. These surfaces are recognizable throughout the region and are used to construct a regionally unified stratigraphic nomenclature. A key finding of this study is the construction of a chemostratigraphic profile spanning most of Noonday time. This was greatly aided by the discovery of carbonatebearing strata in the lower part of the Radcliff Member in the Tucki Mountain area of the Panamints, and relating their stratigraphic position to upper Radcliff and younger Noonday strata in the Wildrose Canyon area. The chemostratigraphic profile is a remarkable match for the Maiberg cap carbonate sequence in Namibia, including the decline to a minimum at - 5 ‰, a recovery to near 0 ‰, and then subsequent decline to - 2 ‰. Globally, profiles through many post-Marinoan sequences are either too condensed or lack sufficient carbonate to record these features, including the sections in the eastern Death Valley region. (Halverson et al. 2005). As such, the Panamint profiles represent the first relatively complete record of the post-Marinoan C-isotopic recovery outside of southern Africa. Correlation of these curves (1) firmly places the Noonday at the base of the Ediacaran Period, (2) indicates deposition of 200 m of Sentinel Peak and Radcliff strata occurred between 635 and 632 Ma, (3) supports the hypothesis that the Wildrose Diamictite of the Kingston Peak Formation, which lies in sharp contact below the Sentinel Peak Member, represents at least part of the Marinoan glacial interval; (4) helps identify correlative cap carbonate sequences in key Laurentian sections, which include the Ravensthroat Formation in the MacKenzie Mountains, dolostones capping the upper diamictite of the Pocatello Formation in eastern Idaho, and the middle part of the Mina el Mezquite Formation in Sonora. The Noonday C-isotopic profile confirms that the details of relatively rapid, complex variations in ocean chemistry observed in basal Ediacaran strata in Namibia are globally reproducible. III. The Kingston Peak Formation in the Panamint Range represents the stratigraphically most complete section of Cryogenian strata along the SW margin of Laurentia. Two glacigenic diamictites and their associated cap carbonates, the older Surprise Member and Sourdough Member and the younger Wildrose Member and Noonday Formation (Sentinel Peak Member), provide timing constraints to bracket the inter-glacial succession to between ca. 713 Ma and 635 Ma, the ages of inferred correlative glacial cap carbonate rocks dated elsewhere. This timing constraint is further strengthened by the presence of a sharp decline in C isotopes in the Thorndike Member, which occurs immediately beneath the Wildrose Member; this decline is readily correlated with the global Trezona anomaly. Within the inter-glacial succession, new mapping in the northern Panamints has documented the presence of a previously unrecognised suite of coarse sedimentary rocks herein defined as the Argenta Member of the Kingston Peak Formation. The Argenta consists largely of poorly-sorted breccias and conglomerates containing an assemblage of gravel-sized clasts dominated by granitic gneiss, schist, feldspar augens, vein quartz and quartzite fragments, and locally carbonate rocks. These compositions indicate derivation from a basement provenance and record deposition in alluvial-fan to coarse-braided fluvial settings; their textural and compositional immaturity implies relatively short distances of transport. Mapping shows that the Argenta defines wedge-shaped packages as much as 200 m thick and that the base of the Argenta is a significant angular unconformity. Combined, these features are evidence that deposition occurred during a phase of extensional tectonism interpreted as recording the initial dismemberment of the Rodinia supercontinent. Best estimates place the timing of this tectonism at ca. 650 – 700 Ma. ...|$|E
