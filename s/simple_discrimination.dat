2500|$|Temporal {{discrimination}} model {{attempts to}} blend in both the selective attention and memory retrieval aspects of negative priming in a less complex model. It {{is based on the}} assumption that negative priming is caused only at the moment of response to a stimulus that was previously considered distractor. This model explains negative priming as the delayed response due to confusion in classifying a stimulus as old or new. A new stimulus is immediately classified as new and undergoes perceptual processing. A repeated old stimulus is familiar and cues the automatic retrieval of the prior episode. A stimulus that has been repetitively ignored prior to becoming the target is neither entirely new nor old. This ambiguity slows down the processing of the stimuli. The temporal discrimination model points to this ambiguity as the cause of slowed categorization of the stimulus leading to negative priming effect. Like feature mismatch hypothesis, this model also claims that negative priming is not due to selective attention of the target or the inhibition of the distractor. This model argues that [...] "negative priming is an emergent consequence of a discrimination process that is inherent to memory retrieval". Temporal discrimination model explains negative priming without reference to inhibition of distractors or the [...] "do not respond" [...] tag and by <b>simple</b> <b>discrimination</b> of [...] "old", [...] "new" [...] and [...] "in between" [...] categories.|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{designed}} to establish stimulus equivalence classes frequently produce differential outcomes {{that may be}} attributable to training structure, defined as the order and arrangement of baseline conditional discrimination training trials. Several possible explanations for these differences have been suggested. Here we develop a hypothesis based on {{an analysis of the}} simple simultaneous and successive discriminations embedded in conditional discrimination training and testing within each of the training structures that are typically used in stimulus equivalence experiments. Our analysis shows that only the comparison-as-node (many-to-one) structure presents all the <b>simple</b> <b>discriminations</b> in training that are subsequently required for consistently positive outcomes on all tests for the properties of equivalence. The sample-as-node (one-to-many) training structure does not present all the <b>simple</b> <b>discriminations</b> required for positive outcomes on either the symmetry or combined transitivity and symmetry (equivalence) tests. The linear-series training structure presents all the <b>simple</b> <b>discriminations</b> required for consistently positive outcomes on tests for symmetry, but not for symmetry and transitivity combined (equivalence) or transitivity alone. Further, the difference in the number of <b>simple</b> <b>discriminations</b> presented in comparison-as-node training versus the other training structures is larger when the intended class size is greater than three or the number of classes is larger than two. We discuss the relevance of this analysis to interpretations of stimulus equivalence research, as well as some methodological and theoretical implications...|$|R

Experiments that have apparently shown such changes in attention have failed to determine whether attention is enhanced to both A and B, which signal reinforcement and nonreinforcement, respectively, or just to A. In Experiments 1 and 2, pigeons were trained with a number of discriminations of the kind AX+ BX-, before compounds that had been consistently nonreinforced were involved in a subsequent discrimination.

When the pigeon was responding consistently to the red key (S+), a green key (S−) would be introduced. At first the pigeon would also respond to the green key (S−) but gradually responses to this key would decrease, because they are not followed by food, so that they occurred only a few times or even never.|$|E

5000|$|Theory of mind {{requires}} the collaboration of functionally related {{regions of the}} brain to form the distinction between self and other mental states {{and to create a}} comprehensive understanding of those mental states so that we may recognize, understand, and predict behavior. In general the theory of mind process is mediated by the dopaminergic-serotonergic system, which involves the TPJ as well as other associative regions necessary for mentalizing. Recent studies suggest that both the left TPJ, working in conjunction with the frontal cortex, and the right TPJ are involved in the representation of mental states; furthermore they suggest that the TPJ is particularly active in making the distinction between the mental states of self and others. A study in Nature Neuroscience from 2004 describes how the TPJ is involved in processing socially relevant cues including gaze direction and goal-directed action and also explains that results from the study show that lesions to this area of the brain result in an impaired ability to detect another persons belief. Moreover, studies have reported an increase in activity in the TPJ when patients are absorbing information through reading or images regarding other peoples' beliefs but not while observing information about physical control stimuli. Some studies, however, have shown that the TPJ, along with the cingulate cortex, is more specifically involved with attributing beliefs, but the process of mentalizing more generally is associated more with the medial prefrontal cortex. [...] Another study in Current Biology from 2012 identifies the importance of the TPJ in both low-level, such as <b>simple</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and high-level, such as the ability to empathize, sociocognitive operations. [...] In July 2011, a review from Neuropsychologia presented a model of the mentalizing network that established that mental states are first detected in the TPJ. The TPJ is composed of two discrete anatomical regions, the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the caudal parts of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and both are active in the process of distinction between mental states of different individuals; thus, it is probable that this detection is the outcome of the combination and coordination of these two parts. Additionally, the right TPJ is involved in the ventral attention stream and contributes to the ability to focus attention on a particular stimuli or objective. It has also been observed that the interaction and communication between the dorsal and ventral streams involves the TPJ.|$|E

Thirty adult participants were randomly assigned to 6 groups, that is, 3 or 6 members with MTO, OTM, or LS. The results showed that there were small differences in the outcome following MTO or OTM.

In order to test the role of the hippocampus in <b>simple</b> <b>discrimination</b> learning, we performed a series of experiments utilizing a two-choice picture discrimination task. Our experiments confirm that rats readily learn simple two-choice picture discriminations after hippocampus damage. However, if such discriminations are first learned while the hippocampus is intact, subsequent hippocampus damage causes severe retrograde amnesia for the discriminations. Furthermore, retrograde amnesia for simple picture discriminations was equally severe when the interval between training and damage was 1 d or 60 d; remote picture memories are not spared. Similarly, the rule or schema underlying a recently or remotely acquired picture discrimination learning set was lost after hippocampus damage. The severity of retrograde amnesia for simple picture discriminations is negatively correlated with the volume of spared hippocampus tissue. Thus, the hippocampus plays an essential role in long-term memories supporting simple picture discriminations...|$|E

This study examined how differences between teaching stimuli in a conditional discrimination task impacted the discrimination/generalization outcomes among learners with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Three color sets {{were identified in}} a pilot study among 30 typically developing adults for the experiment. Subsequently five young children diagnosed with Down syndrome and moderate to severe intellectual disabilities participated in the experiment that employed an adapted alternating treatment single case experimental design. Prior to the intervention, participants’ performance within each color set of nine stimuli was baselined to ensure room for improvement. During intervention, each participant received three intervention conditions in an alternated manner. The three experimental conditions included two conditional discrimination conditions, that differed only {{in the degree of}} color difference (maximal or minimal) between two teaching stimuli (i. e., SA and SB), and a <b>simple</b> <b>discrimination</b> condition that involved only one teaching stimulus (i. e., SA).
