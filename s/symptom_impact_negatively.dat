We hypothesized that diabetics reporting increased GI symptoms would experience more impaired quality of life. METHODS: Subjects from the community with diabetes (n = 892) and outpatients with diabetes (n = 209) were recruited for this study. Subjects were divided into type 1 (diabetes diagnosed at age < 30 yr and requiring insulin) and type 2. A validated questionnaire measuring GI symptoms and diabetes status and the Short Form- 36 were completed. The results were compared with Australian normal data. GI symptom groups measured were frequent abdominal pain, bowel-related abdominal pain, reflux, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence. RESULTS: There was a clinically significant decrease in quality-of-life scores in diabetics compared with population norms across all subscales. The impact on quality of life in diabetes was predominantly observed in type 2 diabetics. The quality-of-life scores in all subscales decreased markedly with increasing numbers of distinct GI symptom groups, and this was similar in community and outpatient diabetics. For all the Short Form- 36 subscales, GI symptom groups were significantly (all p < 0. 0001) associated with poorer quality of life in diabetes, independent of age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, and type of diabetes.

40|$|Nonmotor {{symptoms}} (NMS) {{are common}} in patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) and {{have a major impact}} upon quality of life. We investigated the significance of NMS in relation to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with newly diagnosed PD. Patients and healthy controls were recruited as part of the Incidence of Cognitive Impairment in Cohorts with Longitudinal Evaluation in Parkinson's Disease Study. Prevalence of NMS was determined with the Non-Motor Symptom Questionnaire. HRQoL was recorded with the 39 -item Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ- 39). Further assessments included measures of motor disability, depression, sleep, and cognition. One hundred and fifty-eight patients with newly diagnosed PD and 99 controls participated in this cross-sectional study. Patients reported greater numbers of NMS than controls (mean 8. 3 ?. 3 versus 2. 8 ?. 5 symptoms; P?<? 0. 001). Patients reported lowest HRQoL in the domains assessing bodily discomfort, mobility, and activities of daily living. Motor and nonmotor <b>symptoms</b> <b>impacted</b> <b>negatively</b> upon HRQoL scores. Patients with the postural instability and gait difficulty motor subtype reported worse HRQoL, compared with those with tremor-dominant disease. Depression (P?<? 0. 001), incomplete bowel emptying (P?<? 0. 001), anxiety (P?<? 0. 001), impaired concentration (P?<? 0. 001), memory complaints (P?<? 0. 001), and insomnia (P?=? 0. 001) had the greatest negative impact upon HRQoL. NMS {{are common in}} patients with early PD and represent a significant cause of poorer health-related quality of life.

40|$|Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It is an incurable disease with improvement in quality of life (QOL) as a major focus area for management. This study assesses the QOL of COPD patients and the factors affecting it. Materials and Methods: All 124 patients diagnosed with COPD in a larger cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of COPD were assessed for their QOL using St. George's respiratory questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C). Spirometry was performed to assess lung function and diagnose COPD. Chronic lung disease (CLD) severity index {{was used to assess}} the severity of symptoms and the Medical Research Council questionnaire was used to assess the severity of dyspnea. Sociodemographic data regarding the patients were also recorded. Results: Patients with COPD showed significantly reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL). CLD estimate for severity of lung disease and the Medical Research Council assessment for dyspnea and the duration of illness showed a highly significant positive correlation with HRQOL. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between lung function and SGRQ-C score. Increasing age, increased quantum of smoking, and lower socioeconomic status were correlated with poorer HRQOL. No association between QOL and education, body mass index (BMI), and gender was observed. Conclusion: This study showed that Indian patients with COPD had reduced HRQOL.

40|$|Shortness {{of breath}} {{associated}} with cardiorespiratory abnormalities and peripheral muscle discomfort {{are the major}} factors that limit exercise capacity in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and those with congestive heart failure (CHF). Both of these <b>symptoms</b> <b>negatively</b> <b>impact</b> on patients’ daily physical activity levels. In turn, poor daily physical activity is commonly associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programmes partially reverse muscle weakness and dysfunction and increase functional capacity in both COPD and CHF.

Moreover, several barriers limit access and uptake of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programmes by eligible patients. A potential solution to the underutilisation of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is the implementation of tele-rehabilitation interventions at home using information and communications technologies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Preterm {{birth is}} {{associated}} with lower cognitive functioning. One potential pathway is postnatal parental depression. The authors assessed depressive symptoms in mothers and fathers after preterm birth, and identified the impacts of both prematurity and parental depressive symptoms on children's early cognitive function. METHOD: Data were from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (n = 5350). Depressive symptoms at 9 months were assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and children's cognitive function at 24 months by the Bayley Short Form, Research Edition. Weighted generalized estimating equation models examined {{the extent to which}} preterm birth, and mothers' and fathers' postnatal depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>impacted</b> children's cognitive function at 24 months, and whether the association between preterm birth and 24 -month cognitive function was mediated by parental depressive symptoms. RESULTS: At 9 months, fathers of very preterm (< 32 weeks gestation) and moderate/late preterm (32 - 37 weeks gestation) infants had higher CESD scores than fathers of term-born (≥ 37 weeks gestation) infants (p value =. 02); preterm birth was not associated with maternal depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, preterm birth was associated with lower cognitive function at 24 months; this association was unaffected by adjustment for parental depressive symptoms. Fathers', but not mothers', postnatal depressive symptoms predicted lower cognitive function in the fully adjusted model (β = - 0. 11, 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 18 to - 0. 03). CONCLUSION: Fathers of preterm infants have more postnatal depressive symptomology than fathers of term-born infants. Fathers' depressive <b>symptoms</b> also <b>negatively</b> <b>impact</b> children's early cognitive function. The national findings support early identification and treatment of fathers of preterm infants with depressive symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Background: Frontotemporal {{dementia}} (FTD) presents with marked neuropsychiatric <b>symptoms</b> that <b>impacts</b> <b>negatively</b> on {{activities of}} daily living (ADLs). The relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and disability in FTD is not well understood. This study aimed to (1) describe baseline function and neuropsychiatric symptoms in behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA); (2) examine longitudinal functional and neuropsychiatric symptom changes; and (3) examine whether function and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated longitudinally. Methods: 39 people (bvFTD= 21; svPPA= 18) were seen annually on two to four visits between 2007 - 2012, with 200 assessments completed in total. The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) assessed function, Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised (CBI-R) evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms, and Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) measured general cognition. Results: At baseline, people with bvFTD were more impaired functionally than svPPA despite having higher cognitive scores. In terms of baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms, bvFTD showed higher levels of apathy and changes to eating habits, whereas {{there was no difference in}} disinhibited or stereotypical behaviours between the groups. Longitudinally, both groups showed functional decline, however bvFTD remained worse than svPPA over time. Apathy and eating changes increased for both groups. Over time, disinhibited and stereotypical behaviours reduced in bvFTD, yet continued to increase for svPPA. Apathy and stereotypical behaviour were associated with functional decline in bvFTD, whereas only apathy made longitudinal contributions to functional disability in svPPA. Conclusions: People with bvFTD are more functionally impaired than svPPA, and despite overlapping baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms, these dissociate over time, with disinhibition and stereotypical behaviour reducing in people with bvFTD and increasing in svPPA. For both bvFTD and svPPA, apathy has a strong role in disability, but stereotypical behaviors only contributed to functional deficits in bvFTD. Aligning with previous clinical observations, our findings suggest that rigid/compulsive behaviors may in fact support activity engagement in svPPA (O'Connor et al. Disability & Rehabilitation 2016). Overall, our results indicate that interventions to address functional disability in FTD should carefully weigh the interaction of neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional status, thus require a tailored approach which may differ from those used in AD dementia...|$|R

METHODS: The 17 -item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD- 17), overall severity, somatic symptoms, {{and quality of life}} (QOL) (EuroQOL Questionnaire- 5 Dimensions [EQ- 5 D]) were assessed at baseline and 3 months. Anxiety was measured using items 10 and 11 from the HAMD- 17. Linear, tobit, and logistic multiple regression models analyzed the <b>impact</b> of anxiety <b>symptoms</b> on outcomes. Baseline anxiety was related to age and the presence of pain symptoms at baseline. RESULTS: Regression models showed that a higher level of anxiety was associated with a lower frequency of remission and lower QOL at 3 months. Patients with lower baseline anxiety symptoms had higher remission rates (odds ratio for each point of anxiety symptoms, 0. 829 [95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 723 - 0. 951]). Patients with higher levels of baseline anxiety had a lower QOL at 3 months (a decrease in EQ- 5 D tariff score for each point of anxiety symptoms, 0. 023 [95 % CI: 0. 045 - 0. 001]).

40|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD) is {{a mental illness}} that encompasses a constellation of devastating <b>symptoms</b> that <b>negatively</b> <b>impacts</b> the lives of many. Individuals with BPD also demonstrate impairment in perspective taking abilities. Previous studies have linked perspective taking to decrease in negative affect in university samples. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the relationship between perspective taking and negative affect in individuals with BPD. Participants included five women who were diagnosed with borderline {{personality disorder}}. Each participant completed self-report questionnaires measuring trait negative affect, trait perspective taking abilities, and current negative affect. Participants read an anger-inducing vignette and engaged in a mentalization-based therapy intervention using the two-chair technique to increase perspective taking skills. Given the small sample size, visual analysis was used to interpret the study findings. Results indicated increased negative affect after participants read the anger-inducing vignette, and decrease in negative affect after participating in the perspective taking intervention. The results also demonstrated individuals with greater trait perspective taking scores showed greater decrease in negative affect after engaging in the perspective taking intervention. Furthermore, individuals with greater trait perspective taking scores also reported lower trait negative affect scores.
