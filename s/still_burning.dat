5|$|Firefighting {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was <b>still</b> <b>burning.</b> Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.|$|E
25|$|After 20 hours, {{the centre}} of the fire was still {{inaccessible}} to firefighters and five pools of fuel were <b>still</b> <b>burning.</b> A special fire-retardant foam was brought from an Ultramar refinery in Lévis, aiding progress by firefighters on the Saturday night. Five of the unexploded cars were doused with high-pressure water to prevent further explosions, and two were <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> and at risk of exploding 36 hours later. The train's event recorder was recovered at around 15:00 the next day and the fire was finally extinguished in the evening, after burning for nearly two days.|$|E

25|$|Disused {{coal mines}} {{can also cause}} issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to {{infrastructure}} or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, {{and it has been}} estimated that thousands of coal seam fires are burning at any given time. For example, there is a coal seam fire in Germany that has been burning since 1668, and is <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Marlene Olive and Riley {{tried to}} dispose of the bodies by {{transporting}} them to a wooded area at nearby China Camp and burning them in a barbecue pit with gasoline and logs in an attempt to make them unrecognizable. The couple left while the bodies were <b>still</b> <b>burning.</b> A fireman who arrived shortly thereafter to put out the unattended fire initially mistook the partially burnt remains for a deer carcass. The couple later returned to the park and further burned the remains along with additional evidence.|$|E

50|$|After {{the wave}} of {{explosive}} bombs came about 200,000 phosphorus and incendiary bombs whose job was to ignite the firestorm, for as with attacks on other cities, for instance Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah), the firestorm was no accident, but rather a carefully planned tactic that {{was the result of}} years of thorough scientific research. It would <b>still</b> be <b>burning</b> long after the bombers had returned to England.|$|R
25|$|The city {{is noted}} for one world record. A 110+ year old 4-watt light bulb, called the Centennial Light, {{housed in the}} Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department main station, is <b>still</b> <b>burning.</b> It glows dimly, but still {{functions}} as a light bulb. The Guinness Book of World Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not, and General Electric {{have concluded that the}} bulb has been burning continuously since 1901 with the exception of power failures and three times it was disconnected for moves to new stations. The light bulb was manufactured by the Shelby Electric Company and was hand blown with a carbon filament.|$|E
25|$|By sunrise, {{the firefighters}} were still battling {{the fire and}} trying to spray areas where people were seen trapped. The {{watching}} crowd were pushed back from the building because of falling debris. At 04:14, officials from the Metropolitan Police Service addressed the large crowd of onlookers and urgently instructed them to contact anyone they knew who was trapped in the building—if {{they are able to}} reach them via phone or social media—to tell them they must try to self-evacuate and not wait for the fire brigade. At 05:00, the building was <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> and severely damaged.|$|E
25|$|A Coast Guard {{investigation}} concluded several {{facts about}} the Marine Sulphur Queen which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and {{along the sides of}} the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire <b>still</b> <b>burning.</b> When a fire was actually put out, the sulphur would puddle and cake around equipment, once shorting out a major electrical generator. Caked sulphur was also found in spaces below the tanks, due to many cracks in the structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{rescue effort}} was {{hampered}} by the weather, terrain, and other problems. Emergency vehicles could not approach due to a fuel pipeline destroyed by the crash and blocking the narrow road. United States Navy Seabees of NMCB133 {{were some of the}} first on the scene as they utilized their earth moving equipment to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> eight hours after impact.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the deaths}} and damage in Texas City were due to the {{destruction}} and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. 27 of the 28 members of Texas City's volunteer fire department and 3 members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department {{who were on the}} docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had not responded to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100km) away. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived, {{from as far away as}} Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned hulks.|$|E
25|$|On November 9, 2016, {{a massive}} fire struck the Industrial Materials Recycling {{facility}} {{located in the}} plant's former galvanizing, cold mill, and hot mill buildings. The fire, which began at about 7 AM after a lightbulb exploded over flammable materials, was fought by more than 100 firefighters from Lackawanna, Buffalo, and other towns. Several explosions were caused by the fire, which collapsed {{the roof of the}} structure and caused other heavy damage to it. Federal and state environmental officials rushed to the scene to monitor health hazards from the blaze, which caused the evacuation of a nearby neighborhood due to fire and the closure of two elementary schools due to smoke dangers. Burning debris fell on the towns of Lackawanna and Hamburg. The fire was contained but <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> on the morning of November 10, requiring the continued evacuation of the neighborhood and the schools.|$|E

This resulted in a reduction in the hotly competitive linen trade which had been in a brief slump. A consequence of this scattering of highly-political Catholics, however, was a spread of Defenderism throughout Ireland.|$|R

25|$|The {{result was}} that shortly after the {{ineffective}} single bomber's attack the ship, with no life boats or rafts {{as a result of}} the earlier fighter attack, was hit heavily damaged and set in flames. The captain attempted to beach her but was unsuccessful in reaching the island as the engines failed with the ship about three miles offshore. The attacks continued and survivors jumped overboard in an attempt to swim to the island, a process that took about ten hours. Those that reached the island arrived in scattered groups, assembled and began searching for others. They found four dead and that many were missing. In the mid-morning of 20 February H.M.A.S. Warrnambool, having rescued some of the missing crew, picked up the main body of survivors. Warrnambool, with survivors aboard approached the <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> Don Isidro searching for the missing Chief Engineer and Chief Electrician reported to be still aboard and badly burnt and wounded. The ship's deck was already under water and no survivors were found. The survivors aboard Warrnambool reached Darwin about midnight where they were treated overnight at hospital. Then they were billeted at the camp of the 147th Field Artillery awaiting orders.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} North Dakota State Capitol building, built between 1883 and 1884, {{and expanded}} in 1894 (Senate wing) and 1903 (House wing), {{burned to the}} ground the morning of December 28, 1930. The fire was said to have been started by oily rags in a janitor's closet {{on the top floor of}} the main part of the building. The rags had been used to clean and varnish the legislators' desks in preparation for the upcoming legislative session. North Dakota Secretary of State Robert Byrne saved the original copy of the state's constitution, but he suffered cuts and burns on his hands while breaking a window to reach the document. Another state employee, Jennie Ulsrud, burned her hands when she attempted to save records in the North Dakota State Treasurer's office. Governor George F. Shafer came back from his visit to St. Paul, Minnesota while the fire was <b>still</b> <b>burning.</b> Upon arrival, he immediately assembled a team of state legislators and officials to discuss plans for coping with the loss of records and work space. The day after the fire, to save as many records as possible, 40 state prison inmates went to work trying to salvage materials from the ruins. The Legislature met temporarily in Bismarck's War Memorial Building and the City Auditorium.|$|E

In particular, he contributed to the first detections of solar-like oscillations in stars such as eta Bootis, beta Hydri and alpha Centauri. He also led the discovery, using data from the Kepler space telescope, that red giants oscillate in mixed modes that are directly sensitive to the core properties of the star and can be used to distinguish red giants burning helium in their cores from those that are <b>still</b> only <b>burning</b> hydrogen in a shell.|$|R

500|$|No.24 Squadron's {{strength}} at {{the beginning}} of 1942 was four Hudsons, six Wirraways, and 130staff. On New Year's Day, Lerew led the Hudsons on a raid against Kapingamarangi Island, igniting a fuel dump that was <b>still</b> <b>burning</b> when the squadron returned to follow up the attack two days later. During 4–7 January, Vunakanau airfield suffered four raids by unescorted Japanese bombers, destroying {{all but one of the}} Hudsons. Although the Wirraways were scrambled to intercept attackers on several occasions, their rate of climb was so poor that only once did one of them manage to engage an enemy seaplane, without result; this action, on 6January, was the first air-to-air combat between RAAF and Japanese forces. At this point, Lerew signalled headquarters for six [...] "modern fighters" [...] with which to defend his airfield; none were forthcoming.|$|E
