5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Los Angeles {{estimated}} in 2007 that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples {{would result in}} a net gain of approximately $3.2 million each year to the state budget. The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive <b>study</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E

The couple lived in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania before settling in Minneapolis in 1936 when Jean Piccard joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota.

5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a <b>study</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 United States Census, {{before the}} city's incorporation, {{recorded}} 520 residents. The following 1920 censusthe first to define Omak {{as a distinct}} subdivisioncounted 2,500 residents, making it the most populous municipality of Okanogan County, having surpassed Okanogan (1,519 residents). Subsequent census counts documented an increase to 4,000 residents before a shrink in population at the 1980 census, when fruit prices rose, land was lost, and major employers were shut down. After this decline, the population steadily increased, approaching approximately 5,000 residents by the 2000 census. Between 1990 and 2000, the city's population experienced a boom of 14.7 percent, while between 2000 and 2010, the population increased by around 2.6 percent. The United States Census Bureau estimated that there were 4,792 residents in 2013, representing a 0.6 {{percent increase over the}} 2010 census, while an estimate from Office of Federal Financial Management in 2013 documented a population decrease of 0.3 percent to 4,830 people. A 2011 <b>study</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States Census Bureau showed that there were 4,881 residents, a 0.7 percent increase over the 2010 census.|$|E
5|$|The Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (Metro) began {{operating}} {{bus service}} in King County in 1973, including regular bus {{service to the}} airport from Downtown Seattle on routes 174 and 194. A 1986 <b>study</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Puget Sound Council of Governments and Metro recommended {{the construction of a}} light rail system between Federal Way and Lynnwood serving the airport and Downtown Seattle. A regional transit authority (RTA) was formed in the early 1990s to study a regional light rail system, first proposing a $6.7 billion plan in 1995 with service to Sea-Tac Airport via International Boulevard. The proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, leading to a smaller, $3.9 billion proposal approved by voters the following year, with stations at the airport and South 200th Street.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to <b>study</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E
