25|$|A tightly <b>spun</b> <b>wool</b> yarn {{made from}} fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|E

60|$|Being a {{great deal}} alone, in the strange place, fancies possessed her, people took on strange shapes. Even Ciccio and Pancrazio. And it came that she never wandered far from the house, from her room, after the first months. She seemed to hide herself in her room. There she sewed and <b>spun</b> <b>wool</b> and read, and learnt Italian. Her men were not at all anxious to teach her Italian. Indeed her chief teacher, at first, was a young fellow called Bussolo. He was a model from London, and he came down to Califano sometimes, hanging about, anxious to speak English.|$|E
6000|$|Life was {{primitive}} in all {{the homes}} of the coulee. Money was hard to get. We always had plenty to eat, but {{little in the way of}} luxuries. We had few toys except those we fashioned for ourselves, and our garments were mostly home-made. I have heard my father say, [...] "Belle could go to town with me, buy the calico for a dress and be wearing it for supper"--but I fear that even this did not happen very often. Her [...] "dress up" [...] gowns, according to certain precious old tintypes, indicate that clothing was for her only a sort of uniform,--and yet I will not say this made her unhappy. Her face was always smiling. She knit all our socks, made all our shirts and suits. She even carded and <b>spun</b> <b>wool,</b> in addition to her housekeeping, and found time to help on our kites and bows and arrows.|$|E
60|$|The Romans had {{in those}} days very small riches, they held in general small farms in the country, which they worked {{themselves}} {{with the help of}} their sons and slaves. The plebeians were often the richest. They too held farms leased to them by the state, and had often small shops in Rome. The whole territory was so small that it was easy to come into Rome to worship, attend the Senate, or vote, and many had no houses in the city. Each man was married with a ring and sacrifice, and the lady was then carried over the threshold, on which a sheepskin was spread, and made mistress of the house by being bidden to be Caia to Caius. The Roman matrons were good and noble women {{in those days}}, and the highest praise of them was held to be Domum mansit, lanam fecit--she stayed at home and <b>spun</b> <b>wool.</b> Each man was absolute master in his own house, and had full power over his grown-up sons, even for life or death, and they almost always submitted entirely. For what made the Romans so great was that they were not only brave, but they were perfectly obedient, and obeyed as perfectly as they could their fathers, their officers, their magistrates, and, as they thought, their gods.|$|E

Hard labour included rock breaking and oakum picking.|$|E

The factory in Bond Street <b>spun</b> <b>wool</b> sourced in England and later New Zealand and in 1861 two steam engines named 'Juno' and 'Jupiter' were {{installed}} to operate new 'Brookhouse' knitting frames. These two engines were not replaced until the 1940s. In 1862 the firm bought a second factory in Leicester, Abbey Mills, and in 1885 a third, Anker Mill in Nuneaton. The two engines in this latter (named 'Annie' and 'Elizabeth') were modelled on James Watt's original steam engine and ran night and day between 1890 and 1938 with only three stoppages of more than a week.|$|E

5000|$|The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company {{produced}} {{good quality}} wool products.

50|$|During the Long March {{the women}} engaged in battle, carried the wounded off battle fields, often came under enemy fire, and {{were subject to}} the same trials and {{diseases}} as the men.

The army even carried costumes and sets so the women could entertain the troops after a day of marching. They were in charge of propaganda as well, recruiting hundreds of soldiers along the way, as well as nurses and more women. The women were generally treated as equal comrades-in-arms by their fellow soldiers. However, their situation did not always lead to complete equality, as it was not uncommon for some of the women to be relegated to traditional female tasks such as cooking and laundry.|$|E
5000|$|The Pawtuxet Valley Dyeing Company is a {{historic}} mill complex at 9 Howard Avenue {{in the town of}} Coventry, Rhode Island. The complex includes three buildings: the main mill building and two pump houses, as well as the dam which impounds the Pearce Mill Pond, and the tailrace which evacuates water from the mill into the North Branch Pawtuxet River. The main mill is an irregularly shaped complex of structures, which grew from the original Pearce Brothers Woolen Mill, a two-story rubble-stone structure that predates 1859, and has been extended in all directions. Most of the additions were made in the first two decades of the 20th century. The dam, about 100 ft long, is an earth-fill structure faced in fieldstone and capped in 20th-century concrete, with a modern spillway. The tailrace is a trench lined with cut stone which exits from under the original mill building. The mill was established by Joseph W. Pearce, an English immigrant, and carded and <b>spun</b> <b>wool.</b> [...] The November 13, 1920 edition of Fibre and Fabric, a trade publication, lists James B. McDowell as president and J.B. Bennett as treasurer and general manager. A brief notice states that the company added a new machine, and is [...] "quite busy with orders".|$|E
