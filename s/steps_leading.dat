5|$|The Calais Lighthouse (Le phare de Calais) {{was built}} in 1848, {{replacing}} the old watch tower as the lighthouse of the port. The 55 metre high tower was electrified in 1883 and automated in 1992. The staircase has 271 <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> up to the lantern. By day it is easily distinguishable from other coastal lighthouses by its white color and black lantern. The lighthouse was classified as a historical monument on 22 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> up to the stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Library {{became a}} popular {{destination}} for studying and hanging out {{for young people}} from well-known neighbouring schools such as Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls' School, St Joseph's Institution and Tao Nan School that had their early beginnings in this area. The landmark Balustrade or front porch and <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> up to the Library became an intimate public space where one could sit and read, wait, chat or simply watch the world go by.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} known that under the church was a vault {{containing}} the remains of {{some members of the}} Stanley family but its whereabouts were not known until they were discovered by an architect in 2007. A stone slab was removed exposing <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> to a crypt under the chancel. This contained six coffins, four of which contained the bodies of the first and second LordsStanley and their wives. Once the details had been recorded, the crypt was resealed.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{provides}} feedback {{as well as}} {{technical advice}} to each country and evaluates its progress on an individual basis. Once a country is agreed to meet the requirements, NATO can issue that country an invitation to begin accession talks. Currently, two countries have a Membership Action Plan: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia.. Former MAP participants were Albania and Croatia between May 2002 and April 2009, and Montenegro between December 2009 and June 2017, when they joined NATO. The final accession process, once invited, involves five <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> up to {{the signing of the}} accession protocols and the acceptance and ratification of those protocols by the governments of the current NATO members.|$|E
5|$|The Malé Friday Mosque is {{oriented}} west. Its prayer carpet is angled {{towards the}} mosque's northwest corner, so worshippers can face Mecca while they pray. Devotees enter the mosque from the Islamic Centre, climbing several marble <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> to the mosque balcony. The prayer hall below has a burgundy-coloured carpet, patterned with images resembling hot-water bottles which demarcate spaces for the believers offering prayers. The carpet can accommodate 1,372 people if each devotee occupies one space. The mosque has a reported capacity of 10,700 for Friday prayers.|$|E

50|$|For emulsions, {{flocculation}} describes clustering {{of individual}} dispersed droplets together, whereby the individual droplets do not lose their identity. Flocculation is thus the initial <b>step</b> <b>leading</b> to further ageing of the emulsion (droplet coalescence {{and the ultimate}} separation of the phases). Flocculation is used in mineral dressing.|$|R
5|$|The Terrace of the Presidents: Robert Gannon, {{president}} of Fordham from 1936 to 1949, initiated {{the custom of}} engraving the granite <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> up to Keating Hall {{with the names of}} heads of state who visit the university. Among the names engraved are George Washington, who visited the Rose Hill Manor before it was succeeded by St. John's College in 1841; Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Harry S.

5|$|Gomti Ghat {{consists}} of <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> to the Gomti River, {{which is also}} a holy place for pilgrims to take a dip in the river, before visiting Dwarakadish temple. The ghat has a number of small shrines dedicated to the Samudra (God of the Sea), Saraswati and Lakshmi. Other notable temples in the ghat area include the Samudra Narayana (Sangam Narayana) temple, which is at the confluence of the Gomti River with the sea, the Chakra Narayana temple where there is a stone with an imprint of a chakra as a manifestation of Vishnu, and the Gomati temple, which has an idol of the river goddess Gomati that {{is said to have been}} brought to earth by the sage Vasishta.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{mechanism}} proposed by Sweet in 1973 the aldol condensation of ethylacetoacetate 1 and the aryl aldehyde is the rate-limiting <b>step</b> <b>leading</b> to the carbenium ion 2. The nucleophilic addition of urea gives the intermediate 4, which quickly dehydrates {{to give the}} desired product 5.|$|R
30|$|Dehydration of {{glycerol}} {{may follow}} two pathways. The dehydration {{of the secondary}} hydroxyl group yields 3 -hydroxypropanal, which undergoes a dehydration <b>step,</b> <b>leading</b> {{to the formation of}} acrolein. On the other hand, the dehydration of the primary hydroxyl group results in 1 -hydroxyacetone, also known as acetol [23].|$|R
50|$|Electrification {{allowed the}} {{placement}} of machinery such as machine tools in a systematic arrangement along {{the flow of the}} work.

5|$|St Edwen's {{is built}} from local red gritstone, formed into square blocks and dressed with sandstone. The roof {{is made from}} slate with stone edging. The church, {{which is in the}} Late Decorated style, has a tower topped with a broach spire at the north-west corner of the nave, {{supported}} by buttresses. The church is entered through a porch with an arched doorway in the lowest of the three stages of the tower. Inside, the woodwork of the roof is exposed; some of the nave timbers might be medieval beams reused in the 1856 rebuilding. The nave and chancel are divided by an arch and by three <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> up from the nave. The chancel and sanctuary are separated by an altar rail set on top of some wooden panels.|$|E
5|$|The west front has two {{flights of}} broad, balustraded <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> {{up to the}} central door. Inside is a full-height hall with a part-hipped valley roof. On either side of this are {{octagonal}} turrets with cupolas and delicately pierced parapets. To {{the left of the}} hall is the former medieval kitchen with a balustraded parapet and buttresses. To the right is a range of parapetted rooms with a stepped buttress at the corner. The south front was plain, being the inside north wall of the original abbey church which was pulled down, but was rebuilt by William Talbot in 1828 to include bay windows. At this end of the building is Sharington's tower, an octagonal, three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade and stair turret.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the house a series of {{terraces}} leads down to the Fish Pond. The retaining walls {{at the southern end of}} the upper terrace are listed at GradeII, as are the retaining walls at the end of the upper terrace and the <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> down to the middle terrace. Stretching along the middle terrace is a long rectangular pool containing a three fountains. The retaining walls of this pool are listed at GradeII, as are the railings on the north and the south side of the terrace. On each side of the pool are two compartments framed by yew hedges. Between these compartments, on each side, is a statue by Raymond Smith. Both of these were made in 1852 for the 2ndMarquess and are listed at GradeII. The one to the north depicts a stag at bay, and that to the south a hunter on a rearing horse.|$|E

50|$|This cycle {{involving}} HOx and NOx is terminated by {{the reaction}} of OH with NO2 to form nitric acid or by {{the reaction of}} peroxy radicals {{with each other to}} form peroxides. The chemistry involving VOCs is much more complex but the same reaction of peroxy radicals oxidizing NO to NO2 is the critical <b>step</b> <b>leading</b> to ozone formation.|$|R
5|$|To {{the eastern}} {{transept}} is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) {{which was made}} to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. The bed was once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; however once {{it was no longer}} used it was transferred to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. The bed {{is in the form of}} a high platform with many layers, and small <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the throne hall, member of the royal family take their seat in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. During such times the throne and bed were used as altars for Buddha images.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{military}} experience {{began in the}} French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia. In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and Indians {{as far north as}} present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. The following year he led another expedition to the area to assist in the construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before reaching that point, he and some of his men, accompanied by Indian allies, ambushed a French scouting party. Its leader was killed, although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed. This peacetime act of aggression is seen {{as one of the first}} military <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> to the global Seven Years' War. The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush, forcing his surrender. Released on parole, Washington and his troops returned to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow <b>steps</b> <b>leading</b> down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
