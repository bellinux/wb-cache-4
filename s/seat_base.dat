2500|$|The {{front end}} of the Range Rover was revamped in 1986. This brought a more pedestrian-friendly plastic grille with {{horizontal}} slats, and optional front valance with two fog lights. The <b>seat</b> <b>base</b> was lowered and door handles were redesigned, making it more difficult for rear passengers but greatly improving the comfort for taller people in the front. The dashboard switchgear was updated again, now featuring steering column stalks from the Austin Montego, and other miscellaneous items from the Austin Rover car range. [...] Other changes included the windows, tailgate and bonnet, but none of those affected the general design. Bonnet and door hinges gradually evolved out of sight and the fuel filler cap was hidden behind a hinged flap. [...] The last major change to the interior took place in 1994, when the Range Rover was re-designated [...] "Classic" [...] upon the arrival of the replacement P38A version. The car gained a 'soft feel' safety dashboard (derived from that used in the facelifted Series 1 Discovery) with new switches (this time lifted from the Rover 800) and instruments. [...] These end of the line models are popularly called [...] "soft dash" [...] models by the motor trade and by enthusiasts to distinguish them from other members of the Range Rover Classic series.|$|E

50|$|Burns Municipal Airport covers {{an area of}} 825 acres (334 ha) at an {{elevation}} of 4,159 feet (1,268 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 12/30 is 5,100 by 75 feet (1,554 x 23 m) with an asphalt surface; 3/21 is 4,600 by 60 feet (1,402 x 18 m) with a concrete surface.

50|$|Many {{recumbent}} bicycles have {{at least}} a rear suspension because the rider is usually unable to lift themselves off the seat while riding. Single pivot is usually adequate when the pedaling thrust is horizontal - that is, forwards rather than downwards. This is usually the case provided the bottom bracket is higher than the seat's base height. Where the bottom bracket is significantly lower than the <b>seat</b> <b>base,</b> there may still be some pedalling-induced bounce.|$|E

50|$|In {{only one}} {{significant}} respect does the underbone {{differ from the}} conventional motorcycle - there is no frame member or fuel tank between the <b>seat</b> <b>base</b> and the headstock. Generally the fuel tank is under the riders seat. The underbone arrangement improves ease of mounting and dismounting and contributes to the cross-gender appeal of the layout as an around-town shopping and commuter vehicle. The engine size of a typical underbone is generally between 50 cc and up to about 150 cc, though much bigger ones are available.|$|E
50|$|The E65 {{contained}} many {{departures from}} automotive interior design conventions. BMW removed the traditional console mounted gear selector {{replacing it with}} a steering-column mounted stalk, in favour of two cup holders. The e-brake is controlled using a button on the dashboard. The seats adjustment controls were moved from their traditional place {{on the side of the}} <b>seat</b> <b>base</b> to the inside of the raised central console, which drew some criticisms. Unlike most BMWs since 1975 (including the E65's predecessor and successor), the centre instrument panel is not angled towards the driver.|$|E
50|$|The ride has one train, {{which has}} 10 cars with 2 seats on each car {{catering}} 650 riders per hour. The safety system consists of over-the-shoulder restraints that lock {{into place and}} then a belt-type connector that attaches the <b>seat</b> <b>base</b> to the over-the-shoulder restraints. Riders are taken up 14.8 m by a wheeled lift hill, and go through a tight helix, followed {{by a series of}} small turns and drops. Upon approaching the station, the ride is slowed by a magnetic brake run. Each ride cycle takes 1.5 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|In the United Kingdom and Ireland, {{the term}} couch is rarely used, the terms sofa or settee being more common. A {{furniture}} set {{consisting of a}} sofa with two matching chairs. {{is known as a}} [...] "chesterfield suite" [...] or [...] "living room suite." [...] Also in the UK, the word chesterfield meant any couch in the 1900s, but now describes a deep buttoned sofa, usually made from leather, with arms and back of the same height.

5000|$|A new [...] "L" [...] {{designation}} {{was used}} for extended-wheelbase Town Cars from 2000 to 2011. The L editions offered an additional 6 in of rear-seat legroom, as well as remote access audio and climate controls mounted in the rear center armrest. Also included was a two-way travel switch for the front passenger <b>seat</b> <b>base</b> (a feature shared with the extended-wheelbase Jaguar XJ). This L designation {{was similar to that}} used on other luxury flagship sedans such as the BMW 7-Series or the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

5000|$|In 1990, Cadillac {{offered a}} lower-priced ($53,050) {{companion}} {{model with a}} cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop, and a model including the hardtop at $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, which included a $650 Gas Guzzler Tax along with $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, which was equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté's bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and 100000 mi, was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional 50000 mi of coverage. Allanté owners also received a special toll-free number to call for service or concerns. Headlamp washers and dual 10-way Recaro seating remained standard, among other niceties. A driver's side airbag {{was added to the}} leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel [...] - [...] which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster - introduced the previous year - was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), however, only 358 cars were equipped with the analog cluster. The power mirror control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on {{the upper end of the}} driver's door armrest, while the power seat switches (previously mounted on the face of the <b>seat</b> <b>base)</b> were relocated to the lower side trim of the <b>seat</b> <b>base</b> facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener base mounted on the header panel above the windshield was eliminated when a revamped sun visor design was introduced this year. Technological news was the addition of traction control - the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 in the world to be equipped as such. The elaborate system was able to cut fuel to up to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. The electronically controlled shock absorbers were retuned to remain in [...] "soft" [...] mode for up to 40 mph. Previously, they entered [...] "normal" [...] mode after just 25 mph. A revised audio system allowed a CD player to be added as standard equipment, along with the cassette player. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported - four to Canada and one to Germany. Allanté was available in eight colors this year, the most popular was Euro Red, found on 1,012 cars, while the least chosen was Gray Metallic, with only 28 made. Interior color choices (and production figures) were Charcoal Gray (1,343), Natural Beige (767), and Maroon (413).|$|E
