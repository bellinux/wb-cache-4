Numerical TCAD device simulations were used first to characterize and optimize {{the performance of the}} TFET. The optimized TFETs show a steeper subthreshold slope than CMOS leading to a 5 orders of magnitude reduction in standby current. A look-up table model for circuit simulation of the TFET was developed based on characteristics obtained from TCAD simulations. A TFET SRAM cell is proposed and its performance is analyzed. Our novel 8 T TFET SRAM cell operates at VDD= 1 V or lower. The Read and Write Static Noise Margins (SNM) are evaluated at 120 mV and 200 mV, with operation speeds of 3. 8 GHz and 800 MHz at VDD= 1 V in read and write, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Static</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memories</b> (SRAMs) exhibit faults {{that are}} {{electrical}} in nature. Functional and electrical testing are performed to diagnose faulty operation. These tests are usually designed from simple fault models that describe the chip interface behavior without a thorough {{analysis of the}} chip layout and technology. However, there are certain technology and layout-related defects that are internal to the chip and are mostly time-dependent i nature. The resulting failures {{may or may not}} seriously degrade the input/output interface behavior. They may show up as electrical faults (such as a slow access fault) and/or functional faults (such as a pattern sensitive fault). However, these faults cannot be described properly with the functional fault models because these models do not take timing into account. Also, electrical fault models that describe merely the input/output interface behavior are inadequate to characterize every possible defect in the basic SRAM cell. Examples of faults produced by these defects are: (a) static data loss, (b) abnormally high currents drawn from the power supply, etc. Generating tests for such faults often requires a thorough understanding and analysis of the circuit technology and layout. In this article, we shall examine ways to characterize and test such faults. We shall divide such faults into two categories depending on the types of SRAMs they effect-silicon SRAMs and GaAs SRAMs...|$|R
