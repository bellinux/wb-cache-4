40|$|Detecting {{the factors}} that {{determine}} the interruption of gene flow between populations is key to understanding how speciation occurs. In this context, caves are an excellent system for studying processes of colonization, differentiation and speciation, since they represent discrete geographical units often with known geological histories. Here, we asked whether discontinuous calcareous areas and cave systems represent major barriers to gene flow within and among the five species of Sardinian cave salamanders (genus Hydromantes) and whether intraspecific genetic structure parallels geographic distance within and among caves. We generated mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences from 184 individuals representing 48 populations, and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to infer possible areas of cladogenesis for these species and reconstruct historical and current dispersal routes among distinct populations. Our results show deep genetic divergence within and among all <b>Sardinian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> species, which can mostly {{be attributed to the}} effects of mountains and discontinuities in major calcareous areas and cave systems acting as barriers to gene flow. While these salamander species can also occur outside caves, our results indicate that there is a very poor dispersal of these species between separate cave systems...|$|E

50|$|Ambrosi's <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{endemic to}} a small area of southeastern France and northwestern Italy. Despite its name, it is not {{restricted}} to caves though it retreats under stones, logs and into caverns in dry periods. At other times it is active on the leaf litter near streams and on wet rocky outcrops in wooded valleys at altitudes of up to 1250 m. In the southeast of its distribution, where its range overlaps that of the Italian <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> (Speleomantes italicus), the two species sometimes hybridise.|$|R
50|$|The Italian <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{a slender}} species with short limbs and grows to {{a length of}} about 12.5 cm {{including}} a short tail. The head is broad with prominent eyes {{and there is a}} distinct groove between the nostrils and the edge of the lips. The feet are partially webbed. It is dark in colour with mottled reddish or yellowish markings and a dark belly. In the north of its range it is more variable in colour and sometimes hybridises with Ambrosi's <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> (Speleomantes ambrosii).|$|R
50|$|The <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> is a {{relatively}} large lungless salamander, {{ranging in size from}} 10 to 20 cm in total body length. The tail makes up a significant proportion of the total length, up to 60-65%. Post-metamorphic individuals have orange to reddish orange backs and a pale, unmarked ventral surface. The dorsal surface of the body is heavily marked with irregularly spaced spots and dashes. The limbs of the <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> are long. There are 14-15 costal grooves {{on the side of the}} body. This species has a prehensile tail.|$|R
50|$|This {{salamander}} {{resembles the}} Tennessee <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> (Gyrinophilus palleucus) but grows {{to a larger}} size, has a more spatulate snout, a broader head and more pigmentation. The premaxilla bones {{at the tip of}} the snout are completely divided in adults of this species while they are not in the Tennessee <b>cave</b> <b>salamander.</b> The larvae have small, functional eyes and they can detect vibrations in the water with the help of mechanoreceptors which are located on the head and sides. If they proceed to the full adult state, their eyes become functionless.|$|R
