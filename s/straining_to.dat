40|$|The {{presence}} of multiresistance {{to the effects}} of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics and extended spectrum beta-lactamase were examined in 45 strains of E. coli and 35 strains of Salmonella. The strains of E. coli originated from several species of domestic animals: dogs, cats, poultry, and cattle, and 30 strains of Salmonella originated from poultry, 4 strains from cattle, and 1 strain from swine. The {{presence of}} the following serovarieties was established using serological examinations: Salmonella Enteritidis 17 strains, Salmonella Gallinarum 1 strain, Salmonella Hartford 5 strains, Salmonella Anatum 1 strain, Salmonella Typhimurium 4 strains, Salmonella Agona 1 strain, Salmonella Infantis 1 strain, Salmonella Thompson var. Berlin 1 strain, Salmonella Tennessee 1 strain, Salmonella Senftenberg 1 strain, Salmonella Glostrup 1 strain, and Salmonella Hadar 1 strain. In the examinations of the listed strains we used antibiogram discs of ampicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cephtriaxon, cephotaxim, cephtazidime, aztreonam, gentamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cyprofloxacine, and a combination of sulphamethoxasole and trimethoprim.

Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'.

The tensile properties (tensile strength, Young’s modulus and <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> failure) were determined by varying span length. Scanning electron microscopic analysis was also carried out to determine the physical properties of fibers in order to correlate with its strength, Young’s modulus and <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> failure. The Young’s modulus and <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> failure were corrected using newly developed equations. The study revealed that with increasing test span length the Young’s modulus increased and tensile strength as well as <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> failure decreased. This is because no extensometer could be used in this test set-up and machine displacement (denoted by α) was used for the modulus determination. It is also attributed that larger span length helps to minimize the machine displacement compared to smaller ones due to the reduced relative effect of slippage in the clamps. Among all fibers, the Young’s modulus of bamboo fiber was the highest. Jute fiber had smoother surface compared to other three examined fibers...|$|R
