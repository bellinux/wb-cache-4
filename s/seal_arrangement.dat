Those factors result in several types of imperfection at the sealing surface. This work explores the possibility to seal large rotary processors to positive pressure up to 1 atmosphere (14. 7 psig). First, an extensive theoretical analysis combined with on-site measurements evaluation was conducted to quantify the magnitude of each type of surface imperfection at the seal location. Against these results, the current typical seals used in the industry were evaluated and compared. The seals that featured compressed packing seals seem to show great possibility as they are already used in successful positive pressure large <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement.</b> A typical packing <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> with a stuffing-box was studied thoroughly {{in order to understand}} its particularities. The data collected and calculated in the previous steps was gathered and settled the new seal requirements. A new <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> is proposed and it features as principal characteristics: radial compression and adaptive flexible housing. Based on the stuffing-box available mathematical relations, the equations are re-evaluated to account for the new radially oriented arrangement. Meanwhile, a test rig is designed and built to measure the seal performance and observe its behaviour. The effect of several parameters can be studied such as temperature, gas pressure, magnitude of sealing surface imperfection, magnitude of radial compression and drum rotation speed.

In recent years this approach has been re-evaluated and additional steps to insure safety in case of a secondary seal failure undertaken. Since both tandem and double seals can be used for applications with sealing pressure below approximately 40 bar, what benefits are to be gained by double seal application? Double <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> among other things, allows for system simplification and more reliable operation, significant reduction of sealing gas volumes, prevention of seal reverse pressurization and shorter in-between the bearings shaft span.

40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) {{with low}} levels of {{external}} pressurization and poor end sealing are prone to air entrapment, thus reducing the damping capability. Furthermore, existing predictive models are too restrictive. Single frequency, unidirectional load and centered circular orbit experiments were conducted on a revamped SFD test rig. The damper journal is 1 " in length and 5 " in diameter, with nominal clearance of 5 mils (0. 127 mm). The SFD feed end is flooded with oil, while the discharge end contains a recirculation groove and four orifice discharge ports to prevent air ingestion. The discharge end is fully sealed with a wave-spring that pushes a seal ring into contact with the SFD journal. The measurements conducted without and with lubricant in the squeeze film lands, along with a frequency domain identification procedure, render the mechanical seal dry-friction force and viscous damping force coefficients as functions of frequency and motion amplitude. The end <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> is quite effective in eliminating side leakage and preventing air entrainment into the film lands. Importantly enough, the dry friction force, arising from the contact forces in relative motion, increases significantly the test element equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The identified system damping coefficients are thus frequency and amplitude of motion dependent, albeit decreasing rapidly as the motion parameters increase. Identified force coefficients, damping and added mass, for the squeeze film damper alone agree very well with predictions based on the full film, short length SFD model...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to develop designs and methods for the {{preservation}} and display of historic documents. The results were applied via the design, manufacture, and installation of five hermetic display encasements for the original Massachusetts Constitution (1780), a Goddard broadside of the Declaration of Independence (1777), an original copy of the Bill of Rights (1789), the 1629 Charter of Massachusetts Bay, and the 1692 Charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. In addition to meeting the aesthetic requirements for a permanent exhibit, the encasements had to have leak rates that would maintain less than 0. 5 % oxygen content over 20 years and preserve 40 % relative humidity at 70 'F. Furthermore, the encasement portion of the project had a 300, 000 USD total budget, approximately one tenth the budget allocated for the "Charters of Freedom" project at the National Archives. The encasements designed for this project incorporated a novel <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> that "floats" the glass and allows for helium leak testingat any time, without disturbing the document. These design choices were motivated by developing a model for permeation of gases through a network of polymer seals. Preparing the preservation environment also required the design and fabrication of the "Moisturematic", a device that allows for controlled filling of a vessel with precisely humidified gas. Continuous monitoring of the atmosphere inside the encasements {{was made possible by}} the development of specialized instrumentation. In January 2009, these historic documents were put on permanent display in the Treasures Gallery at The Massachusetts Archives.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|E

Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) is a shell and tube type, counter current, sodium to sodium heat exchanger. IHX is a very important, massive, over dimensional (∼ 42 tones in weight, ∼ 2 meters in diameter and ∼ 18 meters in length) and critical component of reactor, as it transfers heat from the radioactive primary circuit sodium to non-radioactive secondary circuit sodium forming the boundary between these two circuits. The principal material of construction of IHX is austenitic stainless steel grade 316 LN. Each IHX has 3600 nos. of straight seamless tubes which are rolled and then welded to the either ends of top and bottom tubesheets by autogenous pulsed Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process. The shell welding around the tube bundle is extremely difficult and challenging task due to small gap between the tube bundle and shell inside diameter. Special arrangements were made to avoid arc strike or fusion on the tube during shell welding around the tube bundle. A mechanical hardfaced <b>seal</b> <b>arrangement</b> at the interface of the IHX outer shell and the inner vessel stand pipe is the chosen design concept to ensure leak tightness in the IHX penetrations. Based on radiation dose rate & shielding considerations during maintenance, handling and decommissioning, nickel based ENiCr-B hard facing alloy (Colmonoy- 5) was chosen to replace the traditionally used cobalt based stellite alloys to improve the resistance to high temperature wear, especially galling of mating surfaces in sodium environment. The more versatile Plasma Transferred Arc Welding (PTAW) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) were used for deposition of Colmonoy- 5. The hardfacing on the seal ring is really challenging task, as the diameter is too large and thickness & width is too small and which has hardfacing on all mating surfaces. Extensive varieties of trials were conducted on the mockup to optimize the hardfacing process along with heat treatment cycle to obtain minimum distortion deploying special tools and fixtures. Intermediate Heat Exchanger involves 10 mm and 28 mm thick borated stainless steel components around the tube bundle and bottom portion confirming to ASTM 887, Type 304 B 4, Grade B classification to reduce the radiation level in secondary sodium system while flowing through the IHX. Various types of welding trials were conducted on the test coupons for welding procedure qualification of borated stainless steel components using versatile grades of welding consumables. More than hundred nos. of trial coupons welded using 10 varieties of welding consumables have shown fissures and cracks in weld, as these welding consumables found not having good compatibility with SS 304 B 4, Grade B borated steel.

40|$|LectureThe use of CO 2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) {{has been}} around since the early 70 ?s and was {{developed}} to enable oil extraction from declining fields. The process involves injecting CO 2 from either natural or man-made sources into the ground to free up trapped crude oil that would otherwise not be possible to obtain. This process significantly improves the lifetime production of oil from mature fields. Moving the CO 2 from one field to another is accomplished through a series of pipelines and pumps using centrifugal technology.

This particular <b>sealing</b> <b>arrangement</b> was selected because of the very poor lubricating qualities of CO 2, the desire for high reliability, and the lack of capability to seal this fluid in the liquid state using a single seal. The downside to this arrangement was the cost and complexity.
