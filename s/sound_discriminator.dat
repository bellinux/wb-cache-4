50|$|In addition, some {{aftermarket}} alarms have {{provisions for}} optional sensors (these must be purchased separately). The tilt sensor can sense the vehicle being tilted (alerting to towing). Tilt sensors come in digital or mercury. A digital sensor is more accurate since it sets itself, {{allowing for the}} vehicle {{to be placed on}} a hill and not cause false triggers. A <b>sound</b> <b>discriminator</b> or glass breakage sensor senses only the sound of glass breaking. Typically, a <b>sound</b> <b>discriminator</b> sensor can be eliminated using a shock sensor. Proximity, infrared, or motion sensors sense motion inside or outside the vehicle; these are typically installed on convertible or T-top vehicles. The sensors mentioned here are usually adjustable in order to avoid false alarms. For example, a shock sensor will sometimes vibrate due to a loud noise in the area, or an accidental bump to the car from a passerby. Proximity sensors can cause false alarms in parking lots when a passerby is entering or exiting a vehicle parked next to the armed car. These can cause the alarm to falsely sense an attempted break-in.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{occupation}} {{number of}} a field is a <b>sound</b> <b>discriminator</b> between classical and quantum regimes. In this pamphlet we give an overview {{of what we can}} learn about infla-tionary magnetogenesis just by looking at the occupation numbers of the classical magnetic fields observed today, and those of the quantum electromagnetic field during inflation. The sole occupation number behaviour dictates that for a pure Maxwell theory in de Sitter space it appears impossible to match the two epochs...|$|E
30|$|Research was {{conducted}} to identify a series of neuropsychological tests to assess the ability to drive. Driving performance of young and old UK drivers was modeled through multiple linear regression and univariate logistic regression tools. The UFOV 3 test (i.e. the third subtest of the UFOV test) had comparatively high discriminating ability in separating poor-drivers from not-poor-drivers, with 92.86 % of the drivers correctly classified; the UFOV 3 test resulted in a Sensitivity of 62.5 %. Age and a composite cognitive measure were also found to be <b>sound</b> <b>discriminators</b> of poor-drivers and not-poor-drivers with 91.07 % and 89.28 % of the drivers correctly classified respectively; both age and the composite cognitive measure resulted in a Sensitivity of 50 %. It {{was found that the}} commonly recommended Clock Drawing Test and the Trail Making-B test were insignificant predictors of driving ability. Results suggest that for a score greater than 220 on the UFOV 3 test, the driver may be further evaluated by a driving specialist to ascertain questionable driving behavior. Also, drivers above the age of 77 were more susceptible to exhibiting unusual driving behavior; if such drivers have UFOV 3 scores greater than 220 it would be more appropriate to evaluate driving behavior through a driving specialist.|$|R
