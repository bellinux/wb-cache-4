40|$|AbstractDespite {{technical}} and technological advances in Neurosurgery, {{in the last}} four decades, there has been no significant reduction, in the dimensions of the, aneurysm clip applicator forceps. This can be challenging, even to the most experienced neurovascular surgeon, especially when the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> created remains narrow, despite all possible measures to widen it. The author describes one such situation, where an anterior communicating artery aneurysm was clipped successfully using a simple “hemostat” forceps. The author describes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} a hemostat forceps, when used as a clip applicator. He also explains how a “custom made” hemostat forceps, can overcome these pitfalls. The author concludes that, though a standard clip applicator forceps is the instrument of choice, to clip aneurysms, a “custom made” set of hemostat forceps can prove superior to conventional clip applicators, in select situations, where the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> is too narrow and the relatively large dimensions of the clip applicator itself, obliterates visibility of the local anatomy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several disc disease {{nomenclatures}} {{and approaches}} for LDH exist. The traditional midline bone-destructive procedures together with approaches requiring extreme muscular retraction are {{being replaced by}} muscle sparing, targeted, stability-preserving surgical routes. The increasing speculation on LDHs and the innovative corridors described to treat them have lead to an extensive production of papers frequently treating the same topic but adopting different terminologies and reporting contradictory results. METHODS: The review of such literature somehow confounding gave us the chance to regroup by <b>surgical</b> <b>corridors</b> the vast amount of approaches for LDH differently renamed over time. Likewise, LDHs were simplified in intra-foraminal (ILDH), extra-foraminal (ELDH), and intra-/extra-foraminal (IELDH) in relation to precise anatomical boundaries and extent of bulging disc. RESULTS: Through {{the analysis of the}} papers, it was possible to identify ideal <b>surgical</b> <b>corridors</b> for ILDHs, ELDHs, and IELDHs, distinguishing for each approach the exposure provided and the technical advantages/disadvantages in terms of muscle trauma, biomechanical stability, and nerve root preservation. A significant disproportion was noted between studies discussing traditional midline approaches or variants of the posterolateral route and those investigating pros and cons of simple or combined alternative corridors. Although rarely discussed, these latter represent valuable strategies particularly for the challenging IELDHs, thanks to the optimal compromise between herniation exposure and bone-muscle preservation. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of adequate mastery of traditional approaches together with a greater confidence through unfamiliar <b>surgical</b> <b>corridors</b> can improve the development of combined mini-invasive procedures, which seem promising for future targeted LDH excisions...|$|R

40|$|Long slender {{instruments}} used in Endonasal Surgery {{have two}} main limitations, the first being that current instruments have a fixed shape so that difficult positioned lesions cannot be reached. The other limitation {{is caused by}} the colliding of instrument shafts when multiple shafts are inserted in the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor,</b> reducing the instrument maneuverability. A Multi-Branched instrument could overcome these problems i. e. an instrument with a single steerable shaft that is inserted through the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> that at the distal end divides into multiple tool branches that are all steerable. In this research a first step was made to develop a suitable control strategy to operate such an instrument, using a new method for performance testing. Methods: Two interfaces were proposed: A sequential interface that allows the control of a single instrument at a time for each hand, and a simultaneous interface that allows the control of two instruments in parallel for each hand. The simultaneous interface was expected to result in quicker performance. To evaluate their performance, the interfaces were prototyped and connected to a simulation environment containing a virtual Multi-Branched instrument. Results: The sequential interface resulted in around 10 % quicker performance than the simultaneous interface. The used methodology to test the control strategies has proven to be successful and enabled further research with relatively low effort to experiment with other instrument configurations and control concepts.

40|$|Postoperative groin and thigh dysesthesias {{are known}} {{potential}} sequelae of minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusions (LLIF). Injury to the genitofemoral nerve (GFN) may play some role in occurrence of these symptoms. Our goals were {{to determine a}} precise, reproducible manner of diagnosing postoperative GFN dysfunction, and to evaluate an endoscopic assisted LLIF as a viable method of identifying and protecting the GFN. We performed a retrospective review of 21 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic-assisted LLIF at 33 disc levels. CO 2 insufflation was performed through a laterally placed incision. The GFN was visualized {{over the surface of}} the psoas muscle and mobilized away from the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor.</b> The rest of the surgery proceeded as previously described (Ozgur et al., 2006 [18]). The presence of GFN injury was defined as a subjective sense of pain, numbness, or dysesthesias in the GFN territory, or an objective decrease in sensation in the ipsilateral femoral triangle. The patients were followed for an average of 15. 1  months (range of 2 to 41  months). The GFN was identified in the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> in seven cases. In 6 patients, the nerve was easily mobilized. In one patient, intramuscular dissection was required. This patient experienced temporary diminished sensation in the territory of the GFN. Therefore, our rate of transient genitofemoral neuropathy was 4. 8 %, and there were no cases of permanent nerve damage.

40|$|AbstractObjectivePosterior pelvic lesions, {{especially}} of the sacral-iliac joint, have high mortality and morbidity risks. Definitive fixation {{is necessary for the}} joint stabilization, and one option is the sacral percutaneous pinning with screws. Proximity to important structures to this region brings risks to the fixation procedure; therefore, {{it is important to know}} the tridimensional anatomy of the pelvis posterior region. Deviations of the surgeon's hand of four degrees may target the screws to those structures; dimorphisms of the upper sacrum and a poor lesion reduction may redound in a screw malpositioning. This study is aimed to evaluate the dimensions of a safe <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> for safe sacroiliac screw insertion and relations with age and sex of the patients. MethodOne hundred randomly selected pelvis CTs of patients with no pelvic diseases, seen at a tertiary care teaching Hospital. Measurements were made by computer and the safest area for screw insertion was calculated by two methods. The results were expressed in mm (not in degrees), in order to be a further surgical reference. ResultsThere was a significant size difference in the analyzed sacral vertebra, differing on a wider size in men than in women. There was no significant statistical difference between vertebral size and age. By both methods, a safe area for screw insertion could be defined. ConclusionAge does not influence the width of the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor.</b> The surgeon has a safe corridor considered narrower when inserting screws in a female pelvis than when in a male one.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{developed}} an augmented reality system that enables intraoperative image guidance by using 3 -dimensional (3 D) graphics overlaid {{on a video}} stream. We call this system DEX-Ray and report on its development and the initial intraoperative experience in 12 cases. METHODS: DEX-Ray consists of a tracked handheld probe that integrates a lipstick-size video camera. The camera looks over the probe's tip into the surgical field. The camera's video stream is augmented with coregistered, multimodality 3 D graphics and landmarks obtained during neurosurgical planning with 3 D workstations. The handheld probe functions as a navigation device to view and point and as an interaction device to adjust the 3 D graphics. We tested the system's accuracy in the laboratory and evaluated it intraoperatively {{with a series of}} tumor and vascular cases. RESULTS: DEX-Ray provided accurate and real-time video-based augmented reality display. The system could be seamlessly integrated into the surgical workflow. The see-through effect revealing 3 D information below the surgically exposed surface proved to be of significant value, especially during the macroscopic phase of an operation, providing easily understandable structural navigational information. Navigation in deep and narrow <b>surgical</b> <b>corridors</b> was limited by the camera resolution and light sensitivity.

40|$|Objective Vertebrobasilar (VB) aneurysms remain {{considered}} as a significant challenge for both microneurosurgical and endovascular neurosurgeon/interventional neuroradiologists. The nature of the aneurysm formation and growth, {{as well as the}} tortuosity and geometry of the vessels in many cases, has reduced the efficacy of final clinical and radiological outcome of endovascular therapy. On the other hand, microsurgical treatment for VB aneurysms has also been reported to have a relatively high morbidity and mortality rate. The need to effectively treat the VB aneurysms was essentially based on the clinical fact that they have a higher rupture rate and worse prognosis than the anterior circulation group. Reducing the morbidity and mortality rate while increasing the aneurysm occlusion rate and its durability is the ultimate goal of aneurysm treatment. Our aim is to evaluate simple surgical techniques and their clinical and radiological results that have been used to treat VB aneurysms in department of neurosurgery of University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital. Patients and Methods We analyzed surgical techniques that have been used in department of neurosurgery of University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital during ten year period. The pre-operative clinical scale and final clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed to evaluate the efficacy of the surgical approaches. We used a defined subgroup of the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridors</b> into anterolateral, lateral, and posterolateral corridors to treat five levels of VB aneurysms. The five levels of VB aneurysms were divided based on their level to the clivus bone, which are above, upper, middle, lower, and lowermost. Results Above clivus level of VB aneurysm defined as more than 6 mm above the posterior clinoid process (PCP) was effectively treated by LSO approach, a simple modification of pterional approach which has anterolateral <b>surgical</b> <b>corridors.</b> Specifically for BB aneurysm, the wide P 1 (first segment of PCA) angle was also a determined factor for the selection to use LSO. Upper clivus level defined as within 6 mm above and 8 mm below the PCP was simply treated with a subtemporal approach,at a lateral corridor to reach the lesion. This approach was a workhorse to treat theupper clivus level aneurysm because of shorter distance, more “straight to the point,”and better visibility of posterior basilar perforators. Middle clivus level aneurysms,defined as more than 8 mm below the PCP to the level of internal acoustic meatus (IAM) were commonly treated with a simplified presigmoid approach. This posterolateral corridor offered a wider and better exposure of VB artery and its surrounding neural structures. VB aneurysm which is located at lower clivus level, defined as more than 10 mm above the foramen magnum to the level of IAM, was effectively treated with simple lateral suboccipital approach or tic craniotomy. If the aneurysm is located very low or defined as less than 10 mm above the foramen magnum, a modification called “enough-lateral” approach was recommended. Conclusion These five simple surgical approaches (LSO, subtemporal, presigmoid, lateral suboccpital, and “enough-lateral”) were effective approaches to treat five different levels of VB aneurysm according to the clivus bone. The pre-operative clinical gradingscale and the large – giant size of aneurysm were the most consistent and determinant factors for unfavorable outcome in this study.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We have {{developed}} an interactive virtual model {{of the temporal bone}} for the training and teaching of cranial base surgery. METHODS: The virtual model was based on the tomographic data of the Visible Human Project. The male Visible Human's computed tomographic data were volumetrically reconstructed as virtual bone tissue, and the individual photographic slices provided the basis for segmentation of the middle and inner ear structures, cranial nerves, vessels, and brainstem. These structures were created by using outlining and tube editing tools, allowing structural modeling either directly {{on the basis of the}} photographic data or according to information from textbooks and cadaver dissections. For training and teaching, the virtual model was accessed in the previously described 3 -dimensional workspaces of the Dextroscope or Dextrobeam (Volume Interactions Pte, Ltd., Singapore), whose interfaces enable volumetric exploration from any perspective and provide virtual tools for drilling and measuring.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess (1) whether vasoreactivity is altered in {{patients}} with epilepsy and (2) whether the two most commonly used approaches, the trans-Sylvian (TS) and the trans-cortical (TC) route, differ in their impact on cortical blood flow. Methods: Patients were randomized to undergo selective amygdalohippocampectomy (selAH) through a TC or TS route. Before and after selAH, we recorded microcirculation parameters on the superficial cortex surrounding the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor.</b> Blood flow and velocity were measured using laser Doppler flowmetry and micro-Doppler, respectively. Cortical oxygen saturation (SO 2) was measured using remission spectrophotometry under hypocapnic and normocapnic conditions. Results: Ten patients were operated using the TS approach, and eight were operated via the TC approach. Vasomotor reactivity patterns measured with micro-Doppler were physiologically prior to selAH in both groups. After completion of surgery, a significant increase in SO 2 -values occurred in the TS group (before: 56. 7 2. 2, after: 65. 5 +/- 3. 0 %SO 2), but not in the TC group (before: 52. 9 +/- 5. 2, after: 53. 0 +/- 3. 7 %SO 2). The rate of critical SO 2 values below 25 % was significantly higher after the TC approach (12. 3 %) compared to the TS approach (5. 2 %; p < 0. 05). Discussion: Our findings provide the first invasively measured evidence that patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have preserved cerebral blood flow responses to alterations in CO 2. In addition, local cortical SO 2 was higher in the TS group than in the TC group after selAH. This may be a sign of reactive cortical vessel dilation after proximal vessel manipulation associated with the TS approach. In contrast, the lower values of SO 2 after the TC approach indicate tissue ischaemia surrounding the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> surrounding the corticotomy...|$|E
40|$|The use of robotic {{technology}} in the surgical treatment of brain tumour promises increased precision and accuracy {{in the performance of}} surgery. Robotic manipulators may allow superior access to narrow <b>surgical</b> <b>corridors</b> compared to freehand or conventional neurosurgery. This paper reports values and ranges of tool-tissue interaction forces during the performance of glioma surgery using an MR compatible, image-guided neurosurgical robot called neuroArm. The system, capable of microsurgery and stereotaxy, was used in the surgical resection of glioma in seven cases. neuroArm is equipped with force sensors at the end-effector allowing quantification of tool-tissue interaction forces and transmits force of dissection to the surgeon sited at a remote workstation that includes a haptic interface. Interaction forces between the tool tips and the brain tissue were measured for each procedure, and the peak forces were quantified. Results showed maximum and minimum peak force values of 2. 89 [*]N (anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III) and 0. 50 [*]N (anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III), respectively, with the mean of peak forces varying from case to case, depending on type of the glioma. Mean values of the peak forces varied in range of 1. 27 [*]N (anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III) to 1. 89 [*]N (glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component, WHO grade IV).

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> and optical distortion can influence the perception of carotid landmarks in transnasal endoscopic surgery. METHODS: Computed tomography images of skulls in 20 subjects were analyzed. The petrous carotid angle (PCA) was calculated as the angle between the petrous carotid axis and the coronal plane connecting stylomastoid foramina. The angle of incidence (AI) on the anterior carotid genu of 3 different surgical corridors (contralateral nostril, ipsilateral nostril, and transmaxillary ipsilateral route) was evaluated. PCA, AI, and their differences were studied by Spearman's correlation test. Two cadaver heads were dissected, simulating the studied surgical corridors. The fish-eye effect was empirically quantified. RESULTS: Mean PCA was 31 ° (range, 21 - 41 °). PCA and AI are linked by an inverse proportion relationship. A transmaxillary approach always ensures the highest value of AI on the target. The cadaveric dissection qualitatively confirmed the radiologic data.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} {{a patient with}} a tight filum associated with a small concentric lipoma that was treated by cutting the filum terminale through a totally endoscopic approach. Our approach required {{the creation of a}} midline <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> provided by the placement of a telescopic self-retaining retractor over the ligamentum flavum at L 5 -S 1, under endoscopic control. The ligamentum was partially removed, the dura and the arachnoid opened and the filum terminale and the roots of the cauda exposed. After neurophysiological confirmation of the absence of neural structures the filum was coagulated and cut, the dura was closed by a continuous suture and seated with fibrin glue. The entire surgery was performed under the illumination and magnification provided by a rigid endoscope working in an aerial environment. This case shows that the cauda can be explored and the filum terminale cut with a minimally invasive endoscopic approach that does not significantly compromise the structural integrity of the spine, requires only a short dural incision, therefore reducing the risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and allows the use of multiple surgical instruments in an aerial environment. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart...|$|E

Objective measures were the comparisons of the accessibility of midline and paramedian targets with progressive dissections by level II detachment of the medial canthal ligaments and removal of the nasal bone and by level III removal of the lateral orbital walls with lateral orbital retraction. Mean areas of freedom increased for most targets with progressive bone removal. For midline targets, the most effective freedom increment was at the pituitary gland (level II: 28. 8 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 05; level III: 107. 1 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Background CASMIL aims {{to develop}} a {{cost-effective}} and efficient approach to monitor and predict deformation during surgery, allowing accurate, and real-time intra-operative {{information to be provided}} reliably to the surgeon. Method CASMIL is a comprehensive Image-guided Neurosurgery System with extensive novel features. It is an integration of various modules including rigid and non-rigid body co-registration (image-image, image-atlas, and image-patient), automated 3 D segmentation, brain shift predictor, knowledge based query tools, intelligent planning, and augmented reality. One of the vital and unique modules is the Intelligent Planning module, which displays the best <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> on the computer screen based on tumor location, captured surgeon knowledge, and predicted brain shift using patient specific Finite Element Model. Also, it has multi-level parallel computing to provide near real-time interaction with iMRI (Intra-operative MRI). In addition, it has been securely web-enabled and optimized for remote web and PDA access. Results A version of this system is being used and tested using real patient data and is expected to be in use in the operating room at the Detroit Medical Center {{in the first half of}} 2006. Conclusion CASMIL is currently under development and is targeted for minimally invasive surgeries. With minimal changes to the design, it can be easily extended and made available for other surgical procedures. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
30|$|A {{thorough}} {{review of}} the preoperative clinical and radiological data for all enrolled patients was performed. Each one of the operated patients had his/her surgery done under general anesthesia in the supine position through a formal frontal (or parietal in two cases) craniotomy {{on the right side}} whenever applicable. A <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> was created through the anterior part of the middle frontal gyrus heading posteromedial with a slight caudal inclination towards the tip of the frontal horn of the ipsilateral ventricular cavity where the tumor was identified and removed with maximum care not to violate any normal neural tissue. In cases of posteriorly located tumors, a posterior parietal approach was used to approach the tumor through the occipital horn of the ipsilateral ventricle. Whenever safe, gross total resection was performed; otherwise, tumor debulking was considered in cases where gross total resection was not applicable. Meticulous hemostasis was always performed and sought for due to the vascular nature of such tumors and high rates of intraoperative and/or postoperative bleeds. In cases where preemptive cerebrospinal fluid diversion was not done, an intraventricular catheter was left behind for at least 72  h postoperatively for temporary cerebrospinal fluid drainage. However, testing for the need for a permanent cerebrospinal fluid shunting was done prior to catheter removal via temporary closure of the catheter with a concomitant close observation of the patient’s status.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{removal of}} clival lesions, mainly those located intradurally {{and with a}} limited lateral extension, may be {{challenging}} {{because of the lack}} of a <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> that would allow exposure of the entire lesion surface. In this anatomic study, we explored the clival/petroclival area and the cerebellopontine angle via both the endonasal and retrosigmoid endoscopic routes, aiming to describe the respective degree of exposure and visual limitations. METHODS: Twelve fresh cadaver heads were positioned to simulate a semisitting position, thus enabling the use of both endonasal and retrosigmoid routes, which were explored using a 4 -mm rigid endoscope as the sole visualizing tool. RESULTS: The comparison of the 2 endoscopic surgical views (endonasal and retrosigmoid) allowed us to define 3 subregions over the clival area (cranial, middle, and caudal levels) when explored via the endonasal route. The definition of these subregions was based on the identification of some anatomic landmarks (the internal carotid artery from the lacerum to the intradural segment, the abducens nerve, and the hypoglossal canal) that limit the bone opening via the endonasal route and the natural well-established corridors via the retrosigmoid route. CONCLUSION: Different endoscopic surgical corridors can be delineated with the endonasal transclival and retrosigmoid approaches to the clival/petroclival area. Some relevant neurovascular structures may limit the extension of the approach and the view via both routes. The combination of the 2 approaches may improve the visualization in this challenging area...|$|E
40|$|Background: Spinal meningioma with ventral {{attachment}} is {{a challenging}} pathology. Several technical modifications {{have been proposed}} to secure safe and precise resection of these tumors. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study focused on the precise and safe surgery of spinal meningiomas with strictly ventral attachment of cervical or thoracic spine. The surgical technique included a lateral oblique position for the patient, laminectomy with unilateral medial facetectomy on the tumor side, and spinal cord rotation with the dentate ligament. The neurological status of patients was assessed using the modified McCormick functional schema (mMFS) and sensory pain scale (SPS) before and at least 3 months after surgery. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 23. 7 months. Tumor removal was graded using the Simpson grade for removal of meningiomas, {{and the extent of}} excision was confirmed using early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Simpson grade 1 or 2 resections were achieved in all cases. No major surgery-related complications were encountered, postoperatively. The mean mMFS score before surgery was 3. 1, improving significantly to 1. 7 after surgery (P < 0. 05). The mean SPS score before surgery was 2. 4, improving significantly to 1. 6 after surgery (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: This surgical technique offers a posterolateral <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> to the ventral canal of both cervical and thoracic spine. The present preliminary analysis suggests that functional outcomes were satisfactory with minimal surgery-related complications, although considerable surgical experience is needed to achieve a high level of surgical confidence...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{endoscopic}} technologies and techniques has expanded {{the limits of}} conventional endoscopic sinus surgery. The expanded endonasal approach describes a series of surgical modules in the sagittal and coronal planes that allow surgical access to the entire ventral skull base. The sagittal plane extends from the frontal sinus to the second cervical vertebra. The coronal plane extends from the midline {{to the roof of}} the orbit, the floor of the middle cranial fossa, and the jugular foramen. Key principles of endonasal skull base surgery are choosing a <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> that minimizes the need for neural and vascular manipulation, team surgery, use of the endoscope to enhance visualization, and bimanual tumor dissection under direct visualization. Particular challenges of the expanded endonasal approach are identification of anatomical structures using unfamiliar landmarks, hemostasis, and dural reconstruction. Over the last decade with more than 1000 completely endonasal skull base surgeries, we have demonstrated that endoscopic endonasal surgery of the skull base can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. The introduction of the septal mucosal flap for dural reconstruction has decreased the incidence of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks to less than 5 %. Early data suggests that oncological outcomes for malignant sinonasal tumors with skull base involvement are comparable to conventional techniques. Proper training in endonasal surgical techniques is essential to prevent unnecessary morbidity and achieve good outcomes. Carl H. Snyderman, Harshita Pant, Ricardo L.

40|$|Introduction: Approaches for {{proximal}} {{sciatic nerve}} decompression use a transgluteal route, but are associated with morbidity and complications. An alternative anterior approach to the sciatic nerve was designed. Methods: Five adult human cadavers (10 sides) were used. In the supine position and with lower limbs abducted, an incision was made 3 -cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle of each specimen. With blunt dissection, a muscle-splitting approach through the obturator foramen was performed through the underlying adductor muscles and deeper obturator muscles that traversed the obturator foramen. Within the pelvis, a laparoscope was inserted in the <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor,</b> which was extraperitoneal. The obturator neurovascular bundle was identified medially and followed posterolaterally toward the greater sciatic foramen. The sciatic nerve was identified. The piriformis muscle was identified as it exited the greater sciatic foramen. Microscissors were inserted and under visualization with the laparoscope, the piriformis muscle was transected near the spine. Results: The piriformis was well visualized and transected. The muscle was best visualized inferolateral to the sciatic nerve. No gross damage to the sciatic nerve or surrounding neurovascular structures occurred. Mean distance from the superomedial edge of the obturator foramen to the ischial spine was 7. 2  cm for left sides and 7. 3  cm for right sides. Conclusions: Use of a laparoscope to approach the piriformis muscle from an anterior intrapelvic, extraperitoneal approach via the obturator foramen is feasible. Clinical use of this method is in order to demonstrate use in patients with suspected compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle...|$|E
40|$|The sphenopetroclival area is {{the border}} zone between the middle and {{posterior}} cranial fossa. Several authors have studied the microsurgical anatomy of this region and have furnished sometimes contradictory descriptions of this area, which still represents a great challenge for the neurosurgeon. On the basis of previous anatomical data reported in the literature, the authors undertook a new microanatomical analysis of the sphenopetroclival region and report their findings. Twenty human cadaveric heads were used to reproduce, in the laboratory, different skull base approaches to expose the petroclival area. Measurements were taken in 40 specimens. From this study has emerged {{the finding that the}} sphenopetroclival area is a venous space, which the authors have named the "sphenopetroclival venous gulf" (SPCVG). The SPCVG is filled anteriorly by blood from the cavernous sinus (lateral sellar compartment [LSC], medially by blood from the basilar plexus, and laterally by blood from the superior petrosal sinus; this venous gulf is drained by the inferior petrosal sinus. The SPCVG is comparable in shape to an irregular hedron figure. It contains the Dorello canal, the venous segment of the abducent nerve, and the superior sphenopetrosal (Gruber) ligament, the fibers of which are in anatomical continuity with those of the inferior sphenopetrosal (petrolingual) ligament, forming a "falciform ligament. "The structures defining the posterior surface of the SPCVG may represent a helpful <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> through which it is possible to approach the LSC via the posterior fossa. This conceptualization of the SPCVG is an attempt to define univocally the microanatomy of the sphenopetroclival region in its entirety...|$|E
40|$|Background: Basilar apex aneurysms (BAA) {{are located}} in interpeduncular cistern {{surrounded}} by eloquent neurovascular structures. Surgical access is difficult due to narrow surgical corridors and requires traversing through a depth of 6 - 8 cm of subarachnoid space. Aim: Surgical management of BAAs clipped using frontotemporal craniotomy, orbitozygomatic osteotomy with combined subtemporal and transylvian (half and half) approach is discussed. Setting and Design: Tertiary care referral institute; prospective study. Materials and Methods: Five patients with BAA rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage presented in modified Hunt and Hess (Hand H) grades II (n= 1), III (n= 1) and IV (n= 3), respectively. In 4 patients, the aneurysms were 0. 8 - 1. 2 cm in diameter, situated 7 mm- 1 cm above dorsum sellae. Two of them had posteriorly projecting aneurysms. One patient had a giant, high BAA with a left parietooccipital arteriovenous malformation. Vasospasm of posterior cerebral/proximal basilar artery was seen in 2 patients. In one patient, internal carotid artery was mobilized by intradural anterior clinoid drilling with carotid collar division. Triple-H therapy was administered following surgery. Results: There was no intraoperative rupture or temporary clipping. Follow up angiography showed complete aneurysmal obliteration with preservation of posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries. Follow up (mean: 8. 7 &# 177; 3. 5 months) H and H grades were II (n= 2) and III (n= 3), respectively. The morbidity include caudate and thalamic region infarct, transient III rd nerve palsy and cerebrospinal fluid otorrhoea (n= 1, respectively). Conclusions: This simple approach provides a wide <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> from 5 mm below to greater than 1 cm above dorsum sellae with adequate proximal control of basilar artery. It is an option to endovascular embolization especially with large and giant, or wide-necked BAA, vertebrobasilar tortuosity, coil compaction or postcoiling re-rupture and an associated large haematoma...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Percutaneous sacro-iliac (SI) screw {{fixation}} represents a widely used technique {{in the management}} of unstable posterior pelvic ring injuries and sacral fractures. The misplacement of SI-screws under fluoroscopic guidance represents a critical complication for these patients. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of sacral dysmorphia and the radiographic anatomy of surgical S 1 and S 2 corridors in a representative trauma population. Methods Prospective observational cohort study on a consecutive series of 344 skeletally mature trauma patients of both genders enrolled between January 1, 2007, to September 30, 2007, at a single academic level 1 trauma center. Inclusion criteria included a pelvic CT scan as part of the initial diagnostic trauma work-up. The prevalence of sacral dysmorphia was determined by plain radiographic pelvic films and CT scan analysis. The anatomy of sacral corridors was analyzed on 3 mm reconstruction sections derived from multislice CT scan, in the axial, coronal, and sagittal plane. "Safe" potential surgical corridors at S 1 and S 2 were calculated based on these measurements. Results Radiographic evidence of sacral dysmorphia was detected in 49 patients (14. 5 %). The prevalence of sacral dysmorphia was not significantly different between male and female patients (12. 2 % vs. 19. 2 %; P = 0. 069). In contrast, significant gender-related differences were detected with regard to radiographic analysis of surgical corridors for SI-screw placement, with female trauma patients (n = 99) having significantly narrower corridors at S 1 and S 2 in all evaluated planes (axial, coronal, sagittal), compared to male counterparts (n = 245; P P = 0. 06), implying S 2 as a safe <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor</b> of choice in patients with sacral dysmorphia. Conclusions These findings emphasize a high prevalence of sacral dysmorphia in a representative trauma population and imply a higher risk of SI-screw misplacement in female patients. Preoperative planning for percutaneous SI-{{screw fixation}} for unstable pelvic and sacral fractures must include a detailed CT scan analysis to determine the safety of surgical corridors. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Endonasal and supraorbital eyebrow craniotomies are {{increasingly}} being used to remove craniopharyngiomas and tuberculum sellae meningiomas. Herein, we assess the relative advantages, disadvantages, and selection criteria of these 2 keyhole approaches. METHODS: All consecutive patients who had endonasal or supraorbital removal of a 1 craniopharyngioma or tuberculum sellae meningioma were analyzed. RESULTS: of 43 patients, 22 had a craniopharyngioma (18 endonasal, 4 supraorbital), and 21 had a meningioma (12 endonasal, 7 supraorbital, 2 both routes); 33 % had prior surgery. Craniopharyngiomas were primarily retrochiasmal in location in 78 % of endonasal cases versus 25 % of supraorbital cases (P = 0. 08). Meningiomas were larger when approached by the supraorbital route versus the endonasal route (33 10 versus 25 +/- 8 mm, respectively; P = 0. 008). Endoscopy was used in 84 % of endonasal approaches and in 31 % of supraorbital approaches (P = 0. 001). of patients having p first-time surgery for a craniopharyngioma (n = 14) or meningioma (n = 15), total/near total removal was achieved in 83 % and 80 % of patients by the endonasal route and in 50 % and 80 % of patients by the supraorbital route, respectively. Vision improved in 87 % and 70 % of patients who had surgery by an endonasal versus supraorbital route, i respectively (P = 0. 3). Visual deterioration occurred in 2 patients with meningiomas, 1 1 by endonasal (7 %), and 1 by supraorbital (11 %) removal. the endonasal approach {{was associated with a}} higher rate of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks (16 versus 0 %; P = 0. 3), 4 of 5 of which occurred in patients with meningioma. CONCLUSION: the endonasal route is preferred for removal of most retrochiasmal craniopharyngiomas, whereas the supraorbital route is recommended for meningiomas larger than 30 to 35 mm or with growth beyond the supraclinoid carotid arteries. for smaller midline tumors, either approach can be used, depending on surgeon experience and tumor anatomy. Compared with traditional craniotomies, the major limitation of both approaches is a narrow <b>surgical</b> <b>corridor.</b> the endonasal approach has the added challenges of restricted lateral suprasellar access, a greater need for endoscopy, and a more demanding cranial base repair.
