25|$|These punishments {{range from}} public lashing to {{publicly}} <b>stoning</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> amputation of hands and crucifixion. However, in most Muslim nations {{in modern times}} public stoning and execution are relatively uncommon, although they are found in Muslim nations that follow a strict interpretation of sharia, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran.|$|E

25|$|Stoning {{is a form}} {{of capital}} {{punishment}} whereby a group throws stones at a person until death ensues. As of September 2010, stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws in some countries including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria as punishment for zina al-mohsena ("adultery of married persons"). While stoning may not be codified in the laws of Afghanistan and Somalia, both countries have seen several incidents of <b>stoning</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|ISIL {{carried out}} executions on {{both men and}} women who were accused of various acts and found guilty of crimes against Islam such as sodomy, adultery, usage and {{possession}} of contraband, rape, blasphemy, witchcraft, renouncing Islam and murder. Before the accused are executed their charges are read to them and the spectators. Executions take various forms, including <b>stoning</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> crucifixions, beheadings, burning people alive, and throwing people from tall buildings. The Islamic State in Iraq frequently carries out mass executions in Mosul and Hawija.|$|E
25|$|Capital and {{physical}} punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, <b>stoning</b> (<b>to</b> <b>death),</b> amputation, crucifixion and lashing, {{as well as}} the sheer number of executions have been strongly criticized. The death penalty can be imposed {{for a wide range of}} offences including murder, rape, armed robbery, repeated drug use, apostasy, adultery, witchcraft and sorcery and can be carried out by beheading with a sword, stoning or firing squad, followed by crucifixion. The 345 reported executions between 2007 and 2010 were all carried out by public beheading. The last reported execution for sorcery took place in September 2014.|$|E

In September 1981, women came together in Karachi in an emergency meeting to oppose the adverse effects on women of martial law and the Islamization campaign. They launched what later became the first full-fledged national women's movement in Pakistan, the Women’s Action Forum (WAF). WAF staged public protests and campaigns against the Hudood Ordinances, the Law of Evidence, and the Qisas and Diyat laws (temporarily shelved as a result).|$|E

500|$|Gandhi {{believed}} there were material contradictions between Hinduism and Islam, and he shared {{his thoughts on}} Quran and on Muslims many times. He stated in 1925, for example, {{that he has not}} criticised the teachings of the Quran, but he does criticise the interpreters of Quran. Gandhi believed that numerous interpreters have interpreted it to fit their preconceived notions. He believed Muslims should welcome criticism of Quran, because [...] "every true scripture only gains from criticism". Gandhi criticised Muslims who [...] "betray intolerance of criticism by a non-Muslim of anything related to Islam", such as the penalty of <b>stoning</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> under Islamic law. To Gandhi, Islam has [...] "nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable". According to him, Islam like communism was too quick in resorting to violence.|$|E

2500|$|In Southwest Asia, {{adultery}} {{has attracted}} severe sanctions, including death penalty. In some places, such as Saudi Arabia, {{the method of}} punishment for adultery is <b>stoning</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Proving adultery under Muslim law {{can be a very}} difficult task as it requires the accuser to produce four eyewitnesses to the act of sexual intercourse, each of whom should have a good reputation for truthfulness and honesty. The criminal standards do not apply in the application of social and family consequences of adultery, where the standards of proof are not as exacting. Sandra Mackey, author of The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom, stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, [...] "unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Koranic law [...] are extremely rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, the Standing Committee of the Church of Nigeria, {{headed by}} Akinola, issued a Message to the Nation, taking up ten {{political}} controversies in Nigeria, {{among them a}} bill regarding same-sex relationships: [...] "The Church commends the law-makers for their prompt reaction to outlaw same-sex relationships in Nigeria and calls for the bill to be passed since the idea expressed in the bill is the moral position of Nigerians regarding human sexuality." [...] The bill in question, as well as criminalising same-sex marriage, also proposed to criminalise [...] "Registration of Gay Clubs, Societies and organizations" [...] and [...] "Publicity, procession and public show of same-sex amorous relationship through the electronic or print media physically, directly, indirectly or otherwise", on penalty of up to 5 years of imprisonment. The proposed legislation was formally challenged by the United States State Department as a breach of Nigeria's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

2500|$|This {{period of}} {{military}} rule, lasting from 1977 to 1988, is often {{regarded as a}} period of great purge and growth of state-sponsored religious conservatism. Zia-ul-Haq committed himself to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing sharia law. Zia established separate Shariat judicial courts and court benches to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine. New criminal offences (of adultery, fornication, and types of blasphemy), and new punishments (of whipping, amputation, and <b>stoning</b> <b>to</b> <b>death),</b> were added to Pakistani law. Interest payments for bank accounts were replaced by [...] "profit and loss" [...] payments. Zakat charitable donations became a 2.5% annual tax. School textbooks and libraries were overhauled to remove un-Islamic material. [...] Offices, schools, and factories were required to offer praying space. Zia bolstered {{the influence of the}} ulama (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties, whilst conservative scholars became fixtures on television. 10,000s of activists from the Jamaat-e-Islami party were appointed to government posts to ensure the continuation of his agenda after his passing. Conservative ulama (Islamic scholars) were added to the Council of Islamic Ideology. Separate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985 even though Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from the county's political process.|$|E
