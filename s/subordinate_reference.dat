40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} if a <b>subordinate</b> <b>reference</b> spectra {{in addition to the}} main standard spectra for different atmospheric conditions can enable an intuitive and more direct comparison of solar energy components. The main criterion for the evaluations {{of the value of the}} spectra is the change of the plant components efficiency with the spectra. As the number of subordinate spectra should be as small as possible and only as high as needed the spectra is investigate for similarities. The applicability of the subordinate standard spectra and the possible improvement of quick product comparisons is tested and discussed based on time series of spectral data from five exemplary sites that are of interest for solar energy plants. These time series are created from ground measurements of broadband solar irradiance, aerosol optical depth, perceptible water vapor and other auxiliary parameters. A model to derive DNI spectra based on this input is enhanced so that also GTI can be derived. If the intuitive selection of a subordinate spectrum based only on the average atmospheric parameters for the example sites leads to more accurate estimation of the components efficiency (e. g. responsivity, absorptance, transmittance etc.), this suggests that this concept has some practical value. On the other hand, if this is not the case for some of the exemplary sites, it proofs that there are sites where this concept or at least the suggested 8 subordinate spectra are not applicable...|$|E

Commonly used alternate names, or names referring to certain races or species groups, are included in the index but only principal page references are listed under these names. Page references to illustrations of species or of specific displays are indicated by italics. The Appendix and Summary have not been indexed. Scientific Names: This index provides a reference only to the page where the principal discussion of each genus or species begins. The general index should be consulted for locations of illustrations and for <b>subordinate</b> <b>references.</b> Several commonly used generic names, here considered synonyms or subgenera, are included for cross reference and are set off by quotation marks...|$|R

Evidence suggests that aggression from the dominant female naked mole-rat directed towards subordinates could produce these lowered levels of LH.

40|$|When {{the concept}} of {{multiculturalism}} {{was introduced to the}} Swedish national curriculum in the 1990 's, a new democratic vision was added to the educational agenda: the school as a creator of a multicultural society. Based on a conceptual analysis of Swedish national curricula from 1962 until today, this study outlines how {{the concept of}} culture is <b>subordinated</b> to <b>references</b> of an “objective time”, being divided into parts of its own temporalities. The study shows that elements referring to the past are more prominent in the concept of culture than elements referring to either the present or the future. The past is through its main concept ‘cultural heritage’ seen as a unified greatness of great importance; meanwhile a sincere complexity is apparent in the conceptualisation of the present. Conceptualisations of the future in relation to culture are mainly expressed through the ambition of shaping a multicultural society. A denial of the complexity of culture is made through both the singularity of cultural heritage and also of a clearly defined future. Based on this analysis, this article contends that the singularity of the past could be a potential obstacle to future multiplicity, and thereby – a multicultural society...|$|R
40|$|Oil {{pollution}} at sea {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical and destructive consequences due to human activity in marine areas, with an impact on the environment that requires decades to be reabsorbed. Satellite based remote sensing systems could be implemented for a surveillance and monitoring network. At present, the SAR system is the most widely used sensor for this purpose as it offers day and night high resolution images and it is not influenced by the presence of cloud cover, dust or smoke over the scene. The operational capabilities of these kinds of sensors are limited by factors such as the low revisiting frequency over the scene, the data's high cost, and finally the inability to make a certain assessment of the nature of the detected event without collecting data from complementary instruments. SAR sensor limitations could be complemented by optical sensor capabilities. In particular, multispectral sensors like MODIS offer a high number of spectral bands to detect, identify, classify and describe an oil spill event, and guarantee daily image frequency. However, optical sensors are highly dependent on meteorological conditions over the study area, they offer only low and medium resolution images and, finally, dedicated algorithms for image processing do not exist at present. For these reasons, the optical sensors play only a <b>subordinate</b> role with <b>reference</b> to SAR sensors. This work shows the results achievable through the development of dedicated algorithms for automatic image processing from MODIS data, and a method to classify and describe oil spill events...|$|R
