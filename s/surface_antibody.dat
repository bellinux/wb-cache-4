5000|$|Upon {{receiving}} an unidentified stimulus, the maturing B cells (centroblasts) migrate {{from the dark}} zone to the light zone and start to express their antibody on the cell surface and at this stage {{are referred to as}} centrocytes. The centrocytes {{are in a state of}} activated apoptosis and compete for survival signals derived from follicular dendritic cell and TFH cells. This rescue process, known as germinal center selection, is believed to be dependent on the affinity of their <b>surface</b> <b>antibody</b> to the antigen. Such that, a B cell that has successfully gained mutations that confer a higher affinity <b>surface</b> <b>antibody</b> towards antigen gains a survival advantage over lower affinity B cell clones and those that have gained deleterious mutations. Cyclic re-entry into the dark zone once again as centroblasts allows a chance for otherwise non-selected B cell mutants to gain more mutations in order to improve affinity towards antigen. Interactions with T cells are also believed to prevent the generation of autoreactive germinal center B cells.|$|E

The varying specificity of the ICSA for the different islet cell types led to the recognition of class I sera, whose ICSA bind exclusively to B cells, class II sera, binding only to A and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells and class III sera, reacting with the three islet cell types but not with D cells.

50|$|Quantification with PBA can be {{achieved}} by measuring intensity of the red color from phenolphthalein because brighter red emerges when the sample contains higher concentration of target antigens. For instance, if more antigens are bound to the <b>surface</b> <b>antibodies,</b> more eosin-conjugated antibodies will also bind to the bound analytes. Thus, photopolymerization on the surface becomes much faster and forms a thicker hydrogel film in which phenolphthalein molecules are trapped.

50|$|Within {{germinal}} centers, B cells proliferate and mutate {{the genetic}} region coding for their <b>surface</b> <b>antibody</b> (also known as immunoglobulin). The process is called somatic hypermutation and {{is responsible for}} introducing spontaneous mutations with a frequency of about 1 in every 1600 cell division (a relatively high frequency considering the low mutation frequency of other cells of the body being 1 in 106 cell divisions). Then after gaining a set number of mutations, germinal center B cells are subjected to a round of selection by TFH cells. B cell clones that have mutated and gained higher affinity surface immunoglobulin that better recognize antigen receive cellular contact-dependent survival signals from interacting with their cognate TFH cells {{and go on to}} one of three fates: (i) differentiate into plasma cells that have improved affinity towards antigen (therefore more efficient than their earlier the generation of plasma cells in clearing the infection), (ii) affinity matured memory B cells, or (iii) retained in the germinal center to re-enter another round of mutative replication and TFH cell-dependent selection. Therefore, as an infection proceeds, memory B cells selected in the later stages of a germinal center response are found to have accumulated the highest numbers of immunoglobulin mutation events with superior affinity towards their targeted antigen. Conversely, {{during the course of a}} germinal center reaction, low affinity or potentially auto-reactive germinal center B cell clones, or those that have gained non-functional mutations are out-competed by higher affinity clones and eventually undergo cellular apoptosis.|$|E

Presence of BCG scar was observed in 59 (67. 1 %) of them, included five children without any pre-adoptive medical records. Twenty-three out of 29 children without any evidence of BCG scar were tested by Mantoux. Seven (30. 4 %) of 23 were tuberculin positive and diagnosed as having latent tuberculosis infection. We also examined immunization status against poliovirus 1 - 3, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella and hepatitis B of 70 internationally adopted children and we compared it with the pre-adoptive immunization records of their birth country. Protective titers (> 1 : 8) against poliovirus 1 - 3, were found respectively in 67. 1 %, 91. 4 %, 42. 8 % of 70 immunized children, and only 38. 5 % of them had at the same time full protection against all three types of poliovirus. Protective titers against tetanus and diphtheria were found in 91. 4 % and 95. 7 % of 70 vaccinated children. Presence of antibodies against pertussis, measles, mumps and rubella was observed respectively in 16 (32. 6 %) of 49, 40 (62. 5 %) of 64, 28 (56 %) of 50 and 24 (85. 7 %) of 28 children who had received the vaccine.

40|$|The {{recent history}} of {{autoimmune}} neurology is marked by the discovery of many central nervous system (CNS) antibody-mediated diseases. These disorders are caused by antibodies that target important proteins expressed in the neuronal surface, which {{are believed to be}} directly pathogenic. These antibodies are immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype and, as such, have the potential to cross the placenta during gestation. Foetal exposure to CNS-targeting antibodies could alter developing neuronal circuits, leading to disease. However, the consequences of exposure to these antibodies during neurodevelopment has hardly been considered. To study the relationship between maternal <b>antibodies</b> towards neuronal <b>surface</b> proteins and neurodevelopmental disorders in the foetus a dual approach was undertaken. First, pregnancy serum samples from mothers of children later diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder and from mothers of children with typical development were screened for the presence of neuronal <b>surface</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Next, the effects of pathogenic neuronal <b>surface</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the offspring were assessed in a maternal-to-foetal transfer mouse model. <b>Antibodies</b> to neuronal <b>surface</b> proteins in the gestational serum, particularly CASPR 2 antibodies, were found to associate with an increased risk of mental retardation and disorders of psychological development in the progeny.

The column-perifused Î² cells released insulin in a biphasic pattern in response to 30 mmol/l D-glucose and in a monophasic pattern to 20 mmol/l L-arginine. Rat islet cells, first exposed to a rabbit anti-rat islet cell surface serum and complement and then added to the column, were unable to release insulin in response to 30 mmol/l D-glucose and 0 Â· 1 mmol/l 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX). In order to study cytotoxicity by an additional approach, islet cells were prelabelled with radioactive chromium (Na 251 CrO 4). These cells did not release either insulin or 51 Cr in response to glucose. Furthermore, exposure of the cells to surface antiserum and complement before perifusion did not induce either chromium or insulin release.

Histological changes during the clearance of HBsAg are unknown. Methods and Results: We described two chronic hepatitis B carriers (both hepatitis B e antigen negative), who cleared HBsAg after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Both received hepatitis B surface and core antibody positive human leucocyte antigen identical donors' marrow and had serological clearance of HBsAg 15 and 7 weeks after allogeneic BMT, respectively. Both events were preceded by hepatic flare. Both patients were also treated with famciclovir {{for the prevention of}} hepatitis B reactivation after BMT. Histological examination during the flare showed only mild necroinflammatory activity with multiple foci of confluent necrosis, associated with moderate lymphocytic infiltration. The majority of these lymphocytes were cluster of differentiation (CD) 8 positive. Using immunohistochemistry, there was no detectable hepatic expression of hepatitis B core antigen. However, HBsAg was positive, mainly in the area of confluent necrosis. Using in situ hybridization, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected in the nucleus of 5 % of hepatocytes, but not in the cytoplasm.

Methods A total of 23 patients with neuronal <b>surface</b> <b>antibody</b> associated encephalitis were divided into ascent, climax, descent and recovery stage according to their clinical course. The relation between EEG background activity, distribution of slow wave, epileptiform discharge, extreme delta brush (EDB) and relapse or fluctuation of the disease was analyzed. The relation between EEG features and head MRI abnormalities, and also EEG features in different stages were analyzed. Results There were 19 anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis patients, 3 anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI 1) antibody associated encephalitis and one anti-Î³-aminobutyric acid B receptor (GABABR) antibody associated encephalitis. The frequencies of clinical presentations were psychological or cognitive dysfunction, epileptic seizure, conscious disturbance, speech dysfunction and movement disorder in descending order. Within 30. 50 d from onset, 6 patients demonstrated slow wave background, of whom 2 relapsed or fluctuated; 5 patients had Î± rhythm background {{and none of them}} relapsed or fluctuated. In patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, the difference in first hospital stay (Z = - 0. 785, P = 0. 433) and relapse or fluctuation (Fisher's exact probability: P = 0. 155) between EDB group and non-EDB groupÂ was not significant. There was no apparent correlation between EEG background activities and head MRI abnormalities in different stages. In ascent and climax stage, EEG background activities were predominantly slow wave, and the distribution of slow wave was relatively broader. EEG background changed to Î± rhythm from descent stage and slow wave distribution decreased in recovery stage.
