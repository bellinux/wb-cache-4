40|$|Poultry {{production}} is a lucrative business in Nigeria but inadequate hatchery machines limit the expansion and make poultry products for instance day old chicks more expensive. At the moment, few commercially owned poultry hatcheries in Nigeria are located distance {{far away in}} the western and Eastern parts of the country. Majority of these hatcheries {{have little or no}} access to the national grid system but operate at about 60 per cent below the installation capacity. Generally, environmental pollution, unreliability and lack of access to grid power supply and low performance efficiency characterize the condition of the poultry hatchery business powered by conventional energy supply in Nigeria. These hamper and adversely affect the establishment of medium to large scale poultry production outfits in the rural areas of the country. But with the advent of electric powered egg incubator technology in poultry production, poultry farmers in Nigeria are likely to incubate and hatch poultry eggs and breed day-old chicks under a <b>sustained</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> in a clean environment. Therefore, this study was aimed at the design, developed and tested in order to provide a favourable environment for eggs hatching. The developed machine was tested to assess its performance. The results from the test showed that out of the total 25 eggs, 5 eggs hatched after operating the machine. This gives 33 % hatchability. The result...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2015. From the {{electric}} power generation perspective, {{the last three decades}} have been characterized by sustained growth in the amount of Distributed Power Generation (DPG) systems integrated into {{the electric}} grid. This trend is anticipated to continue, {{especially in light of the}} widespread acceptance of the many benefits envisaged in the increase of renewable-based power generation. The potential for grid-integrated DPG systems to significantly contribute to electric <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> reliability has consistently attracted extensive research in recent times, although concerns continue to be raised over their adverse impact on the normal grid operation at high penetration levels. These concerns largely stem from the limited controllability of most DPG systems, which tend to exhibit large output impedance variation, and non-deterministic power output characteristics. There has therefore also been a growing need to develop effective control strategies that can enhance the overall impact of the DPG systems on the grid operation, thus improving their synergistic properties, and probably also enabling an even higher penetration level into the utility grid. In line with this identified need, this thesis discusses the modeling and controller design for an inverter-based DPG system with the capability to effectively operate both in grid-connected and autonomous (i. e. independent of the utility grid) operational modes. The dual-mode operation of the DPG is made possible by incorporating into the inverter interface control scheme the means to ensure seamless transition of the DPG between the grid-connected and autonomous modes of operation. The intention is to have a grid-integrated inverter-based DPG system whose operation approximates that of an online Uninterruptible <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> (UPS) system, in that it is able to <b>sustain</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to the local load in the absence of the grid supply, which would be desirable for critical loads, for which the level of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> reliability guaranteed by the grid often falls short of the requirements. The work developed in this thesis considers three of the aspects associated with grid-integrated DPG systems that are equipped with autonomous-mode operation capability...|$|R

40|$|The Brookhaven AGS is {{a strong}} {{focusing}} accelerator {{which is used to}} accelerate protons and various heavy ion species to equivalent maximum proton energy of 29 GeV. The AGS Main Magnet <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> (MMPS) is a thyristor control supply rated at 5500 Amps, +/-go 00 Volts. The peak magnet power is 49. 5 Mwatts. The <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is fed from a motor/generator manufactured by Siemens. The motor is rated at 9 MW, input voltage 3 phase 13. 8 KV 60 Hz. The generator is rated at 50 MVA its output voltage is 3 phase 7500 Volts. Thus the peak power requirements come from the stored energy in the rotor of the motor/generator. The rotor changes speed by about +/- 2. 5 % of its nominal speed of 1200 Revolutions per Minute. The reason the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is <b>powered</b> by the Generator is that the local power company (LIPA) can not <b>sustain</b> <b>power</b> swings of +/- 50 MW in 0. 5 sec if the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> were to be interfaced directly with the AC lines. The Motor Generator is about 45 years old and Siemens is not manufacturing similar machines in the future.

This makes good technical and commercial sense, as the amplifier can handle music with a relatively low mean power, but with brief peaks; a high 'music power' output can be advertised (and delivered), and money saved on the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and heat sink. Program sources that are significantly compressed are more likely to cause trouble, as the mean power can be much higher for the same peak power.

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor.
