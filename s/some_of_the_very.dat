5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had seen <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important {{he thought it would}} be for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E

50|$|DEC64 is a {{proposed}} format for storing integer and decimal numbers in a computer. Its {{aim is to}} solve <b>some</b> drawbacks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> widely used format described by IEEE 754. Namely, in languages which implement IEEE 754, some very simple arithmetic operations can have unexpected results due to rounding errors. DEC64 was proposed by Douglas Crockford.|$|R

25|$|It {{was shown}} by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then there exist {{problems}} in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm {{problem and the}} integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate.

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> {{earliest}} B-26s suffered collapses of {{the nose}} landing gear. It is {{said that they were}} caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner's position in 1941.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 the proprietors {{determined}} {{the need to}} improve their railway for ordinary locomotive use. Part of this process involved easing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> sharp curves on the line. This process included providing a new viaduct to cross the River Irvine, a little distance south of the first viaduct. This second bridge was wooden; it was located where the river banks were lower than at the first viaduct, and elevated approaches were needed. Little detail of this second viaduct has survived.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Greece, kouros sculptures {{from the}} archaic period depict men wearing dreadlocks while Spartan hoplites wore formal locks {{as part of}} their battle dress. Spartan magistrates known as Ephors also wore their hair braided in long locks, an Archaic Greek {{tradition}} that was steadily abandoned in other Greek kingdoms. The style was worn by Ancient Christian Ascetics in the Middle East and Mediterranean, and the Dervishes of Islam, among others. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> earliest adherents of Christianity in the Middle East may have worn this hairstyle; there are descriptions of James the Just, first Bishop of Jerusalem, who is said to have worn them to his ankles.|$|E

25|$|In the 2009 {{test of the}} Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a {{worldwide}} evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance by the OECD, Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the best results in mathematics, science and reading. The OECD also found that even in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> poor rural areas the performance {{is close to the}} OECD average. However, controversy has surrounded the high scores achieved by the Chinese students due to the unusual spread of the numerical data, with suggestions that schools were 'gaming' students for the exams. Also while averages across the breadth of other countries are reported, China's rankings are taken from only a few select districts.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 1938, Lovestone's Manhattan {{apartment}} at London Terrace, 410 West 24th Street was broken into. Extensive collections of his correspondence, his passport {{and a gold}} watch were stolen. At the time Lovestone claimed this was a GPU operation, though the FBI {{came to the conclusion}} that it was a hoax perpetuated by Lovestone to obtain a new passport. Hoax or not, the expelled board members lawyer, Maurice Sugar reproduced <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> documents Lovestone claimed had been stolen at the trial. A special Bulletin, published by the expelled members sympathizers also published some of the documents to prove that Lovestone was behind Martin's attempt to purge them.|$|E
25|$|His Prairie houses use themed, coordinated design {{elements}} (often {{based on}} plant forms) that are repeated in windows, carpets and other fittings. He made innovative {{use of new}} building materials such as precast concrete blocks, glass bricks and zinc cames (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used Pyrex glass tubing as a major element in the Johnson Wax Headquarters. Wright {{was also one of}} the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting).|$|E

50|$|The Chicago studio, {{as well as}} the new Niles studio, {{continued}} to produce films for another five years, reaching a total of well over 1,400 Essanay titles during its ten-year history. The Chicago studio produced many of Essanay's famous movies, including <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first American Sherlock Holmes (1916) with William Gillette, the first American A Christmas Carol (1908) and the first Jesse James movie, <b>The</b> James Boys <b>of</b> Missouri (1908).

25|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the original}} Contender design were later developed, distinguished easily by the hammer design. The first variant has a push button selector on the hammer for choosing rimfire vs. centerfire, the second variant has a left-center-right toggle switch for selecting center fire-safe-rimfire firing pins, and the third variant has a horizontal bolt selection for choosing center fire-safe-rimfire firing pin positions. All three of these Contender variants have a cougar etched {{on the sides of}} the receiver, thereby easily distinguishing them from the later G2 Contender which has a smooth-sided receiver without an etched cougar. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> earliest Contenders, those requiring a screwdriver to switch the firing pin between rimfire and centerfire, had smooth sides, without the cougar etched on the sides.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a {{new threat}} to the Cape arose. Some 900 of the Kat river Khoikhoi, who had in former wars been firm allies of the British, joined their former enemies: the Xhosa. They were not without justification. They complained that while serving as {{soldiers}} in former wars — the Cape Mounted Rifles consisted largely of Khoikhois — they had not received the same treatment as others serving in defence of the colony, that they got no compensation for the losses they had sustained, {{and that they were}} in various ways made to feel they were a wronged and injured race. A secret alliance was formed with the Xhosa to take up arms in order to remove the Europeans and establish a Khoikhoi republic. Within a fortnight of the attack on Colonel Mackinnon, the Kat river Khoikhoi were also in arms. Their revolt was followed by that of the Khoikhoi at other missionary stations, and some of the Khoikhoi of the Cape Mounted Rifles followed their example, including <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> men who had escorted the governor from Fort Cox. But many of the Khoikhoi remained loyal, and the Fingo likewise sided with the Cape government.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, he {{was ordered}} to report to Secretary Mallory, where he was then {{assigned}} to the Marine Camp at Drewry's Bluff, James River, Virginia, as part of Company A. He served there briefly until {{he was ordered}} on December 22, 1863, to report to Admiral Franklin Buchanan, commander of the Mobile Squadron. On arrival on December 28, he was assigned to the Mobile Marine Barracks. On August 3, 1864, Rapier and several fellow marines were ordered to reinforce Fort Gaines on Dauphin Island, Mobile Bay, Alabama, during which time he was made Major W. R. Browne's adjutant. Thus he participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay. When the commanding officer of the fort, Colonel Charles D. Anderson, held a council with his officers on August 6, he revealed a document he wished them to sign, surrendering the fort. Rapier and one other marine, were <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few that refused to sign. Rapier was captured on August 8, 1864. He later escaped from prison in New Orleans on October 13, 1864, by making his way through the swamps and bayous until he reached Mobile on November 10. He met up with Captain Fry, a relative, who gave him command of two 32-pounder guns on the gunboat Morgan. He participated in the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely in April 1865. He was on this boat until he surrendered on May 4, 1865. He was paroled May 10, 1865, at Nanna Hubba Bluff, Alabama.|$|E
