Since the pioneering work of Sol Spiegelmann in 1967 ref, involving RNA that replicates itself {{with the aid of}} an enzyme extracted from the Qß virus ref, several groups (such as Kramers ref and Biebricher/Luce/Eigen ref) studied mini and micro variants of this RNA in the 1970s and 1980s that replicate on the timescale of seconds to a minute, allowing hundreds of generations with large population sizes (e.g. 10^14 sequences) to be followed in a single day of experimentation. The chemical kinetic elucidation of the detailed mechanism of replication ref meant that this type of system was the first molecular evolution system that could be fully characterised on the basis of physical chemical kinetics, later allowing the first models of the genotype to phenotype map based on sequence dependent RNA folding and refolding to be produced ref. Subject to maintaining the function of the multicomponent Qß enzyme, chemical conditions could be varied significantly, in order to study the influence of changing environments and selection pressures ref. Experiments with in vitro RNA quasi species included the characterisation of the error threshold for information in molecular evolution ref, the discovery of de novo evolution ref leading to diverse replicating RNA species and the discovery of spatial travelling waves as ideal molecular evolution reactors ref. Later experiments employed novel combinations of enzymes to elucidate novel aspects of interacting molecular evolution involving population dependent fitness, including work with artificially designed molecular predator prey and cooperative systems of multiple RNA and DNA ref. Special evolution reactors were designed for these studies, starting with <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> machines, flow reactors such as cell-stat machines, capillary reactors, and microreactors including line flow reactors and gel slice reactors. These studies were accompanied by theoretical developments and simulations involving RNA folding and replication kinetics that elucidated the importance of the correlation structure between distance in sequence space and fitness changes ref, including the role of neutral networks and structural ensembles in evolutionary optimisation.|$|E

30|$|We have {{improved}} and expanded our previous model [15] of an autocatalytic set that is {{observed in a}} self-assembling RNA system that is a plausible mimic {{of the origins of}} information transfer. Our main observation is that <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> has the effect of preventing the molecular system from reaching chemical equilibrium, thereby augmenting the power of slight differences among rate constants to promote selection. While a batch system can generate different frequencies of its final products, in the context of network dynamics, the evolutionary potential of such a scenario is highly limited. With <b>serial</b> <b>transfer,</b> we can observe changes in network composition over time (Figure  3) that are dependent and driven by relatively small intrinsic variations in 3 -nt base-pairing interactions, whose free energies can differ by less than 1  kcal/mole in the active site of catalytic RNAs such as the ones under study [26]. Our results were obtained even when the composition of the food-stock was kept constant in each transfer; true environmental systems would not be so regular and the effects of <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> on selection should be similarly augmented. This phenomenon should be applicable {{to a wide range of}} autocatalytic set realizations including protein networks [11], nucleic-acid networks [9, 10], and lipid networks such as the composomes envisioned in the GARD model of Lancet and co-workers [27]. We posit that a pre-biotic scenario of dehydration/rehydration would be permissive for the evolution of autocatalytic networks and thus should be explored further.|$|E
40|$|Acquired {{resistance}} to the antibiotic cycloheximide developed by Neurospora crassa and Sclerotium rolfsii was studied. Both the fungi gained certain level of tolerance to the antibiotic just after a single exposure and by <b>serial</b> <b>transfers</b> could adapt to the several-fold initial inhibitory dosage. Cycloheximide-resistance in both the cases was not a stable characteristic and was lost gradually on <b>serial</b> <b>transfers</b> in fungicide-free media. The resistant strains of both the fungi showed poor growth and decreased sporulation or sclerotia formation in fungicide-free media. Sclerotium rolfsii developed cross-{{resistance to}} Difolatan but not to Polyoxin-D, Hinosan and Bayleton. The cycloheximide-resistance in Sclerotium rolfsii was {{probably due to the}} conversion of cycloheximide into isocycloheximide which is a less toxic structural analog, as revealed by thin layer chromatographic studies of culture filtrates of resistant and sensitive strains. The resistant strain of Sclerotium rolfsii retained its pathogenicity to tomato, mustard and chilli seedlings. However, the loss of sclerotia forming capacity and the instability of the acquired resistance trait may prove to be of ecological disadvantage to the resistant strain.

Bacteriol. 85 : 577 – 584. 1963. —Cells of the obligate phototroph Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum, when {{grown on}} a normal concentration of inorganic phosphate, accumulated large intracellular metachromatic granules identified as polymetaphosphate. Inorganic phosphate was released from polymetaphosphate by cell-free extracts. This release was adenosine diphosphate-dependent and light-independent.

40|$|The mouse {{hematopoietic system}} was {{subjected}} to repeated depletion and regeneration either by <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> of bone marrow cells through lethally irradiated recipients or by repeated treatment with the cycle-active drug hydroxyurea (HU). The capacity of surviving stem cells to proliferate and self-renew was assayed at intervals by two methods: (a) the spleen colony method; and (b) competitive repopulation of irradiated recipients using chromosome markers, with normal bone marrow cells as an internal control. The progressive decline in stem cell function that occurred during <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> of bone marrow and that had already begun after a single transfer was not seen during HU treatment; up to 25 pairs of HU injections given over more than 1 yr had no discernible effect {{on the number of}} stem cells present 3 wk after the final injection or on their capacity to self-renew. Within 2 d after exposure to HU, the average self-renewal capacity of surviving stem cells was enhanced. This implies that the drug selectively eliminates poorly self-renewing stem cells and hence that these enter cycle more readily than stem cells with a high self-replicative potential. However, the fact of being in cycle at the time of injection did not of itself affect self-renewal. The results show that <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> of bone marrow is not a valid method for studying clonal aging phenomena because it does not fulfill the assumptions on which such studies are based. No evidence was obtained for any intrinsic limitation in the capacity of bone marrow populations for repeated regeneration after HU-induced depletion. However, this does not necessarily imply that individual hematopoietic clones are capable of indefinite expansion because hematopoiesis may (as suggested by the relative resistance of highly self-replicative stem cells to mitogenic signals) proceed on the basis of clonal succession...|$|E
40|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>transfer</b> can aid the {{evolution}} of autocatalytic sets Wim Hordijk 1, Nilesh Vaidya 2, 3 and Niles Lehman 2 * Background: The concept of an autocatalytic set of molecules has been posited theoretically and demonstrated empirically with catalytic RNA molecules. For this concept to have significance in a realistic origins-of-life scenario, {{it will be important}} to demonstrate the evolvability of such sets. Here, we employ a Gillespie algorithm to improve and expand on previous simulations of an empirical system of self-assembling RNA fragments that has the ability to spontaneously form autocatalytic networks. We specifically examine the role of <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> as a plausible means to allow time-dependent changes in set composition, and compare the results to equilibrium, or “batch ” scenarios. Results: We show that the simulation model produces results that are in close agreement with the original experimental observations in terms of generating varying autocatalytic (sub) sets over time. Furthermore, the model results indicate that in a “batch ” scenario the equilibrium distribution is largely determined by competition for resources and stochastic fluctuations. However, with <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> the system is prevented from reaching such an equilibrium state, and the dynamics are mostly determined by differences in reaction rates. This is a consistent pattern that can be repeated, or made stronger or weaker by varying the reaction rates or the duration of the transfer steps. Increasing the number of molecules in the simulation actually strengthens the potential for selection. Conclusions: These simulations provide a more realistic emulation of wet lab conditions using self-assembling catalytic RNAs that form interaction networks. In doing so, they highlight the potential evolutionary advantage to a prebiotic scenario that involves cyclic dehydration/rehydration events. We posit that such cyclicity is a plausible means to promote evolution in primordial autocatalytic sets, which could later lead to the establishment of individual-based biology...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first on-orbit {{calibration}} of the photometric losses due to imperfect CTE on ACS HRC and WFC. We utilized images of 47 Tuc from a CTE calibration program (GO 9648; PI Riess) {{to measure the}} dependence of stellar photometry {{on the number of}} parallel and serial transfers. For WFC, photometric losses are apparent for stars undergoing numerous parallel transfers (y-direction) and are ~ 1 - 2 % for typical observing parameters rising to ~ 10 % in worst cases (faint stars, low background). The size of the photometric loss appears to have a strong power-law dependence on the stellar flux, as seen for other CCD’s flown on HST. However, the dependence on background is surprisingly weak implying that post-flashing may have little advantage to mitigate CTE. No losses are apparent for WFC due to <b>serial</b> <b>transfer</b> (x-direction). Also for HRC, photometric losses arise from parallel transfer (~ 1 % for typical observations, ~ 5 % for worst case) but are not seen for <b>serial</b> <b>transfer.</b> Correction formulae are presented to correct photometric losses as a function of a source’s position, flux, background, time, and aperture size.

SCFB mode is the hybrid of output feedback (OFB) mode and cipher feedback (CFB) mode that allows a block cipher to be configured as a self-synchronizing stream cipher. Consequently, SCFB mode feeds back ciphertext to the input of the block cipher similar to the conventional CFB mode, except that the feedback only occurs when the n bit syncpattern is recognized thus making SCFB more efficient in its implementation than conventional CFB mode.
