The chemical reaction is generated by titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) reacting with saturated carbon in hot metal. The following calculations are done by using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package, FLUENT (version 6. 2), with a segregated model. As shown in the results, {{on the basis of}} the flow pattern of liquid iron, the inlet selection of adding TiO(2) may be far away from the taphole. The calculated temperature variation in the damaged hearth by reaction is significant, but that on the other side of the hearth without adding TiO(2) isn't influenced. Additionally, the numerical temperature data of different locations may be examined by the blast furnace operators to judge the effect of lowering temperature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the complicated in-furnace phenomena of pulverized coal injection in ironmaking blast furnaces, a three-dimensional CFD model has been developed to simulate the gas-particle behaviors in not only raceway cavity but also the surrounding coke packed bed under practical conditions. The model considers two different fuels, pulverized coal and coke bed. The model is validated against the measurements in terms of coal burnout and gas composition, respectively. The typical in-furnace phenomena are simulated. Then an array of parametric study is carried out to evaluate the effects of local porosities of different <b>coke</b> bed <b>zones.</b> The qualitative and quantitative analysis is conducted. The results indicate that the local porosities of different <b>coke</b> bed <b>zones</b> can affect the coal burnout and gas composition differently: significantly in the deadman zone but insensitive in the dripping zone. In addition, the present model is able to provide a more reliable indicator to describe coal burnout, i. e. burnout over raceway surface, rather than burnout only along the centerline. The model is expected to be useful for understanding the flow-thermo-chemical behaviors and then optimizing the PCI operation in full-scale blast furnaces. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to numerically simulate iron flow and heat transfer in the hearth of a blast furnace by solving the three-dimensional turbulent Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the transport equation of energy at steady state. Under the effects of conjugate heat transfer and natural convection, a computational fluid dynamic calculation was performed to generate flow field in the hearth and the temperature distribution in the refractories during the tapping process. The accuracy and computation of the model is validated using operation data from BHP Steel's No. 5 blast furnace. The shear stress and heat flux on the wall were then predicted for the different vertical movements, shapes of the <b>coke</b> <b>zone</b> (dead-man), and the lengths of the tap-hole. As shown in the results, it is worth noticing that an increase in the tap-hole length causes the peak values of shear stress to shift in the increasing azimuthal direction at a particular plane, and the location of the peak value of shear stress coincides with the location of higher temperature actually measured on the hearth wall, signifying enhanced heat transfer to the wall at location of peak stress.

To support a helpful insight information of mass transfer for the hearth of the No. 2 blast furnace at CSC (China Steel Corporation), a numerical model including the mass transfer of carbon in thermal convective flow from a blast furnace hearth has been developed during the steady tapping process (based on a uninterrupted tapping process assumption). The three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation combined with the transport equations of energy and species with conjugate heat transfer and physical dissolution source is solved by the finite control volume scheme subjected to the segregated iterate under propriety boundary conditions. The results showed the concentration distribution of carbon expressed in terms of mass flux for analyzing the erosion of carbon brick in the blast furnace hearth with the different conditions including the status of dead-man, production of liquid iron, carbon concentration at the inlet, and porosity distribution in <b>coke</b> <b>zone</b> during tapping process at steady state.

40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractories}} {{is the main}} limitation for a long campaign blast furnace life. An in-depth understanding of the flow and heat transfer is essential {{in order to identify}} the key mechanisms for the hearth erosion. In this study, a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model is described which predicts the flow and temperature distributions of liquid iron in blast furnace hearth, and the temperature distribution in the refractories. The model addresses conjugate heat transfer, natural convection and turbulent flow through porous media, with its main features including three-dimensional, high grid resolution and a wide range of geometrical and kinematic scales (from taphole diameter to hearth outside diameter). The melt flow was simulated using improved transport equations, including a modified k-&# 949; turbulence model and a thermal dispersion term. The predicted results show a well-organized flow pattern: two large scale recirculation zones are separated vertically at the taphole level. This flow pattern controls the temperature distribution in the liquid phase, so that the temperature remains nearly uniform in the upper zone, but changes mainly across the lower zone. The effects of several important factors are examined, such as the fluid buoyancy vs constant fluid density, and the shape and position of <b>coke</b> free <b>zone</b> (different shapes of <b>coke</b> free <b>zones</b> were assumed in connection with the reported dissection study).

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{ferromanganese}} submerged arc furnace was purposed to yield valuable information for exergy calculations. A deeper understanding of at what point exergy is lost in the furnace might yield valuable information for the further optimization of the ferromanganese smelting process. The model is split into two parts covering the <b>coke</b> bed <b>zone</b> and the pre-reduction <b>zone</b> respectively. The <b>coke</b> bed <b>zone</b> model uses the estimated electrode tip position, mass transfer from pre- reduction zone, electric energy input and energy transfer to heat and chemical reactions as parameters. Hot gas ascending from the coke bed will enter the pre-reduction zone and exchange heat and mass (reaction) with the solid particles in the pre reduction zone. In the pre reduction zone model, the shrinking core model is applied to cover the reduc- tion kinetics of the ore particles. Moreover the Boudouard reaction is included and also decomposition of carbonates. Heat is exchanged with the furnace walls and the gas exits the furnace at the top. Unfortunately the model did not get to start working before the time was up for the work on this thesis. Nevertheless a sound foundation with derivations is given for the time this work should be continued. Matlab&# 174;is used for the calculations of this model. Thermodynamic data was programmed into Matlab to be easily available at any time for the calculations. Programs are written {{to take care of}} isolated parts of the problem to be used when their services are needed. The application of solid state thermoelectric devices on the outer shell of the furnace has the advantages of recycling otherwise lost energy, and in the process increasing the overall exergetic efficiency of the smelter. An additional advantage is the interpretation of the power output from the elements as heat flux, possibly replacing todays heat flux measure- ments. </p...|$|R

The {{evolution}} of {{physical and chemical properties}} of the centre-line coke samples were analysed by Light Optical Microscopy (LOM), BET N 2 absorption and SEM/XRF/XRD. Alkali distribution in the EBF cokes was examined by XRF/SEM and EDS. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was used to measure isothermal and non-isothermal CO 2 reactivity of the cokes. The crystalline order of carbon and the concentration of alkalis were found to increase as the coke descended through thermal reserve zone to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The crystallite height (Lc) of EBF coke carbon displayed a linear correlation with the measured EBF temperatures demonstrating the strong effect of temperature on carbon structure of coke in the EBF. Alkali concentration of the coke was increased as it descended into the EBF, and was uniformly distributed throughout the coke matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of lower <b>zone</b> <b>cokes</b> was found to increase when compared to the reactivity of the upper <b>zones</b> <b>cokes,</b> and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkalis concentration. The deterioration of coke quality particularly coke strength and abrasion propensity were related to coke graphitisation, alkalization and reactivity.

40|$|International audienceTranspiration cooling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{efficient}} cooling techniques, but one which generates complex phenomena that are difficult to model, and this all the more in that a reactive fluid such as an endothermic fuel is used. Above a certain temperature, such fuel is pyrolysed and, thanks to its endothermic behaviour, this ensures the active cooling of the hot walls of the combustion chamber. However, one of the consequences of this thermal decomposition is the unwanted formation of coke which blocks the porous material (both on the surface and in the interior). This gradual blocking reduces the material's permeability and thus the efficiency of the cooling system. Modelling the permeability distribution of porous materials is thus a key parameter in better understanding transpiration cooling. The present article shows several models intended to estimate the variation in time and space of the permeability of a material (stainless steel) during its coking. The fluid circulating in this porous material is n-dodecane that is maintained at a high temperature. Following a presentation of the measurement device and the measured experimental data of the mean permeability, two categories of model are studied, notably discontinuous mesh models (with 2 and 3 meshes) and continuous analytical models (linear and exponential). The results obtained show that discontinuous models with 2 and 3 meshes are very close in measuring the temporal evolution of the thickness of the <b>coked</b> <b>zone</b> of the porous material. They also revealed that the exponential model is more appropriate than the linear model in estimating the spatiotemporal evolution of the permeability. Additionally, the evolution of the coking rate in the porous material was determined as a function of time and the results show behaviour similar to that indicated in the literature. Lastly, the average Darcy permeability was linked to the mass of coke deposit in the porous material, the result of which reveals a quasi-linear decrease.

40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{study has been}} carried out on the reduction, softening and melting behavior of olivine based pellets in the experimental blast furnace. The aim of the project was to develop a fundamental understanding of the reduction mechanisms of olivine based pellets and to develop a correlation between the reduction rate and the softening behavior in the cohesive zone of blast furnace. The carburization characteristics of reduced iron were also investigated by examining olivine pellet and coke samples excavated and probed from an experimental blast furnace as well as the experimental investigations of pure hematite and heat treated coke. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to successfully determine the reduction degree of olivine pellets {{in different parts of the}} experimental blast furnace. These results were found to be consistent with assessments of reduction degree based on a detailed chemical analysis. The average reduction degree of iron oxide was seen to increase as the pellets descended towards lower zones of the EBF. Up to 75 % reduction was completed before the pellet had reached the cohesive zone; remaining reduction was completed within the cohesive <b>zone.</b> <b>Coke</b> Lc showed a linear variation with experimental temperature above 11000 C; a correlation was established to estimate furnace temperature as a function of EBF depth. The reduction degree of iron ore pellet showed a linear correlation with distance from the stock line of the EBF to the upper part of cohesive zone. But an abrupt increase in reduction rate was observed in the cohesive zone, a result observed in both EBF and experimental studies. The presence of olivine did not have much influence on the reduction degree of iron ore pellets for temperatures below 1100 oC in the upper shaft zone of the EBF. However, olivine was found to increase the rate of reduction in the advanced stages of reduction in the cohesive zone for temperatures in excess of 1100 oC. This effect was attributed to the formation of increased amount of molten iron oxide within the pellet. The initial melt formation and acceleration of the reduction rate in the cohesive zone of the EBF were also investigated. From the comparison between the reduction degree of excavated olivine pellets in this study and previous studies of EBF, it was found that the excavated pellets were located in the cohesive zone and increase of reduction rate in this zone could be verified by not only the change of gas composition, but also initial melt formation containing FeO phase. The chemical composition of slag phases of excavated pellet samples were located on the line between 2 FeO·SiO 2 and 2 MgO·SiO 2 in the FeO-MgO-SiO 2 ternary phase diagram. This result is in good agreement with the assumption that the initial slag formation of the olivine pellets had proceeded from the fayalite and after reduction the FeO contents in the slag phase had decreased and eventually precipitated as slag with a higher melting point. From the analysis of carbon contents of the excavated pellets in cohesive zone, it was observed that the carburization of iron pellets began after the complete reduction. This study has established that the reduction rate of iron pellet is the rate controlling step for carburization irrespective of the carburization reaction by the solid carbon...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of samples}} {{gathered}} during delineation of a coal resource {{is becoming increasingly}} sophisticated as various organisations attempt to predict and understand the technological behaviour of the mined product. Analysis to determine the concentration of trace elements in coal is becoming more prevalent, and not just merely for academic curiosity. Increased environmental awareness has impelled the need to consider potential negative impacts on the ecosystem caused by liberation of trace elements from coal during utilisation. The aims of this thesis are to: 1) Determine the concentration of trace elements in coal seams mined to supply the Collinsville pulverised fuel combustion plant at the Collinsville open cut, Northern Bowen Basin, Australia; 2) Determine the mineralogy and, using graphical relationships, the likely mode of occurrence of trace elements in the sampled pits; 3) Determine the mode of occurrence of trace elements in the pulverised fuel of the Collinsville power plant using the USGS sequential leaching method, and contrast the results with the same analysis for an unrelated fuel from another coal fired power utility (Mitsui Mining’s Omutu City plant, Kyushu, Japan); 4) Examine the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in the Collinsville power utility, and contrast the results with the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in the Mitsui combustion utility to assess the influence of trace element mode of occurrence on partitioning behaviour; 5) Examine the mobility of trace elements from solid ash waste from the Collinsville power utility, and compare with the mobility of trace elements from the Mitsui power utility solid waste to assess the influence of mode of occurrence on the leachability of trace elements and; 6) Determine the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in carbonisation of Bowen seam coal at the Bowen coke works and compare with the partitioning behaviour of the same elements in combustion. Lithotype logging of coal exposed in the highwalls of the Blake Central, Blake West and Bowen No. 2 pits was undertaken. Of particular note was the presence of dull heat affected coal toward {{the roof of the}} Blake Central pit seam, toward the floor of the Bowen No. 2 pit seam, and the presence of bed-parallel intrusions within the seam in the Blake West pit. In the Blake West pit seam, the intrusion caused thermal alteration of the coal to coke over a 60 cm zone immediately adjacent to the intrusion with a further 1. 10 - 1. 25 m zone of dull heat altered coal beyond the <b>coked</b> <b>zone.</b> In the Blake Central, 4. 5 m of dull heat-affected coal occurred near the roof of the seam. In the Bowen No. 2 pit, 1. 2 m of heat-affected coal occurred near the floor of the seam. Beyond the heat affected zone, lithotype logging of the Blake seams noted a number of rock partings, but no convincing dulling upward cycles due to progressive drying of the mire, noted in other studies of Permian coal, were found. No partings were found in the Bowen seam and only one convincing dulling upward cycles was logged. In part the absence of dulling upward cycles is due to heat alteration of the coal, but the numerous influxes of sediment laden water into the Blake seam mire also acted to terminate any significant dulling upward cycles by raising both nutrient levels and the water table. Following lithotype logging, channel sampling of the pits resulted in a total of 76 samples, 25 from the Blake Central pit, 36 from the Blake West pit and 15 from the Bowen No. 2 pit. The channel sampling intervals were determined approximately by coal lithotype interval, with some amalgamations to restrict sample numbers. The channel samples were analysed for proximate analysis, coal petrography and vitrinite reflectance (selected samples) and for major and trace elements using XRF and INAA. The lithotype logs, proximate analysis data and coal petrography were integrated to infer the depositional environment of the Blake and Bowen seams. The generally high ash yield, common stone bands, low sulphur content of the coal and rare pyrite in the Blake seam suggests the depositional environment was a Class 3 topotelmitic peat with a variable water table. The moderate ash yield, the absence of common stone bands, sulphur contents of ~ 2 % and the moderate pyrite content of the coal in the Bowen seam suggests the depositional environment was a Class 2 topotelmitic peat with a high water table. The igneous intrusions have caused extensive alteration of vitrinite to semi-coke, a general decrease in the volatile matter content and an increase in the vitrinite reflectance [Ro(max) ] toward the intrusion. Mineralogy was calculated from major and trace elements using normative analysis, calibrated by XRD analysis of low temperature ash from selected samples. The mineralogy of the Blake seam samples is dominated by kaolinite, with subordinate quartz, illite, feldspar, and siderite, and minor concentrations of pyrite, gorceixite, goyazite and anatase. The mineralogy of the Bowen seam samples is dominated by kaolinite, with subordinate quartz, illite and pyrite, and minor concentrations of siderite, gorceixite, goyazite and anatase/ rutile/ iron oxides. The concentration of trace elements in the channel samples was determined by INAA and XRF. The INAA and XRF concentrations of iron and uranium show a reasonable statistical relationship suggesting the two analysis methods are consistent with each other. The concentration of trace elements in the Blake and Bowen seams is generally low compared to world average ranges for coal and to crustal averages. Only gold, copper, hafnium, thorium and ytterbium were found to be above the world coal average range in the Blake seam. Only gold and copper were found to be above world coal average range in the Bowen seam coal. Trace element mode of occurrence was inferred using graphical relationships between normative mineral and trace element concentrations. In the Blake seam, arsenic, possibly chromium, copper, mercury, nickel and lead were inferred to be associated with pyrite. Bromine, cobalt, selenium, and zinc appeared to be organically bound. Cerium, caesium, europium, lanthanum, rubidium, and scandium showed a graphical relationship with illite. However, cerium, europium, lanthanum and scandium, along with hafnium, lutetium, neodymium, samarium, terbium, thorium, uranium and vanadium also showed a graphical relationship with gorceixite or gorceixite plus goyazite. It was inferred the latter group of elements are associated with monazite or zircon. In addition to the REE phosphate mode of occurrence, some rare earth elements also showed an affinity for kaolinite. Thorium and uranium were also inferred to be associated with feldspars. Antimony, tantalum and ytterbium were found to be dominantly associated with kaolinite. In the Bowen seam, arsenic, cobalt, possibly chromium, copper, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium and zinc showed a graphical relationship with pyrite. The elements cerium, hafnium, neodymium, rubidium, samarium, tantalum, thorium, uranium and tungsten all showed significant graphical relationships with the anatase/ rutile/ FeO grouping of minerals. It is inferred that the relationship is due to the presence of monazite, zircon, xenotime, REE phosphates, tungstates or other trace minerals, the distribution of which mirrors the distribution of the anatase/ rutile/ FeO grouping. Uranium and thorium were inferred to be associated with REE phosphates and zircon respectively, plus illite. The elements bromine, europium, lanthanum, terbium and vanadium were inferred to be associated with illite. A mixed illite/ heavy mineral suite mode of occurrence is inferred for samarium, tantalum, thorium and uranium. The elements caesium, lutetium, scandium, and ytterbium were inferred to be associated with kaolinite. The effect of igneous intrusions on the concentration of a number of minerals and trace elements was also examined. The presence of semi-coke or an inferred distance of heat alteration was used to distinguish heat affected and unaffected samples. Depletion or enrichment of minerals and elements was inferred using ply thickness weighted average concentration figures for altered and unaltered samples and trends of concentration change toward the intrusion. Some consistent changes in the concentration of trace elements and minerals were found across all three pits sampled. The minerals siderite and pyrite are depleted in the heat affected zone, but goyazite is enriched, particularly toward the margins of the heat affected zone. The elements bromine and strontium (the latter mirroring the goyazite trend) are concentrated in the heat affected zone. The elements cobalt, mercury, manganese (mirroring the pyrite trend), nickel and possibly arsenic and zinc are depleted in heat affected samples from all three pits sampled. The inconsistent behaviour of some other trace elements (molybdenum, chromium and possibly selenium) in response to the igneous intrusion appears {{to be the result of}} different modes of occurrence of trace elements between pits. Samples of pulverised fuel were collected from the Collinsville and Japanese (Mitsui) pulverised fuel utilities. The concentration of major and trace elements was determined by INAA, XRF and (for the Collinsville sample) ICP-MS & ICP-AES. INAA analysis suggests gold, cerium, cobalt, europium, hafnium, lanthanum, lutetium, molybdenum, neodymium, scandium, selenium, samarium, strontium, tantalum, thorium, tungsten and ytterbium are at the upper end or above the world average concentration range in the Collinsville pulverized fuel. Only gold, hafnium and thorium are at the upper end or above the world coal concentration range in the Japanese pulverized fuel. Sequential leaching of the pulverised fuels was undertaken according to the USGS protocol. The sequential leach data was interpreted to infer trace element mode of occurrence in the pulverised|$|R
