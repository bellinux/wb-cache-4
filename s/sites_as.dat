5|$|Organised or {{structured}} {{visits to}} war memorials became popular during the inter-war years.

5|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} early astronomical records and {{drawings}} {{suggested that a}} certain dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 {{may have been an}} impact scar.

5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E

5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E
5|$|During World War II PRR carried {{troops and}} matériel for the Allied war effort, and the Curve was under armed guard. The {{military}} intelligence arm of Nazi Germany, the Abwehr, plotted to sabotage important industrial {{assets in the}} United States in a project code-named Operation Pastorius. In June1942 four men were brought by submarine and landed on Long Island, planning to destroy such <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> the Curve, Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River. The would-be saboteurs were quickly apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after one, George John Dasch, turned himself in.|$|E
5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range in the same way as the missile <b>sites,</b> <b>as</b> well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E

5|$|Fruits are {{released}} in the summer, containing about 16 seeds on average. These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets (Vespula vulgaris) and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided {{by the presence of}} a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and oleic acid. The oleic acid induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing them to bring the seeds to their nesting <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. This has the ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{migration}} {{has been}} recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job, for species such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite tracking. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering <b>sites,</b> <b>as</b> well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.|$|E

Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam study period in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how to document {{the effects of the}} dammed river on their lives. When the Thai government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> well.
