40|$|Gene {{therapy has}} many {{benefits}} for patients suffering from HIV/AIDS. This project will explain how gene therapy {{is being used}} to create better treatments. Gene therapy is the modification of a person’s genetic material in order to correct or silence targeted biochemical processes.

The clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of experimental gene therapy has the potential to create better treatments and give patients the chance to <b>live</b> a <b>normal</b> <b>life...</b>|$|R
