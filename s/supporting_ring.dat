40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein after flight, pilot noticed “Decelerate Right Engine” caption on MFWS along with longitudinal thud. Also, there was momentary display of “Right Engine Vibration” caption. Following this, the pilot {{switched off the}} RH engine and the aircraft landed with one engine (port). Boroscopic examination of the affected engine revealed damages in the turbine area, mostly concentrated in and around LP turbine. On strip examination, {{it was found that}} the LPTR blades, and a labyrinth with the LP turbine disc were severely damaged. A few of these damaged components, viz., (a) fractured and dislodged labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> of LP turbine disc, (b) fractured and dislodged labyrinth, (c) parts of LPTR disc containing the fracture surface, (d) LPTR blades, and (e) lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were sent to this laboratory for establishing the probable cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that the damages to LPTR blades were mostly confined to the tip region except for one where the blade had fractured in the airfoil at one-third height from the blade root platform. Evidences suggested that the damages to the LPTR blades were caused due to tip rubbing with the turbine casing. Fractographic examination confirmed that the fracture in all the blades was by overload. None of the blades showed any signatures of progressive failure. The damages on the lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were also found to be secondary in nature. A part of the labyrinth was retrieved from the damaged engine. It was found mangled and separated from the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> with the LP turbine disc. No pins were available with the labyrinth. The fractured ends of the labyrinth were severely damaged. Fractographic examination showed dimple rupture wherever the fracture features were preserved, indicating failure under overload. The labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> got completely separated from the LP turbine disc. Again, only a part of this ring was available for examination. But, the entire mating fracture surface of the ring was available with the disc. Fracture surface analysis showed that separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> from the disc was by overload fracture. The force acted on the <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> was in the radial direction from outside to inside. Further examination of the separated labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> showed presence of cracks in four pin holes, located in a sector adjacent to each other. The cracks were located at the edge of the holes on the free surface. It was confirmed through scanning electron fractographic study that these cracks were progressive in nature and they had propagated by fatigue mechanism. From the laboratory investigation, it could not be established whether or not these cracks have bearing on the separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> from LP turbine disc. The presence of fatigue cracks, however, does indicate some distress at the pin holes originating either from assembly or during engine run. Considering the overall damages to various components of the engine in and around LP turbine and the laboratory investigation, it appears that the failure in the labyrinth was due to some location specific problem(s). Analysis also suggests that the overload fracture of labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> is indicative of sudden overload on this component during the engine run. Although it was not possible to establish as to what caused this sudden overload, it is believed that the detachment of labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure. In view of this, it is suggested that various possibilities that could lead to sudden overload on the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> of the LP turbine disc be investigated. It also needs to be investigated whether or not there could be any common cause(s) which is responsible for generation of fatigue cracks at the pin holes as well as the separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> from LP turbine disc. Laboratory test results showed that the materials used for fabrication of the components in question conform to specification in terms of chemical composition. No comments can be offered on the microstructure and hardness parameters because of the insufficient data made available to this laboratory. However, based on the overall understanding of the failure, any metallurgical abnormality leading to separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> appears to be a remote possibility...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{deformation}} {{and stability of}} a circular plate under its own weight and supported by a flexible concentric ring. Both bilateral and unilateral supports are considered. Von Karman’s plate model is adopted to formulate the equations of motion. A nonlinear Galerkin’s method based on two sets of assumed functions is used to discretize and solve the governing equations. Vibration method is used to predict {{the stability of the}} deformations. The linear analysis conducted previously predicts that the deformation is always axisymmetric. The current nonlinear analysis, however, shows that the axisymmetric deformation may become unstable when the dimensionless load, i. e., a ratio between the weight per unit area and the flexural rigidity of the plate, reaches a critical value. At this critical load, a stable non-axisymmetric deformation of the form cosnθ emerges following a pitch-fork bifurcation, where the integer n depends on the stiffness and the radius of the ring support. When the load increases further, more than one stable non-axisymmetric deformation may coexist. In a stable non-axisymmetric deformation with bilateral support, tension on the ring support may develop when the load reaches another critical value. In this situation, the circular plate will separate from the <b>supporting</b> <b>ring</b> in part of the angular region if the bilateral support is replaced by a unilateral one. The deformation with unilateral support is in general larger than the one with bilateral support...|$|E

After realising the very significant and varying effect of friction in panel tests with continuous support of wood it was decided to concentrate the further investigations on support of steel. The present results show that the average coefficient of variation for the energy absorption capacity (EAC) at 25 mm displacement among all 6 individual sets in Series 8 was 7. 1 % and among the six sets in Series 9 it was 8. 7 %. For the parallel sets in Series 8 performed with and without friction-reducing bedding material, the results show that friction between the panel and the <b>supporting</b> <b>ring</b> of steel constitutes 25. 7 % and 25. 0 % of what is taken to be energy absorbed by the panel at final displacement of 25 mm. This is in line with earlier results. The cast panels had on average 90 % energy absorption capacity compared to the sprayed panels. Possible influencing parameters are different air content, fibre orientation, compaction and w/c-ratio for cast and sprayed panels. The amounts of data are yet too scarce to draw general conclusions. Series 9 was dominated by the panel fibre contents being strongly overdosed compared to the intended nominal dosages and, correspondingly, the energy absorption values became high, especially for the steel fibre mixes. The fiber measurements in fresh concrete differed strongly from the fibre measurements that was done on samples from the panels after testing...|$|E
40|$|Aufgrund strenger gesetzlicher Vorgaben müssen Rußpartikel aus dem Abgas moderner Diesel-PKW durch Filtration abgeschieden werden. Durch den Aufbau einer Rußschicht auf der Oberfläche des Filters nimmt der Abgasgegendruck während des Fahrzeugbetriebs zu, so dass dieser in regelmäßigen Abständen durch Abbrand des eingelagerten Rußes regeneriert werden muss. Während des Rußabbrands kann es im Filter zu Temperaturüberhöhungen kommen, die zu dessen Zerstörung führen. Gegenstand der vorliegenden Dissertation ist ein Diesel-Partikelfilter auf der Basis eines Filtermediums aus Sintermetall, welches durch die Sinterung eines Edelstahlgranulats auf einem Edelstahl-Streckgitter hergestellt wird. Das Sintermetall-Verbundmaterial wird zu keilförmigen Filtertaschen gefaltet, welche ringförmig um eine zentrale Dichtscheibe angeordnet und verschweißt werden. Die Formstabilität der einzelnen Taschen wird durch wellenförmig gefaltete Abstandshalter aus Blech gewährleistet. Das komplexe Strömungsfeld, die Verteilung des Rußes und der Ablauf der thermischen Regeneration in diesem Filter können durch die in der Literatur vorhandenen Modelle für keramische Wabenfilter nicht beschrieben werden. Grundlage der Untersuchungen ist das numerische Strömungsmodell einer Einzeltasche des Filters unter Verwendung der Strömungssimulationssoftware Fluent. Die Gültigkeit des Strömungsmodells wird durch Abgleich von berechneten Ergebnissen mit Druck- und Geschwindigkeitsmessungen in einem messtechnisch zugänglichen Strömungsexperiment an einer Einzeltasche verifiziert. Eine Erweiterung des Strömungsmodells ermöglicht die Simulation des Rußschichtaufbaus auf der Taschenoberfläche. Hierzu wird angenommen, dass zu jedem Zeitpunkt die abgeschiedene Rußmenge zur Filtrationsgeschwindigkeit {{proportional}} ist, der Ruß also homogen im Abgas verteilt ist. Es wird gezeigt, dass wegen der geringen Größe der Rußteilchen diese Annahme eine zulässige Vereinfachung darstellt. 	 		 Die Ruß-Abbrandrate wurde in Abhängigkeit von der Temperatur und des Sauerstoffgehalts des Gases in einem Versuchsreaktor mit reduzierter geometrischer Komplexität in isothermen Abbrandversuchen gemessen. Die isotherme Prozessführung erlaubt die Untersuchung der Änderung der Abbrandrate während des Reaktionsfortschritts. Aus der Kombination der Strömungssimulationssoftware, mit der die Komponenten-Erhaltungsgleichung für Sauerstoff gelöst wird, mit dem entwickelten Kinetikmodell ergibt sich ein Modell, welches die Simulation des Rußabbrands unter realen Bedingungen ermöglicht. Dieses berücksichtigt auch die Hemmung der Reaktion durch die lokale Abnahme der Sauerstoffkonzentration bei hohen Reaktionsraten. 	 Das Rußabbrand-Modell wird auf das Strömungsmodell des Diesel-Partikelfilters zur Simulation der Regeneration übertragen. Es zeigt sich, dass der numerische Aufwand für den technischen Einsatz - etwa zur Bewertung von Konstruktionsalternativen - sehr hoch ist. Darüber hinaus ist die Übereinstimmung von berechneten und während eines Motorprüfstandsversuchs gemessenen Temperaturen noch nicht zufriedenstellend. Als Ursache der Abweichungen wird das unterschiedliche kinetische Verhalten des Laborrußes im Vergleich zum realen Diesel-Ruß vermutet. Eine systematische Anpassung der Kinetikparameter an die Ergebnisse im Versuch ist aufgrund des zu hohen numerischen Aufwands nicht möglich. 		 Die Ergebnisse der Regenerationssimulation erlauben trotz der ungenauen Wiedergabe der lokalen Temperatur im Filter Aussagen qualitativer Gültigkeit über den Ablauf der Regeneration im Sintermetall-Partikelfilter. Temperaturunterschiede zu Beginn der Regeneration, welche aus der ungleichmäßigen Aufheizung der Filtertasche resultieren, bewirken lokal unterschiedliche Abbrandraten. Die Rußschicht brennt bevorzugt im radial innen gelegenen Bereich des Filters ab, während sie in der Nähe des Filtergehäuses deutlich langsamer abnimmt, so dass unvollständige Regeneration zu erwarten ist. Due to increasingly strict vehicle emission legislation, soot particulates must {{be separated}} from the exhaust gas of modern diesel cars by means of filtration. The engine back pressure increases as a soot layer grows {{on the surface of the}} particulate filter. As a consequence, the filter must be regenerated by increase of the exhaust gas temperature above the soot ignition temperature, which causes its oxidation. During the filter regeneration peak temperature events can occur that cause damage to the filter structure. In this work a diesel particulate filter made from sintered metal is investigated. The filter medium is a compound of a stainless steel wire mesh on which a stainless steel granulate is sintered. From this compound wedge-shaped pockets are folded and welded gas-tight. 50 to 70 pockets are arranged around a sealing disc and welded to each other and a <b>supporting</b> <b>ring</b> around them, resulting in a cylindrical filter. The exhaust gas enters and leaves the filter in the direction of the cylinder axis. The sealing disc and the welds between the pockets are at its downstream end. Between the pockets gaps are formed which open at the upstream side of the filter and narrow along its axis. Inside each filter pocket a folded sheet of stainless steel called spacer maintains its form stability. The complex flow pattern, the soot distribution, and the temperature changes during the thermal regeneration in the filter cannot be predicted by the models currently available in the literature, as these treat ceramic wall flow filters exclusively. The foundation of this investigation is the numerical flow model of a single filter pocket using the commercial CFD software Fluent. After an adaption of the turbulence models to allow for a combination with porous zones, the flow field inside the filter can be calculated. The flow model is validated by pressure and PIV velocity measurements in a flow experiment of a single filter pocket in a plexiglass flow channel. An extension of the flow model allows for the simulation of the soot layer build-up on the filter pocket's surface. Proportionality of the locally deposited soot mass to the filtration velocity is the main assumption, which is equivalent to assuming homogeneous distribution of the soot in the exhaust gas. It can be shown that due to the soot particle's small size this assumption holds valid. In an experimental reactor with reduced geometrical complexity the soot reaction rate with its dependency on temperature and oxygen concentration is experimentally investigated. Isothermal temperature control of the experimental runs allows for the investigation of the reaction rate's dependency on the reaction progress or, in other words, the fraction of remaining soot mass. Combination of the kinetic model with the CFD software, which is used to solve the oxygen conservation equation, results in the complete soot layer combustion model. Mass transfer limitation of the reaction due to local depletion of the oxygen concentration at high reaction rates is thus accounted for. An influence of oxygen concentration gradients within the soot layer on the reaction rate can be neglected, as is shown in a theoretical investigation. The soot layer combustion model is transferred to the flow model of the particulate filter to simulate its regeneration. It turns out that the numerical expense of the full-scale model is too high for technical applications, e. g. assessment of design alternatives. Moreover, the agreement between the resulting temperatures inside the filter pocket with measurements during an engine test bench experiment is still unsatisfactory. A cause for this discrepancy is suspected to lie in the slightly different kinetic properties of the artificial soot used in the laboratory experiments compared to those of real life diesel soot. Systematic adaption of the model's kinetic parameters to the measured temperatures is no option, again due to the high numerical expense of the simulation. In spite of the quantitative inaccuracy of the simulation results some conclusions can be drawn from them concerning the regeneration behavior of the sintered metal diesel particulate filter. Temperature differences at the beginning of the regeneration, that result from the non-uniform convective heat up, lead to local differences in the soot combustion rates. Near the filter's central duct soot reacts rapidly, while toward the outside the reaction proceeds significantly slower. Incomplete regeneration of the filter can thus be expected, but could be avoided by design changes targeting at flow uniformity improvement...|$|E
