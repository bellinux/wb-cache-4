5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} <b>symmetry,</b> in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational <b>symmetry</b> about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection <b>symmetry</b> passing through the point, a dihedral <b>symmetry</b> group. This <b>symmetry</b> will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal <b>symmetry,</b> and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E

5|$|Groups share a {{fundamental}} kinship {{with the notion}} of <b>symmetry.</b> For example, a <b>symmetry</b> group encodes <b>symmetry</b> features of a geometrical object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie groups are the <b>symmetry</b> groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Poincaré groups, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical <b>symmetry</b> underlying special relativity; and point groups are used to help understand <b>symmetry</b> phenomena in molecular chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only are}} groups useful {{to assess the}} {{implications}} of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change <b>symmetry.</b> The Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high <b>symmetry</b> when it adopts a particular ground state of lower <b>symmetry</b> from a set of possible ground states {{that are related to}} each other by the <b>symmetry</b> operations of the molecule.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{classify}} non-freely acting discrete <b>symmetries</b> {{of complete}} intersection Calabi- Yau manifolds and their quotients by freely-acting <b>symmetries.</b> These non-freely acting <b>symmetries</b> can appear as <b>symmetries</b> of low-energy theories resulting from string compactifications on these Calabi-Yau manifolds, {{particularly in the}} context of the heterotic string. Hence, our results are relevant for four-dimensional model building with discrete <b>symmetries</b> and they give an indication which <b>symmetries</b> of this kind can be expected from string theory. For the 1695 known quotients of complete intersection manifolds by freely-acting discrete <b>symmetries,</b> non-freely-acting, generic <b>symmetries</b> arise in 381 cases and are, therefore, a relatively common feature of these manifolds. We find that 9 different discrete groups appear, ranging in group order from 2 to 18, and that both regular <b>symmetries</b> and R-symmetries are possible.

40|$|Duality <b>symmetries</b> for strings {{moving in}} non-trivial spacetime {{backgrounds}} are analysed. It is shown that, for backgrounds generated from compact WZW and coset models, such duality <b>symmetries</b> are exact to all orders in string perturbation theory. A global treatment of duality <b>symmetries</b> is given, by associating {{them to the}} known <b>symmetries</b> of affine current algebras (affine-Weyl group and external automorphisms). It is argued that self-duality <b>symmetries</b> of WZW and coset models generate the duality <b>symmetries</b> of their moduli space. Some remarks are presented, concerning the survival of such <b>symmetries</b> in the non-compact case. The implications of duality <b>symmetries</b> for string dynamics in non-trivial/singular spacetimes are discussed.

5|$|In 1990, Edward Witten {{introduced}} topological string theory, {{a simplified}} version of string theory, and physicists {{showed that there}} is a version of mirror <b>symmetry</b> for topological string theory. This statement about topological string theory is usually taken as the definition of mirror <b>symmetry</b> in the mathematical literature. In an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994, mathematician Maxim Kontsevich presented a new mathematical conjecture based on the physical idea of mirror <b>symmetry</b> in topological string theory. Known as homological mirror <b>symmetry,</b> this conjecture formalizes mirror <b>symmetry</b> as an equivalence of two mathematical structures: the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi–Yau manifold and the Fukaya category of its mirror.|$|E
5|$|In physics, mirror <b>symmetry</b> is {{justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs {{that do not}} require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror <b>symmetry</b> described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror <b>symmetry</b> in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror <b>symmetry</b> states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today mirror <b>symmetry</b> is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror <b>symmetry</b> based on physicists' intuition.|$|E
