30|$|Generally, tissue {{engineering}} (TE) consists of 2 main approaches: cellular and acellular. Cellular approach employs small units of living cells {{for the construction}} of 3 D tissues. This approach includes cell sheet stacking [1],[2], cell sheet sandwiching [3], cell sheet wrapping [4],[5], and 3 D cell accumulation [6],[7]. Tube-like and 3 D thick tissues are mostly fabricated by such methods. However, the fabrication of tissues with more complex structures, such as toroidal, lattice, and spherical shapes, is limited without the use of a <b>support</b> <b>scaffold.</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} the learning outcomes of a French professional development program for science education in primary school, ASTEP. The program {{is based on}} a partnership between a primary school teacher on one hand and a subject expert on the other. Its uniqueness {{lies in the fact that}} the subject expert is a young university student who is challenged to be assessed on his/her learning for academic credits. Compared to most other professional development programs, ASTEP displays an alternative knowledge hierarchy, it is neither top down nor bottom up, but rather a form of knowledge exchange. Data on students´ and teachers´ reflections on the collaboration were analyzed through a grounded theory approach and subsequently organized within the interconnected model of teacher professional growth (IMTPG). Although the analyses indicated significant changes in the practice of the teachers, the learners who individually seem to benefit the most were the university students. The ASTEP program appears to provide a low stake high <b>support</b> <b>scaffold</b> for the students to refine their values and beliefs about a professional life and develop a professional identity. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} {{and stability of}} electrocatalytic nanostructures, which represent one level of porosity in a hierarchical structural scheme when combined with a three-dimensional <b>support</b> <b>scaffold,</b> has been studied {{using a combination of}} synthetic processes, characterization techniques, and computational methods. Dendritic platinum nanostructures have been covalently linked to common electrode surfaces using a newly developed chemical route; a chemical route equally applicable to a range of metals, oxides, and semiconductive materials. Characterization of the resulting bound nanostructure system confirms successful binding, while electrochemistry and microscopy demonstrate the viability of these electroactive particles. Scanning tunneling microscopy has been used to image and validate the short-term stability of several electrode-bound platinum dendritic sheet structures toward Oswald ripening. Kinetic Monte Carlo methods have been applied to develop an understanding of the stability of the basic nano-scale porous platinum sheets as they transform from an initial dendrite to hole containing sheets. Alternate synthetic strategies were pursued to grow dendritic platinum structures directly onto subunits (graphitic particles) of the electrode scaffold. A two-step photocatalytic seeding process proved successful at generating desirable nano-scale porous structures. Growth in-place is an alternate strategy to the covalent linking of the electrocatalytic nanostructures...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{investigation of the}} advanced analysis, reliability-based design and optimisation of steel support scaffolding systems. Support scaffolding systems are used to provide temporary support to timber formwork systems, reinforcement, concrete, workmen and equipment, during the construction of permanent structures such as buildings and bridges. Stick-type steel scaffolds with cuplok joints {{are the focus of}} the thesis. This thesis includes the collection and statistical analysis of shore load effects occurring as a result of construction dead and live loads. A comprehensive series of U-head joint subassembly tests, allowed the top rotational stiffness to be rationally quantified for advanced finite element modelling. Advanced finite element models are calibrated using data compiled in a previous investigation involving eighteen full-scale tests. This calibration exercise also provides statistical data for modelling error. Monte Carlo simulations using advanced analysis are performed to determine the statistical distributions of system strength for a range of geometric configurations of <b>support</b> <b>scaffold</b> systems. The research showed that system strength was governed mainly by jack extension at {{the top and bottom of}} the scaffolding system. By incorporating the load statistics and system strength statistics, the thesis determined the reliability of various steel scaffolding systems designed by the fundamental Load-Resistance-Factor-Design (LRFD) equation.

40|$|Research aims: Joint {{attention}} and social interaction are important prerequisites for language development. Reciprocal turn-taking in dialogues fosters and challenges language development. The {{aim of this}} study was to highlight the process of inviting young children to participate in dialogues. Relationship to previous research works In an earlier study we focussed on interactional style in conversation. In this study we explore professional elicitation strategies and scaffolding in early communication. Theoretical and conceptual framework The theoretical framework relies on the assumption that children develop language by participating in social interaction as active conversationalists (Holquist, 1990; Vygotsky, 1978). Paradigm, methodology and methods Dialogues between 7 speech therapists and 11 children representing an early stage of language development were recorded and transcribed. The elicitation strategies of the speech therapists that preceded the most elaborated utterances from the children (mean length of utterance plus 2) were analyzed with respect to interactional style. Ethical Considerations All the participants had approved to participate in this study. Main finding or discussion The main findings reflect three succeeding types of elicitation strategies. During the first phase the speech therapist is eager to follow the child’s focus of interest in order to co-construct a common ground. The second phase is characterized by emerging mutuality, in which turn-takings and sharing of experiences are expected and encouraged. During the third phase the child is given less active scaffolding but positive feedback and challenge in order to grow as an independent conversationalist. Implications, practice or policy In order to be able to <b>support,</b> <b>scaffold</b> and challenge children’s language development it is important to know about how to invite, support and challenge children to participate actively in conversations...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{goal of the}} Collaboration Spotting {{project is}} to create an {{automatic}} system to collect information about publications and patents related to a given technology, to identify the key players involved, and to highlight collaborations and related technologies. The collected information can be visualized in a web browser as interactive graphical maps showing in an intuitive way the players and their collaborations (Sociogram) and the relations among the technologies (Technogram). We propose to use the system to study technologies related to oral medicine. METHODS: In order to create a sociogram, we create a logical filter based on a set of keywords related to the technology under study. This filter is used to extract a list of publications from the Web of Science™ database. The list is validated by an expert in the technology and sent to CERN where it is inserted in the Collaboration Spotting database. Here, an automatic software system uses the data to generate the final maps. RESULTS: We studied a set of recent technologies related to bone regeneration procedures of oro-maxillo-facial critical size defects, namely the use of porous hydroxyapatite (HA) as a bone substitute alone (bone graft) or as a tridimensional <b>support</b> (<b>scaffold)</b> for insemination and differentiation ex vivo of mesenchymal stem cells. We produced the sociograms for these technologies and the resulting maps are now accessible on-line. CONCLUSION: The Collaboration Spotting system allows the automatic creation of interactive maps to show the current and historical state of research on a specific technology. These maps are an ideal tool both for researchers who want to assess the state-of-the-art in a given technology, and for research organizations who want to evaluate their contribution to the technological development in a given field. We demonstrated that the system can be used in oral medicine as is produced the maps for an initial set of technologies in this field. We now plan to enlarge the set of mapped technologies {{in order to make the}} Collaboration Spotting system a useful reference tool for oral medicine research...|$|E

One {{of the greatest challenges}} faced in bone tissue engineering is how to enhance the <b>supporting</b> <b>scaffold</b> and newly formed bone tissue into establishing a natural capillary network [13]. The success of regenerating large volumes of bone, which is valuable for clinical use, depends on vascularization of these grafts. This still remains the greatest challenge for tissue engineering of bone, the ability to revascularize the graft.|$|R
40|$|The {{highest risk}} during a {{structure}} 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime is generally during the construction phase. This {{is evidenced by}} the fact that most structural failures occur during construction rather than after the structure is completed and is in service. The construction period can represent the most critical phase in a building 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. The <b>scaffold</b> <b>support</b> system, a combination of steel scaffolds and wooden shores, is typically used for the temporary support of high clearance concrete buildings in Asia. These types of structures, generally having clearances of greater than 4 meters, include museums, hangars, churches, gymnasiums, etc. <b>Scaffold</b> <b>support</b> systems are often used because they are convenient, versatile, and relatively inexpensive temporary support structures. No guidelines exist, however, for the design and use of these temporary structures during construction. Modern design codes only concentrate on ensuring the safety of the structure during its service life. Furthermore, concrete placement patterns during construction may influence the loads on the temporary supports. Little is known about these effects, either. ^ This thesis mainly focuses on the safety of the <b>scaffold</b> <b>support</b> system and the influences of the concrete placement pattern load on the temporary supports during construction. There are five major parts in this thesis. First, the outline, basic assumptions, and collapse predictions of the entire <b>scaffold</b> <b>support</b> system are introduced. Second, the analyses of the scaffold system proceeds in two steps: the steel scaffold system and <b>scaffold</b> <b>support</b> system (steel <b>scaffold</b> system with wooden shores). Third, a simplified model is introduced to simplify the 3 -D problem into a one degree of freedom model. In addition, the set concept for the <b>scaffold</b> <b>support</b> system is also introduced. Fourth, the pattern load effects of concrete placement are investigated, and a simplified influence surface model is used to predict the maximum reaction force and its location. Finally, the safety of this <b>scaffold</b> <b>support</b> system is investigated, and design guidelines and work checklists are presented for use in actual construction practice. ...|$|R

40|$|Up to date, {{a plethora}} of protein based {{materials}} are used as implants to stimulate tissue regeneration or fillers to alleviate tissue or organ impairment. This includes glottal insufficiency, urinary bladder incontinence and especially in cosmetic industrial to improve facial contour. Once in vivo, protein-based materials are decomposed by cell secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and lose their volume within months. By introducing MMP inhibitor (MMPI), the extent of material degradation over time may be reduced. In this dissertation, the development of cell-based assay capable of identifying MMPI candidates for protein-based implant lifetime prolongation is described. To visualize the degradation, DQ-gelatin, (heavily fluorescence labeled gelatin that emits fluorescence signal proportional to its degradation) was used to represent the implant material. This gelatin was co-cultured with NIH- 3 T 3 in a 96 -well plate supplemented with growth media under standard tissue culture condition (5 % CO 2, 95 % humidity at 37 °C). Number of seeded cells, DQ-gelatin concentration and experiment run time were varied to optimize signal-to-noise ratio whilst taking into account more than 80 % of seeded cells must remain viable. With optimized parameters, 0. 8 million cells cultured on cell adhesion <b>support</b> <b>scaffold</b> in presence of 50 µg/mL DQ-gelatin for 5 days, the efficacy of BB- 94 and TIMP- 1 as synthetic and natural MMPI candidate were investigated. Both BB- 94 and TIMP- 1 were tested at different concentrations according to their IC 50 and the approximated amount of MMPs in tissue fluid, 20 - 1000 nM and 0. 1 - 2 µg/mL respectively, to determine their most efficient dosage. BB- 94 and TIMP- 1 demonstrated maximum potential at 72. 59 ± 4. 75 % and 60. 00 ± 27. 41 % at the concentration of 1000 nM and 2 µg/mL respectively. Statistical Analysis could not detect the significant difference from varying MMP inhibitor concentration, therefore, their concluded most efficient dosage in our experiment is the lowest concentration used for testing. Because our assay generated reliable statistically distinct signals and are capable of detecting quantitative inhibitory efficacy of MMP inhibitors, we believe our novel cell-based assay is a feasible method for MMP inhibitor screening that could better represent the complex degradation process of protein-based implants in biological systems than the current conventional enzyme-based methods...|$|E
40|$|Bladder cancer, one of {{the most}} {{frequently}} diagnosed cancers, is a significant source of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. According to the American Cancer Society (2005), approximately 63, 210 new cases will be diagnosed in the United States and bladder cancer will account for nearly 13, 180 deaths. The current standard for detection of bladder cancer relies on cystoscopy, an invasive procedure, and cytology. Cytology has a high specificity, but lacks sensitivity in detection of low-grade tumors, as well as requires a trained pathologist for review. Because current diagnostic tools are less than optimal and because bladder cancer has a high rate of recurrence and long term monitoring is a necessity, a better diagnostic tool is needed. There is now a great interest in researching urine markers for bladder cancer. Our lab previously identified six nuclear structural proteins (BLCA 1 - 6) that are specifically expressed in bladder cancer tissue. The nuclear matrix is the <b>support</b> <b>scaffold</b> of the cell nucleus. This structure has a variety of functions, many of which have implications in cancer progression. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine changes in nuclear structural proteins. The hypothesis we propose is that changes in structural elements of the nucleus are involved in the progression of bladder cancer and can be developed into markers of this disease. Specifically this study had three goals. 1) to determine if BLCA- 1 could be developed into a biomarker of bladder cancer, 2) to clone the gene encoding BLCA- 1, and 3) to examine functional aspects of BLCA- 4. A urine-based immunoassay was developed that can detect BLCA- 1 in patients with bladder cancer with a specificity of 87 % and sensitivity of 80 %. Furthermore, this protein can be detected in serum of individuals with bladder cancer and may associate with the stage of disease. We also demonstrated that BLCA- 4 can confer a growth advantage to cells over-expressing this protein. Over-expression of BLCA- 4 led to many gene expression changes. BLCA- 4 {{may play a role in}} bladder cancer pathobiology by altering genes that enhance proliferation and invasion, maintain blood flow for tumor cell survival, or enhance angiogenesis. Finally, we have been successful in cloning part of the cDNA that encodes for BLCA- 1 and it appears to have a close homology to a novel metastasis related gene. In summary, this project has demonstrated that bladder cancer specific nuclear matrix proteins can be developed into markers of the disease and may play a functional role in bladder cancer pathobiology...|$|E

In the case of channels, a-helices create the scaled barrier that separates the hydrocarbon region of the bilayer from the permeation pathway for solutes. The helices surrounding the permeation pathway tend to be rather steeply tilted relative to the membrane normal and are consistently arranged in a right-handed bundle.

40|$|Abstract Microtubules are {{generally}} perceived as structural, static elements that basi-cally function either as <b>supporting</b> <b>scaffolds</b> or barriers. This view has been increasingly challenged {{during the last}} decade of the last century, when in-vivo imaging of micro-tubules revealed that they are endowed with complex and highly nonlinear dynamics. This indicates that, in addition to their traditional structural functions, microtubules must play a role in more volatile events that have to be organized in space and time. It has become clear that microtubules are subject to numerous signalling chains and that this is especially important in plants, where morphogenesis is under tight control of a broad panel of environmental cues. However, it has remained a bit more implicit that microtubules are not only targets for signalling, but participate very actively in signal transduction itself. This work ventures to review and to emphasize this aspect. It be-gins with a survey of the physiological and molecular evidence of microtubules as targets for signalling, but then changes perspective focussing on the mechanosensory proper-ties of microtubules.

The main strategies under validation to bioengineer or regenerate liver, pancreas, or parts of the digestive tract are twofold: engineering of progenitor cells and seeding of cells on <b>supporting</b> <b>scaffold</b> material. In the first case, stem cells are initially expanded under standard tissue culture conditions.

A sheep bone was wired and loaded with compression to 250 N, and with cantilever bending to 50 N. The stiffness was found to be similar to previously reported stiffness for sheepfemora. Limitations to the study include the irregular size, shape, and composition of the sheep bone, as well as differences in loading compared to a human bone...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid hydrogels {{composed}} of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAM) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) {{are presented in}} this study as novel injectable and thermoresponsive materials for siRNA delivery, which could specifically target several negative regulators of tissue homeostasis in cartilaginous tissues. Effectiveness of siRNA transfection using pNIPAAM formulated with either MgAl-LDH or MgFe-LDH platelets was investigated using osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) {{was used as an}} endogenous model gene to evaluate the extent of silencing. No significant adverse effects of pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogels on cell viability were noticed. Cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled siRNA was greatly enhanced (> 75 %) in pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogel constructs compared to alginate, hyaluronan and fibrin gels, and was absent in pNIPAAM hydrogel without LDH platelets. When using siRNA against GAPDH, 82 - 98 % reduction of gene expression was found in both types of pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogel constructs after 6 days of culturing. In the pNIPAAM/MgAl-LDH hybrid hydrogel, 80 - 95 % of GAPDH enzyme activity was reduced in parallel with gene. Our findings show that the combination of a cytocompatible hydrogel and therapeutic RNA oligonucleotides is feasible. Thus it might hold promise in treating degeneration of cartilaginous tissues by providing <b>supporting</b> <b>scaffolds</b> for cells and interference with locally produced degenerative factors...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{engineering}} of {{skeletal muscle}} requires platforms that facilitate the proliferation {{and maintenance of}} primary muscle stem cells (myoblasts) and muscle fibre maturation {{in a manner that}} reflects native muscle structure. In addition, the <b>supporting</b> <b>scaffold</b> needs to accommodate the correct innervation of the re-engineered muscle tissue by promoting axonal connection and neuromuscular junction formation. We have been investigating the use of micro and nano-structured conducting polymer surfaces for ex vivo muscle and nerve growth, differentiation and trophic electrical stimulation. Micro-structured platforms were created by localization of wet-spun PLA:PLGA fibers onto polypyrrole substrate, whilst nano-structured platforms were created by orientation of carbon nanotube fibres on a conducting gold mylar surface, over which a layers of polypyrrole were deposited. Human and murine myoblasts and rat dorsal root ganglion explants (sensory nerve) were grown and/or differentiated on these platforms. A significant effect on myotube orientation was seen on both micro and nano-structured surfaces whilst surface topography similarly influenced the direction in which elements of the DRG cellular components grew. Growth of muscle cells as well as sensory nerve components (Scwhann cells and axons) on both nano and micro-structured polypyrrole was increased by electrical stimulation, providing a novel model system by which the effective innervation of regenerating muscle can be explored...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a variety}} of mechanisms(s) factor(s) that may {{influence}} stem cell therapies for heart regeneration. Among the best candidates for stem cell source are: mesenchymal stem cells (also those isolated from adipose tissue), cardiac cell progenitors (CPC) and descendants of iPSC cells. iPSC/s can be potentially beneficial although their pluripotent induction has been still in question due to: low propagation efficacy, danger of genomic integration/instability, biological risk of current vector system teratoma formation etc. which have been discussed in this review. Optimization protocols are {{required in order to}} enhance stem cells resistance to pathological conditions that they may encounter in pathological organ and to increase their retention. Combination between gene transfer and stem cell therapy is now more often used in pre-clinical studies with the prospect of subsequent clinical trials. Complementary substances have been contemplated to support stem cell viability (mainly anti-inflammatory and anti- apoptotic agents), which have been tested in animal models with promising results. Integration of nanotechnology both for efficient stem cell imaging {{as well as with the}} aim to provide cell <b>supporting</b> <b>scaffolds</b> seem to be inevitable for further development of cellular therapies. The whole organ (heart) reconstruction as well as biodegradable scaffolds and scaffold-free cell sheets have been also outlined...|$|R
