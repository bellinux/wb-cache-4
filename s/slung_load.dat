500|$|The concept {{proposed}} by de Lackner Helicopters was a one-man flying platform, and it received the company designation [...] "DH-4".

50|$|As cranes {{became more}} common in docks, and as ships became bigger, they also became more specialised. In 1927, Stothert & Pitt {{produced}} the first bulk-handling crane. Rather than a simple hook that could handle a range of <b>slung</b> <b>loads,</b> this was a crane designed around {{the use of an}} integral grab. Working the grab requires extra cable or cables from the crane jib, so these are a whole specialised design. The first was to unload coal at a power station in London.|$|R
50|$|Foregoing the {{requirement}} to carry palleted or podded cargoes, Mil redesigned the Mi-10 with a much shorter, fixed, four-leg undercarriage and replaced the extendible escape chute with a gondola fitted with flying controls for a pilot to fly the aircraft during <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> operations. The remainder of the aircraft is essentially identical with the long-legged version. Seventeen of the new flying crane were produced as the Mi-10K, including two conversions from Mi-10s from 23 March 1974 to 1977.|$|E

The Flycatcher system is built into a standard military Craig container, with a semi-detachable trailer bogey. The antennas are retractable to facilitate air transport the Flycatcher, either as a <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> or as fixed wing cargo.

50|$|Transport {{helicopters}} {{are used}} for transporting personnel (troops) and cargo in support of military operations. In larger militaries, these helicopters are often purpose-built for military operations, but commercially available aircraft are also used. The benefit of using helicopters for these operations is that personnel and cargo can be moved to and from locations without requiring a runway for takeoffs and landings. Cargo is carried either internally, or externally by <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> where the load is suspended from an attachment point underneath the aircraft. Personnel are primarily loaded and unloaded while the helicopter is on the ground. However, when the terrain restricts even helicopters from landing, personnel may also be picked up and dropped off using specialized devices, such as rescue hoists or special rope lines, while the aircraft hovers overhead.|$|E

Like the El Tomcat, the Jet-Cat was {{to be only a}} single-seat aircraft with a fuselage radically reconfigured from its original design. The Jet-Cat was also equipped to carry <b>slung</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|R

Capable of lifting up to 80 troops and moving small Armoured fighting vehicles (usually as <b>slung</b> <b>loads</b> but also internally), these helicopters operate in the tactical transport role {{in much the same way}} as small fixed wing turboprop air-lifters. The lower speed, range and increased fuel consumption of helicopters are more than compensated by their ability to operate virtually anywhere.|$|R

The Super Stallion has a cruise speed of 173 mph (278 km/h) {{and a range}} of 621 miles (1,000 km). [...] The helicopter is fitted with a forward extendable in-flight refueling probe and it can also hoist hose refuel from a surface ship while in hover mode. It can carry three machine guns: one at the starboard side crew door; one at the port window, just behind the copilot; and one at the tail ramp. The CH-53E also has chaff-flare dispensers.|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to carry suspended loads as this can provide significant benefits to several applications in agriculture, law enforcement and construction. The load impact on the underlying system dynamics should not be neglected as significant feedback forces may be induced on the vehicle during certain flight manoeuvres. The constant variation in operating point induced by the <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> also causes conventional controllers to demand increased control effort. Much {{research has focused on}} standard multi-rotor position and attitude control with and without a <b>slung</b> <b>load.</b> However, predictive control schemes, such as Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), have not yet been fully explored. To this end, we present a novel controller for safe and precise operation of multi-rotors with heavy <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> in three dimensions. The paper describes a System Dynamics and Control Simulation Toolbox for use with MATLAB/SIMULINK which includes a detailed simulation of the multi-rotor and <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> as well as a predictive controller to manage the nonlinear dynamics whilst accounting for system constraints. It is demonstrated that the controller simultaneously tracks specified waypoints and actively damps large <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> oscillations. A linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) is derived and control performance is compared. Results show the improved performance of the predictive controller for a larger flight envelope, including aggressive manoeuvres and large <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> displacements. The computational cost remains relatively small, amenable to practical implementations...|$|E

40|$|To support {{helicopter}} pilots during <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> operations {{currently a}} pilot assistance system called Hubschrauber- AuÃenlast-Assistenzsystem (HALAS) {{is being developed}} within a cooperation of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and iMAR Navigation GmbH. The objective {{of this research is}} the demonstration of an automatic <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> stabilisation and positioning system during the flight test with DLRâs research helicopter Active Control Technology/ Flying Helicopter Simulator (ACT/FHS). The automatic <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> control system is being designed to extend the functionalities of the helicopterâs stability, control and augmentation system. The control system will be able to handle the challenges of rescue hoist operations. This means compensation of additional roll, pitch and yaw moments created by a significant distance of the load suspension point to the helicopterâs centre of gravity and the handling of a variable cable length. To measure the <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> motion, an optical-inertial sensor is being developed by iMAR Navigation GmbH. In this paper, the overall system architecture of HALAS as well as the hardware integration into the ACT/FHS is explained. The optical-inertial sensor used for the <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> dynamics measurement and estimation is described in detail. Furthermore, a first system analysis of a simulation model used for the later controller design is presented.

40|$|General {{simulation}} equations {{are derived}} for the rigid body motion of slung-load systems. This work {{is motivated by}} an interest in trajectory control for <b>slung</b> <b>loads</b> carried by two or more helicopters. An approximation of these systems consists of several rigid bodies connected by straight-line cables or links. The suspension can be assumed elastic or inelastic. Equations for the general system are obtained from the Newton-Euler rigid-body equations {{with the introduction of}} generalized velocity coordinates. Three forms are obtained: two generalize previous case-specific results for single-helicopter systems with elastic and inelastic suspensions, respectively; and the third is a new formulation for inelastic suspensions. The latter is derived from the elastic suspension equations by choosing the generalized coordinates so that motion induced by cable stretching is separated from motion with invariant cable lengths, and by then nulling the stretching coordinates to get a relation for the suspension forces. The result is computationally more efficient than the conventional formulation, is readily integrated with the elastic suspension formulation, and is easily applied to the complex dual-lift and multilift systems. Results are given for two-helicopter systems; three configurations are included and these can be integrated in a single simulation. Equations are also given for some single-helicopter systems, for comparison with the previous literature, and for a multilift system. Equations for degenerate-body approximations (point masses, rigid rods) are also formulated and results are given for dual-lift and multilift systems. Finally, linearlized equations of motion are given for general slung-load systems are presented along with results for the two-helicopter system with a spreader bar...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of small}} scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is quickly becomingcommonplace in many domains. Operating such {{vehicles}} often requires using aspecialized radio control (RC) transmitter. One {{objective of this}} thesis is toinvestigate the use of other means of controlling {{a particular type of}} a UAV - aquadrotor. Two types of alternative devices are investigated, a standard gamingconsole controller PlayStation 3 Â gamepad (PS 3 gamepad) and a smartphone(Android OS based). The purpose of substituting the RC controller is to make iteasier for a novice user to operate a UAV. The second objective is to investigate solutions to the problem of <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> control. A <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> is a uniform mass attached to a platform with a wire that may swingfreely. The <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> control problem consists of several subproblems: slung loadmodeling, altitude control, ï¬ltering of sensor data and the <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> control itself. The purpose of controlling the <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> is to reduce the oscillations of the load inï¬ight and to minimize its inï¬uence on the ï¬ight performance of a UAV. Both types of alternative interfaces to the UAV were designed and implemented. Inorder to interface with the quadrotor platform at hand a new communicationprotocol based on TCP/IP was introduced. A study of the design process and typicaluse cases was performed. The two types of interfaces were evaluated by a group oftarget users as well as in real ï¬ight tests. The game controller was easy to use whilethe smartphone interface required automatic altitude control to be really useful. The evaluators found that the smartphone provided a smoother control over the steeringcompared to using the joystick on a game controller. The <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> control problem was investigated theoretically and in practice on astationary testing rig. The altitude control problem has been addressed byincorporating a PID controller which uses ï¬ltered data from a pressure sensor. ThePID control was extended with an anti-windup mechanism combined with afeedforward control of the tilt angle. A mechanism for a smooth transition from themanual to automatic altitude control modes was implemented and veriï¬ed in ï¬ighttests...|$|E
40|$|Helicopter/slung load {{systems are}} two body systems {{in which the}} <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> adds its rigid body dynamics, aerodynamics, and sling {{stretching}} dynamics to the helicopter. The <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> can degrade helicopter handling qualities and reduce the flight envelope of the helicopter. Confirmation of system stability parameters and envelope is desired, but flight test evaluation is time consuming and costly. A simulation model validated for handling quality assessments would significantly reduce resources expended in flight testing while increasing efficiency, productivity, and safety by aiding researchers, designers, and pilots to understand factors affecting helicopter-slung load handling qualities. This thesis describes a comprehensive dynamics and aerodynamics model for <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> simulation, obtained by integrating the NASA Ames Gen Hel UH- 60 A simulation with <b>slung</b> <b>load</b> equations of motion. Frequency domain analysis is used to compare simulation to flight test frequency responses and key system stability parameters. Results are given for no load, a 4 K lb Block, and a 4 K lb CONEX load. Handling quality parameters, stability margins, and load pendulum motion roots for cases without load aerodynamics and with static wind tunnel data were compared. Results illustrated state-of-the-art simulation modeling of helicopter/slung load dynamics and its accuracy in predicting key dynamic parameters of interest. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that systems composed of multiple aerial robots with autonomous cooperation capabilities can assist responders in many {{search and rescue}} (SAR) scenarios. In most of the previous research work, the aerial robots are mainly considered as platforms for environmental sensing and have not been used to assist victims. In this paper, outdoors field experiments of transportation and accurate deployment of loads, with single/multiple autonomous aerial vehicles are presented. This is a novel feature that opens the possibility to use aerial robots to assist victims during the rescue phase operations. The accuracy in the deployment location is a critical issue in SAR scenarios where injured people may have very limited mobility. The presented system is composed of up to three small size helicopters and features the cooperative sensing, using several different sensor types. The system supports several forms of cooperative actuation as well, ranging from the cooperative deployment of small sen- sors/objects to the coupled transportation of <b>slung</b> <b>loads.</b> Within this paper the complete system is described, outlining the used hardware and the used software framework, {{as well as the}} used approaches for modeling and control.
