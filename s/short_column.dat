He took a strong, highly popular stand in favor of aviation, including a military air force of the sort his flying buddy General Billy Mitchell advocated.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the load}} on a column is applied {{through the center}} of gravity (centroid) of its cross section, it is called an axial load. A load at any other point in the cross section is known as an {{eccentric}} load. A <b>short</b> <b>column</b> under the action of an axial load will fail [...] by direct compression before it buckles, but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by springing suddenly outward laterally (buckling) in a bending mode. The buckling mode of deflection is considered a failure mode, and it generally occurs before the axial compression stresses (direct compression) can cause failure of the material by yielding or fracture of that compression member. However, intermediate-length columns will fail by a combination of direct compressive stress and bending.|$|E

There are {{changes in}} {{material}} properties of concrete when compared axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with micro-expansive concrete filled steel tube with axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with common reinforced concrete and these changes will inevitably {{lead to the}} change of axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with micro-expansive concrete filled steel tube in performance. It is impossible to fully use the existing research results of axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with common reinforced concrete; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} do experimental research on the working performance of axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with micro-expansive concrete filled steel tube. This paper studied the hydration heat, self-stress and failure load according to the test conditions of the 15 axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with micro-expansive concrete filled steel tube specimen; determined the optimum mix amount of axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with micro-expansive concrete filled steel tube and proposed the increase rate of ultimate failure load of axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with micro-expansive concrete filled steel tube compared with axially loaded <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with common reinforced concrete.

In his original 1669 edition, the columns were placed on two successive pages (15-16) forming six <b>short</b> <b>columns,</b> three columns of seven names each (headed Carver, Samuel Fuller, and Edward Tilley) {{on the first page}} and three columns of seven, seven, and six names each (headed Turner, Priest, and Clarke) on the next page. In the second (1721) and third (1772) editions, the six <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> were joined into three long columns of 14, 14, and 13 names each on a single page (20). The first and fourth <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> were joined into the first long column (headed Carver with Turner halfway down), the second and fifth <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> were joined into the second long column (headed Samuel Fuller with Priest halfway down), and the third and sixth <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> were joined into the third long column (headed Edward Tilley with Clarke halfway down), changing their order. In the fifth (1826) and sixth (1855) editions, the names were also in three long columns of 14, 14, and 13 names each on one page (1826: 38, 1855: 26), but now they were placed in their original 1669 order. The first and second <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> formed the first long column (headed Carver with Samuel Fuller halfway down), the third and fourth <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> formed the second long column (headed Edward Tilley with Turner halfway down), and the fifth and sixth <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> formed the third long column (headed Priest with Clarke halfway down).

60|$|But {{the feature}} of {{the place is a}} <b>short</b> <b>column</b> that rises {{from the middle of the}} marble {{pavement}} of the chapel, and marks the exact centre of the earth. The most reliable traditions tell us that this was known to be the earth's centre, ages ago, and that when Christ was upon earth he set all doubts upon the subject at rest forever, by stating with his own lips that the tradition was correct. Remember, He said that that particular column stood upon the centre of the world. If the centre of the world changes, the column changes its position accordingly. This column has moved three different times of its own accord. This is because, in great convulsions of nature, at three different times, masses of the earth --whole ranges of mountains, probably--have flown off into space, thus lessening the diameter of the earth, and changing the exact locality of its centre by a point or two. This is a very curious and interesting circumstance, and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who would make us believe that it is not possible for any portion of the earth to fly off into space.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} was to investigate whether the use of the normal shear design procedure of various codes {{may or may not be}} applied to reliably calculate the shear strength of <b>short</b> <b>columns.</b> Provisions of the codes American ACI 318 M- 08, Canadian CSA A 23. 3 - 04, Japanese AIJ Guidelines, New Zealand NZS 3101, European EN 1998 (EC 8) parts 1 and 3, combined with EN 1992 - 1 - 1 (EC 2), and draft fib Model Code 2010, as well as a strut-and-tie model are applied on <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> tested under cyclic loading that failed in shear. Actual shear resistances are compared to predictions, and the resulting shortcomings of the codes are identified.

40|$|AbstractThe {{temperature}} distribution of concrete filled steel tube reinforced concrete (CFSTRC) square <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> was analyzed. Test results of four CFSTRC square <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> {{were reported in}} this paper. The specimens exposed to the ISO- 834 standard fire without initial loads. The fire test lasted 180 minutes. The influential factors included the side length of cross-section, slenderness ratio and steel tube area ratio. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was used to calculate {{temperature distribution}} of CFSTRC square <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> at elevated temperature. The test {{results show that the}} larger side length of cross-section, the lower temperature inside the specimens with the same fire exposure time and steel tube area ratio and height of specimens. Under the same fire exposure time and side length of cross- section and steel tube area ratio, the slenderness ratio was larger, and the temperature inside the specimens was lower. With the same fire exposure time and side length of cross-section and slenderness ratio, the steel tube area ratio had slight influence on temperature distribution inside the specimens. The FEM simulation results agreed well with the experimental results. The FEM simulation was capable of calculating temperature distribution of CFSTRC square <b>short</b> <b>columns</b> with an accuracy that was sufficient for design purposes...|$|R
