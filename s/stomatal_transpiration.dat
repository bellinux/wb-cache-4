40|$|<b>Stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> is at {{the centre}} of a crisis in water {{availability}} and crop production {{that is expected to}} unfold over the next 20 - 30 years. Global water usage has increased 6 -fold in the past 100 years, twice as fast as the human population, and is expected to double again before 2030, driven mainly by irrigation and agriculture. Guard cell membrane transport is integral to controlling stomatal aperture and offers important targets for genetic manipulation to improve crop performance. However, its complexity presents a formidable barrier to exploring such possibilities. With few exceptions, mutations that increase water use efficiency commonly have been found to do so with substantial costs to the rate of carbon assimilation, reflecting the trade-off in CO 2 availability with suppressed <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration.</b> One approach yet to be explored in any detail relies on quantitative systems analysis of the guard cell. Our deep knowledge of transport and homeostasis in these cells gives real substance to the prospect for ‘reverse engineering’ of stomatal responses, using in silico design in directing genetic manipulation for improved water use and crop yields. Here we address this problem with a focus on stomatal kinetics, taking advantage of the OnGuard software and models of the stomatal guard cell (www. psrg. org. uk) recently developed for exploring stomatal physiology. Our analysis suggests that manipulations of single transporter populations are likely to have unforeseen consequences. Channel gating, especially of the dominant K+ channels, appears the most favorable target for experimental manipulation...|$|E
40|$|A hydroponic {{system was}} {{developed}} for intact measurements of water uptake rate, dissolved O_ 2 and CO_ 2 concentrations in nutrient solution under controlled environment. The relationship between water uptake rate and gas exchange in intact roots of cucumber plants was analyzed in response to <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> in the treatments that leaf transpiration was promoted by lighting and was inhibited by applying ABA and microcrystalline wax to the leaves. The decrease rate of O_ 2 was not necessarily associated with water uptake rate. On the other hand, increase rate of CO_ 2 was higher in the lighted plants in which leaf transpiration and water uptake were inhibited. The CO_ 2 concentration continued to increase even in O_ 2 deficit solution in the transpiring plants. From the fact that water uptake is caused by leaf transpiration and gas exchange in leaf is promoted in transpiring leaf, gas exchange in leaf {{was considered to be}} responsible for gas exchange in roots, and it is possible that O_ 2 transported from leaves to root system may be used for root respiration...|$|E

Emboli rate course have been measured over time too for whole and half-defoliated water stressed plants.

The experiment was carried out at the Faculdade de Ciências Agronômicas UNESP, Botucatu, SP. Sweet pepper plants were grown for 230 days after transplanting of seedlings and arranged in a completely randomized experimental design with 4 treatments, two irrigation managements (50 and 1500 kPa) and two soil surface managements (presence or absence of black polyethylene covering), and six replications. Physiological activities, such as <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> and resistance to water vapor diffusion, were evaluated as well as biochemical activities, such as peroxidase activity and total soluble protein in foliar tissues. It was observed that soil water availability may lead to physiological and biochemical alterations in plants.

The objective of this study was to evaluate photosynthesis and enzymatic activity in S. terebinthifolius seedlings under conditions of water deficit and their potential to recover following re-irrigation. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse under a plastic covering where plants were distributed into two groups: Group 1 - control plants, where irrigation was maintained at 70 % of the water retention capacity, and Group 2 - stressed plants, where irrigation was suspended until the photosynthetic rate neared zero, followed by rehydration for 12 days, then a further suspension of irrigation. At the beginning of the experiment and during the suspension of irrigation and rehydration, plants were evaluated for gas and antioxidant enzyme exchanges. Hydric stress significantly reduced photosynthesis, <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> conductance, carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco, and the chlorophyll content of the S. terebinthifolius plants.

Gene expression studies that have examined the influence of water stress in sugarcane have yielded divergent results, indicating the absence of a fixed pattern of changes in gene expression. In this work, we investigated the expression profiles of 12 genes in the leaves of a drought-tolerant genotype (RB 72910) of sugarcane and compared the results with those of other studies. The genotype was subjected to 80 – 100 % water availability (control condition) and 0 – 20 % water availability (simulated drought). To analyze the physiological status, the SPAD index, Fv/Fm ratio, net photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> (E) were measured.

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) are {{essential}} for development and stress signaling in plants. They contribute to plant defense against pathogens, regulate <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration,</b> and influence nutrient uptake and partitioning. Although both Ca 2 + and K+ channels of plants {{are known to be}} affected, virtually nothing is known of the targets for ROS at a molecular level. Here we report that a single cysteine (Cys) residue within the Kv-like SKOR K+ channel of Arabidopsis thaliana is essential for channel sensitivity to the ROS H 2 O 2. We show that H 2 O 2 rapidly enhanced current amplitude and activation kinetics of heterologously expressed SKOR, and the effects were reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Both H 2 O 2 and DTT were active at the outer face of the membrane and current enhancement was strongly dependent on membrane depolarization, consistent with a H 2 O 2 -sensitive site on the SKOR protein that is exposed to the outside when the channel is in the open conformation. Cys substitutions identified a single residue, Cys 168 located within the S 3 α-helix of the voltage sensor complex, to be essential for sensitivity to H 2 O 2. The same Cys residue was a primary determinant for current block by covalent Cys S-methioylation with aqueous methanethiosulfonates.

The water permeability of cuticular membranes (CM) isolated from the adaxial (astomatous) and abaxial (stomatous) leaf sides was measured using a method which allowed the separation of water diffusion through {{the remnants of the}} original stomatal pores from water diffusion through the solid cuticle. The long-term effects of low (20 – 40 %) or high (60 – 80 %) RH applied during plant growth and leaf ontogeny (‘growth RH’) and the short-term effects of applying 2 % or 100 % RH while measuring permeability (‘measurement RH’) were investigated. With both species, water permeability of the solid stomatous CM was significantly higher than the permeability of the astomatous CM. Adaxial cuticles of plants grown in humid air were more permeable to water than those from dry air. The adaxial CM of the drought-tolerant H. helix was more permeable and more sensitive to growth RH than the adaxial CM of Z. zamiifolia, a species avoiding water stress. However, permeability of the solid abaxial CM was similar in both species and independent of growth RH. The lack of a humidity response in the abaxial CM is attributed to a higher degree of cuticular hydration resulting from <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration.</b> The ecophysiological significance of higher permeability of the solid stomatous CM compared to the astomatous CM is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Leaves {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{anatomical}} and morphologi-cal structures that partially isolate stomata from the turbulent atmosphere (Figs. 1 – 8). Traditionally, such stomatal protection has been considered as an adaptation to dry climates (e. g., Raven et al., 2005), with the suggestion that they increase the effective boundary layer, decreasing stomatal conductance and thereby reducing <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> (e. g., Hill, 1998; Roth-Nebelsick, 2007). These features are of particular interest to palaeobotanists because they have often been used to infer dry climates (e. g., Hill, 1998). However, the evidence for any association between stomatal protection and dry climates is largely anecdotal. The physiological function of stomatal protection remains ambiguous because water loss and carbon assimilation vary in concert. One possible advantage of reduced conductance is in-creased instantaneous water use effi ciency (von Caemmerer and Farquhar, 1981) because decreases in conductance result in lower carbon dioxide concentration in the substomatal cavity. As a result, the gradient in carbon dioxide concentration from the leaf to the external atmosphere increases more than the cor-responding gradient in water vapor. However, this does not necessarily imply that stomatal protection is an advantage in dry climates because plants can adjust water use effi ciency by altering the degree of stomatal opening. One possible way of determining if stomatal protection is linked with aridity would be to test for an evolutionary associa-tion with dry climates in an evolutionary model system. The extant and extinct species of Proteaceae, a southern hemisphere family of evergreen trees and shrubs, are especially suitable for investigating the evolution of xeromorphy and scleromorph...|$|E

The main factor was NPK fertilizer recommended by Department of Agriculture Malaysia (DOA) and United Plantation Berhad (UPB). The sub-factors were applications and non-application (as control) of kieserite (Mg), boric acid (B) and sodium silicate (Si). The sub-sub factors were the four Rastali accessions, namely, R 08, R 62, R 34 and R 12. In particular, the Berangan accession was selected as the control treatment. The observations were carried out on the stomatal morphology, <b>stomatal</b> conductance and <b>transpiration</b> rate. Data were analyzed with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) at 5 % level and continued with the Least Significant Differences (LSD) if significant. The relationship patterns among the parameters were determined using regression analysis. The findings showed that high-dose applications of NPK fertilizer enhanced stomatal length and width (abaxial and adaxial), <b>stomatal</b> conductance and <b>transpiration</b> rate, with or without Mg, B and Si. Similarly, in low doses, NPK fertilizers added with Mg, B and Si significantly enhanced stomatal length and width, <b>stomatal</b> conductance and <b>transpiration</b> rate. On the contrary, stomatal density (abaxial and adaxial) and ratio were not influenced by NPK fertilizer, Mg-B-Si or their combinations. Moreover, stomatal density and ratio were found to be different among the cultivars (Berangan and Rastali), but similar within the Rastali accessions. In particular, Berangan had a high stomatal density (abaxial and adaxial) compared Rastali, so stomatal ratio became smaller.

30|$|As we all know, epicuticular waxes {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, which are significant to plants (Shepherd and Griffiths 2006). They could form an important protective layer {{to protect the}} internal structure of the plant body (Koch and Ensikat 2008). Except control the loss of water by <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration,</b> plants also reduce the water loss by epicuticular waxes, which {{plays a crucial role}} in resisting water stress (Sieber et al. 2000). Waxes layer {{on the surface of the}} leaves has reflection effect to ultraviolet rays and light, which can protect the leaves from the dangers of radiation (Holmes and Keiller 2002). Until now, lots of genes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of epicuticular waxes have been reported. LTP 4, a gene of lipid transfer proteins gene family, could bind to fatty acids and transfer phospholipids between the membranes (Arondel et al. 2000). CER 2 gene expressed in an organ- and tissue-specific manner affects epicuticular waxes accumulation and the stems of cer 2 mutants are bright green (Xia et al. 1996). CER 4 encoded an alcohol-forming fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase (FAR) is responsible for the synthesis of primary alcohols, which involves in epicuticular waxes production (Rowland et al. 2006). FAR 4 could affect the formation of primary alcohols and the encoded enzyme could increase the length of the fatty acid chain (Domergue et al. 2010). Researchers generally believe that if stems or leaves have a glossy green phenotype, it is indicative of waxes deficiency, and conversely, if plants have whitish green stems, it is most likely displayed more waxes (Go et al. 2014).|$|E

Permeances were in the range 0. 6 - 2. 9 x 10 (- 5) m s- 1 and were unaffected by most treatments. In Prunus, P increased slightly but significantly in the NO treatment. In Corylus and Fagus, P was sometimes found to be reduced by fumigation with NO, but not always. Betula leaves grown under elevated SO 2 and NO 2 showed higher values of P only if they were visibly damaged. Minimum conductances (g(min) estimated from water loss rates of both sides of detached hypostomatous leaves were higher than P, and were more strongly affected by treatments. In these cases, the most probable explanation is some damage to stomatal function resulting in a reduced ability to close after leaf excision. Effects of growing conditions and time of year on P were found, which allowed a hypothetical interaction between P and stomatal sensitivity to air humidity to be tested in beech.

Stomatal opening and the rise in <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> of the mutant was delayed in the light and following Ca 2 + -evoked closure, consistent with a constitutive form of so-called programmed stomatal closure.

40|$|Stomata open in {{response}} to light allowing CO 2 uptake for photosynthesis and they close {{in response}} to abiotic stress, such as drought, to prevent transpirational water loss from the plant. A pair of guard cells surrounds each stoma and stomatal movements depend on K+ fluxes across the guard cell plasma membrane. These fluxes are mediated by inward and outward rectifying K+ channels (K+in and K+out). The SNARE SYP 121 was originally identified in association with ion channel regulation in guard cells. SNARE proteins mediate vesicle fusion and facilitate delivery of membrane proteins to target membranes. They are also linked {{to a variety of}} physiological responses. In particular, the plasma membrane SNARE SYP 121 has been attributed a role in immune response and K+ nutrition. I have used the Arabdopsis loss-of-function mutant syp 121 and uncovered a set of mutant phenotypes associated with impaired stomatal opening. In the syp 121 mutant stomatal reopening was delayed and incomplete following Ca 2 +-induced closure, and increase in <b>stomatal</b> <b>transpiration</b> was slowed in the light. Incomplete reopening was rescued by complementation with wild-type SYP 121 and was not observed in the syp 122 mutant, lacking the homologous gene product. Guard cell K+ in current, necessary for K+ uptake during stomatal reopening, was reduced in syp 121 mutant guard cells. Analysis of current gating characteristics suggested an impaired delivery of K+in channels to the plasma membrane, which was consistent with inhibition of stomatal reopening by the trafficking inhibitor Brefeldin A in wild-type plants. Impaired stomatal reopening in the syp 121 mutant was phenomenologically similar to a Ca 2 +-encoded form of ‘programmed closure’ and my results suggest that endocytosis and delayed recycling of K+in channels may underly this phenomenon. Impaired stomatal function manifested in a conditional syp 121 mutant growth phenotype dependent on high light and low humidity, characterised by reduced stomatal conductance and photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation. My results suggested the necessity for SYP 121 -dependent K+in channel traffic during stomatal reopening.

Pitiuba were evaluated under semi-arid {{conditions at the}} Embrapa-Centro de Pesquisa Agropecuária do Trópico Semi-Árido (CPATSA) at Petrolina, PE, Brazil. The treatments were: maize and cowpea as sole crops, at a population of 40, 000 plants ha- 1, and intercropped at a population of 20, 000 plants ha- 1. The results obtained in this paper appear {{to be related to}} the degree of competition experienced by the components, mainly for water and light. Maize intercropped had higher values of leaf water potential, <b>stomatal</b> conductance, <b>transpiration</b> and photosynthesis than as sole crop. Intercropped cowpea had higher values of leaf water potential but lower <b>stomatal</b> conductance, <b>transpiration</b> and photosynthesis than sole cowpea. Maize productivity increased 18 % in relation to sole crop whereas a 5 % decrease was observed with cowpea. Despite these facts the Land Equivalent Ratio obtained was 1. 13 indicating intercropping advantage over the sole system. The higher partial Land Equivalent Ratio observed for maize suggests that this specie was the main component influencing the final productivity of the intercropping system studied...|$|R
40|$|Growth chamber {{estimation}} under severe water-stress of behaviour of 4 cherry rootstocks (seedling, Colt, CAB/ 6 P and CAB/ 11 E) {{was carried}} out through the measure of leaf water potential, <b>stomatal</b> conductance and <b>transpiration</b> rates. This experience showed {{a positive correlation between}} leaf water potenti al and stomatal conductance, a difference equivalent to 1, 0 - 1, 5 M Pa, O, 5 - O, 7. sec → 1 and 15 /h/m 2 of water respectively in leaf water potential, <b>stomatal</b> conductance and <b>transpiration</b> rates between irrigated and stressed trees. In particular, CAB/ 6 P selection resulted the most sensible to water stress, followed by CAB/ 11 E, Colt and seedling; the last one kept more intense transpiration rates and showed more rapid restarting of stomatal conductance during recovery than Colt...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} how {{vascular}} land plants compensate for loss of photosynthetic leaf area by altering {{the output of}} photosynthetic carbon assimilation, <b>stomatal</b> conductance and <b>transpiration</b> and optimizing water use and compensatory leaf growth. We collected approximately 200 hours of physiological process data for 7 diverse vascular land plant species subject to one, three or four successive defoliation treatments. We found {{that the majority of}} species studied showed a parabolic maximization of photosynthetic rate, <b>stomatal</b> conductance and <b>transpiration</b> rate with moderate defoliation compared to undefoliated same-age plants. Furthermore, we found that the maximization of these processes in response to defoliation is generalizable across taxa but the degree to which this occurs does not necessarily vary consistently within phylogenetic groups but, perhaps, can be predicted by ecology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Plant water {{relations}} of five obligate riparian species were studied along California's North Fork Kings River. Diurnal <b>stomatal</b> conductance, <b>transpiration,</b> and xylem pressure potentials were measured throughout the 1986 growing season and in mid-season in 1987. Patterns were similar for all species although absolute values varied considerably. Maximum stomatal conductance occurred {{early in the}} day and season during favorable environmental conditions and decreased as air temperature and the vapor pressure difference between the leaf and air increased. Maximum transpiration rates occurred in mid-morning and mid-summer resulting in estimated daily water losses per unit sunlit leaf area of 163 - 328 mol H 2 O m- 2. Predawn xylem pressure potentials remained high in 1986 when streamflows averaged 1. 41 m 3 /s (50 cfs), however they were notably lower in 1987 at 0. 7 m 3 /s (25 cfs). The objectives of this study were to examine patterns of riparian plant water relations, determine how these patterns change as streamflow changes, and provide physiological data sets for a predictive model of vegetation responses to diversion. We attempted to determine if streamflow changes influence plant water relations, patterns of water use, canopy temperatures, and differential mortality of riparian individuals. We measured daily and seasonal patterns of <b>stomatal</b> conductance, <b>transpiration,</b> and plant xylem pressure potential of adult and juvenile riparian plants to determine how these patterns may be affected by diversion...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects of {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus response in young (two- and three-year-old), non-bearing,'Western Schley' and 'Wichita' varieties of pecan (Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) C. Koch) grown in two orchards in San Simon, AZ. Using tree trunk diameter and rates of photosynthesis, <b>transpiration,</b> <b>stomatal</b> conductance, and <b>transpiration</b> as proxies for tree growth and positive response, and by analyzing foliar elemental concentrations of N and P, preliminary results suggest that 'Wichita' responds better than 'Western' to N and P fertilizer with respect to tree growth. Additions of nitrogen ranging from 5. 6 kg N·ha⁻¹ to 35. 9 kg N·ha⁻¹ increased foliar N concentration in 'Wichita', {{although there was no}} response to photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, intracellular CO₂, or transpiration. Additions of phosphorus fertilizer up to 112 kg·ha⁻¹ improved tree growth; and growth increased with increasing foliar P concentration...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades the {{pressure}} probe has been used extensively in studies of the hydro-mechanical and osmotic properties of plant cells. However, although pressure probe techniques have been employed successfully in the study of stomatal function, there is no detailed account of this special application of the pressure probe technique. This paper describes the construction and use of the pressure probe in studies relating to stomatal func-tion, and reviews the current state of knowledge of stomatal function in relation to guard cell and leaf hydromechanical properties.

40|$|Zn {{deficiency}} induced {{increases in}} epicuticular wax deposits, lamina thickness, degree of succulence, water saturation deficit, diffusive resistance, and proline accumulation and decreases in carbonic anhydrase activity, water potential, <b>stomatal</b> aperture, and <b>transpiration</b> {{in the leaves}} of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var botrytis cv Pusa) plants. Restoration of Zn supply to the deficient plants increased <b>stomatal</b> aperture, <b>transpiration,</b> and carbonic anhydrase activity significantly within 2 h. However, leaf water potential in the Zn-deficient plants did not recover within 24 h after resupply of Zn. The guard cells in epidermal peels from the Zn-deficient leaves had less K+ than those from the controls. Stomatal aperture in the epidermal peels from Zn-deficient leaves was 64 % less than in the controls when the epidermal strips were floated on 125 mM KCl. Supplementing the ambient medium 25 mM KCl with ZnCl 2 enhanced stomatal aperture in both control and Zn-deficient peels, and the effect was significant in the latter. The observations indicate involvement of Zn in stomatal opening, possibly as a constituent of carbonic anhydrase needed for maintaining adequate [HCO 3 -] in the guard cells, and also as a factor affecting K+ uptake by the guard cells...|$|R

Sarakhs, P. atlantica sub sp. Mutica, P. atlantica sub sp. Atlantica) were evaluated {{during the spring}} and summer seasons of 2005 in the Iran's Pistachio Research Institute (IPRI). Ecophysiological characteristics such as photosynthesis rate (Pn) in leaf surface (µmol m- 2 s- 1), <b>stomatal</b> conductance (gs), <b>transpiration</b> rate (E), leaf internal CO 2 concentration (Ci) and leaf temperature (0 C) were measured in the 6 stages of nut growth and development.

Negative correlation was found between photosynthesis and leaves internal CO 2 pressure. The highest rate of photosynthesis (16. 59 µmol m- 2 s- 1), stomatal conductance (0. 456 mol m...|$|R
40|$|Many {{factors such}} as climate and {{agricultural}} practices influence the ecophysiology of legume crops. As an important legume crop, pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) has been grown mainly in arid, semi-arid tropical and subtropical regions of the World. However, performance of pigeonpea in southeastern United States has not been extensively investigated. To test the effects of climate and agricultural practices on the ecophysiology of pigeonpea, we conducted a two-year field experiment in Nashville, Tennessee. Precipitation {{during the growing season}} showed contrasting patterns with fall drought in 2010 and frequent precipitation in 2011. Four pigeonpea varieties at three planting densities were evaluated in both years. Measurements included maximum net leaf photosynthesis, <b>stomatal</b> conductance, <b>transpiration,</b> water use efficiency (WUE), leaf area index (LAI), and soil respiration. We found strong interannual variations in all variables investigated. Leaf photosynthetic rates, <b>stomatal</b> conductance, <b>transpiration</b> and LAI were significantly higher in 2011 than in 2010. The high values observed in 2011 were mainly due to high precipitation rates during and after the flowering time. Pigeonpea varieties G 1 and W 3 had higher photosynthetic rates and LAI while variety W 3 had the highest WUE. Planting density did not influence these ecophysiological variables except for plant transpiration. Our results indicated that variety selection could improve pigeonpea performance under varying climatic conditions. Although pigeonpea varieties are adaptable to drought, irrigation and growing in moist climatic regions could significantly enhance its ecophysiological performance and yield...|$|R
