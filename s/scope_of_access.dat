40|$|Abstract. Hierarchical {{decomposition}} is {{a fundamental}} principle that encourages the organization of program elements into nested <b>scopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>access,</b> instead <b>of</b> treating all as “global. ” This paper offers a foundational study of heap decomposition inference, the problem of statically extracting the decomposition hierarchy latent in the runtimes of object-oriented programs, henceforth revealing the compositional nature of the heap. The centerpiece of the paper is Cypress, a sound, precise, and scalable constraint-based ownership type inference coupled with a novel application of linear programming over integers. All constraints in Cypress are linear, and the precision of decomposition – placing objects to scopes as non-global as possible – {{can be reduced to}} a linear programming problem. Cypress has been implemented as an open-source tool that can decompose realworld Java applications of more than 100 K LOC and up to 6000 statically distinct instantiations. ...|$|R

40|$|Research problem: Readers’ {{advisory}} services are generally recognised as a core service offered in New Zealand public libraries. Currently no readers’ advisory resources or tools exist {{based solely on}} New Zealand content, either for narrative nonfiction or fiction. The aim of this bibliography was to provide librarians with a tool to find New Zealand narrative nonfiction books {{within the context of}} a readers’ advisory framework. Methodology: The bibliography is based on appeal theory and takes the approach of creating a narrative nonfiction readers’ advisory tool. 112 New Zealand narrative nonfiction books are described, classified by genre and identified by their appeal elements, characteristics that give readers insight into a book’s qualities: character, mood, pacing and story line. Results: The development and dissemination of a readers’ advisory tool increases awareness of New Zealand narrative nonfiction genres and content. It offers a New Zealand point of reference that supports nonfiction leisure reading and promotes narrative nonfiction readers’ {{advisory services}}. Implications: The organisation of the bibliographic records into a library using Zotero referencing software enables the material to become an online New Zealand narrative nonfiction readers’ advisory tool.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{popularity}} of complementary medicine {{continues to be}} asserted by the professional associations and umbrella organisations of these therapies. Within conventional medicine there are also signs that attitudes towards some of the complementary therapies are changing. AIM: To describe the scale and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to complementary therapies (acupuncture, chiropractic, homoeopathy, hypnotherapy, medical herbalism, and osteopathy) via general practice in England. DESIGN OF STUDY: A postal questionnaire sent to 1226 individual general practitioners (GPs) in a random cluster sample of GP partnerships in England. GPs received up to three reminders. SETTING: One in eight (1226) GP partnerships in England in 1995. METHOD: Postal questionnaire to assess {{estimates of the number}} of practices offering 'in-house' access to a range of complementary therapies or making National Health Service (NHS) referrals outside the practice; sources of funding for provision and variations by practice characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 964 GPs replied (78. 6 %). Of these, 760 provided detailed information. An estimated 39. 5 % (95 % CI = 35 %- 43 %) of GP partnerships in England provided access to some form of complementary therapy for their NHS patients. If all non-responding partnerships are assumed to be non-providers, the lowest possible estimate is 30. 3 %. An estimated 21. 4 % (95 % CI = 19 %- 24 %) were offering access via the provision of treatment by a member of the primary health care team, 6. 1 % (95 % CI = 2 %- 10 %) employed an 'independent' complementary therapist, and an estimated 24. 6 % of partnerships (95 % CI = 21 %- 28 %) had made NHS referrals for complementary therapies. The reported volume of provision within any individual service tended to be low. Acupuncture and homoeopathy were the most commonly available therapies. Patients made some payment for 25 % of practice-based provision. Former fundholding practices were significantly more likely to offer complementary therapies than non-fundholding practices, (45 % versus 36 %, P = 0. 02). Fundholding did not affect the range of therapies offered, and patients from former fundholding practices were no more likely to pay for treatment. CONCLUSION: Access to complementary health care for NHS patients was widespread in English general practices in 1995. This data suggests that a limited range of complementary therapies were acceptable to a large proportion of GPs. Fundholding clearly provided a mechanism for the provision of complementary therapies in primary care. Patterns of provision are likely to alter with the demise of fundholding and existing provision may significantly reduce unless the Primary Care Groups or Primary Care Trusts are prepared to support the 'levelling up' of some services...|$|E

40|$|On March 31, 2010, Access Copyright {{applied to}} the Copyright Board to certify a tariff that would govern the {{relationship}} between the organization {{and the members of the}} Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and the Association of Community Colleges of Canada (ACCC). Previously, the relationship had been governed by a series of license agreements between the organizations which had been periodically renewed. But Access Copyright chose not to seek renewal of the licenses, and {{applied to the}} Board to certify a general tariff that would cover all post-secondary institutions for the period of 2011 through 2013. Access Copyright was not merely trying to carry forward the terms of previous licensing agreements in the form of a Board certified tariff. Rather, they were seeking a tariff with a much higher rate, wider scope and broader application; one which would place new burdens on the institutions, their staff and students, and which would also jeopardize many of the rights of academic staff and students. This working paper reviews the terms of the Proposed Tariff and its progeny licenses and discusses several of the arguments that have been raised against them. The first general grouping is that many of the provisions are ambiguous, counterintuitive and are based on problematic definitions which attempt to extend the reach of the compensable activities beyond what is authorized by Canadian law. The second broad issue is the lack of value in the Proposed Tariff itself. The third general grouping deals with the audit, reporting, monitoring and survey (ARMS) provisions in the Proposed Tariff and the progeny licenses. With respect to the Proposed Tariff, we argue that several of its terms are also ultra vires the Copyright Act and would not have survived scrutiny had they been fully litigated. While recent developments have cast a new light on these issues, many of the concerns raised in this report about the Proposed Tariff remain unresolved. Despite strong arguments to the contrary, and their previous opposition to the Proposed Tariff at the Board; AUCC, ACCC and several institutions still felt that a license with Access Copyright was needed. In January 2012, Access Copyright announced they had reached licensing agreements with the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario, the terms of which were substantially similar to the proposed tariff. Following the “lead” of UWO and the University of Toronto, AUCC and ACCC have since announced a similar agreement with Access Copyright, resulting in a “Model License,” and they have since dropped their opposition to the Proposed Tariff at the Copyright Board. In this report, we refer to the UWO and University of Toronto agreements and the AUCC/ACCC model licenses as the “progeny” of the Proposed Tariff because despite some differences, they are substantially similar in many respects. To date, some institutions have accepted the Model License, others have rejected it, and many others had not yet announced their intentions as of the end of July 2012. This paper is divided into five sections. Following this introduction, section 2 will address some of the definitional problems in the Proposed Tariff and progeny licenses in more detail. First and foremost are the definitions of “copy” and “course collection” which increase the scope of the statutory reproduction right and create other burdens. These overbroad definitions are foundational problems with the tariff/licenses which not only exceed the scope of owners 2 ̆ 7 statutory rights, but will have the potential to substantially impede the delivery of course materials, adversely impact faculty and student privacy rights, and ultimately threaten academic freedom. The other problematic definition involves the “Secure Network,” along with various limitations that flow from this definition. The third part of this report will ask the question: What value would institutions obtain under the Proposed Tariff and its progeny licences? A review of section 3 of the Proposed Tariff and its progeny indicates that the scope of the permissions does not add very much to what is already permitted under fair dealing and other limitations and exceptions in the Copyright Act. In addition, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>Access</b> Copyright 2 ̆ 7 s repertoire is ambiguous, and the value of the indemnification clause in the progeny licenses is very limited. The fourth section will turn to the audit, reporting, monitoring, and survey (ARMS) provisions in the Proposed Tariff. We argue that these measures are overbroad and ultra vires the Copyright Act. They should be substantially scaled back if not entirely eliminated from any eventual tariff order. And while these ARMS provisions have been cast in modified terms in the progeny licenses, these corresponding provisions remain highly problematic. The last section will look at the implications of more recent developments (including the UWO and UofT licenses of January 30 th, the AUCC and ACCC Model License, and the withdraw of AUCC from objector status at the Board) for the tariff proceedings which are still pending at the Board. It will close with a summary of the recommendations made throughout this report. And while a full treatment of the implications of the passage of Bill C- 11 in June and the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s historic July pentalogy is beyond the scope of this report, they will also be considered throughout this report. Therefore, the overall purpose of this report is to identify and address some of the key issues that have been raised from the outset about the Proposed Tariff dispute, as they remain largely unresolved. In addition to highlighting flaws with the Proposed Tariff and its progeny licenses, we will offer some suggestions for how an effective and fair tariff or license could be crafted. We are calling this report a Working Paper as it is very much still a work in progress given the fast pace of current developments and the still unsettled state of the issues. Many institutions have yet to announce whether they will accept or reject the model license agreement and the status of the tariff proceedings before the Copyright Board still needs to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Developing a multiagent system (MAS) is {{difficult}} due to numerous issues. We aim {{to define and}} discuss some of these. The project contains most of the typical phases of MAS development, from literature study to implementation (testing {{is beyond the scope}} of the project). As a case-study for the development of a multiagent system, we use an adaptive diary assistant that is run by a team of autonomous agents. Creating a useful application is only a secondary goal. It is the entire process from literature study to implementation that we are interested in, not the end product. The two main techniques used for the development of this diary assistant are qualitative decision theory and graph rewriting. Qualitative decision theory provides us with a convenient architecture for the design, whereas graph rewriting is used for implementation. Besides defining and discussing the issues encountered during MAS development, we also explore and expand the possibilities of graph rewriting as a programming language for MAS. Functionality for qualitative decision theory and complex data manipulation is added to the graphical agent programming environment OutOfBrain. The project has many goals, but the focus lies with two simple research questions: "How can Boutilier's QDT architecture be extended to allow for temporal reasoning?" and "Can Boutilier's QDT architecture, extended with a temporal modality, be integrated into OutOfBrain?". QDT can possibly be extended with temporal reasoning by combining it with BDI's apparatus for handling time series and events. We call this combined architecture QDT+ from now on. It has three modalities, one for linear preference orderings, one for linear normality orderings and one for time trees that branch into the future and are linear in the past. This allows agents to reason about time as well as mental attitudes. We claim that such a multimodal architecture is necessary for general purpose learning. The design we end up with leads to the following conclusion. QDT can be extended to allow for temporal reasoning by combining it with certain parts of BDI. We provide the first steps toward such an architecture. The second main goal of this project is to implement QDT+ as an integral part of OutOfBrain. In this endeavour we were only partly successful. The original QDT architecture, using preferences and normalities, was indeed implemented and it is now part of OutOfBrain. However, the functionality for handling time and events was not. This is partly due to time constraints on the project. Despite this deficit, we are tempted to answer our second research question in a positive way: QDT+ can indeed be implemented to become an integrated part of OutOfBrain. Although we did not succeed in doing so ourselves, we developed a clear picture of how one would go about implementing such an architecture. The project has four secondary goals. They should be viewed as the context for our two main goals. Also, we use them to solidify the more abstract challenges of analysing issues in MAS and exploring and extending OutOfBrain. The first of these secondary goals is to create a useful application using QDT and OutOfBrain. Requirements on new software are extremely high nowadays and the adaptive diary assistant does not live up to them. Security issues for example are not dealt with. One's diary should be private and not accessible to other people. Achieving this {{is beyond the scope of}} this project. Besides this issue, many others have to be dealt with before the application could be called seaworthy. However, we decided that the diary assistant should never leave the computer-lab. It served its purpose, which was to be a test-bed to explore and extend QDT and OutOfBrain. Secondary goal number two is to successfully incorporate agent communication in order to improve the application's performance and to further our understanding of sociality in MAS. The communication standard we use, FIPA-ACL, proved to be highly intuitive and perfectly capable of modelling fairly complex communication flows. Therefore, we encourage other researchers and engineers to make use of it. The third context-goal is to develop a powerful learning method to facilitate user modelling. Again, we aim to improve the diary assistant with that, but we also desire to expand our own knowledge of the topic. We were only partly successful in this endeavour. The learning technique used in the application is not general purpose; it can only operate in a highly constrained, predefined problem space that fails to impress. The fourth and final secondary goal is to use standards from cognitive ergonomics to improve the interface of the application. We hardly pursued this goal in practice, but we did end up with a usable interface thanks to our own insights and Rockingstone's experience with developing database applications. Because of our research goals, we choose to make use of a team of agents as opposed to a single agent. From an engineering point of view, it would be better to use a single agent, because the system is not distributed in space and henceforth not a true multiagent system. In the current version of the programming environment, the world, including the agents, is represented in a single graph. We simulate distributedness by posing constraints on the agents' <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> and control over the environment. They need to work together, since each member has unique capabilities. To successfully implement the BDI components as well, one would have to develop a way to store the history of the world. This would result in not one, but a whole series of OutOfBrain graphs, one for each time step. Each one is a world that can contain anything from first order sentences to complex statements, combining temporal operators with mental attitudes. This is something for potential future work. Another possible topic for future studies is the general purpose learning method we mentioned. It would require a module that extracts logical formulas from raw input, coming from the real world, an experimental setting, a simulation or a database. Needless to say, this is an unsolved problem and many people are working on it. A learning method for QDT+ would have to transform histories of percepts to formulas containing normalities and preferences, combined with temporal operators. We believe that MAS will play a central role in the future world of diary-keeping. The best approach is to have a single agent represent his user instead of having an entire team of agents per user. We envision a company where everybody caries a PDA that acts as a personal secretary. After a single button-press by the chairman of the board, a meeting can be scheduled that fits everybody's appointments and preferences as much as possible. The personal secretaries negotiate and form alliances in order to satisfy (or rather satisfice) the desires of their masters. ...|$|E

This paper describes the United States recently enacted Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and assesses its quantitative impact on African exports. The AGOA expands the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> preferential <b>access</b> <b>of</b> Africa's exports to the United States in key areas such as clothing. However, its medium-term benefitsestimated at about US$ 100 -$ 140 million, an 8 − 11 percent addition to current non-oil exportswould have been nearly five times greater (US$ 540 million) if no restrictive conditions had been imposed on the terms <b>of</b> market <b>access.</b> The most important of these conditions are the rules of origin with which African exporters of clothing must comply to benefit from duty-free access...|$|R
30|$|Assumptions {{about how}} phones or the Internet will be {{accessed}} that could create additional harm. For instance, community members who perceive {{that access to}} Wi-Fi or library phones is checked out to facilitate conversations between women and girls and male community members for romantic purposes could put beneficiaries or staff in additional harm. An assessment before implementing this service {{would need to be}} conducted as well as consistent messaging to the community on the purpose and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> Wi-Fi <b>access</b> and the use of library phones or information stewards throughout implementation. For this model to function and avoid increasing the potential for harm, focus group and community discussions with women and girls should inform the decision to implement and the approach for implementation, utilizing the assessment to determine interest, readiness, and risk factors.|$|R
40|$|Australia and South Korea {{have signed}} a new free trade {{agreement}} - the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA). Is it a fair trade fairytale? Or is it a dirty deal done dirt cheap? Or somewhere in between? It is hard to tell, given the initial secrecy of the negotiations, and {{the complexity of the}} texts of the agreement There has been much debate in Parliament over the transparency of the trade agreement; the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> market <b>access</b> provided under the deal; the impact of the investment chapter, with its investor-state dispute settlement clause; the intellectual property chapter; the environment chapter; its impact upon public health; and the labor rights chapter. KAFTA provides an indication of the approach of the new Conservative Government in Australia to other trade deals – such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership...|$|R

GA requires a data distribution; we do not expect the user to supply this; rather, we show how we perform data distribution and work distribution according to OpenMP static loop scheduling. An inspector-executor strategy is employed for irregular applications in order to gather information on accesses to potentially non-local data, group non-local data transfers and overlap communications with local computations. Furthermore, a new directive INVARIANT is proposed {{to provide information about}} the dynamic <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> data <b>access</b> patterns. This directive can help us generate efficient codes for irregular applications using the inspector-executor approach. Our experiments show promising results for the corresponding regular and irregular GA codes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to give a tutorial on lattice-based access control models for computer security. The paper begins with a review of Denning's axioms for information flow policies, which provide a theoretical foundation for these models. The structure of security labels in the military and government sectors, and the resulting lattice is discussed. This is followed by a review of the Bell-LaPadula model, which enforces information flow policies by means of its simple-security and *-properties. It is noted that information flow through covert channels is beyond the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> such <b>access</b> controls. Variations <b>of</b> the Bell-LaPadula model are considered. The paper next discusses the Biba integrity model, examining its relationship to the Bell-LaPadula model. The paper then reviews the Chinese Wall policy, which arises in a segment of the commercial sector. It is shown how this policy can be enforced in a lattice framework...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the role of electronic health records in healthcare delivery, we must understand how medical information moves through the healthcare system. This report summarizes the theoretical underpinnings of a model of patient data flow, and {{presents the results of}} a small field study designed to understand the mechanics of patient data flow in practice. Since privacy is critical to the acceptance of electronic records, special attention is paid to limiting the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> data <b>access.</b> As a patient moves through the healthcare system, each medical or administrative step might require some amount of patient data to be accessed by the appropriate stakeholder. Limiting access to data may prevent care providers from properly aiding patients; failing to limit access to data can compromise patient privacy. Despite wide variation in practice, enough common structure runs through access patterns inside the private healthcare system to make generalizable modeling possible. Two perspectives of modeling of patient data flow are presented, one focusing on a wider <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> privacy issues, the other aimed at providing empirically grounded quality of care metrics. Further steps are identified to build a more complete, empirically grounded model...|$|R
50|$|The {{mission of}} the Postal Service is to provide the American public with trusted {{universal}} postal service. While not explicitly defined, the Postal Service's universal service obligation (USO) is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions: geographic <b>scope,</b> range <b>of</b> products, <b>access</b> to services and facilities, delivery frequency, affordable and uniform pricing, service quality, and security of the mail. While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only carrier with a legal obligation to provide all the various aspects of universal service.|$|R
