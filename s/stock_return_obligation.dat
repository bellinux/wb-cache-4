The fundamental exogenous variables were constructed following the previous research of Lev and Thiagarajan [1993], Abarbanell and Bushee [1997], Piotroski [2000] and Mohanram [2004], while the endogenous variable is defined as a one-year-ahead <b>stock</b> <b>return.</b> Empirical analysis based on a panel data model for 187 companies in years 1999 – 2003 finds that the future <b>stock</b> <b>returns</b> are significantly related to three fundamental variables, i. e. gross margin, sales and administrative expenses and <b>return</b> on assets. <b>Stock</b> <b>returns</b> are also strongly associated with price-earnings ratio.

40|$|Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio) {{has been}} broadly used by analysts and investors for stock selection. Stocks with low PE ratio are {{perceived}} as having cheaper current price hence expected to generate higher return in subsequent period. This paper aims to examine predictability of <b>stock</b> <b>return</b> using PE Ratio based on historical relationship between PE Ratio and subsequent <b>stock</b> <b>return.</b> Particularly, it seeks to find whether stocks with high PE Ratio followed by low <b>stocks</b> <b>return</b> and on the contrary, stocks with low PE Ratio followed by high <b>stocks</b> <b>return.</b> Using <b>stocks</b> which are included as member of Liquidity 45 and observation period 2005 - 2010 as samples, results {{show that there is}} significance difference between low PE and high PE portfolio <b>stock</b> <b>return</b> in short term (holding period of 6 months) but there is no significance difference between both portfolio <b>stock</b> <b>return</b> if they are hold for one, two, three, and four years.

The endogenous variables {{in this study are}} <b>stock</b> <b>returns</b> and trading volume while the exogenous variables are inflation, exchange rates and interest rates. The sample used in this research is secondary data of JCI closing price, trading volume, inflation, exchange rates, and interest rates on the period from 2006 to 2015. Using Eviews 8, methods of analysis used in this study include stationary test, lag order selection criteria, multivariate cointegration tests: Johansen Cointegration Test, VECM estimation, t-statistical tests, F-statistical test, coefficient of determination (R²), impulse response analysis, variance decomposition analysis and granger causality test.
