30|$|The Braive and BK drying {{recorder}} is {{an instrument}} frequently {{employed in the}} coatings industry to measure the drying performance of a paint film operated with different lengths of a test strip; hence the two names used to denote it. This recorder consists of hemispherically ended needles, moving {{along the length of}} the test strip, which is made from plain glass and coated with a thin film. The drying characteristics of paint film are classified into four stages: the paint flows together (wet-edge time), the paint begins to polymerise (dust-free time), surface dries and finally lines become no longer visible on the film (total drying or through drying time) (Miccichè et al. 2005 a). However, Klaasen et al. classified the drying performance into three phases: open time (a <b>scratch</b> <b>line</b> traced by a pin closes up), dust free time (pin leaves a visible scratchy line, partially closed) and tack free time (a <b>scratch</b> <b>line</b> does not close) (Klaasen & van der Leeuw 2006). Clearly, assessing the drying of film suffers from subjective evaluation.|$|E

40|$|The {{archives}} of motion pictures represent {{an important part}} of precious cultural heritage. But unfortunately, these collections of cinematography are vulnerable to different types of distortions; specially, the effect caused by chemical support on which they are recorded becomes unstable with time, unless they are stored at low temperature. Some defects on colour movies, such as colour fading, are irreversible and hence it is beyond the capability of photochemical restoration process. Though the spatial colour algorithms, like ACE and Retinex, provide helpful solution for restoration of degraded films, there are some challenges associated with these algorithms. Firstly, they work well if the colour degradation takes place mainly along the axes of the colour space. If, instead, the degradation has resulted in an increased correlation between the colour channels, they do not perform so well. Secondly, spatial colour algorithms tend to emphasize all details in the images, including defects such as dust and scratches. This may also influence the way the algorithm restores the colours in the regions surrounding the defect. And, finally, the algorithms are inherently computationally expensive. We propose here an automatic colour correction method which eventually automates the colour fading restoration process. The proposed method uses the STRESS model - an automatic image enhancement technique that deals with correcting colour images according to the Human Visual System. We also propose an efficient preprocessing technique which will be applied to the degraded images in prior to apply STRESS algorithm. The preprocessing technique, which includes Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and some sort of saturation enhancement, will ultimately make the resulting image more appealing and acceptable to Human Visual System. We also presented a comparison scenario in case of processing time for frames between our method with STRESS and the ACE alogorithm. It is worth to mention that our method outperforms the method with ACE in case of processing time of the frames. Besides this, we depicted the comparison in case of maintainig the shape of histogram while covering the whole dynamic range between our suggested method and ACE. Since the spatial colour algorithms do not preserve some basic properties like the mean saturation and lightness value of the preprocessed image, we offered a very effective postprocessing method for preserving them. This method helps to produce pleasant final image by maintaining the expected saturation and lightness value. Apart from colour degradation, <b>scratch</b> <b>line</b> is another source of degradation in case of old movies. We have put an effort to analyze this problem and tested existing algorithm on our test movies to remove <b>scratch</b> <b>line</b> from the frames of the movies. Since, our main focus is on correcting the colour of the frames, we discussed this <b>scratch</b> <b>line</b> problem as an option and showed the effect of applying this <b>scratch</b> <b>line</b> removal algorithm on colour correction performance. We went beyond the spatial domain of the frames and extended our algorithm and implemented it on the temporal domain as well. We were able to achieve 80 percent reduction of the computational time for processing each frame in the temporal domain comparing to the processing time in the spatial domain for single frame. The implementation and achieved performance of our algorithm in case of both the spatial and temporal domain of the frames of old motion pictures were a great success in case of achieveing reduction of processing time comparing with existing algorithm, ACE and the colour correction result is also at a good acceptable stage from the Human Visual System...|$|E

In addition to these costs, there were the familiar costs of faculty professional development time and many expenses associated with content research, selection, capture, analysis, and digitization.

I explore through the lens of cultural geography the racialized landscapes of the real and symbolic American South and the real, symbolic and imaginary black territorial frontier. Borrowing perspectives from cultural and critical race studies, I aim to show the theoretical and practical significance of contemporary literary representations of an almost forgotten historical past. ^ Chapter I traces the sites of history, memory and imagination in migration and frontier narratives of enslaved and newly freed black people in the Oklahoma Territory. Chapter II addresses an oppositional narrative of masculinity in frontier narratives depicted in Standing at the <b>Scratch</b> <b>Line</b> by Guy Johnson. Chapter III examines how the black frontier landscape can be created and recreated across three generations who endure racial threats, violence and the razing of Greenwood during the Tulsa Riot of 1921 in Magic City by Jewell Parker Rhodes. Chapter IV scrutinizes the construction of black frontier subjects and exclusive black communities in Paradise by Toni Morrison. ^ My dissertation seeks to add to and expand the literary studies of migration and frontier narratives, taking into account two popular novels alongside a more academically recognized novel. The selected novels mobilize very different resources, but collectively offer insights into black frontier identities and settlements as sites of a past, present and future African American collective consciousness. ...|$|E

30|$|In {{the past}} studies of {{mechanical}} force nanolithography [15 – 17, 22, 23], tip plowing causes {{a significant reduction}} in the practical linewidth resolution, with cantilever torsion producing edge irregularities or sidewalls of piled up debris on each side of a <b>scratch</b> <b>line.</b> The edge irregularities can be overcome on SEBS films with hexagonal-spherical microstructure by using ATHN manual procedures [19]; while the hammering process and overall operation are very difficult, being limited to hammering individual lines in any single step of the procedure. This costs much time, and it is impossible to hammer out duplicate identical patterns forever. However, the improved automatic method for hammering nanolithography solves these mentioned problems, which saves much time in fabricating complex patterns. A complicated pattern can be completed in less than ten minutes depending on the predesigned program, and the linewidth precision and the success rate can also be significantly improved. In addition, the improved automatic method has a good reproducibility and repeatability; the corresponding design program can be hammered repeatedly to duplicate the same patterns for many times, and the pattern size can also be changed easily through adjusting the program parameters. This new automatic hammering method overcomes some common drawbacks of previous AFM nanolithography methods [15 – 17, 22, 23], such as expertise operating skill, expensive diamond tips, tip wearing, and low efficiency. Most importantly, {{it is well known that}} the existence (or absence) of a spot of the local indentation can represent ‘ 0 ’ or ‘ 1 ’ of a digital mode in a data storage context. The preexisted dot array pattern and shape memory effect of this block copolymer media therefore offer particular applicability in the field of high density data storage should we are able to selectively indent dot-array patterns at predefined positions using this newly developed auto-hammering method, which will be reported later. The limitation of the present hammering nanolithography is that the writing media has to be the specially tailored block copolymer films.|$|E

40|$|<b>Line</b> <b>scratches</b> {{are common}} {{artefacts}} in old motion pictures that may produce a very annoying {{effect on the}} viewer. In this paper, we will introduce a new method for fast detection and high quality restoration {{of this kind of}} degradation. Our detection method relies on the statistical characteristics of the intensity of pixels in the scratched areas of frames. For high quality restoration of the scratches we use a mixed adaptive stochastic AR-Median model to restore the scratched areas. The proposed detection algorithm is fast and more efficient compared to the other available approaches. The main contribution of our restoration algorithm is its ability to jointly adapt the image model to the data and concurrently restore the missing pixels. only to the scratched parts of the images. So it is necessary to detect the positions of the scratched pixels by a so-called detection algorithm, before applying any restoration algorithm. The main problem in the detection of <b>line</b> <b>scratches</b> is their similarity to vertical features of the image. In some cases even for a human observer it may be hard to distinguish between a <b>line</b> <b>scratch</b> and a vertical feature (e. g., in Fig. 1 look at the <b>line</b> <b>scratch</b> in the image near the door edge and its similarity to the door frame).

40|$|Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is an {{infectious}} disorder that {{begins in the}} skin but classically spreads to the adjacent lymph nodes. Bartonella henselae is the predominant but not the sole cause of CSD; in 1995, Clarridge et al. isolated a new Bartonella species. 1 Bartonella species have been characterized as arthropod-transmitted haemotropic Gram-negative bacteria of small mammals, fish and birds. Human exposure to Bartonella occurs after contact with a cat. 2 The micro-organism enters the skin through a scratch or previous site of injury. 3 – 5 CSD begins with a papule or pustule that develops in 3 – 14 days along the initial <b>scratch</b> <b>line.</b> These papules and pustules typically develop {{within a few days}} of the scratch. This stage of disease is followed 5 – 50 days later by the development of a regional lymphadenopathy (> 90 % of patients) in nodes proximal to the scratch. CSD is a self-limiting condition and normally resolves without treatment. Patients may have fever, headache and malaise but most patients generally feel well. A few patients with CSD demonstrate unusual presentations. They develop lesions in other locations that present more serious health concerns. Atypical manifestations of CSD include tonsillitis, encephalitis, cerebral arthritis, granulomatous hepatitis, osteolysis, pneumonia bacillary angiomatosis and oculoglandular syndrome of Parinaud. 6, 7 We describe an atypical presentation of CSD. A 40 -year-old man presented a large painless erosion on the distal shaft of the penis, lymphadenopathy of both groins and axilla, fever (38 °C), headache and malaise (Fig. 1). The serologic tests specific for syphilis, hepatitis B and C, and human immunodeficiency virus were normal. Other causes of lymphadenopathy were negative, too. Laboratory tests indicated increased values of erythrosedimentation rate, white blood cell count, aspartate-aminotransferase and alanine-aminotransferase. Two to three days later, the chancre was resolved while suppurative lymphadenitis of the right groin appeared. The culture of the fine needle aspiration from the right groin lymph node was negative for fungal and bacterial infections.

Eventually, fewer and fewer <b>scratch</b> <b>lines</b> are present with most touching diamond pushing deformed pad around. Because there are only a handful of diamond grits that are engaged in cutting pad, the number of working crystals can increased substantially by improving the leveling of diamond tips. This improvement can increase the longevity of diamond disks that paves the way for future CMP of 18 inches wafers scheduled to make the debut in 2012...|$|R
