5|$|Fighting {{continued}} to erupt in games McGraw managed. During a brawl that erupted {{during a game}} against the Detroit Tigers on August 21, 1901, McGinnity <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> umpire Tom Connolly. McGinnity was arrested for the incident and permanently suspended by AL president Ban Johnson, who wanted there to be no fighting in AL games. Johnson later cut the suspension down to 12 days after McGinnity apologized. McGinnity compiled a 26–20 record for the 1901 Orioles, and his 48 games, 39 complete games, and 382 innings pitched led the AL.|$|E
5|$|Leigh Leigh, born Leigh Rennea Mears, was a 14-year-old {{girl from}} Fern Bay, {{on the east}} coast of Australia, who was murdered on November 3, 1989. While {{attending}} a 16-year-old boy's birthday party at Stockton Beach, Leigh was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on the beach that a reviewing judge later called non-consensual. After being kicked and <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> by the group, Leigh left the party. Her naked body was found in the sand dunes nearby the following morning, with severe genital damage and a crushed skull.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was popular}} with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was {{frequently}} involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures {{should not be considered}} role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness {{to become one of the}} NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.|$|E

5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E

25|$|Purificatory {{measures}} such as fasting, sexual abstention, bathing, and (especially in the pre-Spanish past) confession generally precede major ritual events. In 16th-century Yucatán, purification (exorcism of evil spirits) often represented a ritual's initial phase. The bloodletting-rituals (see below) may also have had a purificatory function. More generally, purification is needed before entering areas inhabited by deities. In present-day Yucatán, for example, it is customary to drink standing water from a rock depression at the first opportunity upon entering the forest. The water is then <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and thus renders the individual 'virginal', free {{to carry out the}} business of humankind in the sacred forest.|$|E
25|$|The Pinkertons, too, {{wished to}} surrender. At 5:00p.m., they raised a white flag and two agents {{asked to speak}} with the strikers. O'Donnell {{guaranteed}} them safe passage out of town. Upon arrival, their arms were stripped from them. With heads uncovered, to distinguish them from the mill hands, they passed along between two rows of guards armed with Winchesters. As the Pinkertons crossed the grounds of the mill, the crowd formed a gauntlet through which the agents passed. Men and women threw sand and stones at the Pinkerton agents, <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> them and beat them. Several Pinkertons were clubbed into unconsciousness. Members of the crowd ransacked the barges, then burned them to the waterline.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, a {{numerical}} design method for high-performance sports spats was proposed. The effect of sports <b>spats</b> <b>on</b> {{the human body}} during running motions was calculated. An anisotropic hyperelastic model considering stress softening was implemented to reproduce the mechanical characteristics of the sports spats fabric. Also, cyclic tensile loading tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical characteristics of the sports spats fabric, which was composed of tricot fiber. The stiffness changed with loading direction, and the stiffness was softened depending on previous maximum stretch. The material parameters of the sports spats were identified using the cyclic loading test results. The theoretical calculations showed good agreement with experimental results. The anisotropic hyperelastic model was applied to a 3 D-CG human model and running motion data were also introduced into the human model. The proposed numerical design method enabled calculation of the stress induced by the sports spats during running motions. Also, the joint torque generated in each knee was calculated using the stress calculation. The effect of high-performance sports <b>spats</b> <b>on</b> the human body was thus evaluated numerically...|$|R

25|$|In 1210, a {{delegation}} {{arrived at the}} court of Genghis Khan (r. 1206-27) to proclaim the ascension of Wanyan Yongji to the Jin throne and demanded the submission of the Mongols as a vassal state. Because the Jurchens defeated the powerful steppe nomads and allied with the Keraites and the Tatars, they claimed sovereignty over all the tribes of the steppe. High court officials in the Jin government defected to the Mongols and urged Genghis Khan to attack the Jin dynasty. But fearful of a trap or some other nefarious scheme, Genghis Khan refused. Upon receiving the order to demonstrate submission, Genghis Khan reportedly turned {{to the south and}} <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> the ground; then he mounted his horse, and rode toward the north, leaving the stunned envoy choking in his dust. His defiance of the Jin envoys was tantamount to a declaration of war between the Mongols and Jurchens.|$|E
25|$|La Dolce Vita broke all {{box office}} records. Despite scalpers selling tickets at 1000 lire, crowds queued {{in line for}} hours to see an “immoral movie” before the censors banned it. At an {{exclusive}} Milan screening on 5 February 1960, one outraged patron <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> Fellini while others hurled insults. Denounced in parliament by right-wing conservatives, undersecretary Domenico Magrì of the Christian Democrats demanded tolerance for the film’s controversial themes. The Vatican's official press organ, l'Osservatore Romano, lobbied for censorship while the Board of Roman Parish Priests and the Genealogical Board of Italian Nobility attacked the film. In one documented instance involving favourable reviews written by the Jesuits of San Fedele, defending La Dolce Vita had severe consequences. In competition at Cannes alongside Antonioni’s L’Avventura, the film won the Palme d'Or awarded by presiding juror Georges Simenon. The Belgian writer was promptly “hissed at” by the disapproving festival crowd.|$|E

A law to create a new offence of Mafia conspiracy, and confiscate Mafia assets was introduced by Pio La Torre but it had been stalled in parliament for two years, La Torre was murdered 30 April 1982. In May 1982, the Italian government sent Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, a general of the Italian Carabinieri, to Sicily with orders to crush the Mafia. However, not long after arriving, on 3 September 1982, the General was gunned down in the city centre, his young wife by his side. Sicilians rose up in outrage. Outside the church, the politicians who attended were jeered and <b>spat</b> <b>on,</b> and blamed by Sicilians for tolerating the Mafia for so long. In response, the Italian government finally offered investigators the backing they needed, and Pio La Torre's law was passed 10 days later.|$|E
25|$|From one rivalry to the other, it {{had been}} {{simmering}} for some time between Mick Foley and Randy Orton.

In December 2003, Foley returned as the replacement for Steve Austin as Raw co-general manager and gave himself a shot at Orton's Intercontinental Championship, but {{he walked out of the}} match and would not face Orton even after the champion <b>spat</b> <b>on</b> his face. In January 2004, a furious Austin declared that Foley would be entered in the Royal Rumble match and he expected him to return and wrestle, which he did by eliminating Orton (and himself) from the match. Foley was later joined by The Rock in the feud, and the reformed Rock 'n' Sock Connection challenged Orton, Batista, and Flair to a handicap tag team match at WrestleMania.|$|E
