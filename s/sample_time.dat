During the study, the most widespread surface melt on record for the past 120 years was observed in Greenland; [...] on 12 July 2012, unfrozen water was present on almost the entire ice sheet surface (98.6%). The findings indicate that methanotrophs {{could serve as a}} biological methane sink in the subglacial ecosystem, and the region was, at least during the <b>sample</b> <b>time,</b> a source of atmospheric methane. Scaled dissolved methane flux during the 4 months of the summer melt season was estimated at 990 Mg CH4. Because the Russell-Leverett Glacier is representative of similar Greenland outlet glaciers, the researchers concluded that the Greenland Ice Sheet may represent a significant global methane source. A study in 2016 concluded that methane clathrates may exist below Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheets, based on past evidence.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [73]- 75) Instead {{of using}} the trial-and-error approach, this thesis proposes a systematic procedure of a fuzzy controller design. In this procedure, a symmetric decision table is decided by the sliding mode approach first Then, two scaling factors, Kj and K 2, are adjusted {{with the aid of}} the phase plane portraits. Since the problem which always comes with the sliding mode control is the control discontinuity, or the chattering, a more precise symmetric decision table is used in this paper to smooth out the chattering in a thin boundary layer neighboring the switching surface. The simulation results indicate that the suggested design procedure improves the stability of a system with nonlinearity or with disturbance. In digital control systems, a proper <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> is essential to the desired <b>time</b> response. A <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> too small or a <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> too big will affect the system seriously. A proper range of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> for a fuzzy control system can be chosen. In the sliding-mode-aided fuzzy control system design, a proper <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> is deeply related to the scaling factor, K 2. In addition to introducing the relation between the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and K 2, this paper offers a method to choose the values of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and K 2 which is easily implemented and also makes the system stable.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{bilinear}} transform, or first order diagonal Padé approximation to the matrix exponential, preserves quadratic Lyapunov functions between continuous-time and corresponding discrete-time linear time invariant (LTI) systems, regardless of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time.</b> The analagous result also holds for switched linear systems. In this note we show that, for any <b>sampling</b> <b>time,</b> diagonal Padé approximations of any order preserve quadratic Lyapunov functions for LTI systems and switched linear systems. Also, for a certain type of switching system where a quadratic Lyapunov function does not necessarily exist, yet the system is stable, we show that certain even ordered diagonal Padé transformations also preserve stability regardless of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time.</b> Other Padé approximations also preserve stability provided the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> is less than a readily computable upper bound. ...|$|R
30|$|Depending on the {{processing}} speed, {{the processing}} phase can partially or completely happen {{in parallel with}} the <b>sampling</b> phase. The <b>time</b> used for collecting samples from the air {{is referred to as}} the <b>sampling</b> <b>time,</b> while the time required by the processing phase in addition to the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> {{is referred to as the}} processing time. The sensing efficiency is then defined as the ratio of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and the summation of the <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> and the processing time. During the processing <b>time,</b> the <b>sampling</b> of the wireless medium is put onto hold, which means that the sensing engine is ‘blind’. It is possible that a number of transient signals are missed during this period. The <b>time</b> interval when <b>sampling</b> activity is put onto hold is referred to as the blind time. Ideally, the blind time should be reduced to zero, meaning 100 % sensing efficiency to achieve seamless detection.|$|R
