50|$|Since {{the law was}} {{approved}} in 2009 until abrogation of the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to a communication service in 2013, only one user has been sentenced to suspension (for 15 days) plus fined for EUR 600. The sentence never applied because of the abrogation some days after.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 July 2013, the French Ministry of Culture {{published}} official decree No. 0157, removing {{from the}} law [...] "the additional misdemeanor punishable by <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to a communication service." [...] allegedly because [...] "the three strikes mechanism had failed to benefit authorized services as promised". The Minister explained that the stricter copyright policy of the French Government would be revised from going after the end-user to taking punitive sanctions against companies who provide web hosting and telecom infrastructure services which allow copyright infringement to occur. Nevertheless, the fines against users found to be sharing unauthorized content remained standing ("up to EUR 1500 in cases of gross negligence"), and ISPs are still required to provide details to identify them.|$|E
50|$|The {{part of the}} HADOPI {{law that}} allowed for <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{internet}} <b>access</b> to a repeat infringer was revoked on 8 July 2013 by the French government because that penalty {{was considered to be}} disproportionate. The power to impose fines or other sanctions on repeat infringers remains in effect.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 October 2015, Sherwood Forester {{was working}} a West Coast Railway Company special through Doncaster {{when it was}} noticed that its TPWS (Train Protection and Warning System) had been {{isolated}} by the footplate crew. Previously, isolation of TPWS on a WCRC-operated loco had been {{a factor in the}} Wootton Bassett SPAD incident and the resultant <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> WCRC's <b>access</b> to the network. As a result, in November 2015 a further prohibition notice was issued to WCRC by the ORR, suspending further steam services operated by them.|$|R
50|$|In April 2015 the Amazonas {{government}} {{launched a}} campaign for Rural Environmental Registration in the town, coordinated by the Ministry of the Environment (SEMA) and executed by the Amazonas Institute of Environmental Protection (IPAAM).The purpose was to ensure that owners or possessors of rural property preserve 80% of that property.If they exceeded 20% clearance they had to replant to ensure forest regeneration.Property owners who registered would receive an environmental license, <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> fines and <b>access</b> to credit and financing.|$|R
50|$|Grandfield was the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) {{spokesman}} when in June 2005 {{an international}} aid worker {{was shot in}} Indonesia's tsunami-hit Aceh province, leading to temporary <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> aid worker <b>access.</b> In December 2005, Grandfield warned that the new tsunami warning technology would only save lives if it was combined with a community based communication network. In January 2006, Grandfield commented on the effective use of aid funds in relation to fishing boat increases that might threaten fish stocks.|$|R
40|$|The export-oriented garment {{industry}} in Madagascar has displayed robust growth, thus both {{contributing to the}} economy and creating formal employment opportunities. However, it experienced a critical situation after the political turmoil that occurred in 2009. Our investigation using the trade data demonstrates that <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> duty-free <b>access</b> to the US market (AGOA) resulting from the turmoil had a greater impact on exports, 64 %– 78 % reduction, than the turmoil itself. Our original factory-level data demonstrates that AGOA suspension increased the probability of closure by 57. 8 % for the factories supplying exclusively to US market, and reduced 6405 jobs for low-skilled positions during the post turmoil period. The factory-level adverse impacts are much less than those on export value at the industry level because of the maintained duty-free access to EU, which has provided an alternative market. It suggests that if EU also had cancelled duty-free access, adverse impacts would have been enormous. Given the general pattern of comparative advantage in low-income countries, unplanned cancellation <b>of</b> duty-free <b>access</b> for them hurts labor-intensive industries and low-skilled workers...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} form {{of transmission}} {{of knowledge about}} the Spanish nation is based on the continuous telling of stories in which the nation features as a suprahistorical, perennial entity. Myths of national origin, golden-age legends, and epics of national heroes are some of these stories. This mode <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to knowledge assumes a <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief for the audience, and precludes other attempts to comprehend the nation through scientific research. Subjective national identities constructed upon such <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief have a tendency to reify, personify or even deify the nation. In the struggle between mythic and objective knowledge, the question of authenticity becomes a hotly contested arena. This paper attempts to address questions of mythical national representation in Spanish films of 1975 - 2000...|$|R

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that a suspension in 1930 would have decreased {{the severity of the}} Great Depression. More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses. Our statistical evidence indicates a 25 percent increase in the probability that an average bank in the two states remains open with the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments. The <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreases noteholders' losses by about 20 cents per dollar of notes. Bank failures; Banks and banking - History; Banks and banking, Central...|$|R

If there is a supply shock to the backing commodity, the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the commodity standard may be desirable in terms of stabilisation of production and consumption. By representing a credible commitment to return to the commodity standard, the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> cash payments maintains the value and circulation of money.

50|$|<b>Suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{judgment}} is a cognitive process and a rational {{state of mind}} in which one withholds judgments, particularly on the drawing of moral or ethical conclusions. The opposite <b>of</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{judgment is}} premature judgment, usually shortened to prejudice. While prejudgment involves drawing a conclusion or making a judgment before having the information relevant to such a judgment, <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> judgment involves waiting for all the facts before making a decision.|$|R
40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2. Through this process, I argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be determined with sufficient consideration of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing reoffending...|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief or willing <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief {{has been}} defined as a {{willingness}} to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a [...] "human interest and a semblance of truth" [...] into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility <b>of</b> the narrative. <b>Suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief.|$|R
