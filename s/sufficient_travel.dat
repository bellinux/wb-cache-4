40|$|It is {{well known}} among HOV {{practitioners}} {{that the success of}} a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in motivating people to shift to HOVs depends on maintaining a travel time differential between it and the adjacent general purpose lanes. This differential exists only if there is continuing delay on the general purpose lanes. The paradox inherent in this requirement – that HOV lanes as a congestion reduction measure require the continuance of congestion – is rarely noted. Because of this requirement for continuing congestion, {{it is not clear that}} construction of an HOV lane will always reduce delay or vehicle emissions more than construction of a general purpose lane. The objective of this research was to determine the circumstances in which this would be the case. The hypothesis was that such circumstances would be quite limited, and this proved to be the case. A model was developed to calculate person-delay and emissions for four alternatives: add an HOV lane, add a general purpose lane, convert an existing lane to an HOV lane, and do nothing. The model required relatively few inputs: the beginning and ending time of the congested period, the time of the maximum delay, the length of the maximum delay, the number of lanes and the capacity per lane, the proportion of HOVs, and the average occupancy of HOVs and non-HOVs (hereafter referred to as LOV 3 for low occupant vehicles). Application of the model in typical situations showed that if the initial proportion of HOVs is. 15 or greater, adding an HOV lane would eliminate or substantially reduce delay. However, in a wide range of such situations, adding a general purpose lane would be even more effective. Only if the initial delay is long and the proportion of HOVs falls in a rather narrow range would an added HOV lane be more effective. In these cases the proportion of HOVs must be such that it allows good utilization of the HOV lane while maintaining a <b>sufficient</b> <b>travel</b> time differential to motivate a shift to HOVs...|$|E
40|$|Advisors: Tao Xu. Committee members: Elizabeth Gaillard; Di-Jia Liu; Lee Sunderlin; Chong Zheng. This {{dissertation}} investigates {{two separate}} clean energy applications, emphasizing material applications and electrochemistry techniques. The first section examines environmentally friendly alternatives for water purification to avoid carcinogenic by-products. To diminish such possibilities, research has shifted towards photoelectrochemical catalysts, such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2), because pure TiO 2 has limited absorption in the ultraviolet region. Therefore, Ti 3 +, a self-dopant, {{has become an}} attractive candidate for environmentally friendly alternatives. This dissertation demonstrates a novel oxidation procedure to form self-doped Ti 3 + in the bulk of rutile TiO 2. A brief overview of the work will be given and supporting data including material, methods, structural characterization, photocatalytic activity, and wastewater applications will be discussed. These results displayed a photoactive shift to the visible-light region due to Ti 3 + being present within {{the bulk of the}} sample, while utilizing a simple industrialization process. The second section of this dissertation investigates the clean energy application of fuel cells to decrease fossil fuel dependency. Currently, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFCs) and alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) are the leading candidates for transportation applications due to their capability of producing a high power density, operating at low temperatures, and achieving <b>sufficient</b> <b>travel</b> range between fuel refills. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode is the rate-limiting reaction for PEMFCs and AFCs versus the hydrogen oxidation reaction at the anode. Thus, the cathode requires a significantly higher electrocatalyst load of platinum (Pt), which is known to be scarce and costly. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been actively involved in developing highly active, low-cost non-PGM catalysts using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors. The second section of this dissertation examines the impact of ORR catalytic activity by MOF-based precursors with various nitrogen-containing organic ligands. The catalyst synthesis, processing, and performance evaluation in both acidic and alkaline media will be discussed. Ligand effects were investigated within MOF [...] based precursors to determine their capability of impacting PEMFC and AFC performance. These findings suggest ligands have the ability to enhance catalytic activity, further the improvements of an ORR active catalyst, and eventually replace costly Pt. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{success of}} a high {{occupancy}} vehicle lane in motivating people to shift to carpools and buses depends on maintaining a travel time differential {{between it and the}} adjacent general purpose lanes. This differential, in turn, depends on the level of continuing delay on the general purpose lanes. Therefore, it is clear that a high occupancy vehicle lane that will motivate people to shift to high occupancy vehicles will not eliminate congestion. Consequently, {{it is not clear that}} constructing a high occupancy vehicle lane will necessarily reduce delay more than construction of a general purpose lane. The objective of this research is to determine the circumstances in which this would be the case. The hypothesis is that such circumstances would be quite limited, and this proves to be the case. The intended benefits of high occupancy lanes are defined as reduced person-delay and reduced emissions. A model is developed to calculate these benefits for four alternatives add a high occupancy vehicle lane, add a general purpose lane, convert an existing lane to a high occupancy vehicle lane, and do nothing. The model takes into account the initial conditions, the dynamic nature of the travel time differential between the high occupancy vehicle lane and other lanes, and the uncertainty regarding the extent to which people will shift modes. It combines queueing theory and mode choice theory and provides a robust method for comparing alternatives using a small amount of easily observed data. Application of the model in typical situations shows that with initial delays on the order of 15 min or more, adding a high occupancy vehicle lane would provide substantial reductions in delay and some reduction in emissions. However, in a wide range of such situations, adding a general purpose lane would be even more effective. Only if the initial delay is long and the initial proportion of high occupancy vehicles falls in a rather narrow range, would an added high occupancy vehicle lane be more effective. The proportion of high occupancy vehicles must be such that it allows good utilization of the high occupancy vehicle lane while maintaining a <b>sufficient</b> <b>travel</b> time differential to motivate a shift to buses or carpools. Adding a high occupancy vehicle lane to a three lane freeway will be more effective than adding a general purpose lane only if the initial maximum delay is on the order of 35 min or more and the proportion of high occupancy vehicles is on the order of 20 %. Federal policies encourage construction of high occupancy vehicle lanes and restrict funding for general purpose lanes in areas that have not attained air quality standards. The findings of this research suggest a need to reconsider these policies. High occupancy vehicle, high occupancy vehicle lane, carpool lane, Urban Studies and Planning...|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} BMW Motorrad {{explanation of}} the duolever includes this:The advantage of this front wheel suspension on the motorcycle market at present is its torsional rigidity. The BMW Motorrad Duolever front wheel suspension is not influenced by negative forces {{in the same manner}} as a conventional telefork whose fixed and take-off tubes twist laterally as well as longitudinally during jounce/rebound and steering. Its two trailing links absorb the forces resulting from the jounce/rebound and keep the wheel carrier stable. Thus, any torsioning is excluded and the front wheel suspension is very precise. The steering commands of the rider are converted directly and the feedback from the front wheel is transparent in all driving conditions.A kinematical anti-dive effect is additionally achieved, just as for the Telelever, due to the arrangement of the trailing link bearings. While a conventional telefork during strong braking manoeuvres jounces heavily or locks, the Duolever still has <b>sufficient</b> spring <b>travel</b> remaining in this situation and therefore the rider can still brake into the corner extremely late yet directionally stable.|$|R

Instead, mobile robots in human environments need to travel to their destination safely,  keeping a comfortable distance to humans and not colliding with any obstacles along the way.

Current approaches solve this task by predicting the trajectories of humans in the scene and then planning a collision-free path. However, this requires separate components for detecting and predicting human motion and does not scale well to densely populated environments.
