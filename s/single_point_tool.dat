The machinability of the ceramic material depends on not only its physical properties but also the method of machining. For the work materials of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2, the honing is superior in cutting ability to the grinding.

The shapes of pyramids incrementally formed were truncated pyramids, twisted pyramids, stepwise pyramids, and star pyramids about 1 mm in size.

40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{the generation of}} a quasi monitoring system intended for an operator to change cutting tool during turning operation. The monitoring system uses the effects of turning variables on acoustic emission signal responses and factorial experimental design approach. In cutting op-erations, acoustic emission provides useful information concerning the tool wear condition because of the fundamental differences between its source mechanisms in the rubbing friction on the wear land of the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>tool.</b> In this study, effects of cutting speed, feed and tool condition on the acoustic emission signal are investigated using acoustic emission’s energy, amplitude, and fre-quency response and 23 factorial design for turning operation. Cutting tests were performed using high-speed steel under dry conditions. Calculated effects, standard errors at 95 % confidence level, and models governing the acoustic emission response to the cutting conditions have been generated from the acoustic emission signal responses. The generated models revealed that acoustic energy response is affected by significant interactions between cutting speed and feed, and insignificant interactions between cutting speed and tool condition, while the acoustic amplitude response is af-fected by insignificant interactions among cutting speed, feed, and tool condition. These results sug-gest that acoustic emission’s energy and amplitude responses {{could be used to}} control the cutting speed and feed during turning operation, thus prolonging the life of the cutting tool...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is part of and continuation of the work {{carried out by the}} author on the Mechanics of Power Hacksawing, on behalf of a hacksaw blade manufacturer. Process parameters which influence the metal. removal rate during power hacksawing have been identified and thus a detailed explanation of the basic sawing mechanism-suggested. Power hacksaw machine characteristics have also been investigated. The problem of blade testing is discussed. A method for assessing the blade performance is proposed which is based on metal removal rate but is independent of the machine characteristics. This could be 'used as a quality index for power hacksaw blades. This performance index is found to vary with workpiece breadth and tooth pitch. A theoretical model is used to give some explanation of this variation. iiowever, there is evidence that the gullet size and goemetry arc, more significant factors influencing the variation in blade performance with changes in the breadth of the workpiece and pitch of the blade teeth. Examinations of saw blade teeth have revealed that they have large cutting edge radii compared to the layer of metal removed, indicating that saw blades are basically blunt tools. The cutting action of tools with large cutting edge radii has been investigated and extensive simulation tests have been undertaken. From the observations of the chip formation mechanism and measurements of the relative position of the tool and machined surface during cutting, some new light is thrown upon the ploughing process. A slip-line field is proposed which qualitatively represents the assumed chip formation mechanism under steady state cutting conditions. The application of an empirical relationship between the chip tool contact length and the undeformed chip thickness in conjunction with the slipline field, provides quantitative correlation with the test results of a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>tool</b> and qualitative correlation with a hacksaw blade. </p...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the wide}} range of {{applications}} of reamers in manufacturing industries, the theoretical work in this area is very limited. An initial survey of the reaming process indicated that there was very limited work carried out in reaming. Therefore 2 avenues were investigated to improve the understanding of the reaming process [...] an experimental program to understand the reaming process and a theoretical analysis of the reaming process. Experimental work carried out has revealed that there are three components of force and torque which are developed in a reaming operation. Thrust force and cutting torque which both are constant during a reaming operation are generated as the result of material removal by the chamfer of the reamer. The chamfer section of the reamer removes material from an initially drilled hole to bring the hole to more accurate size. A rubbing component of torque is also developed as the result of contact between the helical part of the reamer and the hole. This rubbing torque {{has been found to be}} a function of the distance that the reamer has travelled into the workpiece. Rubbing action by the helical part of the reamer is performed to create a better surface finish. Two theoretical models are developed in order to predict the thrust force, cutting torque and the rubbing torque in reaming. The model developed for the cutting torque and thrust uses the variable flow stress theory of machining. In this work the reamer cutting edges are subdivided into individual cutting edge and analysed as a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>tool</b> with a cutting geometry. The model predicts the values of thrust and cutting torque for each cutting edge and the total value is obtained by multiplying the values by the number of cutting edges. This model takes into consideration parameters such as the tool geometry, cutting conditions and the work material variable flow stress properties. The rubbing model is based on the latest theories of wave formation in friction and is able to predict the values of rubbing torque in reaming. Existence of the wave has been verified using SEM analysis. The rubbing model takes into account parameters such as, tool geometry, wave size, lubrication condition and the coefficient of friction between the helical part of the reamer and the hole. Experimental work is carried out for a wide range of cutting conditions and two different work materials in order to test the validity of these models. It has been shown that the experimental and predicted values of thrust force, cutting torque and the rubbing torque are in good agreement and therefore the developed models are able to predict the cutting parameters...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} precision mechanical components such as bearings, fuel injectors, gears and hydraulic components, which are made of hardened steels, {{and have to be}} machined to a high degree of precision. Traditionally these components are being ground. Due to the development of ceramic and cubic boron nitride tools for turning this process are now being challenged by hard turning. In the metal cutting industry, machining with a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>tool</b> in heat-treated products with a hardness of above HRC 55 is normally considered as hard turning. Important factors such as quality, lead-time and cost can be improved thanks to hard turning. To ensure the quality of hard turned products, many different parameters must be considered. One of these parameters is residual stress generated in the work piece. Residual stresses have a great impact on the fatigue life of the product and must therefore be controlled. The knowledge of residual stress in terms of how it affects the component and how it is generated and measured is not widespread within the industry. In order to have a controlled implementation of hard turning in the industry, the effect of cutting conditions on the residual stresses must be clarified. In prior research there have been several reports on the improvement of the fatigue life of hard turned products. There have been several explanations for the enhanced product performance. One reason for the improved fatigue life has been {{explained by the fact that}} hard turning produces a better product in terms of roundness. Another idea is that hard turning generates an untempered martensitic layer which is harder than the bulk material and which has good wear resistance. However, most reports attribute improved fatigue life to the compressive stresses generated by hard turning. It has been suggested that the cutting conditions should be chosen on the basis of their effect on residual stress. In this work, the effect of cutting conditions impact on generated residual stresses has been measured using the X-ray diffraction method. The approach has been empirical and statistical methods have been used. The effects on residual stress from different input factors such as different cutting conditions have been investigated. It was found that the residual stress is generated in two different ways. The creation of stresses is mainly controlled by temperature on the surface and under the surface the mechanical generation is the dominating process. Both a summary table explaining how cutting parameter affects the residual stress and a program called cutting advisor have been developed. A fatigue test on bearings showed that the life can be doubled with stresses generated in hard turning...|$|E

40|$|An ultrasonic, {{vibration}} assisted diamond turning (UVADT) device {{has been}} constructed {{that allows for}} variation of vibration frequency and vibration amplitude via a direct drive actuator [1]. This device {{has been used to}} identify the relationships between the tool vibration variables and the process parameters.

This paper discusses the tool design, the experimental results, and the model used to describe the mechanism by which vibration assisted turning reduces tool wear. FINAL DESIGN / ACTIVE TOOLING Prototype vibration assisted machining (VAM) devices have been described in [1] and [2]. The tool used in this work represents an integrated tool that couples the actuators directly into the tool shank, creating a UVADT device that can now be integrated with a standard tool holder mechanism on conventional precision machine tools, shown in Figure 1. The new tool also has the distinct advantage of being adaptable to conventional or hard turning operations. The tool uses multiple PZTs actuated sequentially to achieve the desired frequency. 1 Additionally, this new integrated cutting tool / actuator system is now embeddable in other systems. For example, the compact tool has been coupled with a long-range fast-tool servo (FTS).

40|$|Most of {{the studies}} todate into the wear {{mechanisms}} associated with cutting tools have been undertaken on <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>tools</b> which invariably operate under conditions of high speed and stress. The application of PVD coatings has been claimed to confer great benefits in terms of tool life by reducing friction on the rake face and slowing down diffusion wear. Multipoint cutting tools, notably handsaws and circular saws, have been mostly neglected in these studies {{despite the fact that}} these are the basic tools used throughout many industrial environments. Wear is recognised as a serious problem in metal cutting operations and surface engineering via the application of plasma vapour (PVD) film is an established technology. It finds current applications deposited on many areas of industry, including high speed steel drilling, gear cutting and mulling. The current work is a study of the wear and failure modes of both standard and simulated wear tested bandsaw and circular saw blades. A range of PVD thin films are critiqued from both the Magnetron Sputtered and Arc Evaporated Systems. The most suitable candidate coatings are prepared for the surface engineering of multipoint cutting tools. The tool wear and failure modes are identified for the surface engineered simulated wear test specimens in order to gain a greater understanding of the benefits obtained from the application of thin films in multipoint cutting applications. The most notable benefits in cutting performance and wear behaviour were recorded at increased cutting speeds on selected coating-substrate systems. This finding was supported via an examination of the resulting tool wear and failure modes. In conclusion the optimum coating-tool systems at the more efficient cutting speeds are recommended for further work as the key to the full exploitation of surface engineered multipoint cutting tools...|$|R
