40|$|Abstract: RemoAct is a {{wearable}} depth sensing and {{projection system}} that enables interaction on many surfaces. It makes {{interaction with the}} environment more intuitive through sharing and sending data with surrounding devices by applying certain gestures. This system offers a mobile and intuitive solution for interacting using a projected surface on habitual flat surfaces. Every user has their public and private areas, where the user can create tiles on the fly and share it with others and these public tiles are shown to other users through augmented reality. Interaction is made through hand gestures, finger tracking and hand tracking. This gives the user more freedom in movement. Different experiments were conducted to calculate the accuracy and RemoAct ran against different conventional methods to compare its accuracy, time and user experience. RemoAct takes less time for two users to draw one chart. As the system enables the users to work simultaneously, it reduces the needed time, short compared to <b>successive</b> <b>drawing.</b> For gesture recognition, accuracy reached 90 - 95 %. Object recognition and face identification accuracy varied with the variation of light...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Psychological {{and social}} health of {{children}} with cancer may be severely affected by the disease and its treatment. <b>Successive</b> <b>drawing</b> by children can help them over time in terms of psychological and social adaptation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of drawing on depression in children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 7 - 12 -year-old children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. After completing Maria Kovacs' Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), 65 children who had obtained scores higher than 12 were chosen as study participants and were randomly divided into two experimental and control groups. The children {{in the experimental group}} were engaged in open painting sessions for 6 weeks. After the intervention, the CDI was completed again in both the groups. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods, such as independent t-test, paired t-test, and Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: There was {{a significant difference between the}} children's depression scores before and after the intervention in both the two groups (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that painting was effective in reducing depression in children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Therefore, painting can be used as an easy, cheap, and effective intervention by nurses to help children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Subject of Research. We {{consider}} {{the principles and}} algorithms for construction of en-route flight paths of an aircraft (airplane) in a horizontal plane for their subsequent display on the navigation situation indicators in the cockpit. Navigation situation indicatorsaredisplay devices designed {{on the basis of}} flat liquid crystal panel. Methods. Flight trajectory display by on-board multifunction indicators is performed by <b>successive</b> <b>drawing</b> of graphic primitives available in the library and defined in accordance with an array of data to display the route. An array of data is generated by on-board software complex based on the information provided in the flight task and the corresponding «Jeppesen» database or analogous one. Formation of the array is carried out by bringing the set of trajectory paths to the format of three typical trajectories described. In addition, each of the types of trajectories has a standard description of the algorithm for calculating the parameters that make up an array of data to display. Main Results. The algorithms of forming and calculating the amounts of data of routing paths required for their construction and display on the multifunction indicators applied in avionics. Practical Relevance. These novel routing algorithms for constructing trajectory paths unify algorithms of generating information for display on the navigation situation indicators and optimize a set of calculated data for flight control at the trajectory in the horizontal plane...|$|E

Subjekti so morali z avtosugestijo podoživeti štiri glavne emocije, ter jih abstraktno narisati s flumastri s pomočjo barve, črte in pike. Ugotovili smo, da je simbolizacija emocij konceptualno pogojena in in njihovo doživljanje nima odločilnega pomena. Kljub zaporednemu risanju emocij ni prišlo do interferenc med njimi. Hipotezo neodvisnosti uporabe različnih likovnih elementov od emocij smo testirali s Chi 2 -testom. Barve pomebneje diferencirajo med različnimi emocijami. Za vsako od štirih temeljnih emocij smo identificirali temeljne značilnosti njene simbolizacije. Na risbah obstaja precej podobnosti v uporabi likovnih elementov, strukturalnih značilnosti celote in shematskem prikazu dane emocije. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{ascertain}} the caracteristics of the graphic symbolization of emotions. With the help of autosuggestion the subjecthad to experience four primary emotions (joy, sorrow, anger, and fear) and draw them abstractly with fibrepen. Their means of expression were: colour, line, and dot. Drawing were analysed on the basis of a list of plasticelements and some characteristics of the whole. The list was prepared in advance. It was discovered that the symbolization of emotions is above all determined conceptually and that their experiencing is not of a crucial importance. In spite of the <b>successive</b> <b>drawing</b> of the four primary emotions there were no interferences among them. The hypothesis of the independence of the use of different plastic elements of emotions was tested with the chi 2 -test.
