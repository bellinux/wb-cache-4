30|$|A wide <b>strap</b> design, {{approximately}} 4.5  cm in width, is {{more suitable}} for women with large breasts compared to the standard width (2.5  cm) or a gel <b>strap</b> design for sports bras, {{as evidenced by the}} <b>strap</b> preference and the bra <b>strap</b> pressure data. Participants consistently perceived that the wide <b>straps</b> better cushioned the load borne by the <b>straps,</b> which is logical considering the greater surface area over which to distribute the load generated at the bra strap-shoulder interface. This was also evident in the significantly lower mean static and dynamic mean peak pressure recordings in the wider bra <b>strap</b> conditions compared to the other <b>strap</b> conditions [29]. However, although the wide <b>strap</b> design had the lowest VAS scores, no significant difference was found in <b>strap</b> discomfort among the three <b>strap</b> designs, which may also be attributed to the short durations over which the <b>straps</b> were worn.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} bra shoulder <b>strap</b> pressures, to investigate how bra <b>strap</b> cushions moderated this pressure and increased comfort, and {{to investigate the}} effects of variations in bra shoulder <b>strap</b> configuration on vertical breast motion, breast discomfort, shoulder pressures, and comfort. Methods: Fourteen healthy women (C+ bra cup size) ran on a treadmill wearing a sports bra under five <b>strap</b> conditions (no <b>straps,</b> traditional vertical alignment, crossed-back alignment, and with and without bra <b>strap</b> cushions inserted under the <b>straps).</b> Bra shoulder <b>strap</b> pressure, vertical breast displacement, breast pain, and shoulder comfort were measured during each trial. Results: Maximal pressures from 0. 83 to 2. 67 N·cm- 2 and mean pressures from 0. 52 to 1. 06 N·cm- 2 were recorded during running. The bra <b>strap</b> cushions only reduced maximal shoulder <b>strap</b> pressure in the crossed-back <b>strap</b> orientation. Vertical breast displacement was significantly less in the crossed-back orientation compared with no <b>straps,</b> and breast pain was significantly reduced in both the traditional and crossed-back orientation compared with the no <b>strap</b> condition. No significant between-condition difference was found in shoulder comfort regardless of shoulder <b>strap</b> orientation, although the crossed-back <b>strap</b> orientation resulted in significant increases in shoulder force and mean pressure values compared with the traditional <b>strap</b> orientation. Conclusion: The bra shoulder <b>strap</b> cushion was not effective in decreasing the bra shoulder <b>strap</b> pressure due to design flaws that prevented it from adequately increasing the strap–shoulder contact area. However, modifying shoulder <b>strap</b> orientation from a traditional to a crossed-back configuration could alleviate the common problem of bra shoulder <b>straps</b> slipping off {{the shoulders of the}} wearer, without decreasing the overall efficacy of the sports bra in providing breast support...|$|R

40|$|Background Bra <b>straps</b> are {{a primary}} source of {{discomfort}} during sport and exercise, particularly for women with large breasts. This study aimed to investigate the effects of altering bra <b>strap</b> orientation and design on bra <b>strap</b> comfort, pressure and breast support in women with large breasts. This is a descriptive laboratory study. Methods Bra <b>strap</b> discomfort (visual analogue scale, 0 to 10), pressure (custom-designed 10 mm 2 calibrated pressure sensor, 0. 5 to 24 kPa range, 50 Hz, S 2011, Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany, placed under the right bra <b>strap</b> at the crest of each participant 2 ̆ 7 s shoulder), preference ranking and vertical breast displacement (VBD; Optotrak Certus® motion capture system, 200 Hz, Northern Digital, Ontario, Canada) data during dynamic treadmill running and static upright standing (pressure only) were collected for 23 active women with large breasts (D+ cup size) while they wore an encapsulation sports bra with six different bra <b>strap</b> conditions (two bra <b>strap</b> orientations: vertical and cross-back; three bra <b>strap</b> designs: standard width, wide and gel). Results Bra <b>strap</b> discomfort was significantly less (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001) in the vertical compared to the cross-back <b>strap</b> orientation, which was the most preferred orientation despite {{no significant difference in}} <b>strap</b> pressure. The wide <b>strap</b> design had the lowest discomfort scores, significantly lower <b>strap</b> pressure compared to the standard width and gel <b>strap</b> designs (p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 001), and was equally the most preferred design with the gel <b>straps.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} VBD among the six <b>strap</b> conditions. Conclusions Bra <b>straps</b> that are vertically orientated and wide (approximately 4. 5 cm in width) are preferable for women with large breasts during sport and exercise to minimise bra <b>strap</b> pressure and discomfort. The addition of gel pads under bra <b>straps</b> may also decrease discomfort and prevent <b>straps</b> slipping off the shoulders, although this notion warrants further investigation...|$|R

5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood <b>strapped</b> to the performers' bodies.

Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|The {{failed attempt}} to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was {{inspired}} by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is <b>strapped</b> to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, , in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene.

30|$|The lack of {{difference}} in <b>strap</b> pressure in the two <b>strap</b> orientation conditions was {{in contrast to the}} previous study of Bowles and Steele [5] that reported higher <b>strap</b> pressures in cross-back orientated <b>straps</b> compared to vertical <b>straps</b> [5]. The mean peak pressures were of a lower range in the current study compared to those reported by Bowles and Steele [5] (current study 5.7 to 10.6 versus 11.7 to 14.9 kPa) [5], which is likely to be attributed to differences in the measurement devices (current study: one 10  mm 2 sensor versus ten 1  cm 2 sensors positioned in parallel) [5]. Ideally, it would be preferable to have the pressure sensors the same width as the bra <b>strap.</b> However, {{it is also possible that}} pressures in the cross-back orientation measured by Bowles and Steele [5] were falsely high due to overly tight <b>straps.</b> That is, the <b>straps</b> used by Bowles and Steele [5] were commercially available convertible bra <b>straps</b> of a fixed length, which did not allow for the additional length required to traverse the torso in the cross-back orientation. Tighter <b>straps</b> will cause higher <b>strap</b> pressures and more <b>strap</b> discomfort. An objective measure of <b>strap</b> tension would provide further insight into the <b>strap</b> pressure/discomfort relationship and is a suggested area of study for future research. Irrespective {{of difference}}s in <b>strap</b> tension, it is imperative that both bra manufacturers and consumers ensure that the <b>strap</b> length is sufficient for bras with a cross-back <b>strap</b> orientation, taking into consideration the wide range of women’s torso morphology.|$|R
