40|$|As {{agricultural}} {{activities in}} Sweden have ceased nowadays, {{more and more}} meadows are being overgrown and planted with forest. Since natural and managed grasslands {{are very important to}} {{a large part of the}} European butterfly fauna, it is a big threat to these species when meadowlands are being planted and overgrown as it gives them less space and is fragmenting their habitats. The <b>scarce</b> <b>heath</b> butterfly, Coenonympha hero, is one of the butterfly species that is being threatened by this, and has decreased its numbers during the past years. It is protected in Sweden, where it occurs primarily in the Värmland and Dalarna regions. The purpose of this essay is to try to explain how area size, isolation and vegetation will influence populations of <b>scarce</b> <b>heath</b> butterflies in chosen patches in the Värmland province. 55 patches where the butterfly had been observed between the years 2004 - 2009 were included in this study. The patches were divided into four different categories depending on the vegetation, and the size of each patch along with the distance to the three closest patches was measured. The data was used for statistical analyses in Excel and SAS 9. 2. Regression statistics show that there is a significant correlation between the maximum number of butterflies and the size of the patches, and between the closest patch/three closest patches set against the maximum number of butterflies. The type of vegetation seemed to have no specific importance for the butterfly populations according to this study...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporotic-associated {{vertebral}} compression fractures {{are a major}} public health concern, dwarfing even hip fractures in incidence in the United States. These fractures carry a significant morbidity and mortality burden and also represent a major growing source of consumption of <b>scarce</b> <b>heath</b> resources. Percutaneous vertebroplasty remains a commonly used and safe technique for the symptomatic treatment of {{vertebral compression}} fractures, both osteoporotic- and neoplastic-induced. By carefully selecting appropriate patients who are referred promptly, vertebroplasty can provide significant and durable pain relief over traditional conservative therapy. Recent controversies surrounding the evidence for vertebroplasty in osteoporotic-associated vertebral compression fractures are reviewed. A comprehensive step-by-step practical guide to performing vertebroplasty is then described. A brief description of patient selection, workup, as well as complications is also provided...|$|E
5000|$|In Britain, {{the species}} {{has always been}} <b>scarce,</b> {{confined}} to <b>heaths</b> in Surrey and the Isles of Scilly, where it is sometimes known as the [...] "St Martin's Ant". In the 1927 edition of British Ants: their life histories and classification, Donisthorpe gives its distribution as being confined to Ripley, Chobham, Reigate and Weybridge. In 2004 there were only four nests in Surrey. It was once found in Cornwall at Whitsand Bay but has not been recorded since 1907. In the Isles of Scilly it is found on the islands of Great Ganilly, Nornour, St Martin's and Teän.As of 2015, F. rufibarbis is now confined to one known colony on mainland Britain, nesting {{on the edge of}} a Heath, the location is kept a closely guarded secret due to the risk posed by curious members of the public. However the nest is also at risk from F. sanguinea, a slavemaker ant, which currently nests only a few hundred meters away.|$|R
