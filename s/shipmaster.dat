5|$|Very {{was born}} on August 28, 1813, in Salem, Massachusetts and {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} at sea. He was the oldest of six children, born out of wedlock to two first cousins; his sister Lydia also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her atheistic beliefs known to all. She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and not a legal one. His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the War of 1812 and was held in Nova Scotia for a time by the British as a prisoner of war. When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a <b>shipmaster,</b> took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a cabin boy on a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. His father died on the return trip, apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The <b>shipmaster</b> may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the {{shipyard}} goes back to year 1732, when Turku merchants Esaias Wechter and Henric Rungeen founded a repair yard on east bank of river Aura, next to Korppolaismäki. Manager of the company was Vasa-born <b>shipmaster</b> Israel Hansson. At the beginning the company focused on repairing and maintaining vessels of the local shipowners, but it also ordered ships from Ostrobothnian shipbuilders. One of such vessels was Södra Finlands Wapn, which was owned jointly by Hansson, Rungeen, Wechter and few others. The ship operated successfully between Finland and Spain in 1732–1738, bringing every time at least 4000barrels of salt to Turku.|$|E

In Halo 3, 'Vadum is <b>Shipmaster</b> of the flagship Shadow of Intent, and supports Cortana's plan to follow Truth to the Ark.

500|$|American {{ichthyologist}} David Starr Jordan {{described the}} goblin shark in an 1898 issue of Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, recognizing the peculiar fish {{not only as}} a new species, but also a new genus and family. He based his account on an immature male [...] long caught in Sagami Bay near Yokohama, Japan. The specimen had been acquired by <b>shipmaster</b> and naturalist Alan Owston, who had given it to Professor Kakichi Mitsukuri at the University of Tokyo, who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark Mitsukurina owstoni in honor of these two men. The common name [...] "goblin shark" [...] is a translation of its old Japanese name tenguzame, a tengu being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face. Another name for this species is elfin shark.|$|E

500|$|Halo Wars 2 {{takes place}} in the science fiction {{universe}} of the Halo series, during the 26th century. The game is set in 2559, 28 years after the events of Halo Wars and shortly after the events of [...] Halo Wars closes with the crew of the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire entering cryosleep and drifting into space. Since that event, the war between humanity and the military alien alliance known as the Covenant has ended, and the Spirit of Fire has been declared lost with all hands. While the Spirit of Fire is adrift in space, the ship's artificial intelligence (AI) Serina (Courtenay Taylor) terminates herself before succumbing to rampancy, a terminal state. Captain James Cutter (Gideon Emery), Professor Anders (Faye Kingslee), and the crew aboard Spirit of Fire wake from cryosleep at the Ark, a Forerunner installation that manufactured the Halo rings. Isabel (Erika Soto) is a UNSC logistics AI operating at a research facility on the Ark when an alien faction known as the Banished invades the installation. The Banished are led by the Brute warlord Atriox (John DiMaggio) and rose to power following the Covenant's demise. Serving under Atriox are the Brute general Decimus and the Elite <b>Shipmaster</b> Let 'Volir (Darin De Paul) who reluctantly sided with the Banished in exchange for fuel for his ship and crew.|$|E

Jordan and Snyder described the species as Pristiurus eastmani in a 1904 volume of the scientific journal Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. Later authors have recognized Pristiurus as a junior synonym of Galeus.

2500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{report on}} 2 March 1960 described how a tsunami {{was reported to}} have come ashore shortly after the earthquake, stating [...] "A tidal wave curled in across the white beaches and lanced [...] into the town. The city dock was cut in two, a Spanish <b>shipmaster</b> radioed." [...] A tsunami disaster was later refuted by a report from the American Iron and Steel Institute after a team of earthquake engineers, including Ray W. Clough from the University of California, Berkeley, surveyed the damage and building failures throughout the Agadir area in March 1960. The report of their findings stated that the port facilities suffered damage due to fairly uniform subsidence in the harbor area that was responsible for knocking over five large cranes, but no evidence of nor any reliable witness to large waves was found, {{with the exception of a}} Dutch freighter crew who stated that large swells in the harbor did cause the separation of their mooring lines at the time of the earthquake. A report in a 1964 issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America also denied the existence of a destructive tsunami because of a lack of evidence from a nearby tide gauge.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1847 Captain John Bush, of the Kirkcaldy and London Shipping Company, married Margaret Greig, {{daughter}} of a <b>shipmaster,</b> at the pier. In 1849 a lifebuoy and rope were provided at the pier head for swimmers who got into difficulty. A ladder leading into the sea was provided for swimmers, {{in addition to the}} stairs which were for use by steamboat passengers. By the 1850s the pier was falling into disrepair, but it was still popular with bathers, and early-morning trains were advertised allowing for a swim before work. There was a gymnasium {{at the head of the}} pier, and the Forth Swimming Club was based there from its inception in 1850. They organised swimming competitions, including [...] "fast swimming" [...] and [...] "long diving" [...] which were, respectively, a [...] race and an underwater endurance contest. [...] "Deep diving" [...] involved retrieving objects from the bottom in [...] of water then surfacing through a floating lifebuoy. A longer race was from Newhaven harbour to the Chain Pier, a distance of [...] In 1864 the winning time was 11 minutes and 35 seconds. Two floating platforms were moored east of the pier; the closer one was about [...] out. In July 1858 an attempt was made to restart ferry services from the pier; this caused annoyance to swimmers.|$|E
