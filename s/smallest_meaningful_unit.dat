Free morphemes can occur on their own whereas bound morphemes must be affixed to a base or root word. Morphological awareness refers to the ability to consciously consider and manipulate the morphemes within words, that is, the explicit understanding of the relation between base/root words and related words with affixes. Morphological awareness has been found to predict vocabulary, reading comprehension, and spelling performance even after differences in related skills like phonological (speech sound) awareness has been taken into account.

40|$|Video {{segmentation}} is {{the process}} of dividing a sequence of frames into <b>smaller</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>units</b> that represent information at the scene level. This process serves as a fundamental step towards any further analysis on video frames for content analysis. In the past, several statistical methods that compare frame differences have been published in literature and a range of similarity measures between frames based on gray-scale intensity, colour and texture have been proposed. On the basis of these measures, one is able to find sharp peaks in plots to determine frame boundaries where the scene is supposed to change. Unfortunately, the identification of correct boundaries is invariably linked to the determination of a correct threshold above which peaks represent genuine scene changes. If the threshold is not optimally set, then a large number of false alarms will result. In this paper we investigate a method of automatically determining the number of scenes in a given video sequence, and therefore automating the process of threshold determination. Our methodology is based on the use of fuzzy clustering of frames that are indexed using texture features. Cluster validity is determined by Davies Bouldin index and a newly proposed temporal validity index. The experimental results show that the proposed method offers a powerful methodology for determining the correct number of scenes and their boundaries in raw video sequences. 1...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of parole supervision {{is to help}} parolees live a more pro-social life in the community, that is, to desist from committing crime. Identifying factors that are perceived by parole officers and parolees {{to be important in}} crime desistance could improve success in parole supervision and the understanding of crime desistance. Thirty-four parole officers and 61 parolees from six major cities in western Canada completed a 30 item survey questionnaire on how much (on a five-point rating scale) they agree or disagree with different markers for crime desistance. In a semi-structured interview, the same participants were also asked to respond to the general question of what they would consider to be important markers for crime desistance. The interview responses were content analyzed using the <b>smallest</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>unit</b> of analysis. Parolees and parole officers generally agreed on most factors related to crime desistance. Whereas parolees recognized important criminogenic and protective factors key to crime desistance when asked by way of the questionnaire, they tended, when interviewed, to place more emphasis on subjective and experiential factors such as motivation and encouragement than on external factors such as peer group and employment. Parole officers ’ views tended to be more balanced. The similarities in the views of parole officers and parolees provide further support for the use of current approaches in parole supervision (Bonta & Cormier, 1999). However, parole officers should also pay attention to the parolees ’ personal and subjective views of what they consider to be important to them in crime desistance, an important responsivity factor. For case management and service delivery in the community, parole officers with Correctional Service Canada use a general framework that includes a clear understanding of an offender’s criminogenic needs or factors related to offending (Bonta & Cormier, 1999). Parole officers in many other jurisdictions use similar approaches. Although this approach is supported by empirical research, its use in parole supervision has been criticized recently for focusing too much on criminogenic factor...|$|E

These units are called acoustic events and are phonologically meaningful as well as recognizable from speech signals. Acoustic events form a phonologically incomplete representation as compared to distinctive features. This problem may partly be overcome by incorporating phonological constraints. Currently, 24 binary events describing manner and place of articulation, vowel quality and voicing are used to recognize all German phonemes. Phoneme recognition in this paradigm consists of two steps: After the acoustic events have been determined from the speech signal, a phonological parser is used to generate syllable and phoneme hypotheses from the event lattice.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a compositional {{process that is}} homogeneous to LaMothe’s four modes of organising experience: corporeal-contiguous, taxonomic-object, symbolic-subjective and narrativecommunal. It begins with the composer 2 ̆ 7 s subjective experience of hearing, rooted in the relationship of a particular human body to its physical neighbourhood (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s corporeal-contiguous modes). The human {{body is used as}} a benchmark for measuring and apprehending the world (Benthall and Polhemus 1975). The thinking body conceptualises the claim that sensation, motor functions and cognition are distributed functions of the body, in a complex interrelationship with the mind (Baily 2006). Our embodied knowledge of proprioceptive and motor activities act as constraints on interpreting music. Sonic objects (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s taxonomic-object modes) are interpreted as gestural sonic tokens, these being the <b>smallest</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>units</b> of gestural information in a sound sequence. These act as signs from which metaphor can be derived, based on the composers interpretations of the meaning of the gestural sonic tokens {{in the context of the}} composition (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s symbolic-subjective modes). This process creates a sonic signscape, a sign system in which the signifier is the gestural sonic token and the signified is the imagined sound source. When used by the composer as foretokens, such signifiers build sequential structured relationships that form a sonic narrative. In this thesis the term sonarrative is used to describe such a sonic account of contiguous and contrapuntal events that create a coherent whole – a composition. The creative process incorporates physicality, sign, metaphor and narrative to organise a meaningful sonic experience for the listener by way of sonarratives (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s narrative-communal modes). In order to ground this theoretical framework in practice, the concepts are applied to a body of compositional work completed between 2009 and 2011...|$|R

40|$|The nuclear {{parameters}} of a reactor lattice may {{be determined by}} critical experiments on that lattice, by theoretical calculations in which only cross sections are used as input, or by methods which combine theory and experiment. Of those methods which combine theory and experiment, the Single Element Method, abbreviated SEM, is shown to have great usefulness. As used here, the method combines experiments on the <b>smallest</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>unit</b> of fuel - a single fuel element - with a theory which relates {{the behavior of a}} lattice of such elements to the experimentally determined behavior of the single element. This particular division of the problem into theory and experiment is useful for at least three reasons. First, several parameters which characterize a reactor lattice - the thermal utilization and resonance escape probability, for example - often depend strongly and in a complicated manner on the properties of individual fuel elements, but only depend weakly or in a simple manner on interactions between the fuel elements. In the Single Element Method, the largest contribution to these parameters is determined by measurements on a single fuel element, and only a relatively small correction to account for the presence {{of the rest of the}} fuel elements need be estimated theoretically. Second, the determination of lattice parameters in this way represents a desirable saving of time, money, effort, and material over their determination in critical or exponential experiments. Third, it is shown that the method provides an excellent way of correlating the results of experimental measurements, since it shows what pertinent variables must be used to express the quantity of interest in a linear or nearly linear fashion. Values obtained by the SEM for the thermal utilization of lattices of uranium rods in heavy water are accurate to about 0. 3 percent (by comparison with THERMOS). Values of P 28, 28, and C* are obtained by the SEM for the same lattices to an accuracy of between five and ten percent (by comparison with experiment). The same method yields values of 28 with are equally accurate in lattices moderated by light water. In addition, the theoretical development of the SEM predicts that P 28, 28, C*, and 625 should vary nearly linearly with the inverse of the unit cell volume (for a fixed size of fuel element). This explains the experimentally observed behavior and provides an important tool for the rational correlation of experimental results. Statement of responsibility on title page reads: Edward E.
