Visalini was born with the congenital oral anomaly ankyloglossia. Her mother (who was then preparing for Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission exams), {{in order to improve}} her daughter's <b>speech</b> <b>anomaly,</b> started talking to Visalini and would read aloud the subjects to her.|$|E
40|$|<b>Speech</b> <b>anomalies</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as characteristic symptoms for the 22 q 11 deletion syndrome. However, research on speech and voice in adults with the syndrome is still scarce. Previous research has indicated that <b>speech</b> and voice <b>anomalies</b> seen in children with the syndrome might have neurological causes. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate speech and voice in a group of adults diagnosed with the 22 q 11 deletion syndrome, with extra focus on anomalies with possible neurological cause. The researched group consisted of 24 adults between the ages 19 to 38 with a verified 22 q 11 -deletion, 16 women and 8 men. A blind, perceptual assessment of audio-recorded speech material was carried out by two speech pathologists. They assessed 30 variables designed to evaluate dysarthric symptoms. The results indicated that speech-, and voiceanomalies were present within the group. The variables most commonly seen were partially the same as in hypokinetic dysarthria. Conclusions were that speech- and voice-anomalies were present within the group but since the reliability was low, no strong conclusions could be made about the severity of the anomalies...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{shape of}} vocal tract and its formant (resonant) frequencies are directly related. The {{study of this}} functional connectivity is essential in speech therapy practice with children. Most of the perceived children’s <b>speech</b> <b>anomalies</b> can be explained on a physical level: malfunctioning movement of articulation organs. The current {{problem is that there}} is no enough data on the anatomical shape of children’s vocal tract to create its acoustic model. Classical techniques for vocal tract shape imaging (X-ray, magnetic resonance, etc.) are not appropriate for children. One possibility is to start from the shape of the adult vocal tract and correct it based on anatomical, morphological and articulatory differences between children and adults. This paper presents a method for vocal tract shape estimation of the child aged one year. The initial shapes of the vocal tract refer to the Russian vowels spoken by an adult male. All the relevant anatomical and articulation parameters, that influence the formant frequencies, are analyzed. Finally, the hypothetical configurations of the children’s vocal tract, for the five vowels, are presented...|$|R
40|$|Background: Voice {{processing}} in real-time is challenging. A drawback {{of previous}} work for Hypokinetic Dysarthria (HKD) recognition is {{the requirement of}} controlled settings in a laboratory environment. A personal digital assistant (PDA) has been developed for home assessment of PD patients. The PDA offers sound processing capabilities, which allow for developing a module for recognition and quantification HKD. Objective: To compose an algorithm for assessment of PD speech severity in the home environment based on a review synthesis. Methods: A two-tier review methodology is utilized. The first tier focuses on real-time problems in speech detection. In the second tier, acoustics features that are robust to medication changes in Levodopa-responsive patients are investigated for HKD recognition. Keywords such as Hypokinetic Dysarthria, and Speech recognition in real time {{were used in the}} search engines. IEEE explorer produced the most useful search hits as compared to Google Scholar, ELIN, EBRARY, PubMed and LIBRIS. Results: Vowel and consonant formants are the most relevant acoustic parameters to reflect PD medication changes. Since relevant speech segments (consonants and vowels) contains minority of speech energy, intelligibility can be improved by amplifying the voice signal using amplitude compression. Pause detection and peak to average power rate calculations for voice segmentation produce rich voice features in real time. Enhancements in voice segmentation can be done by inducing Zero-Crossing rate (ZCR). Consonants have high ZCR whereas vowels have low ZCR. Wavelet transform is found promising for voice analysis since it quantizes non-stationary voice signals over time-series using scale and translation parameters. In this way voice intelligibility in the waveforms can be analyzed in each time frame. Conclusions: This review evaluated HKD recognition algorithms to develop a tool for PD speech home-assessment using modern mobile technology. An algorithm that tackles realtime constraints in HKD recognition based on the review synthesis is proposed. We suggest that speech features may be further processed using wavelet transforms and used with a neural network for detection and quantification of <b>speech</b> <b>anomalies</b> related to PD. Based on this model, patients' speech can be automatically categorized according to UPDRS speech ratings...|$|R
40|$|Persons with {{fetal alcohol}} {{syndrome}} (FAS) may be diagnosed at birth based on specific symptoms and anomalies. These are history of prenatal alcohol exposure, mental retardation, central nervous system dysfunctions, growth deficiency, particular physical <b>anomalies,</b> and <b>speech</b> and language <b>anomalies.</b> With aging, cranial and skeletal anomalies become more pronounced. FAS adolescents and adults exhibit deficits in interpersonal relationships, immature social skills, confusing and nonproductive communication, poor daily living skills, and attention deficits. Easily influenced and excessively friendly, FAS persons are often exploited. No one documented to date has been capable of living a fully independent life. Adolescents may display inappropriate sexual behavior; isolation; loneliness; depression; and inappropriate expectations for work, school, and independence. FAS adolescents and adults have many unmet needs...|$|R
30|$|The {{quality of}} the 50 most {{frequent}} syllables produced after speech acquisition (i.e. after the adjustment of synaptic link weights of the mappings between the phonetic map and all state maps as described in above) was tested by performing a combined acoustic perception and vocal tract action identification test. A phonetic expert (BK, male, 53 years old, no known <b>speech</b> or hearing <b>anomalies)</b> performed this test. In this test, the 50 most frequent syllables, which were already acquired during simulation of speech acquisition, were generated by the model. A winner neuron was calculated {{at the level of}} the phonetic map by activating a specific phonemic state (a specific syllable). Subsequently, the appropriate motor plan state was co-activated for that winner neuron, and then the articulatory and acoustic signal was generated using the feedforward execution path including our vocal tract model (see Figure  2).|$|R
40|$|Liquid State Machine (LSM) is an {{adaptive}} neural computational model with rich dynamics to process spatio-temporal inputs. These machines are extremely fast in learning because the goal-oriented training is {{moved to the}} output layer, unlike conventional recurrent neural networks. The capability to multiplex at the output layer for multiple tasks makes LSM a powerful intelligent engine. These properties are desirable in several machine learning applications such as <b>speech</b> recognition, <b>anomaly</b> detection, user identification etc. Scalable hardware architectures for spatio-temporal signal processing algorithms like LSMs are energy efficient compared to the software implementations. These designs can also naturally adapt to dierent temporal streams of inputs. Early literature shows few behavioral models of LSM. However, they cannot process real time data either due to their hardware complexity or xed design approach. In this thesis, a scalable digital architecture of an LSM is proposed. A key feature of the architecture is a digital liquid that exploits spatial locality and is capable of processing real time data. The quality of the proposed LSM is analyzed using kernel quality, separation property of the liquid and Lyapunov exponent. When realized using TSMC 65 nm technology node, the total power dissipation of the liquid layer, with 60 neurons, is 55. 7 mW with an area requirement of 2 mm^ 2. The proposed model is validated for two benchmark. In {{the case of an}} epileptic seizure detection an average accuracy of 84 % is observed. For user identification/authentication using gait an average accuracy of 98. 65 % is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{orofacial}} defects, inborn or acquired, isolated or {{in combination}} with other handicaps in syndroms, suffer from various problems including psychological problems. Morphological changes within these handicaps burden not only the patients themselves, but also their families. Among the main problems are difficulties with feeding, <b>speech</b> or breathing. <b>Anomalies</b> in number or position of deciduous and permanent teeth, development of jaws and dental arches are often present. Multidisciplinary aproach is necessary when solving all of the tasks and the multidiciplinary team consits of experts from field of plastic surgery, foniatry, speach therapist, dentist and oral surgeons. Surgical therapy involves early primary reconstruction of cleft lip and causes necessity of very detailed therapy planing and evaluation. It is very important to create systematic aproach to dental care including valuace diagnostic methods. In the work presented there will be variol methods of diagnosis and evaluation of the treatment introduced with the aim of evaluating modern methods including 3 D printing and digital technologies and a valid alternative to traditional methods (plaster casts). Key words: 3 D printing, cleft lip and palate, dentistr...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{three patients}} with a comparable deletion encompassing SLC 25 A 43, SLC 25 A 5, CXorf 56, UBE 2 A, NKRF, and two non-coding RNA genes, U 1 and LOC 100303728. Moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID), psychomotor retardation, severely impaired/absent speech, seizures, and urogenital anomalies were present in all three patients. Facial dysmorphisms include ocular hypertelorism, synophrys, and a depressed nasal bridge. These clinical features overlap with those described in two patients from a family with a similar deletion at Xq 24 that also includes UBE 2 A, and in several patients of Brazilian and Polish families with point mutations in UBE 2 A. Notably, all five {{patients with a}}n Xq 24 deletion have ventricular septal defects that are not present in patients with a point mutation, which might {{be attributed to the}} deletion of SLC 25 A 5. Taken together, the UBE 2 A deficiency syndrome in male patients with a mutation in or a deletion of UBE 2 A is characterized by ID, absent <b>speech,</b> seizures, urogenital <b>anomalies,</b> frequently including a small penis, and skin abnormalities, which include generalized hirsutism, low posterior hairline, myxedematous appearance, widely spaced nipples, and hair whorls. Facial dysmorphisms include a wide face, a depressed nasal bridge, a large mouth with downturned corners, thin vermilion, and a short, broad neck. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Now-a-days truncus arteriosus {{has been}} known as "common {{arterial}} trunk" (CAT) and is an uncommon congenital cardiac defect presenting in about 1 - 3 % congenital heart disease. Environmental and genetic factors effects on incidence of CAT and other conotruncal anomalies. The majority patients with CAT and 22 q 11 deletion have other anomalies such as hypoplasia or aplasia of the thymus or parathyroid glands and immune deficits (T-cell deficiency), calcium metabolism disorder (hypocalcemia), palatal defects, learning and <b>speech</b> disorder, craniofacial <b>anomalies,</b> and neuropsychological abnormalities. CAT without surgical treatment frequently involves early severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or early death from heart failure and associated conditions. Therefore, without corrective surgical repair, most CAT patients die in the initial years of life. In numerous centers early surgical repair associated with superior than 80 % long-standing survival. Anesthesiologist must be performs comprehensive preoperative evaluation of infants or neonates with this disorder. In CAT patient exactly hemodynamic monitoring and suitable techniques to regulate pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance and cardiac function {{are more important than}} the select of a special anesthetic drug. Therefore, anesthetic drugs should be carefully administrated and titrate and under monitoring. Management of CAT after surgical repair depends on the adequacy of treatment, cardiac function, level of PAH, and degree of bleeding. Inotropic support is frequently necessary after the cardiac ischemia associated to the surgical repair. Pulmonary vasodilator drugs were used to PAH treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{retinoic acid}} induced 1 (RAI 1) gene maps within the Smith-Magenis {{syndrome}} (SMS) region on chromosome 17 p 11. 2. Interstitial deletion of 17 p 11. 2 including RAI 1 or mutation of RAI 1 results in SMS, while duplication of 17 p 11. 2, including RAI 1, {{results in the}} dup(17) (p 11. 2) syndrome. Smith-Magenis syndrome is a complex disorder characterized by a constellation of 30 features that includes mental retardation, sleep disturbance, craniofacial defects, neurological and behavioral anomalies, and variable systemic features. Dup(17) (p 11. 2) syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, craniofacial defects, developmental delay, failure to thrive, and hyperactivity. We hypothesized that RAI 1 is a dosage-sensitive gene with specific roles in SMS and dup(17) (p 11. 2) syndrome. To understand the clinical consequences of haploinsufficiency of RAI 1 in humans, 60 SMS patients were evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization and/or sequencing of RAI 1 to identify 17 p 11. 2 deletions or intragenic mutations. Phenotypic comparison between patients with deletions and those with RAI 1 mutations show that 21 of 30 SMS features {{are the result of}} haploinsufficiency of RAI 1. Other features such as cardiac and renal <b>anomalies,</b> <b>speech</b> and motor delay, chronic respiratory and ear infections, hypotonia, short stature, and ear and eye anomalies are associated with 17 p 11. 2 deletions rather than RAI 1 mutations (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Mouse models were evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies for phenotypic consequences due to altered Rai 1 dosage. To this extent, BAC transgenic mice overexpressing Rai 1 1. 5 -fold (hemizygous) or 2 -fold (homozygous) and Rai 1 -targeted heterozygous (Rai 1 +/-) mice with 0. 5 -fold dosage were utilized. Compared to wild type littermates, Rai 1 overexpressing mice have growth retardation, increased locomotor activity, gait abnormalities, and abnormal anxiety-related behavior, while Rai 1 +/- mice are obese and hypoactive. Analyses of homozygous BAC transgenic mice revealed a dosage-dependent exacerbation of the phenotype. Both the Rai 1 -overexpressors and Rai 1 -haploinsufficient mice showed neurological deficits. To identify target genes altered due to haploinsufficiency of RAI 1, RNA-interference-based knockdown (50...|$|R
