5|$|Rocket {{propellant}}: <b>Solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> propellant began {{during the}} 1200s during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty {{at a time}} when bows, arrows, and catapult-based projectile launchers were state of the art military technology in medieval Europe. The Song Chinese invented solid propellant rockets in 1232 during the military siege of Kaifeng. The rocket propellants were powered by solid gunpowder fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E

25|$|The rockoon (a {{portmanteau}} of rocket and balloon) was a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> that, {{rather than}} being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket {{did not have to}} move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|E

50|$|When {{a rocket}} launches, it sends out {{large amounts of}} gas called a rocket plume. A rocket’s plume is made of various gases that {{are a result of}} the {{combustion}} of the fuel source used to propel the rocket into space. There are two main types of rocket engine fuels: <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> motor <b>fuels</b> and liquid <b>rocket</b> engine <b>fuels.</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>fuels</b> are considered to be more harmful to ozone than liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuels.</b> It is estimated that global ozone depletion results from a mixture of <b>solid</b> and liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> emissions. <b>Solid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>fuels</b> are more durable and {{do not have to be}} stored under certain conditions. Liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> is better in use because the rocket thrust can be adjusted mid-flight unlike <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> that burns at a fixed rate without any mechanism to alter it.|$|R

50|$|On {{a global}} scale today, rockets have a {{negligible}} impact on destruction of the ozone layer. With the increase in rocket launches predicted {{to occur in the}} future, rockets may have a larger impact on the ozone layer. It is important to consider changes in fuel sources to minimize the effects. Advancements have been made to make liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> non nitrogen-based to reduce the effects of nitric oxide caused ozone loss. Using chlorine-free <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> is another future approach to help eliminate the effect of chlorine radicals destroying ozone. Chlorine is shown to cause the most damage to the ozone layer from <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> as well as overall due to it being used in a catalytic cycle of destruction. Eliminating chlorine from <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> could have a large impact on protecting the ozone layer from future <b>rocket</b> launches. <b>Solid</b> <b>fueled</b> <b>rockets</b> contribute negligibly to ozone depletion on {{a global scale}} due to the understanding of its harmful affects on the ozone layer. With the increasing abundance of space exploration, the use of these <b>solid</b> <b>fueled</b> <b>rockets</b> should be taken into consideration, as they will increase the impact on the global ozone layer. Solid rocket motors cause over sixty times more damage to the ozone layer compared to liquid rocket engines. It is shown to be more efficient to use liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fueled</b> compared to the traditionally used <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>Rocket</b> emissions have remained unregulated. Rocket launches will continue to increase in abundance into the future and will cause future problems {{when it comes to the}} earth’s precious ozone layer. The chlorine-free <b>rocket</b> <b>fuels</b> will help decrease the destruction of ozone molecules in the atmosphere due to rocket launches.|$|R
