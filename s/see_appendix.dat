Once made, a draw offer cannot be retracted, and is valid until rejected. A draw may be rejected either verbally or by making a move (the offer is nullified if the opponent makes a move). The actual offer of a draw may be made by asking directly [...] "Would you like a draw?" [...] or similar, but players frequently agree to draws by merely nodding their heads [...] [...] In international chess, the French word remis is an offer of a draw.|$|E
