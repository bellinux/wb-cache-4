25|$|For {{semiconductor}} devices {{used in a}} variety of consumer and industrial electronics, the idea of thermal resistance simplifies the selection of heat sinks. The heat flow between the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die</b> and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow; there is a resistance from the die to the device case, from the case to the heat sink, and from the heat sink to the ambient air. The sum of these resistances is the total thermal resistance from the die to the ambient air. Thermal resistance is defined as temperature rise per unit of power, analogous to electrical resistance, and is expressed in units of degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W). If the device dissipation in watts is known, and the total thermal resistance is calculated, the temperature rise of the die over the ambient air can be calculated.|$|E

50|$|The junction-to-case thermal {{resistance}} of a TO-220 packaged device (which typically matters {{less than the}} case-to-ambient {{thermal resistance}}), depends on the thickness and {{the area of the}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die</b> inside the package, typically in a range between 0.5 °C/W and 3 °C/W (according to one textbook) or 1.5 °C/W and 4 °C/W (according to another).|$|E

Around 1999, Philips Lumileds introduced power LEDs capable of continuous use at one watt. These LEDs used much larger <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die</b> sizes to handle the large power inputs.

50|$|Reliability of {{semiconductors}} is kept high {{through several}} methods. Cleanrooms control impurities,process control controls processing, and burn-in (short term operation at extremes) and probe and test reduce escapes. Probe (wafer prober) tests the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die,</b> prior to packaging, via micro-probes connected to test equipment. Wafer testing tests the packaged device, often pre-, and post burn-in {{for a set}} of parameters that assure operation. Process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e. g. according to the AEC Q100 and Q101 stress qualifications. Parts Average Testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die</b> that have a higher probability of reliability failures. This technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at-risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications. Tester-based Parts Average Testing varieties include Parametric Parts Average Testing (P-PAT) and Geographical Parts Average Testing (G-PAT), among others. Inline Parts Average Testing (I-PAT) uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function.|$|E
50|$|Structural {{changes are}} often {{made in a}} power device in order to {{accommodate}} the higher current density, higher power dissipation, and/or higher reverse breakdown voltage. The vast majority of the discrete (i.e., non-integrated) power devices are built using a vertical structure, whereas small-signal devices employ a lateral structure. With the vertical structure, the current rating of the device is proportional to its area, and the voltage blocking capability is achieved in the height of the die. With this structure, one of the connections of the device is located {{on the bottom of the}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E
50|$|To make {{connections}} between an integrated circuit and the leads of the package, wire bonds are used, with fine wires connected from the package leads and bonded to conductive pads on the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die.</b> At {{the outside of}} the package, wire leads may be soldered to a printed circuit board or used to secure the device to a tag strip. Modern surface mount devices eliminate most of the drilled holes through circuit boards, and have short metal leads or pads on the package that can be secured by oven-reflow soldering. Aerospace devices in flat packs may use flat metal leads secured to a circuit board by spot welding, though this type of construction is now uncommon.|$|E
50|$|Multiple <b>semiconductor</b> <b>dies</b> and {{discrete}} components can be assembled on a ceramic substrate and interconnected with wire bonds. The substrate bears leads for connection to an external circuit, {{and the whole}} {{is covered with a}} welded or frit cover. Such devices are used when requirements exceed the performance (heat dissipation, noise, voltage rating, leakage current, or other properties) available in a single-die integrated circuit, or for mixing analog and digital functions in the same package. Such packages are relatively expensive to manufacture, but provide most of the other benefits of integrated circuits.|$|R

In order to correlate {{the quality of the}} bonding with the applied pressure, {{as well as with the}} bonding area and the thickness of the sintered Ag layer, Si dies were mounted on Cu substrates and analyzed using X-ray imaging, ultrasonic microscopy and destructive examination methods such as shear tests and SEM analysis of cross sections...|$|R
50|$|During encapsulation, {{bonding wires}} can be severed, shorted, or touch the chip die, usually at the edge. Dies can crack due to {{mechanical}} overstress or thermal shock; defects introduced during processing, like scribing, can develop into fractures. Lead frames may contain excessive material or burrs, causing shorts. Ionic contaminants like alkali metals and halogens can migrate from the packaging materials to the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>dies,</b> causing corrosion or parameter deterioration. Glass-metal seals commonly fail by forming radial cracks that originate at the pin-glass interface and permeate outwards; other causes include a weak oxide layer {{on the interface}} and poor formation of a glass meniscus around the pin.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of electronic parts failures are packaging-related. Packaging, as the barrier between electronic parts and the environment, is very susceptible to environmental factors. Thermal expansion produces mechanical stresses that may cause material fatigue, {{especially when the}} thermal expansion coefficients of the materials are different. Humidity and aggressive chemicals can cause corrosion of the packaging materials and leads, potentially breaking them and damaging the inside parts, leading to electrical failure. Exceeding the allowed environmental temperature range can cause overstressing of wire bonds, thus tearing the connections loose, cracking the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>dies,</b> or causing packaging cracks. Humidity and subsequent high temperature heating may also cause cracking, as may mechanical damage or shock.|$|R

40|$|In fast {{switching}} power semiconductors, {{the use of}} a fourth terminal to provide the reference potential for the gate signal—known as a kelvin-source terminal—is becoming common. The introduction of this terminal presents opportunities for condition monitoring systems. This article demonstrates how the voltage between the kelvin-source and power-source can be used to specifically monitor bond-wire degradation. Meanwhile, the drain to kelvin-source voltage can be monitored to track defects in the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die</b> or gate driver. Through an accelerated aging test on 20 A Silicon Carbide Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor-Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), it is shown that there are opposing trends {{in the evolution of the}} on-state resistances of both the bond-wires and the MOSFET die. In summary, after 50, 000 temperature cycles, the resistance of the bond-wires increased by up to 2 mΩ, while the on-state resistance of the MOSFET dies decreased by approximately 1 mΩ. The conventional failure precursor (monitoring a single forward voltage) cannot distinguish between <b>semiconductor</b> <b>die</b> or bond-wire degradation. Therefore, the ability to monitor both these parameters due to the presence of an auxiliary-source terminal can provide more detailed information regarding the aging process of a device...|$|E
