5|$|The lateral and {{torsional}} <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> {{the rear}} frame and the wheel spindle affects wobble-mode damping substantially.

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the forming <b>of</b> the <b>stiffness</b> matrix <b>of</b> a {{mechanical}} {{system on the}} example of torsional vibration of a drive with flexible coupling and multi stage gear box has been described. First the <b>stiffness</b> matrix <b>of</b> the linearized system has been formed {{taking into account the}} mean values <b>of</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> the elastic elements. For such a linearized system the eigenvalues have been computed. Forming <b>of</b> the <b>stiffness</b> matrix has been described as well for the case when the <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> the elastic elements are variable functions of the turning angle, i. e. of time. The flexible coupling stiffness is then a nonlinear function described by polynomial while the <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> teeth of the meshed gears are nonlinear and periodic functions that have been described by Fourier series with corresponding number of members. For the system with the <b>stiffness</b> matrix <b>of</b> which the elements are nonlinear functions of time the computation of the eigenvalues has been performed with the flexible coupling stiffness linearized in vicinity of working point and with <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> teeth of the meshed gears that have been varied with minimal, mean and maximal values. By comparison of eigenvalues computed for the mechanical system with variable stiffness matrix to the eigenvalues computed for the linearized system the influence of the elastic elements stiffness variability on the eigenvalues of torsional vibrations of the mechanical system has been estimated. Key words: gear teeth stiffness, <b>stiffness</b> matrix, eigenvalues <b>of</b> torsional vibrations. 1...|$|R
40|$|A beam-column {{resting on}} {{continuous}} Winkler foundation and discrete elastic supports is considered. The beam-column is of variable cross-section and the variation of sectional properties along {{the axis of}} the beam-column is deterministic. Young's modulus, mass per unit length and distributed axial loadings of the beam-column have a stochastic distribution. The foundation <b>stiffness</b> coefficient <b>of</b> the Winkler model, the <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> discrete elastic supports, <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> end springs and the end thrust, are all considered as random parameters. The material property fluctuations and distributed axial loadings are considered to constitute independent, one-dimension uni-variate homogeneous real stochastic fields in space. The foundation <b>stiffness</b> coefficient, <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> the discrete elastic supports, <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> end springs and the end thrust are considered to constitute independent random variables. Static response, free vibration and stability behaviour of the beam-column are studied. Hamilton's principle is used to formulate the problem using stochastic FEM. Sensitivity vectors of the response and stability parameters are evaluated. Using these statistics of free vibration frequencies, mode shapes, buckling parameters, etc., are evaluated. A numerical example is given...|$|R

5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E
