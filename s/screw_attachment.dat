40|$|The {{strength}} of pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>attachment</b> to the vertebrae {{is an important}} factor affecting their motion resistance and long term performance. Low bone quality, e. g. in osteopenic patients, keeps the screw bone interface at risk for subsidence and dislocation. In such cases, bone cement could be used to augment pedicle screw fixation. But its use is not free of risk. Therefore, clinicians, especially spine surgeons, radiologists, and internists should become increasingly aware of cement migration and embolism as possible complications. Here, we present an instructive case of cement embolism into the venous system after augmented screw fixation with fortunately asymptomatic clinical course. In addition we discuss pathophysiology and prevention methods as well as therapeutic management of this potentially life-threatening complication in a comprehensive review of the literature. However, only a few case reports of cement embolism into the venous system were published after augmented screw fixation...|$|R

40|$|Polymer clay nanocomposites (PCN) exhibit many {{advantages}} over conventional composites, while using substantially smaller quantities of filler. For various reasons, it is desirable, in nanocomposite manufacturing, to employ processes based on melt exfoliation of modified clay particles. While various researchers {{have studied the}} effects of processing variables and material properties {{on the effectiveness of}} melt exfoliation, many issues remain unresolved. This study attempts to deal with some of these. In this study an amorphous polymer, atactic polystyrene (PS), has been chosen to avoid complications related to crystallization. Three grades of (PS), having different molecular weight, were pre-blended with Cloisite® 1 OA (a modified montmorillonite) in a twin-screw extruder (TSE). The TSE blends were subsequently fed to a single screw extruder, fitted with one of three specially designed attachments {{at the front of the}} <b>screw.</b> The <b>attachments</b> were designed to provide combinations of shear and elongational deformations. The resins, TSE blends, and final nanocomposites were characterized for the degree of exfoliation, mechanical properties, and rheological behavior using capillary and rotational rheometers, FTIR, XRD and TEM. The effects of molecular weight, mixing time, and levels of shear and elongational stresses, on the degree of intercalation and the properties of the nanocomposites were studied. Surprisingly, the complex and shear viscosities of the nanocomposites were found to be lower than the corresponding viscosities of the virgin polystyrene. Intercalation was achieved with in a short residence time. However, the degradation of the clay intercalant increased with residence time which causes degradation of PS...|$|R
50|$|The most desired use is the AV. The AV {{is made up}} of a {{piece of}} heavy rubber hose about 5 cm in {{diameter}} and up a 18 in or more (in some cases less) in length. A small <b>screw</b> cap <b>attachment</b> is fitted or drilled preferably {{in the middle of the}} housing. A piece of latex or silicone rubber (usually rough inside, but some cases smooth) then is put through the hose and pulled up at both ends. Another latex or silicone cone shaped attachment is placed on one end of the AV an held by a rubber band. on thee end of the cone a glass or plastic centrifudge tube is attached usually 15ml size). Through the cap attachment water usually around 54°C is filled until the AV is 1/2 full (temperature may vary from bull to bull). This water is between the inside rubber and the inside hose wall of the AV. A small amount of K-Y jelly or Vaseline is placed just inside on the unconed end and then it is smeared with a pipette or greasing stick. Finally in most cases and AV jacket is tied or attached onto the cone end to cover the cone and tube. This will help prevent cold shock to the semen by keeping the cone and tube warm. The collector then goes cautiously to the side of the bull when he is in mount, directs the bull's penis inside the AV by grabbing the sheath directly behind the extended penis (never touching the penis itself). The bull then ejaculates after his penis slides through the AV. The bull should be ejaculating through the AV into the cone of the AV so there is very little chance of temperature shock to the semen. after the bull has dismounted the AV should be held in the upright position so the semen runs into the tube onto the end of the cone. Then the tube is detached and placed upright in a water bath of about 29-32°C.|$|R

40|$|Special moment {{resisting}} frames (SMRF) {{depend on}} large inelastic strains in the beam-to-column connections to dissipate seismic energy and protect buildings from collapse. The ANSI / AISC 341 - 10 Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings define {{the ends of}} the beams in a SMRF as protected zones at the locations where large inelastic strains are expected. In the protected zone, AISC 341 - 10 prohibits any decking attachments that penetrate the beam flange and any welded, bolted, <b>screwed,</b> or shot-in <b>attachments</b> for other purposes. However, these restrictions are based primarily on a lack of data showing that such fasteners will not cause premature low cycle fatigue fracture in the moment connection. A series of full-scale beam-to-column moment connection tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of powder actuated fasteners (PAF) applied in the protected zone on the seismic behavior of steel moment connections. The primary objective of the testing program was to determine if beam-to-column connections with deck attachments using PAF’s satisfy the SMRF qualification criteria of AISC 341 - 10.

Variations in fasteners included control specimens with no fasteners, PAF at 12 in. spacing representing typical dec...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{research}} on combined reconstructions on teeth and implants {{has led to}} the following results: 1. There is only few data on removable dentures in contrast to the fixed counterpart. 2. Despite the different mobility characteristics of natural teeth and implants resp. the alveoloar bone, fixed reconstructions on teeth and implants show good long-term results. Preconditions of these results:a. A fixed connection between tooth and implant byi. a directly cemented connection (conventional bridges). ii. a <b>screwed,</b> 3 -D-safeguarded <b>attachment.</b> iii. definitively cemented crowns on natural teeth. b. Small bridge-constructions (3 - 4 links). c. Good periodontal and endodontic conditions resp. teeth and good osseous situation resp. implants. d. No extension-arrangements. e. No bruxism. 3.

40|$|Aims To {{develop a}} {{prototype}} of an intraoperative simulator for the navigated surgery of a scoliotic spine. Materials and methods An instrumentation strategy (pedicle <b>screw</b> insertion, rod <b>attachment</b> and rotation) was numerically simulated on a synthetic model of a scoliotic spine by using the radiographs of the spine in standing position (simulating the preoperative conditions). A navigation system was used to acquire the replicated intraoperative geometry of the spine. This geometry {{was transferred to the}} simulator, enabling to update (1) the preoperative planning of the pedicle screw positioning, (2) the simulation of the surgical maneuvers, and (3) the measurement of several clinical indices (Cobb angles, etc.). Results The Cobb angle decreased from 34 ° to 24 ° between the simulated pre- and intraoperative geometries (before the instrumentation). Differences in pedicle screw positioning between the preoperative planning and the intraoperative situation were less than 0. 5 mm. The new simulation of the rod attachment and rotation maneuvers resulted in a 12 °-Cobb angle. Conclusion This study is a first step toward developing an integrated simulator for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation of scoliotic spine surgeries. Significance When completed, the integrated simulator will enable to obtain real-time biomechanical feedback during the navigated surgery of a scoliotic spine, and could help to optimize instrumentation parameters (instrumented levels, surgical maneuvers, etc.) and the resulting correction.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{improvements}} in fixation stability when a hinged unilateral external fixator {{is used to}} supplement compromised internal fixation for distal humerus fractures. Methods: Removing a 1 -cm section of the distal humerus in cadaveric whole-arm specimens created a comminuted distal humerus fracture model (AO type 13 -A 3). Fixation was then performed using different constructs representing optimal, compromised, or supplemented internal fixation. Internal fixation consisted of either 2 reconstruction plates with 1, 2, or 3 (optimal) distal <b>attachment</b> <b>screws,</b> or crossing medial and lateral cortical screws. A hinged external fixator was applied in combination with compromised internal fixation. The stability of the different constructs was then evaluated using 3 -point bending stiffness and distal fragment displacement measurements during flexion and extension testing. Results: Addition of the external fixator increased the stiffness of all constructs. Stiffness of the compromised reconstruction plate constructs with supplemented fixation was similar to or significantly {{greater than that of}} optimal internal fixation. Addition of the fixator to the reconstruction plates with 1 screw or the crossing screws produced displacements of the distal fragment that were {{similar to those of the}} compromised constructs alone. However, medial/lateral and anterior/posterior displacements of the distal fragment during flexion and extension of the elbow for supplemented fixation were found to be greater than those for optimal internal fixation. Conclusions: The use of a hinged external fixator for supplemental fixation of distal humerus fractures may be effective in cases where internal fixation is severely compromised, although displacements may increase above optimal fixation...|$|R

The Cobb angle decreased from 34 ° to 24 ° between the simulated pre- and intraoperative spine (before the instrumentation). Difference in pedicle screw positioning between the preoperative planning and the intraoperative situation was less than 0. 5 mm.
