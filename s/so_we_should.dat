All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E

Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years of}} our nation and Islam. From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

2500|$|Around 214, Cao Cao {{retreated from}} Ruxu, he {{appointed}} Zhu Guang (朱光) as the Administrator (太守) of Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day Lujiang County, Anhui) {{and ordered him}} to station at Wan County (皖縣; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). Zhu Guang developed the area for agricultural use, while bribing bandits from Poyang County to cause trouble in Sun Quan's territories. Lü Meng warned Sun Quan, [...] "The lands in Wan County are very fertile so the enemy's numbers will rise after they gain a bountiful harvest. Within a few years time, Cao Cao's military prowess would have increased significantly, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> eliminate them soon." [...] Sun Quan heeded Lü Meng's advice and personally led a campaign to attack Lujiang Commandery. Before the battle, Sun Quan summoned all his officers and asked them for their opinions.|$|E

2500|$|In 190, Zhang Miao and Cao Cao {{were among}} the first to take up arms against Dong Zhuo, leading to the {{formation}} of a coalition and the launching of a campaign against Dong. During a battle at Bianshui (汴水), Zhang Miao sent his subordinate Wei Zi (衞茲) to lead troops to assist Cao Cao. At the time, Yuan Shao, who was the coalition chief, behaved arrogantly and elicited strong criticism from Zhang Miao. Yuan Shao was furious and he told Cao Cao to kill Zhang Miao, but Cao refused and said, [...] "Mengzhuo is our friend <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be tolerate him. Now, the Empire has yet to be pacified, so we shouldn't start an internal conflict." [...] Zhang Miao was very grateful to Cao Cao when he heard about it, but he also felt uneasy.|$|E
2500|$|On April 27, 1960, {{immediately}} after the resignation of Syngman Rhee, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II sent a telegram to J. Graham Parsons, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. In it, he said [...] "Rhee regime also seized by force and is holding illegally Takeshima Island which has always been considered as Japanese territory. This is very serious and permanent irritant in Japan-ROK relations and {{there can be no}} over-all ROK-Japan settlement until this Japanese island is returned to Japan. Therefore we should also press new ROK regime to return Takeshima to Japan." [...] Further he said [...] "While we should press strongly for return of Takeshima to Japan, if by any chance new regime were unwilling to do <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should,</b> as very minimum, insist that they agree to submit matter to International Court of Justice for arbitration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Zhou Yu died, he, {{along with}} Gan Ning and others, had {{constantly}} urged Sun Quan to attack Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. However, Zhou Yu died of illness while making preparations for {{an invasion of}} Yi Province. When Sun Quan asked Liu Bei for his opinion, Liu Bei, who secretly had the intention of seizing Yi Province for himself, lied to Sun Quan, [...] "Liu Zhang and I {{are members of the}} imperial clan, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> strive to uphold the Han dynasty with the aid of our ancestors' blessings. Now, when I heard that Liu Zhang has offended his neighbours, I feel afraid and don't dare to probe further. I hope you can show leniency towards him. If you don't, I'll retire and return to the countryside." [...] Liu Bei revealed his true intentions later when he attacked Liu Zhang himself and eventually seized control of Yi Province. During the campaign against Liu Zhang, Liu Bei left his general Guan Yu behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. When Sun Quan heard about Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province, he angrily remarked, [...] "This cunning barbarian dares to trick me!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Just as he {{challenged}} the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also {{took aim at}} traditional normative epistemology. [...] According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by Rudolf Carnap) failed, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs.: [...] "Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output {{a description of the}} three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology."

2500|$|In 236, Sun Quan {{launched}} a campaign against Wei and he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead an army to attack the Wei-controlled Xiangyang Commandery. Lu Xun sent a close aide, Han Bian (韓扁), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian encountered the enemy at Mianzhong (沔中) and was captured. When Zhuge Jin received news of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful and wrote to Lu Xun: [...] "His Majesty has withdrawn his forces. The enemy has captured Han Bian and they know our situation. The rivers have dried up <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> make a hasty retreat." [...] Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas, while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin said, [...] "Boyan possesses intelligence and strategy, he knows what he's doing." [...] He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, [...] "The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us. Besides, they have already stationed troops at critical positions and are poised to strike. Hence, we should remain composed and calm our men, after which {{we will have a}} change of plans and prepare to withdraw. If we display signs of retreat now, the enemy will think that we are afraid and will definitely attack us, resulting in defeat for us." ...|$|E
