40|$|Immune response-modulating {{drugs such}} as {{thalidomide}} may be of therapeutic value {{in the treatment of}} chronic inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease (CD). In the present study, we have investigated whether thalidomide exerts this effect by impairing endothelial cell-leukocyte interaction through down-regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory gene products in these cells. Transient CD-like colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by single enema with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) in ethanol followed by macroscopic scoring, histology, intravital microscopy, RT–PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. Thalidomide or its analogue <b>supidimide</b> were administered in olive oil by intragastric instillation 6 [*]h prior to the induction of colitis and then daily for one week. Both thalidomide and <b>supidimide</b> (200 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]d− 1) significantly attenuated TNBS-induced colitis as compared to vehicle-treated control animals (44 and 37 % inhibition, respectively), and this effect persisted for 7 days post cessation of thalidomide treatment (46 % inhibition). Moreover, thalidomide significantly reduced leukocyte sticking to postcapillary venular endothelial cells in the submucosa (by 45 %), improved functional capillary density and perfusion, and attenuated endothelial interleukin- 8 expression, as judged by IHC analysis. According to RT–PCR analysis, both thalidomide and <b>supidimide</b> also significantly reduced vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 mRNA expression in the affected part of the descending colon. These findings suggest that thalidomide and one of its derivatives impairs CD-like TNBS-induced colitis in the rat by down-regulating endothelial adhesion molecule and chemokine expression and, as a consequence, the interaction of these cells with circulating leukocytes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) is {{an animal}} model of ocular inflammation, {{produced}} by footpad injection of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) {{to mimic the}} human disease of acute anterior uveitis, that is useful for testing new anti-inflammatory therapy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the anti-inflammatory effect on EIU of thalidomide and one of its derivatives, <b>supidimide.</b> METHODS: EIU was produced in rats by hind foot-pad injection of LPS (100 micrograms/animal). Animals were killed 20 h after LPS injection. Inflammation was evaluated by anterior chamber determination of proteins and cells. RESULTS: A dosage of 400 mg/kg per day of thalidomide was efficient in reducing inflammation whether given in three doses (at - 24 h, - 4 h and + 4 h relative to LPS challenge = THAL- 1; p < 0. 001 for proteins and cells), in two doses (- 4 h and + 4 h = THAL- 2; p < 0. 001 for proteins, p < or = 0. 012 for cells) or in one dose (at + 4 h = late THAL; p < 0. 001 for proteins, p < or = 0. 02 for cells). A dosage of 300 mg/kg per day of thalidomide was still efficient (p < or = 0. 023 for proteins, p < or = 0. 06 for cells), but 150 mg/kg per day had no effect on inflammation. <b>Supidimide</b> (400 mg/kg per day) had some anti-inflammatory effect (p < or = 0. 053 for proteins, p < or = 0. 06 for cells). CONCLUSION: High-dose thalidomide had a potent anti-inflammatory effect in EIU, but lower doses were not sufficient to reduce inflammation. At similar high doses, <b>supidimide</b> had some effect on EIU but was less effective than thalidomide...|$|E
