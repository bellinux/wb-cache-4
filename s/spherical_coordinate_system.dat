25|$|The {{geographic}} {{coordinate system}} uses the azimuth and {{elevation of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> to express locations on Earth, calling them respectively longitude and latitude. Just as the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is useful on the plane, a two-dimensional <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is useful {{on the surface of}} a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored. This simplification can also be very useful when dealing with objects such as rotational matrices.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various <b>coordinates.</b> The <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> The polar angle is often replaced by the elevation angle measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.|$|R
25|$|In {{three-dimensional}} space, if one coordinate is {{held constant}} {{and the other}} two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a coordinate surface. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding ρ constant in the <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of coordinate planes.|$|E
500|$|... where (r, θ, φ) {{correspond}} to a <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> This metric {{has only two}} undetermined parameters. An overall dimensionless length scale factor R describes the size scale of the Universe {{as a function of}} time; an increase in R is the expansion of the Universe. A curvature index k describes the geometry. The index k is defined {{so that it can be}} only 0, corresponding to flat Euclidean geometry, 1, corresponding to a space of positive curvature, or −1, a space of positive or negative curvature. The value of R as a function of time t depends upon k and the cosmological constant Λ. The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy. The equation describing how R varies with time is known as the Friedmann equation after its inventor, Alexander Friedmann.|$|E
