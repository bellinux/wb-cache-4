50|$|BCS {{was founded}} in 1943 by Luigi Castoldi in his {{workshop}} in Abbiategrasso, a small town near Milan. The area {{was and still is}} highly agricultural. For this reason the motor-mower (essentially an engine-driven, walk-behind <b>sickle-bar</b> <b>mower)</b> model 243 was created. This was among the first self-propelled motor-mowers in the world. At the end of the 1960s BCS entered into a technology-sharing venture with the Grillo company of Italy, the goal being to integrate soil-working implements into the BCS line. This venture lasted until the early 1980s, and served to launch BCS into the field of green maintenance machines by producing their first “light” multipurpose two-wheel tractors. Starting in 1970, BCS introduced rotary disc-mowers (for 4-wheel tractor mounting). In 1988 BCS purchased Ferrari at Luzzara and in 1999 BCS purchased Pasquali at Calenzano; these acquisitions strengthened BCS Group's divisions with two brands with an international reputation, and since Ferrari and Pasquali produced 4-wheel tractors, these purchases allowed BCS to move into the 4-wheel tractor market. BCS Group presently counts on three production plants (Abbiategrasso, Luzzara, and Cusago) and on six branches.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a vibration damping device for vertical vibrations, in particular for the handles of manually guided single-axis appliances {{driven by a}} combustion engine, such as, for example, a tractor, <b>sickle-bar</b> <b>mower,</b> snow clearer, or similar, whereby an oscillating crank is provided which {{is attached to the}} appliance by at least one joint and one coupling element and that said oscillating crank is supported by at least one spring element on the appliance...|$|E
50|$|Sickle mowers, {{also called}} {{reciprocating}} <b>mowers,</b> bar <b>mowers,</b> <b>sickle-bar</b> <b>mowers,</b> or finger-bar mowers, {{have a long}} (typically six to {{seven and a half}} feet) bar on which are mounted fingers with stationary guardplates. In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric hair clipper).|$|R
50|$|In 1938 Ferguson made a {{handshake}} agreement with Henry Ford to produce Ferguson System Ford-Ferguson tractors using Ferguson's own self-regulating three-point hitch system, {{beginning with the}} Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. This tractor is recognizable by the blue Ford emblem {{on the front of}} the hood and the Ferguson System emblem on the grill. The three-point hitch soon became the favourite hitch attachment system among farmers in North America and around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used to power three-point hitch mounted implements such as <b>sickle-bar</b> <b>mowers.</b> This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.|$|R
50|$|Harry Ferguson {{applied for}} a British patent for his three-point hitch in 1926, a three-point {{attachment}} of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The Ferguson-Brown Company produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor with a Ferguson-designed hydraulic hitch. In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch attachment system among farmers around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft {{that could be used}} to power three point hitch mounted implements such as <b>sickle-bar</b> <b>mowers.</b> This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.|$|R
50|$|Production {{continued}} during World War II, and {{the company}} earned 'E' and 'Star' awards from the Army-Navy.As well as being used to maintain the grass on airfields, the tractors were used to pull airplanes and trailers carrying bombs.Another use was to tow <b>sickle-bar</b> <b>mowers</b> used to maintain the verges of roads.Worthington died in October 1944. The company was sold in 1945 to Jacobsen Manufacturing.In 1949 the subsidiary began making Model G tractors using Ford tractor components, mostly for use in parks and golf courses.The company introduced new products, such as a tractor-mounted compressor in 1955.It continued to make lawnmowers in Stroudsburg for golf course maintenance and for residential use until it closed around 1959.Jacobsen manufactured under the Worthington brand until the mid-1960s.|$|R
