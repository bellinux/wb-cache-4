40|$|Effects {{of large}} value {{assigned}} to the maximal car velocity on the fundamental diagrams in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model are studied by extended simulations. The function relating the flow in the congested traffic phase with the car density and deceleration probability is found numerically. Properties of the region of critical changes, so-called jamming transition parameters, are described in details. The basic model, modified by the assumption that for each car an individual velocity limit is assigned, is investigated in the aim {{to find the best}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>rule</b> allowing the jammed traffic to move with velocity larger than the slowest driving vehicle.

50|$|The good lich is {{presented}} in Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faerûn, a <b>supplementary</b> <b>rule</b> book for the D&D 3rd edition rules. Good liches differ from evil liches in that they have sought undeath for a noble cause, to protect a place, a loved one, or to pursue an important quest. In a typical D&D campaign, liches are evil, power-hungry arcane or divine spell casters (of at least 11th level and typically wizards, sorcerers, or clerics) who have, as noted, cheated death by turning themselves into undead. The D&D version 3.5 Monster Manual, a core D&D rule book, emphatically states that liches are always evil. However, good liches are an anomaly amongst the other liches in D&D, {{given the fact that}} they are considered of good alignment.|$|R

40|$|The Krauss-model is a {{stochastic}} model for traffic flow which is continuous in space. For periodic boundary {{conditions it is}} well understood and known to display a non-unique flow-density relation (fundamental diagram) for certain densities. In many applications, however, the behaviour under open boundary conditions plays a crucial role. In contrast to all models investigated so far, the high flow states of the Krauss-model are not metastable, but also stable. Nevertheless {{we find that the}} current in open systems obeys an extremal principle introduced for the case of simpler discrete models. The phase diagram of the open system will be completely determined by the fundamental diagram of the periodic system through this principle. In order to allow the investigation of the whole state space of the Krauss-model, appropriate strategies for the injection of cars into the system are needed. Two methods solving this problem are discussed and the boundary-induced phase transitions for both methods are studied. We also suggest a <b>supplementary</b> <b>rule</b> for the extremal principle to account for cases where not all the possible bulk states are generated by the chosen boundary conditions.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Gary Gygax, a {{military}} history buff and pulp fantasy fan, started to add elements of fantasy into traditional tabletop medieval miniatures wargames at his games club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

40|$|Abstract In {{portfolio}} selection, strategies on {{an efficient}} frontier have {{been regarded as}} nondominated solutions because of the compensation to each increase unit of risk, and a rational decision maker has to consider other <b>supplementary</b> decision <b>rules.</b> This paper proposes an approach that helps a rational decision maker identify the best candidate strategy on an efficient frontier by taking the concept of certainty equivalent from decision analysis. It is shown that by integrating the efficient frontier and an approximation of certainty equivalent based on the widely used exponential utility function in the same coordinate plane, {{we are able to}} derive an analytical solution to the optimal strategy, and thus develop an efficient selecting procedure that can significantly reduce the computational load {{as a result of the}} necessary comparisons between only one or two candidate portfolios...|$|R
