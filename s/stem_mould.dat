60|$|It {{is to be}} {{questioned}} whether in the whole length and breadth of the world {{there is a more}} admirable spot for a man in love to pass a day or two than the typical English village. The Rocky Mountains, that traditional stamping-ground for the heartbroken, may be well enough in their way; but a lover has to be cast in a pretty <b>stem</b> <b>mould</b> {{to be able to be}} introspective when at any moment he may meet an annoyed cinnamon bear. In the English village there are no such obstacles to meditation. It combines the comforts of civilization with the restfulness of solitude in a manner equalled by no other spot except the New York Public Library. Here your lover may wander to and fro unmolested, speaking to nobody, by nobody addressed, and have the satisfaction at the end of the day of sitting down to a capitally cooked chop and chips, lubricated by golden English ale.|$|E

5000|$|Under ideal conditions, {{the life}} cycle can be {{completed}} on potato or tomato foliage in about five days. Sporangia develop on the leaves, spreading through the crop when temperatures are above [...] and humidity is over 75-80% for 2 days or more. Rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers, and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind. The early stages of blight are easily missed. Symptoms include the appearance of dark blotches on leaf tips and plant <b>stems.</b> White <b>mould</b> will appear under the leaves in humid conditions and the whole plant may quickly collapse. Infected tubers develop grey or dark patches that are reddish brown beneath the skin, and quickly decay to a foul-smelling mush caused by the infestation of secondary soft bacterial rots. Seemingly healthy tubers may rot later when in store.|$|R

To the east of the door is a damaged piscina, and to its west is a 16th-century alms box that has been carved from a tree trunk. The font is Norman.

50|$|The current {{church was}} built in the {{traditional}} cruciform shape in the 12th century, with the south aisle, south porch, clerestory, new windows, and south transept being added in the 15th century. The chancel was rebuilt in brick coated with stucco in 1840 by Thomas Smith for the Rev. Benjamin Donne. The church underwent a restoration in 1867 including the addition of the upper stage of the tower, while the vestry was added in 1880.
