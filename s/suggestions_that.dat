5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants and bank cormorants. This has led to <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order to transmit stress during ramming. However, there have also been alternative <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked {{in place on}} the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.|$|E

5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, {{along with the}} fact that abelisaurids seem to have replaced carcharodontosaurids in South America, have led to <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> the two groups were related. However, no cladistic analysis has ever found such a relationship and, aside from the skull, abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids are very different, more similar to ceratosaurs and allosauroids, respectively.|$|E
