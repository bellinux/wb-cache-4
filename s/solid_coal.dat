25|$|Fires {{sometimes}} {{occur in}} coal beds underground. When coal beds are exposed, the fire risk is increased. Weathered coal can also increase ground temperatures {{if it is}} left on the surface. Almost all fires in <b>solid</b> <b>coal</b> are ignited by surface fires caused by people or lightning. Spontaneous combustion is caused when coal oxidizes and airflow is insufficient to dissipate heat; this more commonly occurs in stockpiles and waste piles, rarely in bedded coal underground. Where coal fires occur, there is attendant air pollution from emission of smoke and noxious fumes into the atmosphere. Coal seam fires may burn underground for decades, threatening destruction of forests, homes, roadways and other valuable infrastructure. The best-known coal-seam fire may be the one {{which led to the}} permanent evacuation of Centralia, Pennsylvania, United States.|$|E
25|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fossil fuel on the planet, and widely used {{as the source of}} energy in thermal power stations. It is a relatively cheap fuel, with some of the largest deposits in regions that are stable politically, such as China, India and the United States. This contrasts with natural gas, the largest deposits of which are located in Russia, Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan and the US. <b>Solid</b> <b>coal</b> cannot directly replace natural gas or petroleum in most applications, petroleum is mostly used for transportation and the natural gas not used for electricity generation is used for space, water and industrial heating. Coal can be converted to gas or liquid fuel, but the efficiencies and economics of such processes can make them unfeasible. Vehicles or heaters may require modification to use coal-derived fuels. Coal is an impure fuel and produces more greenhouse gas and pollution than an equivalent amount of petroleum or natural gas. For instance, the operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a nuclear radiation dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.|$|E

60|$|During the {{previous}} four days the plan had been discussed of cutting through from the Logan, which was {{known to have been}} worked nearly up to the Vaughan boundary. This would enable them to enter the pit and rescue any miners who might be alive, but the fact that to erect pumping gear and get out the water would be an affair of many weeks, if not months, had caused the idea to be abandoned as soon as broached. To those who argued that the water had come from the Logan, it was pointed out that there were certainly several yards of <b>solid</b> <b>coal</b> between the Vaughan and the Logan still standing, and that as the force of the explosion was evidently near the Vaughan shaft it was incredible that this barrier between the pits should have been shattered. However, it was decided to solve the question {{one way or the other}} by an immediate visit to the top of the old Logan shaft.|$|E
30|$|Coconut shell gasification. The {{technology}} for gaseous fuel production from <b>solid</b> feedstocks (<b>coal</b> or coconut shell) considered {{in this study}} is thermochemical gasification.

50|$|Coal slurry is {{a mixture}} of <b>solids</b> (mined <b>coal)</b> and liquids (usually water) {{produced}} by a coal preparation plant. As a slurry, coal is separated from non-combustable components (ash) and can be fractionated by particle size as well. Coal slurry can be transferred by pipeline or with specialised pumps such as a progressive cavity pump to pump the highly abrasive, corrosive and viscous coal slurry.|$|R

60|$|On the {{strength}} of this concession and his accumulated oil-savings, Janki Meah took a second wife--a girl of the Jolaha main stock of the Meahs, and singularly beautiful. Janki Meah could not see her beauty; wherefore he took her on trust, and forbade her to go down the pit. He had not worked for thirty years in the dark without knowing that the pit was no place for pretty women. He loaded her with ornaments--not brass or pewter, but real silver ones--and she rewarded him by flirting outrageously with Kundoo of Number Seven gallery gang. Kundoo was really the gang-head, but Janki Meah insisted upon all the work being entered in his own name, and chose the men that he worked with. Custom--stronger even than the Jimahari Company--dictated that Janki, by right of his years, should manage these things, and should, also, work despite his blindness. In Indian mines where they cut into the <b>solid</b> <b>coal</b> with the pick and clear it out from floor to ceiling, he could come to no great harm. At Home, where they undercut the coal and bring it down in crashing avalanches from the roof, he would never have been allowed to set foot in a pit. He was not a popular man, because of his oil-savings; but all the gangs admitted that Janki knew all the khads, or workings, that had ever been sunk or worked since the Jimahari Company first started operations on the Tarachunda fields.|$|E
60|$|His contrast, {{his very}} antithesis, the joyous concierge, was always smiling, and was every way {{more like an}} Italian than a Spaniard. He {{followed}} us into the wettest Madrid weather with the sunny rays of his temperament, and welcomed our returning cab with an effulgence that performed the effect of an umbrella in the longish walk from the curbstone to the hotel door, past the grape arbor whose fruit ripened for us only in a single bunch, though he had so confidently prophesied our daily pleasure in it. He seemed at first to be the landlord, and without reference to higher authority he gave us beautiful rooms overlooking the bacchanal vine {{which would have been}} filled with sunshine if the weather had permitted. When he lapsed into the concierge, he got us, for five pesetas, so deep and wide a wood-box, covered with crimson cloth, that he was borne out by the fact in declaring that the wood in it would last us as long as we stayed; it was oak wood, hard as iron, and with the bellows that accompanied it we blew the last billet of it into a <b>solid</b> <b>coal</b> by which we drank our last coffee in that hotel. His spirit, his genial hopefulness, reconciled us to the infirmities of the house during the period of transition beginning for it and covering our stay. It was to be rebuilt on a scale out-Ritzing the Ritz; but in the mean while it was not quite the Ritz. There {{was a time when the}} elevator-shaft seemed to have tapped the awful sources of the smell in the house of Cervantes at Valladolid, but I do not remember what blameless origin the concierge assigned to the odor, or whether it had anything to do with the horses and the hens which a chance-opened back door showed us stabled in the rear of the hotel's grandiose entrance.|$|E

40|$|<b>Solid</b> {{backfill}} <b>coal</b> {{mining technology}} has been widely applied in coal seams that {{are at risk of}} hard roof. Using actual measured strain–stress curves of the backfill body and the similarity theory, this study designed and employed four experimental models for physical simulation, corresponding to roof-controlled backfilling ratios of 0 %, 40 %, 82. 5 % and 97 % using the geological conditions of Face No. 6304 in the Jining No. 3 <b>coal</b> mine—a <b>solid</b> backfill <b>coal</b> mining face under a hard roof. A non-contact strain measurement system and pressure sensors were used to monitor the deformation of the overlying strata and changes in abutment stress ahead of the face during mining of the models for varying roof-controlled backfilling ratios. The results indicated that the solid backfill body was able to support the roof. As the roof-controlled backfilling ratio was increased, the maximum subsidence of the roof and the maximum height of the cracks decreased. When the roof-controlled backfilling ratio was 82. 5 % or higher, the working face did not display any obvious initial fractures or periodic fractures, and both the value and the impact range of the abutment stress ahead of the face decreased...|$|R

50|$|Exxon Donor Solvent Process (EDS) is a coal {{liquefaction}} process developed by Exxon Research and Engineering Company, starting in 1966.

50|$|Methane adsorbed into a <b>solid</b> <b>coal</b> matrix (coal macerals) will be {{released}} if the coal seam is depressurised. Methane may be extracted by drilling wells into the coal seam. The goal is to decrease the water pressure by pumping water from the well. The decrease in pressure allows methane to desorb from the coal and flow as a gas up the well to the surface. Methane is then compressed and piped to market.|$|E
40|$|Coal fines are {{generated}} during both the dewatering and Coal Seam Gas (CSG) production stages. This {{is due to}} the interaction between the fluid flow and the <b>coal</b> <b>solids</b> affixed to <b>coal</b> cleat surfaces. The generated coal fines may plug gas flow paths and reduce coal permeability. Although some investigations of the impact of water flow on coal fines generation were conducted, little research has been conducted into the generation of coal fines under water-gas two-phase flow condition. This is a typical flow type in the late dewatering and early CSG production phases. Two-phase flow requires higher pressure to initiate the fluid movement. Therefore, coal fines generation in two-phase flow conditions is expected to be very different from that in single-phase flow...|$|R
50|$|The {{basic idea}} of a firing system using {{pulverised}} fuel {{is to use the}} whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of <b>solid</b> fuels. <b>Coal</b> is ground {{to the size of a}} fine grain, mixed with air and burned in the flue gas flow. Biomass and other materials can also be added to the mixture. Coal contains mineral matter which is converted to ash during combustion. The ash is removed as bottom ash and fly ash.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{sedimentation}} is successfully used in various industries: {{from the food}} and chemical industry, through processing of natural minerals resources in the mining industry. The sedimentation process of suspensions depends on many factors, which mainly include the grain size and grain size distribution of the solid phase of the suspension and its chemical and phase composition. The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} basic physicochemical parameters of the suspended <b>solids</b> from <b>coal</b> processing plant for intensification of its sedimentation process by means of multiflux sedimentation and/or flocculation. The particle size (and/or particle size) distribution of <b>solid</b> phase of <b>coal</b> suspension was measured by laser diffractometer.

40|$|The {{development}} of practical technologies for the deep cleaning of coal has been seriously {{hampered by the}} problems of carrying out efficient coal/mineral separations at the very fine sizes (often finer than 10 {micro}m) needed to achieve adequate liberation of the mineral matter from the coal matrix. In this investigation a hybrid process [...] Micro-agglomerate flotation [...] which {{is a combination of}} oil-agglomeration and froth flotation was studied. The basic concept is to use small quantities of oil to promote the formation of dense micro-agglomerates with minimal entrapment of water and mineral particles and to use froth flotation to separate these micro-agglomerates from the water/dispersed-mineral phase. Since the floating units will be relatively large agglomerates (30 [...] 50 {micro}m in size) rather than fine coal particles (1 [...] 10 {micro}m) the problems of froth overload and water/mineral carryover should be significantly alleviated. There are, however, complications. The process involves at least five phases: two or more <b>solids</b> (<b>coal</b> and mineral), two liquids (oil and water) and one gas (air). It is demonstrated in this study that the process is very sensitive to fluctuations in operating parameters. It is necessary to maintain precise control over the chemistry of the liquid phases as well as the agitation conditions in order to promote selectivity. Both kinetics as well as thermodynamic factors {{play a critical role in}} determining overall system response...|$|R
