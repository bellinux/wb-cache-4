My daughter, of course, privately held fast to what she had <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>along.</b> Her notion of the motive which was really {{at the bottom of the}} suicide failed, oddly enough, just where my young lady's assertion of her innocence failed also.

There was no use in pointing this out to Penelope; the objection made about as much impression on her as a shower of rain on a waterproof coat.

She had admired the young lady's face, liked her manner, approved of her fortune and family, and had selected her for a daughter-in-law in a somewhat impetuous manner. Therefore she loved her. But it was by no means clear to Lady Lufton that she did as yet know her young friend. The match was a plan of her own, and therefore she stuck to it as warmly as ever, but she began to have some misgivings whether or no the dear girl would be to her herself all that she had dreamed of in a daughter-in-law.
