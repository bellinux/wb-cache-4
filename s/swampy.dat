5|$|In the Preclassic {{period the}} floor of the Copán Valley was undulating, <b>swampy</b> and prone to {{seasonal}} flooding.

5|$|After its {{confluence}} with Uono River, the Shinano is crossed by Koshiji Bridge and the Shinetsu {{train line}} before emerging onto Echigo Plains of the Niigata Prefecture at Sanjō. After entering the Echigo Plains the river becomes deltaic and <b>swampy</b> {{due to its}} very small gradient (an average of 1 in 4000).|$|E

5|$|After the Pangaean supercontinent sundered {{during the}} Cretaceous period, the region {{became part of}} a {{shifting}} transition zone between a shallow inland sea—the Western Interior Seaway—and a band of plains and low hills to the west. A sandy and <b>swampy</b> coastline oscillated east and west, alternately submerging and uncovering the area atop the present Colorado Plateau that Chaco Canyon now occupies.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum holopus, {{commonly}} known as the white birch bolete, white bog bolete, or ghost bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae found in northern Asia, Europe, and northeastern North America. It associates with birch trees and is typically found in boggy or <b>swampy</b> areas, often growing among sphagnum moss.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} routes was {{suitable}} for heavy freight. Lighter cargoes were carried in York boats to Hudson Bay or in canoes {{on the border}} route. Both routes required navigation of large and hazardous lakes, shallow and rapid-strewn rivers, and <b>swampy</b> creeks and bogs, connected by numerous portages where both cargo and watercraft had to be carried on men's backs.|$|E

5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more <b>swampy</b> and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|The animal {{tends to}} be found in rocky habitats. It {{occupies}} talus piles (collection of broken rock pieces at the base of cliffs, volcanoes, or valley shoulders, accumulated due to periodic rockfall from adjacent cliff faces) with larger stones and rocky areas although it does not inhabit <b>swampy</b> montane tundra or talus lacking vegetation. It may also live in burrows under tree roots or in old moss-scree.|$|E
5|$|The park hosts a {{wide range}} of upland and wetland vegetation. Algae and {{intertidal}} plants {{can be found at the}} shore including salt meadow grass, sedge, and sphagnum moss; the park's <b>swampy</b> areas have red maple and tulip trees; the upland sections include cherry, hickory, and shrubs.|$|E
50|$|Lake Isom has {{suffered}} from considerable siltation in the past, making it even shallower and <b>swampier</b> than it already was. Improved agricultural practices {{in the area are}} slowing this development, however.|$|R

5|$|There is also {{a theory}} that the term comes from the black boots of French {{soldiers}} compared to the barefoot Algerians. Other theories focus on new settlers dirtying their clothing by working in <b>swampy</b> areas, wearing black boots when on horseback, or trampling grapes to make wine.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius iodes forms {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations with}} deciduous trees, particularly oaks. The fruit bodies of Cortinarius iodes sometimes grow singly, {{but more often}} scattered or in groups under hardwood trees, in humus and litterfall. Typical habitats include bog edges, <b>swampy</b> areas, and hummocks. Fruiting usually occurs from July to November. In North America, it is common in eastern regions, and rare in the Pacific Northwest. Its distribution extends from eastern Canada south into Central America and northern regions of South America. It also occurs in northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Eight sacbe (causeways) {{have been}} located around Calakmul. Two {{of these have}} been mapped, three have been {{identified}} visually {{on the ground and}} three more identified with remote sensing. They have been numbered as Sacbe 1 through to Sacbe 7. The causeway network not only linked Calakmul with local satellite sites but also with more distant allies and rivals, such as the great cities of El Mirador, El Tintal and Nakbe. Those causeways that cross <b>swampy</b> land are elevated above the surrounding wetland and they now tend to support denser vegetation than the surrounding forest.|$|E

5|$|In 1717, {{the dark}} {{pigmentation}} of a postmortem spleen and brain {{was published by}} the epidemiologist Giovanni Maria Lancisi in his malaria text book De noxiis paludum effluviis eorumque remediis. This {{was one of the}} earliest reports of the characteristic enlargement of the spleen and dark color of the spleen and brain which are the most constant post-mortem indications of chronic malaria infection. He related the prevalence of malaria in <b>swampy</b> areas to the presence of flies and recommended swamp drainage to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In the Fruitland Formation of New Mexico, P. cyrtocristatus shared its habitat {{with other}} ornithischians and theropods. Specifically, its contemporaries were the ceratopsian Pentaceratops sternbergii; the pachycephalosaur Stegoceras novomexicanum; and some {{unidentified}} fossils belonging to Tyrannosauridae, ?Ornithomimus, ?Troodontidae, ?Saurornitholestes langstoni, ?Struthiomimus, Ornithopoda, ?Chasmosaurus, ?Corythosaurus, Hadrosaurinae, Hadrosauridae, and Ceratopsidae. When Parasaurolophus existed, the Fruitland Formation was <b>swampy,</b> positioned in the lowlands, {{and close to}} the shore of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The lowermost part of the Fruitland Formation is just younger than 75.56 ± 0.41mya, with the uppermost boundary dating to 74.55 ± 0.22mya.|$|E
5|$|In the Gibraltar Range National Park, it is a {{dominant}} shrub of open heathland and a non-dominant shrub of closed heath, mostly found in <b>swampy</b> heath associated with sedges.

50|$|The Fourth Doctor and Romana {{have arrived}} on the third moon of Delta Magna, searching for the {{penultimate}} segment of The Key to Time, finding themselves {{caught in the middle}} of a dispute between the crew of a Methane Refinery and the natives (known as 'Swampies'). The <b>Swampies</b> claim the crew have disturbed the waters, and will incur the wrath of Kroll. It turns out Kroll is a giant squid which surfaces to feed every few centuries and is the source of the abnormally large amount of methane being mined. Once of normal size, it ingested the fifth segment of the Key to Time and began to grow and became a god-like figure to the <b>Swampies</b> and their descendants.|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, Hyakutake ordered Shōji {{to abandon}} his {{positions}} at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. Although American forces had almost completely encircled Shōji's troops along Gavaga Creek at Koli, a gap existed {{by way of a}} <b>swampy</b> creek in the southern side of the American lines. Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape. The Americans closed the gap in their lines on 11 November, but by then Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{inhabited}} a {{wide range}} of marine environments (i.e., shallow coastal waters, areas of coastal upwelling, <b>swampy</b> coastal lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and exhibited a transient lifestyle. Adult megalodon were not abundant in shallow water environments, and mostly inhabited offshore areas. Megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Multnomah County {{is named}} for Native Americans {{who lived in the}} area before {{settlement}} by non-indigenous people in the 19thcentury. Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was <b>swampy,</b> and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90percent in the lower Columbia basin.|$|E
