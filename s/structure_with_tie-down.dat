The arch ribs are laterally supported at their crowns by new shear keys that link them to the reinforced deck.

500|$|Other {{examples}} include Gordie Howe's tactic {{of holding the}} sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks, was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time Buffalo Sabres enforcer Rob Ray to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped <b>with</b> <b>tie-down</b> straps ("fight straps") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to.

5000|$|The {{fabrication}} process involved several North American factories specializing in hand-craftsmanship. There are {{several layers of}} nets in the sculpture. The main body of colored net including the [...] "wormhole" [...] at the center, a structural net, which helps give the primary net its shape, and a cover net. The edge of every mesh is a different length, requiring the use of manual splicing on each joint. The two shortest steel support towers were shipped to the site complete; the third tower was shipped in halves, which were assembled and welded on-site. The suspension rings were created by a manufacturer specializing in fabricating roller coaster equipment. The rings hang concentrically 100 ft above the ground and are bound together with 1 in. diameter steel cable. The rings are secured {{to the base of}} each support tower <b>with</b> <b>tie-down</b> cables, which provide structural stability against strong winds and minimize ring movement.|$|R

50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} best bet is a Jordan holster sewn to a wide stout belt, <b>with</b> <b>tie-down</b> straps to secure {{the bottom of the}} holster firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw holster by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the holster thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the holster to shape it, then letting the holster dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the holster. For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into the holster, {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from the holster and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the holster to pop the snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|R
50|$|Open {{commercial}} car carrier trailers typically have a double-decker design, with both decks subdivided {{into a number}} of loading and storage ramps that can be tilted and lifted independently of one another with hydraulics. Unlike flatbed tow trucks, which often need to transport non-running vehicles, car carrier trailers are not equipped with loaders or winches, instead relying on the vehicles to be loaded under their own power. The trailer hydraulics allow the ramps to be aligned on a slope so cars can be driven up and secured to the ramp floor <b>with</b> chains, <b>tie-down</b> ratchets or wheel straps, after which the ramp can be tilted in any direction to optimize stacking.|$|R

50|$|The 138 year-old {{building}} was non-compliant with current building and life safety codes. Its timber structure had been compromised by indiscriminate installation of electric, gas, and plumbing utilities, {{as well as}} a subsequent reconfiguration of rooms to include private bathrooms. Rhode Island's fire codes were revised and more rigorously enforced after the 2003 Station nightclub fire, rendering the deficiencies insurmountable at Ocean House. Compliance with current life-safety standards, including those for hurricane and wind protection, required installation of interior structural shear walls, new hurricane-rated windows with new frames, a new concrete foundation <b>with</b> steel <b>tie-downs</b> throughout, stripping off all interior and exterior lead paint, and removal of interior mold requiring demolition of interior finishes.|$|R
