The model is based on short term disequilibrium assumption, in which multi period of shocks variables may play an important role. This research applies a loss function approach and uses optimum shock variables as the determinant for government spending during 1970 - 2010. The result shows that real GDP, population, and multi period shock of government spending are statistically significant. It provides evidence {{of the impact of}} multi period shocks to the realization of government spending. It implies that government faces a <b>serious</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> in determining their spending both in short and long terms.

40|$|In 1997 and 1998, {{the most}} {{important}} impulse for the Austrian economy will come from merchandise foreign trade. Exports are likely {{to benefit from the}} recovery of the European economies and the strength of the dollar, and will expand by 7 percent in 1997 and by 8 percent in 1998. Manufacturing output as well as investment in machinery and equipment will pick up markedly. In 1997, economic growth will accelerate to 1. 6 percent in real terms. 1998 will see a recovery of domestic demand, and real GDP is expected to grow by 2 percent. The current account continues to record a <b>serious</b> <b>disequilibrium.</b> The current account deficit will rise to 2 percent of GDP as a result of soaring merchandise imports, high expenditures by Austrian tourists abroad, and high net transfers to the EU. The economic recovery in Austria has not yet been strong enough to ease the strains in the labor market. In 1998, the unemployment rate will decline only slightly, to 6. 9 percent according to the traditional Austrian method, and to 4. 3 percent according to Eurostat. Inflation pressures remain low; the rate of inflation is expected to be 1. 4 percent in 1997 and 1. 6 percent in 1998. Acceleration of Export-Based Growth. Economic Outlook for 1997 and 1998...|$|E
40|$|Estimates {{made just}} before the 21 st century {{indicate}} that, by the year 2100, Earth may have between 10 and 11 billion people - not quite double the 6 billion population count reached in October 1999. Sustainable use of the planet requires that human needs be met without impairing {{the integrity of the}} planet's ecological life support system. This objective will almost certainly require equity and fairness in resource allocation among members of the human species and with natural systems upon which human depend. For the first time in history, humans have the power to create <b>serious</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> in natural systems at a global level. Nature is not vengeful, but it is opportunistic; new 'equilibrium conditions' are likely to be far less favorable to humans than present conditions. To prevent disequilibrium, a new ethos or set of guiding beliefs regarding human society's relationship with natural systems is essential. The best descriptor of the new ethos is eco-ethics (www. eeiu. org) guided by ethical science and implemented by compassionate, reasoned environmental politics. ESEP, the publication organ of the Eco-Ethics International Union, should be a powerful force in developing the necessary integration of science and value systems while maintaining the integrity of both...|$|E
40|$|The {{socio-economic}} development, {{in particular}} rapidly expending processes of industrialization or urbanization of specific countries or regions effect a <b>serious</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> ruling mechanisms of Nature. The said {{development is a}} reason of increasing threat or even of environmental degradation, {{but at the same}} time it magnifies potentials of environmental protection. Total expenditures on environment shaping and protection in Poland in 1982 reach 4 % of global investments in the whole Polish economy. It is estimated that approximately 6 % is needed in order to have the needs fulfilled. Poland is undergoing presently not only the economic and social crisis but also the ecological one. The socio-economic development, when properly understood, cannot be carried out at costs of environmental degradation. Generally speaking, the influence of tasks of protection of environment on the socio-economic development has a two fold meaning: — in the short run,, the necessity of intensified protection of environment can result in decrease of that development, — in the long run, resulted effects in environmental protection can contribute to the icrease of development rate. The protection of environment is a set of goals which must be properly accoounted for in plans and programs of a socio-economic development of the state in the interest of the present and future generations. The adopted solutions have to form the environment to reconcile laws of Nature and laws of socio-economic development.
