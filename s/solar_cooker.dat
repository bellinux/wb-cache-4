25|$|Solar Cookers International {{was founded}} in 1987 as Solar Box Cookers International. Two American women {{described}} as American's serious <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> promoters in the 1970s, Barbara Kerr and Sherry Cole partnered with other supporters to form this organization.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> {{designs are}} {{affected}} by strong winds, which can slow the cooking process, cool the food due to convective losses, and disturb the reflector. It {{may be necessary to}} anchor the reflector, such as with string and weighted objects like bricks.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} type of <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> is the box cooker first {{built by}} Horace de Saussure in 1767.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{research}} project show that <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> can be introduced and distributed successfully in countries with severe problems {{in the field of}} energy (firewood) supply. However, a precondition is that these <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> are adjusted {{to the needs of the}} corresponding user group. The most important adjustments are: The users must be able to prepare their traditional meals with <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> without having to change their cooking habits. The handling of <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> must be simple and without any risks. Another important aspect for the acceptance and distribution of <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> is the acquisition price of the systems. The manufacturing of <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> in these countries is essential for the reduction of the acquisition price. This would be a possible solution in several countries. Thus a network of manufacturers would be established which enabled the distribution of <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> area-wide. The current field test program run by GTZ in South Africa aims at the same target. Seven different <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> (amongst others those described in chapter 3. 2 and 3. 3) at various locations (small and large families, institutes) are tested. The <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> which have been accepted the most by the users are supposed to be manufactured locally after the completion of the field test phase.

25|$|An instrumentalist, {{he invented}} the <b>solar</b> <b>cooker,</b> which was first built at Mount Wilson Observatory, the solar boiler, and held fifteen other patents related to solar energy.

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to burn food in a <b>solar</b> <b>cooker.</b> Food that has been cooked even an hour longer than necessary is usually indistinguishable from minimally cooked food. The exception to this rule is some green vegetables, which quickly change from a perfectly cooked bright green to olive drab, while still retaining the desirable texture.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic <b>solar</b> <b>cooker,</b> you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E

25|$|SCI was {{instrumental}} {{in the formation of the}} Solar Cookers International Network, which is an association of approximately 500 non-governmental organizations and government agencies, manufacturers, and individuals promoting solar cooking throughout the world. The Solar Cookers International Network wiki includes over 1700 articles categorized by country, individual, NGO, manufacturer, and <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> designs. Also included is information regarding related technologies such as heat-retention cooking, water pasteurization, solar food processing, solar food drying, solar autoclaving, and solar canning.

25|$|Some <b>solar</b> <b>cookers,</b> {{especially}} <b>solar</b> ovens, {{take longer}} to cook food than a conventional stove or oven. Using <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> may require food preparation start hours before the meal.

25|$|Food is {{prepared}} {{as if for}} an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be. For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole. For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.|$|E
500|$|Solar cookers use {{sunlight}} for cooking, drying and pasteurization. They can {{be grouped}} into three broad categories: box cookers, panel cookers and reflector cookers. The simplest <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> is the box cooker first built by Horace de Saussure in 1767. A basic box cooker {{consists of an}} insulated container with a transparent lid. It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of [...] Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of [...] and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>cooker</b> is {{a device}} which uses {{the energy of}} direct {{sunlight}} to heat, cook or [...] pasteurise drink. Many solar cookers currently in use are relatively inexpensive, low-tech devices, although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves, and advanced, large-scale solar cookers can cook for hundreds of people. Because they use no fuel and cost nothing to operate, many nonprofit organizations are promoting their use worldwide {{in order to help}} reduce fuel costs (especially where monetary reciprocity is low) and air pollution, and to slow down the deforestation and desertification caused by gathering firewood for cooking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>cookers</b> are {{a type of}} {{equipment}} that are powered by the sun, and no other fuel is required, creating a positive environmental impact. There are large variations of design and functionality, where the parabolic <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> offer the highest temperature, often more than 750 degrees F. SolSource solar stove {{is an example of}} a high-temperature solar stove.|$|R
2500|$|... 2) Converting {{light energy}} to heat energy: <b>Solar</b> <b>cookers</b> {{concentrate}} sunlight onto a receiver {{such as a}} cooking pan. The interaction between the light energy and the receiver material converts light to heat. This conversion is maximized by using materials that conduct and retain heat. Pots and pans used on <b>solar</b> <b>cookers</b> should be matte black in color to maximize the absorption.|$|R
