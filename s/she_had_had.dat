5|$|Alkin made {{financial}} claims {{from the state}} for her nursing, {{some of which were}} paid, although a petition of 1654 refers to her severe illness. The same letter stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> to sell many of her possessions, including her bed. A petition for financial relief from May 1655 is the last recorded note on her, and it is presumed that she died soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{she visited}} India at the {{invitation}} of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who had been impressed by Princess Andrew's interest in Indian religious thought, and for her own spiritual quest. The trip was cut short when she unexpectedly took ill, and her sister-in-law, Edwina Mountbatten, who happened to be passing through Delhi on her own tour, had to smooth things with the Indian hosts who were taken aback at Princess Andrew's sudden change of plans. She later claimed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> an out-of-body experience. Edwina continued her own tour, and died the following month.|$|E
5|$|In {{a highly}} publicized scandal, Beecher was tried on charges that he had {{committed}} adultery with a friend's wife, Elizabeth Tilton. In 1870, Elizabeth had confessed to her husband, Theodore Tilton, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a relationship with Beecher. The charges became public when Theodore told Elizabeth Cady Stanton of his wife's confession. Stanton repeated the story to fellow women's rights leaders Victoria Woodhull and Isabella Beecher Hooker.|$|E

5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. As {{the years went by}} she suffered serious setbacks to her health and the sadness of mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a genuine affection. Rendered financially independent by a legacy, she purchased a house in Paris, from which she spent {{the end of her life}} dispensing charity and keeping up dignified correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Victor and {{his mother}} scream at each other because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with Oscar, {{and because of that}} Victor had {{informed}} the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Elizabeth remained in Edinburgh. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> daughter (Mary) in 1919 and a son (Theo) in 1924, to different fathers (neither of whom was Billy Sing). She travelled to Australia during 1925 with her two children, and settled in Paddington, NSW. She adopted the surname of her son's father. She lived in New South Wales with her son's father until her death in Wollongong in the 1970s. It is not known whether she had any contact with Billy after her arrival in Australia.|$|E

5|$|Reich and Ilse Ollendorff {{divorced}} in September 1951, ostensibly {{because he thought}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> an affair. She continued working with him for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and persuaded her to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which he locked away in the archives of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced {{to adapt to a}} new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|Faye begins dating Sam, {{unaware that}} he is {{cheating}} on her with Ward Sister Chrissie Williams. She ends their relationship when she discovers his infidelity and turns her attention to Joseph, {{who had tried to}} warn her about Sam's indiscretion.

When STI clinician Tim attacks staff members with a crossbow, Faye is shot in the back, but makes a full recovery. She reveals to Joseph that she was formerly married to a much older man named Donald, who left her a substantial amount of money after his death from cancer.

5|$|Gillibrand's legal {{representation}} of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her {{work on behalf of}} Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an associate at her law firm, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> {{a series of}} rows with Bamber. He {{seemed to want to}} end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
5|$|If found, punishments {{ranged from}} death, {{to time in}} the pillory, to being ordered never to dress as a man again. Henry Fielding wrote a {{pamphlet}} titled The Female Husband in 1746, based {{on the life of}} Mary Hamilton, who was arrested after marrying a woman while masquerading as a man, and was sentenced to public whipping and six months in jail. Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717, executed in 1721; Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons, but was exposed by a woman with whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, Shulgin was {{introduced}} to MDMA by {{a student in the}} medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1912 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> four children.|$|E
5|$|Lansbury's Murder, She Wrote fame {{resulted}} in her being employed {{to appear in}} advertisements and infomercials for Bufferin, MasterCard and the Beatrix Potter Company. In 1988, she released a video titled Angela Lansbury's Positive Moves: My Personal Plan for Fitness and Well-Being, in which she outlined her personal exercise routine, and in 1990 published a book with the same title co-written with Mimi Avins, which she dedicated to her mother. As {{a result of her}} work she was awarded a CBE by the British government, given to her in a ceremony by Charles, Prince of Wales at the British consulate in Los Angeles.

5|$|John's first wife, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was {{released}} from imprisonment in 1214; she remarried twice, and died in 1217. John's second wife, Isabella of Angoulême, left England for Angoulême soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> by John. John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as King of England {{for the majority of}} the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan became Queen of Scotland on her marriage to Alexander II. Isabella was Holy Roman Empress as the wife of Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons – Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip – and three daughters – Joan, Maud and probably Isabel.

5|$|On {{the night}} of September 18, 1964, Kinne left the hotel without Pugliese, either to acquire money because the couple was running low or to get {{medicine}} she required. Kinne encountered Francisco Parades Ordoñez, a Mexican-born American citizen, at a bar that night and accompanied {{him back to his}} room in Hotel La Vada. According to Kinne's account, she went with Ordoñez to see photographs he offered to show her, but he soon began to make sexual advances toward her and she was forced to fire her gun at him in an attempt to protect herself. Kinne maintained later that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> no intention of killing or harming Ordoñez, and had intended only to frighten him, but her bullets struck him in the chest and killed him. Responding to the sound of gunfire, hotel employee Enrique Martinez Rueda entered the room. Kinne fired again and hit Rueda in the shoulder. Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and called the police.|$|E
