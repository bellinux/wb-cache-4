40|$|The {{management}} of operational value-at-risk (OpVaR) in financial institutions is presented {{by means of}} a novel, robust calculation technique and the influence of this value on the capital held by a bank for operational risk. A clear distinction between economic and regulatory capital is made, as well as the way OpVaR models may be used to calculate both types of capital. Under the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), banks may employ OpVaR models to calculate regulatory capital; this article therefore illustrates the differences in regulatory capital when using the AMA and the <b>Standardised</b> <b>Approach</b> (<b>SA),</b> {{by means of a}}n example. Economic capital is found to converge with regulatory capital using the AMA, but not if the SA is used...|$|E
40|$|Number: 14 - 73 a This note {{presents}} {{comparisons of}} risk weights calculated using three approaches {{proposed in the}} recent Basel consultative paper on securitisation capital, BCBS 269. 1 These approaches are the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA), the External Ratings Based Approach (ERBA) and the <b>Standardised</b> <b>Approach</b> (<b>SA).</b> The data we employ is supplied {{by a group of}} eight GFMA member banks and comprises capital estimates and other data fields for 4, 614 individual securitisation tranches. We compare the capital implied by the different approaches, focussing on two dimensions of consistency: (i) comparisons of average risk weight levels for particular asset classes and (ii) correlations of individual tranche risk weights implied by the approaches. We find that the average levels of capital for asset classes are quite different when one compares IRBA, ERBA and SA risk weights for particular asset classes. Some discrepancies in average capita...|$|E

40|$|This paper simulates {{the minimum}} capital {{requirements}} for the wholesale exposures of a medium-sized bank in each EMU country depending on the credit rating agencies chosen by the bank to risk-weight its exposures in the <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> to credit risk in Basel II. Three main results emerge from the analysis. First, although the use of different combinations of credit rating agencies leads to significant differences in minimum capital requirements, these differences never exceed 10 % of EMU banks’ regulatory capital for wholesale exposures on average. Second, the <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> provides a small regulatory capital incentive for banks to use several credit rating agencies to risk-weight their exposures. Third, the minimum capital {{requirements for the}} wholesale exposures of EMU banks will be higher in Basel II than in Basel I.

The minimum capital {{requirements}} for the corporate, interbank and sovereign loan portfolios of a representative bank in each EMU country are evaluated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations depending on the credit rating agencies chosen by the bank to risk-weight its exposures. Three main results emerge from the analysis. First, although the use of different combinations of credit rating agencies leads to significant differences in minimum capital requirements, these differences never exceed 10 % of banks’ regulatory capital for loans to corporates, banks and sovereigns on average in the EMU.

40|$|The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision {{designed}} {{a system of}} risk weights (the so called <b>standardised</b> <b>approach)</b> to measure the riskiness of banksÂ’ loan portfolios. Its ability to adequately reflect risk is empirically investigated in this paper, through {{an analysis of the}} economic capital allocations implied in corporate bond spreads. This is based on a unique dataset of issuance spreads, ratings and other relevant bond variables (such as maturity, face value, time of issuance and currency of denomination) including 7, 232 eurobonds issued mostly by Canadian, European, Japanese and U. S. companies during 1991 - 2003. Three main results emerge. First, the spread/rating relationship is strongly significant with spreads increasing when ratings worsen. Second, the estimated spreads per rating class indicate that the risk/rating relationship might be steeper than the one approved by the Basel Committee. Finally the difference between the spread/rating relation of banks and non-financial firms appears quite blurred and statistically questionable. Following this empirical evidence, we underline some adjustments in the <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> risk-weights that might be considered for the future versions of the Basel Accord. eurobonds, credit ratings, spreads, capital regulation, banks. ...|$|R
