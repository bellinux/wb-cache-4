5|$|In the Italian {{province}} of Massa and Carrara, {{located within the}} Tuscany region, it was a peasant food consumed as a one-course meal, topped with grated cheese and olive oil. In Massa and Carrara, it was sometimes accompanied with <b>stracchino</b> cheese or charcuterie. Testaroli remains a very popular dish in Pontremoli, a small city in the {{province of}} Massa and Carrara, where it is served at virtually every restaurant in the city, during both mornings and evenings. Testaroli is also a common and specialty dish in the Lunigiana region and historical territory of Italy, which is located between the Liguria and Tuscany regions.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the meat}} and poultry and bread market. There are stalls of new, various-shaped bread, brown and bright: there are tiny stalls of marvellous native cakes, which I want to taste, {{there is a great}} deal of meat and kid: and there are stalls of cheese, all cheeses, all shapes, all whitenesses, all the cream-colours, on into {{daffodil}} yellow. Goat cheese, sheeps cheese, Swiss cheese, Parmegiano, <b>stracchino,</b> caciocavallo, torolone, how many cheeses I don't know the names of! But they cost about the same as in Sicily, eighteen francs, twenty francs, twenty-five francs the kilo. And there is lovely ham--thirty and thirty-five francs the kilo. There is a little fresh butter too--thirty or thirty-two francs the kilo. Most of the butter, however, is tinned in Milan. It costs the same as the fresh. There are splendid piles of salted black olives, and huge bowls of green salted olives. There are chickens and ducks and wild-fowl: at eleven and twelve and fourteen francs a kilo. There is mortadella, the enormous Bologna sausage, thick as a church pillar: 16 francs: and there are various sorts of smaller sausage, salami, to be eaten in slices. A wonderful abundance of food, glowing and shining. We are rather late for fish, especially on Friday. But a barefooted man offers us two weird objects from the Mediterranean, which teems with marine monsters.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stracchino</b> (...) , {{also known}} as crescenza (...) , {{is a type of}} Italian cow’s-milk cheese, typical of Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto, and Liguria. It is eaten very young, has no rind and a very soft, creamy texture and {{normally}} a mild and delicate flavour. It is normally square in shape.|$|E
50|$|Mascarpone {{originated}} in the area between Lodi and Abbiategrasso, Italy, southwest of Milan, probably in the late 16th or early 17th century. The name is popularly held to derive from mascarpa, an unrelated milk product made from the whey of <b>stracchino</b> (a young, barely aged cheese), or from mascarpia, a word in the local dialect for ricotta. Ricotta, unlike mascarpone, is made from whey.|$|E
50|$|Robiola is an Italian soft-ripened cheese of the <b>Stracchino</b> family. It is {{from the}} Langhe region and made with varying {{proportions}} of cow’s, goat’s milk and sheep milk. One {{theory is that the}} cheese gets its name from the town of Robbio in the province of Pavia; another that the name comes from the word rubeole (ruddy) {{because of the color of}} the seasoned rind.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stracchino</b> {{is usually}} eaten {{on its own}} {{but also as a}} filling for some kinds of bread: in Recco, on the Ligurian riviera east of Genoa, focaccia col formaggio ("cheese focaccia") or focaccia di Recco is {{typically}} filled with crescenza, while in Romagna and in parts of some nearby regions (e.g. northern Marche, Umbria and eastern Tuscany) it is a common filling for piadina.|$|E
5000|$|Recco (Latin: Ricina / Recina) is a comune in the Metropolitan City of Genoa, {{region of}} Liguria, Italy. It {{is known for}} its focaccia al formaggio (focaccia with cheese) which is made with <b>stracchino.</b> The {{consortium}} that dictates the official recipe of the focaccia, supposedly the result of a Saracen attack in the 13th century, is seeking the European Union PGI status for the recipe.|$|E

5000|$|The Mediterranea Italiana {{is raised}} and {{selectively}} bred principally {{for the production}} of the buffalo milk used to make buffalo mozzarella, notably the Mozzarella di Bufala Campana of Campania, which has Denominazione di origine controllata (DOP) status. Other dairy products including burrata, caciotta di bufala, ricotta di bufala, scamorza di bufala, <b>stracchino</b> di bufala, stracciatella di bufala and yoghurt are also made from the milk. Lactation lasts on average 277 days, and usually yields [...] of milk; yields of [...] per lactation are not uncommon. In 2012 a total of [...] of buffalo milk was produced in Italy, about 1.7% of total milk production in that year; the fat content was an average of 7.92%.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stracchino</b> {{is a short}} ripened {{soft cheese}} mainly {{produced}} in the North of Italy. The changes in <b>Stracchino</b> cheese quality are mainly attributable to microbial spoilage and structure breakdown because of enzymatic activity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of different packaging materials on the shelf life of <b>Stracchino</b> cheese, monitoring changes in rheological, microbiological and sensorial properties over 28 days at 4 C. Three packaging materials were compared in order to optimize the suitable packaging for <b>Stracchino</b> cheese: (1) paper-polyethylene as a reference package commonly used for this product [R]; (2) commercial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) -based film, mainly composed of calcium carbonate and HDPE (Ovtene® [OV]); and (3) experimental active packaging obtained with addition of potassium sorbate to OV (active Ovtene® [AOV]). The OV and AOV resulted more effective to control microbial spoilage than R, without affecting sensorial and chemical properties. AOV allowed the inhibition of yeast growth, probably because of the activity of potassium sorbate. The gel structure, which characterizes the <b>Stracchino</b> cheese, was maintained until 21 days with the application of AOV, while a liquid-like behavior was associated to the sample packed with the reference material after 14 days. Microbiological, rheological and sensory results demonstrated the effectiveness of AOV in prolonging <b>Stracchino</b> cheese storabilit...|$|E
40|$|<b>Stracchino</b> is {{a typical}} Italian soft cheese, widely {{consumed}} and appreciated for its flavour and freshness. With the aim to follow the release of health-promoting peptides, an in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion of <b>Stracchino</b> was carried out. The digest was fractionated by semi-preparative RPLC and tested for its antioxidant properties in H 2 O 2 -treated intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC- 6). The most active fraction was characterized by UHPLC-MS/MS, showing the presence of two abundant β-casein hexapeptides: EAMAPK (f: 115 – 120) and AVPYPQ (f: 192 – 197), which were synthesized and tested, showing antioxidant activities in a wide concentration range (5 – 150 [*]µg/mL), involving ROS reduction, SOD expression increase and Nrf 2 antioxidant response activation. Hence, bioavailability {{studies were carried out}} through Caco- 2 monolayers cells on the two hexapeptides, which revealed a significative concentration in the basolateral side. The results highlight the potential of <b>Stracchino</b> as health promoting food, and the possible employment of casein peptides in nutraceutical formulations...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} are important sources of macro- and trace elements for human health. However, fresh cheeses usually have a lower mineral content than other cheeses, and this makes mineral prediction more difficult. Although mineral prediction in several food matrices using infrared spectroscopy {{has been reported in}} the literature, very little information is available for cheeses. The present study was aimed at developing near-infrared reflectance (NIR, 866 – 2, 530 nm) and transmittance (NIT, 850 – 1, 050 nm) spectroscopy models to predict the major mineral content of fresh cheeses. We analyzed samples of mozzarella (n = 130) and <b>Stracchino</b> (n = 118) using reference methods and NIR and NIT spectroscopy. We developed prediction models using partial least squares regression analysis, and subjected them to cross- and external validation. Average Na content was 0. 15 and 0. 22 g/ 100 g for mozzarella and <b>Stracchino,</b> respectively. The NIR and NIT spectroscopy performed similarly, with few exceptions. Nevertheless, none of the prediction models was accurate enough to replace the current reference analysis. The most accurate prediction model was for the Na content of mozzarella cheese using NIT spectroscopy (coefficient of determination of external validation = 0. 75). We obtained the same accuracy of prediction for P in <b>Stracchino</b> cheese with both NIR and NIT spectroscopy. Our results confirmed that mineral content is difficult to predict using NIT and NIR spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} structure changes in <b>Stracchino</b> cheese during storage using rheological measurements. Three packaging materials were used: 1) cellophane-polyethylene as a reference package commonly use for this product (R); 2) calcium polycarbonate and HDPE (Ovtene, OV); 3) active Ovtene, obtained by addition of potassium sorbate to OV (AOV). Product structure was evaluated using rheological oscillatory measurements in linear viscoelastic range (frequency sweep test) over 28 days...|$|E
40|$|The {{formulation}} of innovative packaging solutions, exerting a functional antimicrobial role in slowing down food spoilage, {{is expected to}} {{have a significant impact on}} the food industry, allowing both the maintenance of food safety criteria for longer periods and the reduction of food waste. Different materials are considered able to exert the required antimicrobial activity, among which are materials containing silver. However, challenges exist in the application of silver to food contact materials due to knowledge gaps in the production of ingredients, stability of delivery systems in food matrices and health risks caused by the same properties which also offer the benefits. Aims of the present study were to test the effectiveness and suitability of two packaging systems, one of which contained silver, for packaging and storing <b>Stracchino</b> cheese, a typical Italian fresh cheese, and to investigate if there was any potential for consumers to be exposed to silver, via migration from the packaging to the cheese. Results did not show any significant difference in the effectiveness of the packaging systems on packaged <b>Stracchino</b> cheese, excluding that the active packaging systems exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of spoilage microorganisms. Moreover, silver migrated into the cheese matrix throughout the storage time (24 days). Silver levels in cheese finally exceeded the maximum established level for the migration of a non-authorised substance through a functional barrier (Commission Regulation (EC) No. 450 / 2009). This result poses safety concerns and strongly suggests the need for more research aimed at better characterizing the new packaging materials in terms of their potential impacts on human health and the environment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{complete}} data obtained in previous studies with a survey on cis 9,trans 11 (c 9,t 11) and trans 10,cis 12 (t 10,c 12) conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content in cheeses collected from Italian large-scale retail trade. This {{is an integral part}} of a total study characterising food CLA content, with objective of estimating daily CLA intake of Italian consumers. Among the sampled cheeses (n = 102), Gruyere and Feta (10. 21 and 8. 50 mg g(- 1) fat, respectively) had the highest (P 180 d) showed higher c 9,t 11 values than those with a shorter maturation period. The t 10,c 12 CLA isomer was almost absent, being detected only in Gruyere, <b>Stracchino,</b> Robiola, Philadelphia and Scamorza, with values up to 0. 4 mg g(- 1) fat. These data improved knowledge about CLA content of dairy products, and this will help make an accurate estimate of CLA ingested by Italian consumers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
