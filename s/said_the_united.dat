500|$|Union Environment and Forests Minister Javadekar {{said the}} exact {{causes of the}} {{flooding}} – whether the result of climate change or stemming from other causes – remained in [...] "a grey area" [...] as experts had differing opinions.

According to Javadekar, the recent extreme rainfall across the region was [...] "highly localised" [...] and could not be definitively attributed to the effects of climate-change. [...] " [...] extreme rainfall that occurred over [...] coastal districts of Tamil Nadu is part of the natural variability of the Indian monsoon system. Although some studies have reported an increase in frequency and intensity of extremes in rainfall during the past 40–50 years, their attribution to global warming is not established."
