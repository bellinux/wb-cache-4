2500|$|During Hugo Chávez's tenure, {{he seized}} {{thousands}} of properties and businesses while also reducing the footprint of foreign companies. Venezuela's economy was then largely state-run and was operated by military officers that had their {{business and government}} affairs connected. <b>Senior</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Institution, Harold Trinkunas, stated that involving the military in business was [...] "a danger", with Trinkunas explaining that the Venezuelan military [...] "has the greatest ability to coerce people, into business like they have". According to Bloomberg Business, [...] "y showering contracts on former military officials and pro-government business executives, Chavez put a new face on the system of patronage".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the court}} stated {{clearly that the}} {{decision}} {{is limited to the}} contraceptive mandate (Syllabus p.4-5), the ruling is seen to have consequences extending far beyond contraception. Walter Dellinger, former acting solicitor general said, [...] "for the first time, commercial enterprises could successfully claim religious exemptions from laws that govern everyone else." [...] Fifteen states had filed a brief arguing that businesses would be able to deny coverage for transfusions, stem cell treatments, and psychiatric care. In line with the dissenting opinion, The American Prospect asked, [...] "ill the taxpayers have to send a check to employees if employers feel that minimum wage laws violate their religious beliefs?" [...] Jonathan Rauch, a <b>senior</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Institution, said that objections to paying health benefits for same-sex spouses will get traction. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLT) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights withdrew their support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed by the Senate, saying that its religious exemptions would allow companies to fire or refuse to hire LGBT workers in light of the Hobby Lobby ruling. NGLT executive director Rea Carey said, [...] "We do not take this move lightly. We've been pushing for this bill for 20 years." ...|$|E
