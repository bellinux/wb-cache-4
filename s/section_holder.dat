40|$|AbstractThis paper {{consists}} of three parts. In Section 2, the Cauchy problem for general reaction-convection equations with a special diffusion term G(u) =um in multidimensional space is studied and Hölder estimates of weak solutions with explicit Hölder exponents are obtained by applying the maximum principle. In Section 3, for any nondecreasing smooth function G, the sharp regularity estimate G(u) ∈C(1) up to the boundaries for the radial solution u of the general equation of Newtonian filtration is obtained by applying the maximum principle with the Minty's device. A direct by-product is the sharp regularity estimate of the temperature to the classical two-phase Stefan model. In <b>Section</b> 4, the <b>Hölder</b> continuity of weak solutions of the initial-boundary value problem for general nonlinear reaction–diffusion–convection equations is considered. Under the critical condition on the diffusion function G:meas{u:G′(u) =g(u) = 0 }= 0, we obtain a Hölder continuous solution u and the sharp regularity estimate G(u) ∈C(1) up to the boundaries. Our proof {{is based on the}} maximum principle...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{a few years}} after the end of the Zia dictatorship, the {{passport}} changed again. The green became slightly lighter in colour, and the English words 'Islamic Republic of Pakistan' were once again pushed up and the Urdu ones pushed down. The Arabic text was removed, but the <b>section</b> noting the <b>holder's</b> faith remained and so did the declaration denouncing the Ahmadiyya community. This version of the passport has remained as is till this day, even though the Pervez Musharraf regime (1999-2008) attempted to replace the words 'Islamic Republic of Pakistan' with the old 'Republic of Pakistan'. But the attempt failed due to protests by religious parties. After 9/11, and the rise of religious militancy in Pakistan, more and more countries stopped providing on-arrival-visa facilities to Pakistanis. Pakistanis now require a pre-arrival visa for China as well. Today, only 29 countries provide on-arrival-visas to Pakistanis, most of whom are in Africa.|$|R

We have to make dimensional measurements of drawn cups for various reasons such as effects of lubricants in deep drawing. The methods of measurement of cup dimensions for study of using different lubricants were studied.

40|$|This Article {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} account of non-Voting Rights Act federal voting laws. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act—long the most effective voting rights law in American history—was disabled by the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. <b>Holder.</b> <b>Section</b> 2 of the Voting Rights Act is in the crosshairs. As the Supreme Court becomes more hostile to race-based antidiscrimination laws like the Voting Rights Act, Congress will turn to race-neutral, election administration-based reforms to strengthen the right to vote. Indeed, many proposals for reform post-Shelby County have taken this form. The federal laws this Article examines—the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) —regulate major aspects of the elections process: voter registration, absentee ballots, voting machine technology, and accessibility for disabled persons. These statutes, and the model of regulation they illustrate, both represent the future of federal election law and present previously unstudied challenges with implications for election law broadly. Federal legislation that seeks to regulate and standardize elections implicates complicated relationships among federal, state, and local governments. This domain of “election law federalism” has two distinct features: (1) unusually expansive federal power to legislate pursuant to the Elections Clause; and (2) widespread state prerogative to delegate election responsibilities to local government. Because of these unusual characteristics, federal election laws of the kind this Article discusses run in perceived tension with traditional federalism doctrines like the anticommandeering principle and state authority to organize its own subdivisions. That tension has created enforcement difficulties and widespread noncompliance with the statutes. This Article proposes reforms that would allow federal election legislation to accommodate {{the realities of the}} elections system and more effectively optimize the roles of federal, state, and local governments within the elections system...|$|R
5000|$|Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, {{also known}} as the Fair Housing Act (FHA), bars {{discrimination}} against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling because of race. By passing the FHA, Congress intended to promote racial integration as well as nondiscrimination as national goals. [...] However, despite the passage of the FHA, scholars argue that pervasive racial discrimination and segregation exist within the public housing system, particularly in the Section 8 Program. One of the major problems with the Section 8 Program is that since participation in it is voluntary, many recipients are unable to find landlords to accept the vouchers. [...] The discrimination against voucher holders {{is said to be a}} general problem. The widespread discrimination reduces the utility of the voucher program, and frustrates the purported goal of the legislation, which is to end housing segregated by race and income. In addition, while the refusal to accept the vouchers appears racially neutral on its face, many housing advocates contend that the acceptability and legality of Section 8 discrimination enables landlords to use it as a proxy for other legally prohibited kinds of discrimination, such as that based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, family status, or disability. [...] For example, studies show that the discrimination against <b>Section</b> 8 voucher <b>holders</b> increases if the recipient is African American or Latino. [...] Thus, the Section 8 Program has not been entirely successful at ending housing segregation. Many recipients end up using their subsidies to pay for their current low-income housing units or move within their own segregated neighborhoods. [...] Because of discrimination against voucher holders, many subsidy recipients can only find housing in neighborhoods where they already are in the racial majority.|$|R
40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. Collet chuck holder is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC milling machines. The chuck holder is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} machine, taper portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the spindle for changing holder and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of collet chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated <b>sections,</b> collet chuck <b>holder</b> in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed processes to manufacture collet chuck holder. In the present investigation, upper bound method is used to analyze the combined extrusion/forging process of different types of collet chuck holders. A set of kinematically admissible velocity field is proposed to predict the metal flow pattern and the forging load. This work also employed 3 D finite element formulation to simulate the combined extrusion/forging process for axisymmetric collet chuck holders. The forming loads obtained by proposed upper bound technique is in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results and lies in the range of 0 - 15...|$|R
