5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of the market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Republican politicians, such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, tested the waters {{for a run}} but chose to <b>stay</b> <b>out.</b> New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against {{corporate}} corruption. The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages. Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Stalin {{repeatedly}} {{proposed a}} plan to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations if the new Germany were to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers. Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.|$|E

5|$|A tabloid {{paper offers}} a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing {{the town to}} be {{inundated}} with hunters and reporters. The sheriff forbids anyone from going {{in the woods and}} hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E

Christopher's addiction to heroin deepens, prompting his associates and family to organize an intervention, after which he enters a drug rehabilitation center. Adriana befriends {{a woman who is}} an undercover FBI agent. When the friendship ends, the woman reveals herself as an FBI agent and tells Adriana the only way to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of prison is to become an informant. Adriana agrees and starts sharing information with the FBI.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Duncan was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} last two players for the United States national team for the World Basketball Championship. However, this team was later replaced with CBA and college players because of the NBA lockout. Duncan's first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but a knee injury forced him to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of the Olympic Games themselves.|$|E

5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear that federal intervention {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of the war.|$|E
5|$|Many {{emerging}} {{nations of}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected {{the pressure to}} choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of the Cold War. The consensus reached at Bandung culminated {{with the creation of}} the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.|$|E

Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the player}} take severe damage, the screen will turn red {{and the sound}} of the character's {{heartbeat}} will increase in volume; this indicates the player's health is low. The player must find a way to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of fire to recover before entering battle again or else will die and restart from the last checkpoint. Health is only restored through automatic recharging when the player is not taking fire. Some attacks, such as explosions from grenades or shells, will kill the player instantly if the player is too close.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{replacement}} was Ron Suart, {{who wanted}} Matthews to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> wide, {{and did not}} value his contribution {{in the way that}} Smith had done. Suart limited Matthews to 19 league appearances in 1958–59. Matthews was then used just 15 times in 1959–60, as Suart signed Arthur Kaye to take his place, and local lad Steve Hill also vied for the outside-right position. He enjoyed more games in 1960–61, playing 27 league games as the club narrowly avoiding relegation by the odd point.|$|E

5|$|The border war {{escalated}} in 1777 after British {{officials in}} Detroit began recruiting and arming Indian war parties to raid the frontier American settlements. An {{unknown number of}} American settlers in present Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania were killed during these raids. The intensity of the conflict increased in November 1777, after enraged American militiamen murdered Cornstalk, the leading advocate of Shawnee neutrality. Despite the violence, many Ohio Indians still hoped to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of the war, which proved difficult because they were located directly between the British in Detroit and the Americans along the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith died {{soon after}} Wilfrid's arrival back in England. The new king, Eadwulf, had been {{considered}} one of Wilfrid's friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of Northumbria. Eadwulf's reign lasted {{only a few months}} however, before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith's son Osred, to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser. Wilfrid may have been one of Osred's chief supporters, along with Oswiu's daughter Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, and the nobleman Beornhæth. Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, however, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to York. This appointment meant John's transfer from Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham, which he did until his death.|$|E
5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with its}} {{classification}} as {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for {{the west coast of}} Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach, with a tropical storm watch declared from Keaton Beach northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also issued for non-coastal and non-tidal areas of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The passage of the storm resulted in an increased threat for rip currents, with officials recommending that swimmers <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of the water until the storm leaves the area. A tornado watch was also posted for the southern portion of the state, though was dropped after the storm weakened.|$|E
5|$|In 1314, Château Gaillard was {{the prison}} of Margaret and Blanche of Burgundy, future queens of France; {{they had been}} convicted of {{adultery}} in the Tour de Nesle Affair, and after having their heads shaved they were locked away in the fortress. Following the Scottish defeat at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333 during the Second War of Scottish Independence, the child-king David II and certain of his court were forced to flee to France for safety. At the time, southern Scotland was occupied by the forces of King Edward III of England. David, then nine years old, and his bride Joan of the Tower, the twelve-year-old daughter of Edward II, were granted the use of Château Gaillard by Philip VI. It remained their residence until David's return to Scotland in 1341. David did not <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> of English hands for long after his return; he was captured after the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346 and endured an eleven-year captivity in the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to <b>stay</b> <b>out,</b> the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E
