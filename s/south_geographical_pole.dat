40|$|Of Martian expeditionary accomplishments, the Trans-Mars Expedition is {{the most}} audacious {{in terms of the}} {{logistical}} challenges imposed upon it and diversity of scientific foci it could encompass. The ~ 21, 000 km expedition requires two transpolar assaults on the Martian north and <b>south</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>poles,</b> a traverse across the summit of Mount Olympus and traverses across the interconnecting desert regions of Mars. Taking lessons suggested for Martian desert, polar and mountain expeditions, I describe this expedition using a 120 °W, 300 °W longitudinal route. I quantify the in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) requirements for oxygen, water and fuel. Calculations suggest that ISRU of the martian atmosphere can be used to supply vehicle fuel and to replenish oxygen and water throughout the expedition duration at mean rates of progress and with certain assumptions on oxygen and water usage. Equipment requirements are reviewed with a special focus on equipment that can be modified for use in all of the environments encountered. As its scientific objective, the expedition would undertake a study of volcanism, desert and polar processes over a planetary transect contributing significantly to the inventory of samples gathered across the Martian surface. The planning of such an expedition provides a reference expedition for considering ISRU and scientific requirements for any long-duration, long-distance scientific expeditionary EVA on Mars...|$|R

50|$|It {{was during}} his time at the {{observatory}} that he made the crucial observation {{that led to his}} discovery of geomagnetic reversal.

An analysis optimized to search for the neutralino-induced flux from the Sun has been developed.

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of the ice at the <b>geographical</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> have been investigated at depths between 0. 8 and 1 kilometer. The absorption and scattering lengths of visible light (∼ 515 nanometers) have been measured in situ {{with the use of}} the laser calibration setup of the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) neutrino detector. The ice is intrinsically extremely transparent. The measured absorption length is 59 ± 3 meters, comparable with the quality of the ultrapure water used in the Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven and Kamiokande proton-decay and neutrino experiments and more than twice as long as the best value reported for laboratory ice. Because of a residual density of air bubbles at these depths, the trajectories of photons in the medium are randomized. If the bubbles are assumed to be smooth and spherical, the average distance between collisions at a depth of 1 kilometer is about 25 centimeters. The measured inverse scattering length on bubbles decreases linearly with increasing depth in the volume of ice investigated...|$|R

A two-dimensional skymap is presented with an evidence of 0. 06 % large scale anisotropy. The energy dependence of this anisotropy at median energies per CR particle of 12 TeV and 126 TeV is also presented in this work.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the eighties, in {{response}} to a reported increase of the total neutrino flux in the Homestake experiment in coincidence with solar flares, neutrino detectors have searched for signals of neutrinos associated with solar flare activity. Protons which are accelerated by the magnetic structures of such flares may collide with the solar atmosphere, producing mesons which subsequently decay, resulting in neutrinos at O(MeV-GeV) energies. The study of such neutrinos would provide a new window on the underlying physics of the acceleration process. The sensitivity to solar flares of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the <b>geographical</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole,</b> is currently under study.

5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} unpublished plan envisaged basing {{himself at}} the old Discovery Expedition headquarters in McMurdo Sound. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the <b>geographical</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> and the South Magnetic Pole. Other journeys would follow, {{and there would be}} a continuous programme of scientific work. This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and a specially designed motor vehicle. Neither ponies nor motor traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by Frederick Jackson during the Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition of 1894–97. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from Nansen, the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10. By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic £30,000 (updated value £). However, the response of the RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott.|$|R
50|$|Devon {{is known}} for its mariners, such as Sir Francis Drake, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Sir Richard Grenville, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Francis Chichester. Henry Every, {{described}} as the most notorious pirate of the late 17th century, was probably born in the village of Newton Ferrers. John Oxenham (1536-1580) was a lieutenant of Drake but considered a pirate by the Spanish. Thomas Morton (1576-1647?) was an avid Elizabethan outdoorsman probably born in Devon who became an attorney for The Council For New England, and built the New England fur-trading-plantation called Ma-Re Mount or Merrymount around a West Country-style Maypole, much to the displeasure of Pilgrim and Puritan colonists. Morton wrote a 1637 book New English Canaan about his experiences, partly in verse, and may have thereby become America's first poet to write in English. Another famous mariner and Devonian was Robert Falcon Scott, the leader of the unfortunate Terra Nova Expedition to reach the <b>geographical</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole.</b> The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the crime writer Agatha Christie and the poet Ted Hughes lived in Devon (his funeral and cremation were held there).
