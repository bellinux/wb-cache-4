50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To disengage the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the <b>striker</b> <b>spring</b> would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the <b>striker</b> <b>spring.</b> As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to disengage the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes to disengage the safety.|$|E

50|$|The {{only major}} {{modification}} concerned the firing mechanism. Prior to 1915, the cocked striker {{had been held}} by the sear before being released by the trigger; pulling the trigger subsequently pushed the striker back before releasing it, compressing the <b>striker</b> <b>spring</b> to a greater extent. This {{was inspired by the}} later 9 mm Dreyse due to insensitive wartime ammunition. It allowed a second strike if the first misfired. Another wartime change involved a recess cut in the top front of the slide to facilitate removal of the recoil-spring retaining bush.|$|E
50|$|The TC/3.6 and TC/6 are round minimum metal Italian {{anti-tank}} blast mines. Both mines use {{the same}} fuzing system. They have round deep ribbed plastic cases that are either sand colored or olive green. The fuze works on an air pressure system, with the top pressure plate forcing air through a small bleed valve. The air then inflates a diaphragm which indirectly applies force to the <b>striker</b> <b>spring</b> until a steel restraining ball is {{forced out of the}} way of the striker. The striker is then flipped into the detonator, triggering the mine.|$|E

5000|$|However, the act {{of cycling}} the action on such a firearm (as a natural {{consequence}} of discharging the firearm, or to chamber the first round) will leave the hammer cocked in single-action mode. To return the pistol to its safe state, {{it is necessary to}} uncock (decock) the hammer, usually by holding the hammer spur, carefully pulling the trigger, and then slowly lowering the hammer on the firing pin. However hammer fired semi-auto pistols have a beaver tail to protect the shooters hand from the slide which makes it more difficult (as opposed to a double action/single action revolver) to securely and firmly grasp the hammer with the thumb thus making an accidental discharge more likely. Striker-fired pistols on the other hand do not have a hammer so the only way to return the trigger to its longer pull (safer) state is by means of a decocking or rather detensioning lever which actually releases the tension in the <b>striker's</b> <b>spring</b> without allowing firing pin full travel and internal safeties disengagement (such as firing pin block which these types of firearms are generally fitted with). Note that when a handgun is fitted with a so-called decocking lever {{there is no need to}} pull the trigger while holding the lever like in a revolver, the actual process of [...] "decocking" [...] the gun is done by simply flipping the decocking lever to its [...] "decocked" [...] position with the fingers away from the trigger.|$|R

50|$|The Type 9 wooden {{anti-tank}} mine was an Italian bar type {{anti-tank mine}} used during World War II in North Africa. The box {{consisted of a}} lower section, containing the large warhead and fuzes and an upper, overlapping lid with two pivoting wooden covers that sat over the two fuzes. The fuzes were designed as a pivoting lever, and downward motion of the lid caused the lever to pull back a striker, compressing a <b>striker</b> <b>spring</b> until the pivoting action moved the lever enough to release the striker. The striker then impacted a blank cartridge, firing it, triggering a detonator charge, followed by the main charge.|$|E

50|$|The user then {{throws the}} grenade at the {{intended}} target, taking care that the grenade does not strike an obstacle that could deflect the grenade, bounce it {{back towards the}} thrower or allow it to roll towards the thrower or an unintended place. When the grenade is thrown, the safety lever will fly free (under pressure from the <b>striker</b> <b>spring)</b> and the striker will hit the cap, igniting the pyrotechnic delay element. When the delay element has burned approximately 4 to 5 seconds it will initiate the grenade's explosive filler, causing {{a large number of}} metal fragments to be projected at high velocities. The thrower and friendly personnel in the vicinity should take cover to protect themselves from unintended injury.|$|E

25|$|On April 9, 2008, Ruger {{recalled}} the SR9 model because, under certain conditions, it can fire if dropped with the manual safety off and a {{round in the}} chamber. This condition can occur in pistols manufactured from October 2007 to April 2008. Ruger designed a new trigger group which corrects this issue. It includes, among other things, adding a pivoting inner blade to the trigger itself, similar to that on the Glock pistol. This blade must be depressed to allow the trigger to be pulled. It also serves as an overtravel stop. Ruger also redesigned the magazine release, magazine disconnect & disconnect <b>spring,</b> and the <b>striker</b> blocker and <b>striker</b> blocker <b>spring.</b> Ruger initially announced that, beginning in mid-May 2008, they would retrofit SR9 pistols having a serial number below 330-30000 with the new parts, and include a spare magazine free of charge (approximately 11,000 pistols). SR9 pistols with serial numbers of 330-30000 and higher were manufactured with the safety enhancements and {{are not subject to}} the recall. Ruger began shipping recall boxes to customers in July 2008.|$|R

5000|$|The Walther Model 9 was a striker fired {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{produced by}} Walther arms and chambered in [...]25 ACP. The {{decision to use}} a striker vs. that of an internal hammer like on the Walther Model 8 was to reduce overall size of the gun, but sacrificed reliability. If the <b>striker</b> <b>spring</b> is compressed for {{extended periods of time}} it can weaken and not have enough force to ignite the primer causing a miss-fire. This can be avoided by not keeping the pistol cocked when not in use. It has a 6 round detachable box magazine. The Model 9 is similar in size and function to the Baby Browning pistol which is only slightly larger. The Browning is also chambered in the [...]25 ACP cartridge.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 4 mine or Mine G.S. Mk IV was a British {{anti-tank}} mine used during World War II. Externally the mine has a cylindrical main body filled with explosive either TNT or Baratol. The mine {{is covered by}} a pressure plate, which {{is attached to the}} mine body by four pins which sit in vertical slots in clips that fold up {{from the bottom of the}} mine. The mine uses the Shear-pin based Contact Mine Fuze No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded striker pin restrained by a shear pin. Sufficient pressure on the pressure plate presses the plate down on the head of the fuze, breaking the shear wire and releasing the striker, which is driven into the detonator by the <b>striker</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Roth-Steyr pistol fires from {{an unusual}} style of locked breech. The bolt is very long. Its rear end is solid, {{except for a}} sleeve for the striker, but its front part is hollow and fits tightly over the barrel. The {{interior}} of the bolt has cam grooves cut into it, and the barrel has studs which fit into the grooves. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together within the hollow receiver for about 0.5 inch. During this operation, the helical grooves in the muzzle bush cause the barrel to turn 90 degrees clockwise, after which it is held while the unlocked bolt continues to the rear, cocking the action as it does so. For safety with intended use by mounted cavalry, the pistol has a heavy trigger pull against the firing <b>striker</b> <b>spring,</b> similar to a hammerless revolver.|$|E
50|$|A minimum metal mine is a {{land mine}} that is {{designed}} to use the smallest amount of metal possible in its construction. Typically, the only metal components are located inside the fuze mechanism which triggers detonation. Both minimum metal anti-tank and anti-personnel mines exist. Some designs contain virtually no metal at all e.g. less than a gram. This is achieved by encasing the explosive charge in a plastic, wooden, or glass body, with metallic components limited to the few small parts in the fuze which can not easily be made from other materials, such as the <b>spring,</b> <b>striker</b> tip, and shear pin. Minimum metal mines are extremely difficult to detect using conventional metal mine detectors and usually require modern techniques, such as robotic Multi Period Sensing (MPS) equipment, to identify, but it is still too difficult to find non-metallic mines. These techniques are usually restricted to well-funded international mine clearing organizations and major militaries, making minimum metal mines especially pernicious where they are encountered.|$|R
40|$|The Year 1936 marks an {{important}} step in the evolution of French broadcasting. Echoing the ephemeral hope which the election of Leon Blum's " Front populaire " creates in a growing middle class, the year also coincides with the launching of new programs on private stations. These had recently been handed down to businessmen who were to counterbalance the principles of broadcasting of the Government's network. Placed for 18 months in the hands of Post and Telephone Minister Georges Mandel, the latter was henceforth financially wealthy and structurally organized. By June, a new Minister, Robert Jardillier, a convinced socialist, was appointed. He particularly catches our attention for two reasons: he is a radio professional and is an accomplished musician. Accompanying more than ever the daily life of French people (with tunes on the lips of the <b>strikers</b> of the <b>spring),</b> music still accounts for 60 % of the programs broadcasted and is characterized by a formidable stylistic eclecticism. Drawing its richness from the cultural and social disparity, this eclecticism is the most point of animated debates. Let's come back on a year that what decisive in many regards...|$|R
2500|$|Booby-traps were devised with delayed-action fuzes used a <b>striker</b> on a <b>spring,</b> {{held back}} by a wire. Acid ate through the wire, to release the striker and {{detonate}} the explosive. A number of devices with such fuzes were planted in bunkers but most booby-traps had simple pressure detonators. Wires were attached to useful items like stove chimneys and loot; trip-wires on the stairs of dugouts were connected to bundles of hand-grenades. On some roads, heavy-artillery shells were buried with contact-fuzes, which would only be triggered {{by the weight of}} a lorry. British engineers and tunnelling companies scoured areas as they were occupied and disabled many of the explosives. Roads were flooded by destroying drains and water-courses; wells sabotaged by drilling a shaft next to them and exploding a charge, permanently ruining the well. Much of the explosive used by the Germans (Donarit, Westphalite and Perdit) had the property of water-absorption so could be neutralised by dousing. Some British booby-trap patrols made German prisoners go first, who revealed traps rather than be blown up and British tunnellers removed [...] of explosives. (In some areas no booby-traps were found, as German divisional commanders had been allowed to choose whether to mine their areas and some refused.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Adapting {{the design}} {{to fire the}} {{standard}} [...]303 British round led to the Rifle, [...]303 Pattern 1914 (P14), a design fed from a five-round internal box magazine. With its prominent sight protection ears on the receiver, [...] "dog-leg" [...] bolt handle and [...] "pot-belly" [...] magazine, it was distinctive in appearance. The action was essentially a Mauser design with some Lee-Enfield features and optimised for rapid fire, with the action cocking on closing, a feature highly valued by the British Army {{with its emphasis on}} riflemen highly trained for rapid fire, but less valued in other armies, such as the US or Germany, where cock-on-opening designs such as the M1903 Springfield and Gewehr 98 were preferred. Cock-on-opening actions became more difficult to operate when heated by rapid fire as the effort to open the bolt had to overcome the <b>striker</b> <b>spring</b> to cock the action as well as unsticking the fired case from the chamber. The P14 was an advanced design for the time, and was said to be the most advanced service rifle of World War I.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is {{a departure}} from previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ. When the trigger is pulled, the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the <b>striker</b> <b>spring</b> as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N. Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It {{should be noted that}} the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the safety}} pin is pulled, the grenade is live but {{so long as}} the fly-off lever is kept {{depressed}} while the grenade is held (and the grenade can be held indefinitely with the pin out) it can be safely returned to storage {{so long as the}} fly-off safety lever is still in the closed position and the safety pin reinserted. However if thrown - or the lever allowed to rise - the protective plastic cover falls away and the striker, under pressure of the <b>striker</b> <b>spring,</b> begins to rotate on its axis. This causes the safety lever to be thrown clear, the striker continues to rotate until it hits the percussion cap, which fires and ignites the delay pellet. The heat of the burning delay pellet melts solder holding a retaining ring, allowing the detonator to move under the influence of a spring from the safe to armed position. The delay pellet continues to burn and after between 3 and 4 seconds burns out and produces a flash that forces aside a flap valve allowing ignition. When the flash reaches the detonator this initiates a booster charge which in turn initiates the main explosive filling.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of elastic-plastic structures {{is much more}} difficult to predict in comparison with the corresponding quasi-static one because of complicated loading conditions and the effect of inertia. By assuming that the quasi-static structural and interface behaviour of a structure is specified, its dynamic deformation mode is similar to the quasi-static one and the material is strain-rate insensitive, two mechanical models, namely the Stick Model and Non-Stick Model, are proposed in order to predict the {{dynamic behaviour}} of the structure under a rigid-body impact. Each model contains two lumped masses and two inelastic springs. While spring [circled 2] represents the highly non-linear and in-elastic mechanical property of the interface between the structure and the <b>striker,</b> <b>spring</b> [circled 1] represents the elastic-plastic behaviour of the structure, no matter the latter displays hardening, perfectly plastic or softening in the plastic range. The inertial effect of the structure is represented by an equivalent mass in both models. With the complicated deformation history involving loading, unloading and reversed loading being taken into account, the large dynamic deformation process can be completely simulated and the final deformation can be predicted by these models. A number of numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effects of the mass ratio, energy ratio, structural stiffness/local rigidity and the hardening/softening factor on the maximum and final deformations of the mechanical models. Finally, to verify the validity of the mechanical models proposed for real structures, impact tests on simply supported beams and type II structures, which were structural hardening and softening respectively, were investigated. Good agreements between the theoretical and experimental results indicates that the Stick and Non-Stick Models are reasonable and successful...|$|E
