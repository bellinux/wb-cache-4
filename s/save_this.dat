5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to <b>save</b> <b>this</b> particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another <b>save,</b> <b>this</b> time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first {{significant}} chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen {{on the right-hand side}} of the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on the right-hand side of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received the ball in the Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|On the January 5, 2015, {{episode of}} Raw, after Natalya {{defeated}} WWE Divas Champion Nikki Bella in a non–title match, Brie and Nikki would attack Natalya, with Paige making the <b>save.</b> <b>This</b> {{led to a}} tag team match at Royal Rumble between the two teams, with The Bella Twins picking up the win. Through February, Natalya and Kidd started a brief feud against Naomi and Jimmy Uso, facing off during an intergender tag team match on the February 16, episode of Raw, which Natalya and Kidd lost. When Kidd allied himself with Cesaro, Natalya began managing the team and was by their side in February, when they won the WWE Tag Team Championship's at Fastlane. The following night on Raw, Natalya helped the duo retain the titles against The Usos, turning heel in the process. On the February 26 episode of Smackdown, the villainous Natalya defeated Naomi in a singles match, before the feud ended. On March 28, Natalya inducted Alundra Blayze into the WWE Hall of Fame. On March 29, she accompanied Kidd and Cesaro during the WrestleMania 31 kick-off show, in which they successfully retained the Tag Team Championships.|$|E

5|$|This was a storyline that Russell T Davies {{thought up}} {{as a final}} one-part special for David Tennant on Doctor Who, (this was going to air around Easter 2010, near the time Series 5 would be airing.). The plot would have been that the Doctor finds a {{spaceship}} with an alien family on board (Russell mockingly titled them 'The Proestix Family'.) where the ship was broken, in the special {{he would have to}} sacrifice his life to <b>save</b> <b>this</b> family. This was a choice of a plotline which was also brought up with a two part special that then became The End of Time that he told to Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner. The Proestex family was kept in the special but were changed to be the Vinvocci, Aaddams and Rossiter.|$|E

25|$|Even if the goalkeeper {{succeeds in}} {{blocking}} the shot, the ball may rebound {{back to the}} shooter {{or one of his}} teammates for another shot, with the goalkeeper often in a poor position to make a second <b>save.</b> <b>This</b> makes saving penalty kicks more difficult.

25|$|The Atlantic {{humpback}} dolphin (Sousa teuszii) is {{endemic to}} West Africa. Several stocks {{have been identified}} with numbers ranging from tens to a few hundred. Abundance estimates are lacking. Gaps in the species range and hence distribution is evident. Bycatch is only documented in a few West African countries. Surveys and evaluations need to be conducted to determine the presence/ absence of humpback dolphins in their historical range. Conservation measures need to be implemented to <b>save</b> <b>this</b> species. Because many people live off the sea, it is not feasible to have complete gillnet closures. Some areas may be designated as off-limits to gillnet fisheries. Eco-tourism may be implemented successfully because of high species diversity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{these laws}} {{focus on the}} {{protection}} of individuals, rather than their habitat, and so may do little to mitigate the greatest threat that populations face. Fortunately, {{there are a number}} of projects specifically working to <b>save</b> <b>this</b> vulnerable insect. A conservation programme in Pieniny National Park saved a subspecies of the Apollo butterfly that had declined to just 20 individuals in the early 1990s, through a combination of captive breeding and habitat protection. In south-west Germany, conservationists are working with shepherds to ensure favourable conditions for the butterflies, which share their grassland habitat with sheep. For example, grazing periods have been shifted to avoid the Apollo butterfly larvae stage, which is vulnerable to being trampled.|$|E
25|$|The oldest playing {{style is}} the {{stand-up}} style. In this style, goaltenders are {{to stop the}} puck from a standing position, not going down. The goalies may bend over to stop the puck with their upper body or may kick the puck. Such saves made by kicking are known as kick saves or skate saves. They may also simply use their stick to stop it, known as a stick <b>save.</b> <b>This</b> was the style seen in the early NHL and was most commonly used up until the early 60s. One of the more notable goalies who was last seen using stand up was Bill Ranford, {{but most of the}} goalies from earlier decades such as Jacques Plante were considered pure stand up goalies.|$|E

25|$|On flight day 11, {{the crew}} of Space Shuttle Endeavour {{conducted}} a late inspection of the orbiter's Thermal Protection System. On most previous flights, this inspection was performed after the shuttle undocked from the ISS. However, {{in this case it}} was done early, because the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was to be left on board the ISS after Endeavours departure. The joint Expedition 28/STS-134 crew held a news conference with reporters on the ground at NASA centers around the country and ISS partner agencies. Commander Mark Kelly also spoke to reporters from four Tucson, Arizona television stations. Later in the crew day, the joint crew held an EVA procedure review for the fourth and final spacewalk of STS-134. Astronauts Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff spent the night in the Quest Airlock with the air pressure reduced to 10.2 Psi, so as to avoid decompression sickness during their spacewalk. The crew and flight controllers on the ground opted not to use the In-suit Light Exercise (ISLE) protocol that was tested during EVA 3 earlier in the mission, opting instead to go with the standard campout protocol, since it was discovered that ISLE used more carbon-dioxide scrubbing capability. They wanted to <b>save</b> <b>this</b> capability, since a CO2 sensor in Chamitoff's suit had failed during EVA 1, cutting that spacewalk short.|$|E
