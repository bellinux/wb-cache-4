5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} from the way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism taught that <b>salvation</b> came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that <b>salvation</b> can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Some {{time during}} the late 1960s or early 1970s Boosey & Hawkes bought out The <b>Salvation</b> Army Brass Instrument Factory in North London. They {{continued}} for some years to manufacture instruments with The <b>Salvation</b> Army name and crest on them such as The Bandmaster cornets.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{end of all}} {{his writings}} is to inculcate bhakti addressed to Rama as the greatest means of <b>salvation</b> and emancipation from the chain of births and deaths, a <b>salvation</b> which is as free and open to men of the lowest caste as to Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience was necessary for <b>salvation,</b> but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal <b>salvation.</b> As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of <b>salvation,</b> humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then <b>salvation</b> was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|Churches include Christ the King (Roman Catholic), {{built in}} 1952; Destiny Knowles Pentecostal Church (Pentecostal); St Barnabas (Church of England), built in 1938; Holy Cross (Church of God of Prophecy); and the <b>Salvation</b> Army.|$|E

5|$|A form of Protestantism {{known as}} Methodism {{is the third}} largest Christian {{practice}} and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley. It gained popularity in the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and amongst tin miners in Cornwall. There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists, Quakers, Congregationalists, Unitarians and The <b>Salvation</b> Army.|$|E
5|$|A third-person shooter {{video game}} {{of the same name}} was {{released}} on the same week of the release of the film. Christian Bale declined to lend his voice, so Gideon Emery voiced the character of John Connor. The game, however, features the voices of Common and Moon Bloodgood as Barnes and Blair Williams, respectively. Despite not appearing in the film, Rose McGowan voiced the character of Angie Salter, an ex-high school teacher. The game is set in 2016, after the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and before the events of Terminator <b>Salvation.</b> Another video game also titled Terminator <b>Salvation</b> was released in 2010 in the arcades. It's a light gun shooter developed by Play Mechanix and published by Raw Thrills.|$|E
5|$|All {{human beings}} are created {{in the image of}} God, but because of sin, this image is marred. It is the will of God that all people should receive <b>salvation</b> through faith in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Around 2013, {{research}} company IBISWorld {{reported that in}} the used goods outlet market, Goodwill Industries was first with a 21.5% share, Winmark was second with nearly 6%, and The <b>Salvation</b> Army was third with nearly 4%.

She suffered from mental illness in her later years and committed suicide in around 1970.|$|E
5|$|Baptism {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an important rite {{throughout the history of}} the Christian Church, but Christian groups differ over the manner in which baptism is administered, the meaning and significance of baptism, its role in <b>salvation,</b> and who is a candidate for baptism.|$|E
5|$|By September 5, the <b>Salvation</b> Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the <b>Salvation</b> Army had to procure food {{from other parts of the}} region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} <b>salvation</b> is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for <b>salvation.</b> According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of <b>Salvation</b> is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Chunsoft {{and published by}} Enix (now Square Enix). It is the third installment in the Dragon Quest series (known as Dragon Warrior in North America {{at the time of}} its original release) and was first released for the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America. The game saw an enhanced remake for the Super Famicom (the Japanese version of the Super NES) in 1996 and the Game Boy Color in 2001, and a port to mobile phones and the Wii in 2009 and 2011. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on September 25, 2014, and worldwide as Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of <b>Salvation</b> on December 4, 2014. It was the first time the game was given an official English subtitle.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the damage}} from the {{hurricane}} in the United States, the <b>Salvation</b> Army disaster units were sent throughout the devastated area. To prevent looting, residents in Breckenridge organized watches; the National Guard soon patrolled the streets. In Abilene, the United States Red Cross worked to feed the homeless and supply them with drinking water until city water services was restored.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a library}} clerk {{was forced to}} resign for {{promoting}} the idea that baptism is essential for <b>salvation,</b> considered a violation of the Statement of Faith. Further, in March 2006, five of the college's sixteen faculty members—Erik Root, Robert Stacey, Kevin Culberson, Todd Bates, and David Noe—resigned in protest, claiming that the President's interpretation of the Biblical Worldview Policy restricted academic freedom.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, actor Christian Bale was {{immersed}} in shooting a scene {{for the film}} Terminator <b>Salvation</b> in New Mexico. While performing with actress Bryce Dallas Howard, Bale shouted at the film's director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, for walking into his line of sight. Hurlbut responded calmly, apologized to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.|$|E
5|$|In {{the annual}} Thanksgiving Program, the students, in {{identical}} brown capes, silently construct a large cornucopia {{of fruits and}} vegetables in a ceremony choreographed to music prepared by each class. The food is later donated to the <b>Salvation</b> Army. It is the most treasured of the school traditions, and has been performed every year, virtually unchanged, since 1929.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado {{outbreak}} law enforcement officers, including 30 national guard troops, were sent to Lone Grove to provide security. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Ardmore, Edmond, and Oklahoma City. About 100 volunteers from the Sorghum Mill Estates Neighborhood Association traveled to affected areas in Edmond to help with cleanup efforts. A local restaurant provided free meals to the volunteers as they assisted relief workers. The <b>Salvation</b> Army had two canteens in Oklahoma City, one in Lone Grove, and one in Perkins. About 2,000 meals, drinks, and snacks were provided by the <b>Salvation</b> Army to emergency responders. Feed the Children sent two truckloads of relief supplies to Carter County. They also sent three food trucks, containing a total of 619 meals, 900 drinks, and about 500 snacks, to Ardmore. On February22, the New Life Baptist Church sent drinks and prepackaged snacks, along with items needed for clean-up. Baptist Disaster Relief assisted in Lone Grove with food and emotional care. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) gave away two tickets to anyone who made a donation of $25 or an equivalent amount of food to benefit victims of the tornado. A concert featuring Chris Cagle and other local musicians at Heritage Hall in Ardmore raised over $18,000 to benefit Carter County tornado victims. Another concert set up by the <b>Salvation</b> Army raised $2,300 more for victims.|$|E
5|$|Jesus Christ is {{the only}} Son of God the Father. For the sake of {{humanity}} and its <b>salvation,</b> he became flesh, lived on earth and was crucified, died and was buried; rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, seated at the right hand of the Father.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{is placed}} in his cosmic setting as the Logos made flesh who reveals God and gives <b>salvation</b> to believers; John the Baptist, Andrew, and Nathanael bear witness {{to him as the}} Lamb of God, the Son of God, and the Christ.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{precious}} objects served an important {{aid in the}} religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain <b>salvation,</b> while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces {{as a means to}} guarantee <b>salvation</b> in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the Cambrai Madonna is probably the best known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.|$|E
5|$|Regarding <b>salvation,</b> Maximus {{has been}} {{described}} as a proponent of apocatastasis or universal reconciliation, the idea that all rational souls will eventually be redeemed, like Origen and St. Gregory of Nyssa. While this claim has been disputed, others have argued that Maximus shared this belief in universal reconciliation with his most spiritually mature students.|$|E
5|$|Rider Haggard was {{interested}} in land affairs and wrote several works on the subject; in 1895 he served on a government commission to examine <b>Salvation</b> Army labour colonies, and in 1911 he served on the Royal Commission examining coastal erosion. He was an inveterate letter writer to The Times, and had nearly 100 letters published by the newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Service to America became Good Turn for America in 2004 and {{expanded}} {{to address the}} problems of hunger, homelessness, and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the <b>Salvation</b> Army, the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, and other organizations.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised {{parallels between the}} philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato {{and that of the}} Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to <b>salvation,</b> and Plato's allegory of the cave. Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before dawn, {{she called}} Kingston to hear mass with her, and swore in his presence, on the eternal <b>salvation</b> of her soul, upon the Holy Sacraments, {{that she had}} never been unfaithful to the king. She ritually {{repeated}} this oath both immediately before and after receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The Periya Puranam {{version is}} {{interpreted}} as a Brahmanical narrative, where a particular Dalit is granted <b>salvation</b> by transforming into a Brahmin; {{the superiority of the}} Brahmins is reinforced and the legitimacy of the ban of Dalits is not challenged.|$|E
