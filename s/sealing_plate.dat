25|$|Intertidal {{organisms are}} also {{especially}} prone to desiccation {{during periods of}} emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid desiccation {{in the same way}} as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including Littorina snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. Limpets (Patella) do not use such a <b>sealing</b> <b>plate</b> but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened conical shell using a grinding action. They return to this home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are quite obvious. Still other organisms, such as the algae Ulva and Porphyra, are able to rehydrate and recover after periods of severe desiccation.|$|E
50|$|NiCd {{batteries}} {{usually have}} a metal case with a <b>sealing</b> <b>plate</b> equipped with a self-sealing safety valve. The positive and negative electrode plates, isolated from each other by the separator, are rolled in a spiral shape inside the case. This {{is known as the}} jelly-roll design and allows a Ni-Cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell. Alkaline cells have a bobbin construction where the cell casing is filled with electrolyte and contains a graphite rod which acts as the positive electrode. As a relatively small area of the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte (as opposed to the jelly-roll design), the internal resistance for an equivalent sized alkaline cell is higher which limits the maximum current that can be delivered.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the theory, design, fabrication {{and testing of}} the microvalves and columns necessary in a pressure- and temperature-programmed micro gas chromatograph ({micro}GC). Two microcolumn designs are investigated: a bonded Si-glass column having a rectangular cross section and a vapor-deposited silicon oxynitride (Sion) column having a roughly circular cross section. Both microcolumns contain integrated heaters and sensors for rapid, controlled heating. The 3. 2 cm x 3. 2 cm, 3 m-long silicon-glass column, coated with a non-polar polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stationary phase, separates 30 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in less than 6 min. This is the most efficient micromachined column reported to date, producing greater than 4000 plates/m. The 2. 7 mm x 1. 4 mm Sion column eliminates the glass <b>sealing</b> <b>plate</b> and silicon substrate using deposited dielectrics and is the lowest power and fastest GC column reported to date; it requires only 11 mW to raise the column temperature by 100 C and has a response time of 11 s and natural temperature ramp rate of 580 C/min.

40|$|International audienceA {{three-dimensional}} physical {{experiment was}} conducted to study secondary oil migration under an impermeable inclined cap. Light-colored oil was released continuously at a slow rate of about 0. 1 mL/min from a point {{at the base of}} an initially water-saturated porous model. With buoyancy as a primary driving force, a vertical cylindrical shape of an oil migration pathway was observed first, and then a layer-shaped lateral migration pathway was observed beneath the top inclined <b>sealing</b> <b>plate</b> once the oil cluster had reached the top cap. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to observe the migration processesmdashfor example, morphology of the migration pathway, intermittency of oil bubbles, and variation of oil saturation within the migration paths. Results show that the snap-off phenomenon (related to fast local imbibition processes) occurred more commonly during vertical migration than it did during lateral migration. The lateral migration pathway that parallels to the top inclined cap has a typical vertical thickness of 2 to 4 cm (0. 8 ndash 1. 6 in.) (i. e., roughly 40 ndash 80 pores). This thickness is consistent with the prediction derived from scaling laws related to pore size and Bond number. Along the lateral migration direction, the sectional area and the horizontal width of the migration pathway fluctuate significantly, although the average oil saturation along the pathway remains almost the same. After stopping the initial oil injection, the sectional area of the migration pathway shrinks significantly. Therefore, we believe that this significant shrinking of the migration pathway is the main reason why only a relatively small volume of oil and gas has been lost during secondary migration...|$|E
40|$|The {{narrow channel}} (NC) {{facility}} design {{is based on}} the GALCIT Detonation Tube (GDT) test section design of Mike Kaneshige [3]. The main differences are 1) the design of the longitudinal bolted joint was simplified and 2) the keys for the flanges are not designed to assist with shear loading. The GDT side windows and PLIF window may be used in the NC facility. 304 SS was chosen for its excellent corrosion resistance. The yield strength is 275 MPa. 304 SS is non-magnetic and is therefore more difficult to grind on a table with magnetic locking. All four plates were blanchard ground (using mechanical locking to the table through some of the bolt holes which were drilled before grinding) by a subcontractor for Hales.

Firstly we have to do the marketing study in order to estimate the amount of the production we expect to sell in the first and the following years. The marketing study is done by analyzing the data from Spain and European database in industrial section together with the assumption based on reality. The results from this part are the expected production per year which can let us make the decision for the machine type and it will be used in economic study as well. Then the proper manufacturing process and specific tool’s type for each part will be decided and written on the Phase Document and the Summary of the Operation. These 2 documents are in the form that suitable to be used in reality effectively. Not only the manufacturing procedure, we also indicate the proper cutting condition and the calculations of cycle time, cutting force, machine power and the quality verification for each part. The data obtained by the calculation will be used to choose the specific model of machines, the amounts of machines and workers required to achieve the expected production.
