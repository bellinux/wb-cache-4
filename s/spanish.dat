5|$|A {{year later}} Francisco de Castellanos {{set out from}} Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now {{relocated}} to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty <b>Spanish</b> infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition recruited further forces on the march north to the Cuchumatanes. On the steep southern slopes they clashed with between four and five thousand Ixil warriors; a lengthy battle followed during which the <b>Spanish</b> cavalry outflanked the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The <b>Spanish</b> besieged the city, and their indigenous allies penetrated the stronghold {{and set it on}} fire. This allowed the <b>Spanish</b> to break the defences. The victorious <b>Spanish</b> branded surviving warriors as slaves. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the <b>Spanish</b> as soon as news of the battle reached them. The <b>Spanish</b> continued east towards Uspantán to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cunén, Sacapulas and Verapaz. Although heavily outnumbered, the <b>Spanish</b> cavalry and firearms decided the battle. The <b>Spanish</b> overran Uspantán and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.|$|E
5|$|After Zaculeu {{fell to the}} <b>Spanish,</b> the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were {{sufficiently}} isolated {{to evade}} immediate <b>Spanish</b> attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529 Uspantek warriors were harassing <b>Spanish</b> forces {{and the city of}} Uspantán was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'; the <b>Spanish</b> decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty <b>Spanish</b> infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary <b>Spanish</b> authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj. The <b>Spanish</b> army then marched east toward Uspantán; Arias then handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to the capital. Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the <b>Spanish</b> attacked, they were ambushed from the rear by over two thousand Uspantek warriors. The <b>Spanish</b> forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed.|$|E

5|$|From the 16th {{through the}} 18thcenturies, explorers looking for routes between <b>Spanish</b> colonies along the Rio Grande to the {{southeast}} and other <b>Spanish</b> colonies on the Pacific coast to the west passed near or through the area, which they called El Desierto Pintado, the Painted Desert. However, the park's oldest <b>Spanish</b> inscriptions, left by descendants of the region's early <b>Spanish</b> colonists, date only to the late 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In 1531 the <b>Spanish</b> {{moved their}} base of {{operations}} to Campeche, where they repulsed a significant Maya attack. After this battle, the <b>Spanish</b> founded a town at Chichen Itza in the north. Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers. In mid-1533 the local Maya rebelled and laid siege to the small <b>Spanish</b> garrison, which was forced to flee. Towards the end of 1534, or the beginning of 1535, the <b>Spanish</b> retreated from Campeche to Veracruz. In 1535, peaceful attempts by the Franciscan Order to incorporate Yucatán into the <b>Spanish</b> Empire failed after a renewed <b>Spanish</b> military presence at Champotón forced the friars out. Champotón was by now the last <b>Spanish</b> outpost in Yucatán, isolated among a hostile population. In 1541–42 the first permanent <b>Spanish</b> town councils in the entire peninsula were founded at Campeche and Mérida. When the powerful lord of Mani converted to the Roman Catholic religion, his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity encouraged the lords of the western provinces to accept <b>Spanish</b> rule. In late 1546 an alliance of eastern provinces launched an unsuccessful uprising against the <b>Spanish.</b> The eastern Maya were defeated in a single battle, which marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In 1690 <b>Spanish</b> authorities, {{concerned}} that France posed competitive threat, constructed several missions in East Texas. After Native American resistance, the <b>Spanish</b> missionaries returned to Mexico. When France began settling Louisiana, {{mostly in the}} southern part of the state, in 1716 <b>Spanish</b> authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas. Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first <b>Spanish</b> civilian settlement in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Sinclair {{developed}} the ZX Spectrum 128 (code-named Derby) {{in conjunction with}} their <b>Spanish</b> distributor Investrónica. Investrónica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the <b>Spanish</b> market after the <b>Spanish</b> government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64KB RAM or less, and a law which obliged all computers sold in Spain to support the <b>Spanish</b> alphabet and show messages in <b>Spanish.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} defend against further rival <b>Spanish</b> incursions from the southeast, Pedro de Alvarado {{established}} the <b>Spanish</b> town of San Miguel, which he also used as a base of operations for attacks against the Lenca. A <b>Spanish</b> force commanded by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, consisting of about 120 <b>Spanish</b> cavalry, accompanied by infantry and Indian auxiliaries, crossed the Lempa River and founded San Miguel on 21 November 1530. In addition to the <b>Spanish</b> colonists, the settlement included Mexica and Tlaxcalan allies, among other Indian auxiliaries. Most of the <b>Spanish</b> population of San Miguel abandoned El Salvador with Pedro de Alvarado when he set out on his expedition to Peru.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the <b>Spanish</b> {{continued}} {{to strengthen their}} blockade of trade activities in the Sulu Archipelago, resulting in the blockade's opposition by Germans when many of their trading ships were seized by Spain. Both Berlin and London stated the archipelago should remain open to world trade route. Soon, the British began to co-operate with German when rumours about the seizure of their trading ship by the <b>Spanish</b> began arriving to Great Britain which lead the British to oppose the <b>Spanish</b> action. British and Germans then refused to recognise the <b>Spanish</b> sovereignty over Sulu. But with strong opposition from Germans over the illegal seizures of their ships and the British fear of the German presence (which was stronger than the <b>Spanish</b> during the time), a protocol known as Madrid Protocol was then signed in Madrid to secure <b>Spanish</b> sovereignty over the archipelago, making the <b>Spanish</b> free to wage any war with the Sultanate of Sulu without the fear of other foreign western powers intervening and as a return the <b>Spanish</b> would not intervene {{in the affairs of}} British in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Mortier {{demonstrated}} his tactical prowess in {{the deployment}} of his small force: he sent all his cavalry to the north to attack the <b>Spanish</b> left; three battalions were sent south between the fort at San Cristóbal and the <b>Spanish</b> right wing; and his remaining six infantry battalions assaulted the <b>Spanish</b> front. As the fog rose, the French light cavalry under Briche gained the heights and fell upon the <b>Spanish</b> left flank, while Latour-Maubourg took three dragoon regiments to attack the combined <b>Spanish</b> and Portuguese cavalry on the plains of the Caya. Despite outnumbering the French, the Allied horse ignored orders and immediately fled towards Elvas and Campo Maior. They escaped unscathed, largely because Latour-Maubourg ignored them and instead launched his cavalry against the <b>Spanish</b> infantry line.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1936, the <b>Spanish</b> Army {{launched}} a coup d'état, {{leading to a}} prolonged armed conflict between <b>Spanish</b> Republicans (the elected leftist national government) and the Nationalists (conservative, anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the <b>Spanish</b> Army). Julio Álvarez del Vayo, the <b>Spanish</b> Minister of Foreign Affairs, appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain's territorial integrity and political independence. The League members would not intervene in the <b>Spanish</b> Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. Adolf Hitler and Mussolini continued to aid General Francisco Franco's Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the <b>Spanish</b> Republic. In February 1937, the League did ban foreign volunteers, but this was in practice a symbolic move.|$|E

5|$|Spain's loss of Gibraltar {{and other}} <b>Spanish</b> territories in the Mediterranean was resented by the <b>Spanish</b> public and monarchy alike. In 1717 <b>Spanish</b> forces retook Sardinia and in 1718 Sicily, {{both of which}} had been ceded to Austria under the Treaty of Utrecht. The {{effective}} <b>Spanish</b> repudiation of the treaty prompted the British initially to propose handing back Gibraltar in exchange for a peace agreement and, when that failed, to declare war on Spain. The <b>Spanish</b> gains were quickly reversed, a <b>Spanish</b> expedition to Scotland in 1719 supporting the Jacobites was defeated and peace was eventually restored by the Treaty of The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Spain's {{worldwide}} {{military activities}} between the 14th and 17th centuries called for {{large numbers of}} horses, more than could be supplied by native <b>Spanish</b> mares. <b>Spanish</b> custom also called for mounted troops to ride stallions, never mares or geldings. Due to these factors, <b>Spanish</b> stallions were crossed with local mares in many countries, adding <b>Spanish</b> bloodlines wherever they went, especially to other European breeds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spanish</b> Texas {{was one of}} the {{interior}} provinces of the <b>Spanish</b> colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1690 until 1821.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Spanish</b> conquistadores {{were largely}} volunteers, {{receiving}} {{the spoils of}} victory instead of a salary; many were experienced soldiers who had already campaigned in Europe. The <b>Spanish</b> expeditions to Central America were launched from three different <b>Spanish</b> jurisdictions, resulting in rival conquests by mutually hostile <b>Spanish</b> captains. <b>Spanish</b> weaponry included swords, firearms, crossbows and light artillery. Metal armour was impractical in the hot, humid climate of Central America and the <b>Spanish</b> were quick to adopt the quilted cotton armour of the natives. The conquistadors were supported by {{a large number of}} Indian auxiliaries drawn from previously encountered Mesoamerican groups.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Spanish</b> influence. The {{architectural}} {{influence of}} the ruling <b>Spanish</b> (Illustration 13), although this was a milder influence {{than that of the}} Normans. The <b>Spanish</b> style, a more restrained version of French renaissance architecture, is particularly evident in eastern Sicily, where — owing to minor insurrections — the <b>Spanish</b> maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's monumental Porta Grazia, erected in 1680 as the entrance to a <b>Spanish</b> citadel, would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the <b>Spanish</b> in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched city gate, with its ornate mouldings and scrolls, was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake.|$|E
5|$|The {{sentences}} provoked international {{criticism and}} {{protests against the}} <b>Spanish</b> government. Large demonstrations took place in Italy, Stockholm and Oslo, with the Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, heading the Swedish demonstration. The Dutch foreign minister made a formal protest to the <b>Spanish</b> Ambassador. The <b>Spanish</b> Embassy in Lisbon was attacked and set on fire. The <b>Spanish</b> embassy in Switzerland was occupied for 2 hours by protesters. President of Mexico, Luis Echeverría, called for <b>Spanish</b> membership of the United Nations Security Council to be suspended, but this was vetoed by the US, who considered it an internal <b>Spanish</b> matter. Pope Paul VI asked the <b>Spanish</b> government to grant clemency to the condemned at his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, though he also condemned the crimes that the condemned were convicted of. Franco's brother, Nicolás Franco, joined calls for clemency, appealing to Franco's Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The world-famous <b>Spanish</b> Riding School uses {{highly trained}} Lipizzan stallions in public {{performances}} that demonstrate classical dressage movements and training. In 1572 the first <b>Spanish</b> Riding Hall was built, during the Austrian Empire, {{and is the}} oldest {{of its kind in}} the world. The <b>Spanish</b> Riding School, though located in Vienna, Austria, takes its name from the original <b>Spanish</b> heritage of its horses. In 1729 Charles VI commissioned the building of the Winter Riding School in Vienna and in 1735, the building was completed that remains the home of the <b>Spanish</b> Riding School today.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} loanwords of Mayan or {{potentially}} Mayan origins {{are found in}} other languages, principally <b>Spanish,</b> English, and some neighboring Mesoamerican languages. In addition, Mayan languages borrowed words, especially from <b>Spanish.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{positive}} {{development for the}} Allies during this time was the appearance of another <b>Spanish</b> force in the region. The <b>Spanish</b> Regency at Cádiz had sent General Joaquín Blake, with the two divisions of Zayas and Lardizábal, by sea to Ayamonte on {{the mouth of the}} Guadiana. Landing on 18 April, Blake's army moved to join General Francisco Ballesteros at the <b>Spanish</b> town of Xeres.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various <b>Spanish</b> expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at conquest of the natives being punctuated by battles between competing <b>Spanish</b> forces, and infighting within individual <b>Spanish</b> groups. The various <b>Spanish</b> groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Francisco de Castellanos {{set out from}} Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now {{relocated}} to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition against the Ixil and Uspantek, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty <b>Spanish</b> infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition rested at Chichicastenango and recruited further forces before marching seven leagues northwards to Sacapulas and climbed the steep southern slopes of the Cuchumatanes. On the upper slopes they clashed with a force of between four and five thousand Ixil warriors from Nebaj and nearby settlements. A lengthy battle followed during which the <b>Spanish</b> cavalry managed to outflank the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The <b>Spanish</b> force besieged the city, and their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold {{and set it on}} fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the <b>Spanish</b> to storm the entrance and break the defences. The victorious <b>Spanish</b> rounded up the surviving defenders and the next day Castellanos ordered them all to be branded as slaves as punishment for their resistance. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the <b>Spanish</b> as soon as news of the battle reached them. The <b>Spanish</b> continued east towards Uspantán to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cunén, Sacapulas and Verapaz. The Spaniards were barely able to organise a defence before the defending army attacked. Although heavily outnumbered, the deployment of <b>Spanish</b> cavalry and the firearms of the <b>Spanish</b> infantry eventually decided the battle. The <b>Spanish</b> overran Uspantán and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{instructions}} from the Ministry of Justice (Dirección General de Registros y Notariado), <b>Spanish</b> Consulates abroad may carry out the preliminary paperwork for a same-sex marriage. At {{least one of the}} marrying partners must be a <b>Spanish</b> citizen, residing in the Consular demarcation. However, the marriage itself can only take place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same-sex marriages. In all other cases, the partners must marry in <b>Spanish</b> territory. Two non-resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as {{at least one of the}} partners must be a <b>Spanish</b> resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Rodney was escorting a {{fleet of}} supply ships to relieve the <b>Spanish</b> siege of Gibraltar with {{a fleet of}} about twenty ships of the line when he {{encountered}} Lángara's squadron south of Cape St. Vincent. When Lángara saw {{the size of the}} British fleet, he attempted to make for the safety of Cádiz, but the copper-sheathed British ships chased his fleet down. In a running battle that lasted from mid-afternoon until after midnight, the British captured four <b>Spanish</b> ships, including Lángara's flagship. Two other ships were also captured, but their final disposition is unclear; some <b>Spanish</b> sources indicate they were retaken by their <b>Spanish</b> crews, while Rodney's report indicates the ships were grounded and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After {{his victory}} in the <b>Spanish</b> Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the <b>Spanish</b> Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and {{a variation on the}} Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a <b>Spanish</b> mission to Italy received assurances of technical support for the construction of ships of the class in <b>Spanish</b> yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|After {{the results}} of the first scrutiny, Cardinal Avila, Philip III of Spain's {{representative}} at the conclave, announced that Philip had vetoed Baronius. Baronius had critiqued the claims of <b>Spanish</b> monarchs in ecclesistical affairs in the volume of his Annales Ecclesiastici that had been published in 1605. This led the <b>Spanish</b> monarchy to have such an intense dislike for him that the publication of the volume which contained his criticism was banned in <b>Spanish</b> territory.|$|E
5|$|After {{the western}} {{portion of the}} Cuchumatanes fell to the <b>Spanish,</b> the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were {{sufficiently}} isolated to evade immediate <b>Spanish</b> attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, {{four years after the}} conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing <b>Spanish</b> forces and Uspantán was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that the <b>Spanish</b> decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty <b>Spanish</b> infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary <b>Spanish</b> authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj. The <b>Spanish</b> army then marched east toward Uspantán itself; Arias then received notice that the acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Orduña, had deposed him as magistrate. Arias handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to confront de Orduña. Although his officers advised against it, Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the <b>Spanish</b> began their assault they were ambushed from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. The <b>Spanish</b> forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed on the altar of their deity Exbalamquen. The survivors who managed to evade capture fought their way back to the <b>Spanish</b> garrison at Q'umarkaj.|$|E
5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive <b>Spanish</b> demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the <b>Spanish</b> isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the <b>Spanish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive <b>Spanish</b> demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. The colonists demanded that the Indians supply them with food, wood for construction and firewood, and that they build new houses for the <b>Spanish.</b> In addition, pigs had been introduced by the <b>Spanish</b> and were causing great damage to the natives' maize fields.

5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many <b>Spanish</b> legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the <b>Spanish</b> model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, <b>Spanish</b> law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former <b>Spanish</b> provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, <b>Spanish</b> law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the <b>Spanish</b> principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E
5|$|As for {{the battle}} losses, sources vary. The Flemish Protestant Guillaume Baudart set Dutch losses at 88 horses, 83 prisoners and 24 killed. The Italian Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio claimed {{that more than}} 300 Dutch {{soldiers}} were slain as opposed to about 60 <b>Spanish</b> casualties. The Roman Jesuit Angelo Gallucci also wrote of 300 Dutch casualties. The <b>Spanish</b> soldier and writer Carlos Coloma set the <b>Spanish</b> loss as 19 men killed and claimed that the Dutch force lost three flags and about 400 serviceable horses. On the <b>Spanish</b> side the only soldiers of note among the casualties were Caraffa, Martinengo and Caracciolo, {{all of whom were}} wounded, but not mortally. Joseph de La Pise stated that the Dutch took seven <b>Spanish</b> prisoners and 15 horses. According to Antonio Carnero, accountant in the <b>Spanish</b> army, an envoy of the King of France to the Dutch camp was present at the battle and found later among the fatalities.|$|E
5|$|At Campeche, {{a strong}} Maya force {{attacked}} the city, but was repulsed by the <b>Spanish.</b> Aj Canul, {{the lord of}} the attacking Maya, surrendered to the <b>Spanish.</b> After this battle, the younger Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the <b>Spanish</b> town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo parcelled out the province amongst his soldiers as encomiendas. After six months of <b>Spanish</b> rule, Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the Younger. The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small <b>Spanish</b> garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo the Younger abandoned Ciudad Real by night, and he and his men fled west, where the Chel, Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to <b>Spanish</b> rule. Montejo the Younger was received in friendship by {{the lord of the}} Chel province. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal, (near modern Mérida).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (modern Huehuetenango city), but Zaculeu's fortifications led to its use as a refuge during the conquest. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 40 <b>Spanish</b> cavalry and 80 <b>Spanish</b> infantry, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. Gonzalo de Alvarado left the <b>Spanish</b> camp at Tecpán Guatemala in July 1525 and marched to Momostenango, which quickly fell to the <b>Spanish</b> after a four-hour battle. The following day Gonzalo de Alvarado marched on Huehuetenango and was confronted by a Mam army of 5,000 warriors from Malacatán. The Mam army advanced across the plain in battle formation and was met by a <b>Spanish</b> cavalry charge that threw them into disarray, with the infantry mopping up those Mam that survived the cavalry. The Mam leader Canil Acab was killed and the surviving warriors fled to the hills. The <b>Spanish</b> army rested for a few days, then continued onwards to Huehuetenango only to find it deserted.|$|E
