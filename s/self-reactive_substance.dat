50|$|Generic Types: Division 4.1 self-reactive {{materials}} {{are assigned to}} a generic system consisting of seven types. A <b>self-reactive</b> <b>substance</b> identified by technical name in the Self-Reactive Materials Table in 49CFR 173.224 is assigned to a generic type in accordance with that Table. Self-reactive materials not identified in the Self-Reactive Materials Table in 49CFR 173.224 are assigned to generic types under the procedures of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.|$|E

5000|$|A {{flammable}} solid {{is one that}} is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into • {{flammable solid}}s, • polymerizing <b>substances</b> and • <b>self-reactive</b> <b>substances,</b> i.e., thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing.Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.|$|R
40|$|In {{searching for}} high {{gravimetric}} and volumetric density hydrogen storage systems, {{it is inevitable}} that higher energy density materials will be used. In order to make safe and commercially acceptable condensed phase hydrogen storage systems, {{it is important to understand}} quantitatively the risks involved in using and handling these materials and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies to handle potential material exposure events. A crucial aspect of the development of risk identification and mitigation strategies is the development of rigorous environmental reactivity testing standards and procedures. This will allow for the identification of potential risks and implementation of risk mitigation strategies. Modified testing procedures for shipping air and/or water sensitive materials, as codified by the United Nations, have been used to evaluate two potential hydrogen storage materials, 2 LiBH{sub 4 } {center_dot} MgH{sub 2 } and NH{sub 3 }BH{sub 3 }. The modified U. N. procedures include identification of <b>self-reactive</b> <b>substances,</b> pyrophoric substances, and gas-emitting substances with water contact. The results of these tests for air and water contact sensitivity will be compared to the pure material components where appropriate (e. g. LiBH{sub 4 } and MgH{sub 2 }). The water contact tests are divided into two scenarios dependent on the hydride to water mole ratio and heat transport characteristics. Air contact tests were run to determine whether a substance will spontaneously react with air in a packed or dispersed form. In the case of the 2 LiBH{sub 4 } {center_dot} MgH{sub 2 } material, the results from the hydride mixture compared to the pure materials results showed the MgH{sub 2 } to be the least reactive component and LiBH{sub 4 } the more reactive. The combined 2 LiBH{sub 4 } {center_dot} MgH{sub 2 } resulted in a material having environmental reactivity between these two materials. Relative to 2 LiBH{sub 4 } {center_dot} MgH{sub 2 }, the chemical hydride NH{sub 3 }BH{sub 3 } was observed to be less environmentally reactive...|$|R
