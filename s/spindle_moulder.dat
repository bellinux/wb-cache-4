25|$|In this mode, the router {{can perform}} tasks {{similar to a}} <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder.</b> For smaller, lighter jobs, the router used in this way can be more {{convenient}} than the <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder,</b> {{with the task of}} set up being somewhat faster.

25|$|Modern routers {{are often}} used in place of {{traditional}} moulding planes or <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder</b> machines for edge decoration (moulding) of timber.|$|E
25|$|A related tool, {{called a}} <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder</b> (UK) or shaper (North America), {{is used to}} hold larger cutter heads {{and can be used}} for deeper or larger-diameter cuts. Another related machine is the pin router, a larger static version of the hand {{electric}} router but normally with a much more powerful motor and other features such as automatic template copying.|$|E
50|$|Spindle speed becomes {{important}} {{in the operation of}} routers, <b>spindle</b> <b>moulders</b> or shapers, and drills. Older and smaller routers often rotate at a fixed spindle speed, usually between 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. While these speeds are fine for small router bits, using larger bits, say more than 1 in or 25 millimeters in diameter, can be dangerous and can lead to chatter. Larger routers now have variable speeds and larger bits require slower speed. Drilling wood generally uses higher spindle speeds than metal, and the speed is not as critical. However, larger diameter drill bits do require slower speeds to avoid burning.|$|R

5000|$|In modern industry, {{the work}} of the {{moulding}} plane has been taken up by the electrically powered <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder</b> or wood shaper. On a smaller scale, the hand-held or table-mounted electric router allows the use of interchangeable router bits {{of a wide variety of}} profiles and is readily available to the small business or home craftsperson.|$|E

50|$|A wood shaper, {{usually just}} shaper in North America or <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder</b> in the UK, is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine {{in which a}} vertically oriented spindle drives cutter heads to mill profiles on wood stock. The spindle may be raised and lowered relative to the shaper's table, and rotates between 3,000 and 10,000 rpm, with stock running along a vertical fence.|$|E
50|$|CNC router (Or Computer Numerical Control router) is a {{computer-controlled}} {{cutting machine}} {{related to the}} hand held router used for cutting various hard materials, such as wood, composites, aluminium, steel, plastics, and foams. CNC stands for computer numerical control. CNC routers can perform the tasks of many carpentry shop machines such as the panel saw, the <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder,</b> and the boring machine. They can also cut mortises and tenons.|$|E
50|$|A raised {{panel has}} a profile cut into its edge {{so that the}} panel surface is flush with or proud of the frame. Some popular {{profiles}} are the ogee, chamfer, and scoop or cove. Panels may be raised {{by a number of}} methods - the two most common in modern cabinetry are by coving on the tablesaw or the use of a panel raising cutter in a wood router or <b>spindle</b> <b>moulder.</b>|$|E
