2500|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy about the philosophical nature of Dupin's method. According to biographer Joseph Krutch, Dupin {{is portrayed as}} a dehumanized thinking machine, a man whose <b>sole</b> <b>interest</b> is in pure logic. However, Krutch has been accused elsewhere of a [...] "lazy reading" [...] of Poe. According to Krutch, Dupin's deductive prowess is first exhibited when he appears to read the narrator's mind by rationally tracing his train of thought for the previous fifteen minutes. He employs what he terms [...] "ratiocination". Dupin's method is {{to identify with the}} criminal and put himself in his mind. By knowing everything that the criminal knows, he can solve any crime. His attitude towards life seems to portray him as a snob who feels that due to his aptitude normal human interaction and relationships are beneath him. In this method, he combines his scientific logic with artistic imagination. As an observer, he pays special attention to what is unintended, such as hesitation, eagerness or a casual or inadvertent word.|$|E

2500|$|In 1867 Stalybridge was {{disturbed}} {{by the arrival of}} William Murphy. Records of this man indicate that his <b>sole</b> <b>interest</b> was to sow the seeds of dissent between Roman Catholics, who by this time had grown to significant proportions, and Protestants. He succeeded in this goal only too well for a full year. During 1868 {{there were a number of}} violent disturbances and rioting created by this man who described himself as a [...] "renegade Roman Catholic". In his lectures to the public [...] "pretending to expose the religious practices of the Roman Catholic Church", he became a master at whipping up a crowd into a frenzy. Newspaper reports of the time told of his common practice of waving a revolver in the air in [...] "a most threatening manner". On one occasion he incited a riot of such proportions that Fr. Daley, the parish priest of St. Peter's, took to the roof of the church to defend it. A man was shot. The parish priest was tried but eventually acquitted at the Quarter Sessions. Following this incident, the community began to settle down and Murphy chose to extend his political activities elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|For {{businesses}} where {{floating charges}} were created before 2003, and in eight types of corporate insolvencies in the Insolvency Act 1986, sections 72B to 72GA, an older procedure of administrative receivership remains available. These companies are capital market investments; public-private partnerships with step in rights; utility projects; urban regeneration projects; large project finance with step in rights; financial market, system and collateral security charges; registered social landlords; and rail and water companies. Until the Enterprise Act 2002, creditors who had contracted for a security interest over a whole company could appoint their own representative to seize {{and take a}} company's assets, owing minimal duties to other creditors. Initially this was a right based purely in the common law of property. The Law of Property Act 1925 gave the holder of any mortgage an incidental power to sell the secured property once the power became exercisable. The receiver was appointable and removable only by, and was the sole the agent of, the mortgagee. In companies, secured lenders who had taken a floating charge over all the assets of a company also contracted for the right upon insolvency to manage the business: the appointed person was called a [...] "receiver and manager" [...] or an [...] "administrative receiver". The Insolvency Act 1986 amended the law so as to codify and raise the administrative receiver's duties. All receivers had a duty to keep and show accounts, and administrative receivers had to keep unsecured creditors informed, and file a report at Companies House. By default, he would be personally liable for contracts that he adopted while he ran the business. For employment contracts, he could not contract out of liability, and had to pay wages if he kept employees working for over 14 days. However, the administrative receiver could always be reimbursed for these costs out of the company's assets, {{and he would have}} virtually absolute management powers to control the company in the <b>sole</b> <b>interest</b> of the floating charge holder.|$|E
2500|$|Samantha Jane [...] "Sam" [...] Marquez (Vanessa Marcil) is {{the self-proclaimed}} best casino host in the world. [...] She {{lives in a}} Montecito suite, and is portrayed as a {{ruthless}} businessperson whose <b>sole</b> <b>interest</b> is to get high rollers {{to play at the}} Montecito. [...] However, in the season-four episode, [...] "The Burning Bedouin", she reveals that she is only [...] "cold and jaded because everyone expects it of her", and [...] "underneath it all, she is weak and pathetic like everyone else." [...] She was married to billionaire Casey Manning, from whom she was estranged for seven years prior to divorcing. She is also involved in an on-and-off relationship with Det. Woody Hoyt from Crossing Jordan, which ends officially based on the events from season-four episode, [...] "History of Violins". From [...] "The Burning Bedouin", she is seen to be currently in love with and waiting for Jeremy, who fell into a 20-year coma after falling off a stool at a slot machine; he is the man who first brought her to Las Vegas from Austin, Texas. Following the death of her ex-husband Casey in a freak fishing accident (he is later revealed to have been poisoned), Sam is left control of the casino. She becomes the latest former owner of the Montecito after failing to pay the back taxes owed on the property. Her ownership of the Montecito lasts for a week, when A.J. Cooper buys the Montecito by paying off the back taxes. A.J. fires Sam when she is rude to his ranch manager's son. After Delinda intervenes, Sam and Cooper work things out over a milkshake, bowling, beers, and cigars, and Cooper agrees to rehire Sam. Sam is originally from Texas and enjoys playing bingo. [...] In the season-five finale, Casey Manning's younger brother Vic Manning visits the Montecito to take over the ownership of the casino. At the end of the show, Sam and Vic are said to plan to get married. When asked why Sam wants to marry Vic – she always stated she did not have feelings for him, though he loved her – she says it is because Vic understands her and will not try to change her; plus, he reminds her of Casey.|$|E

60|$|The {{excellence}} of Oxford, then, as I see it, {{lies in the}} peculiar vagueness of the organisation of its work. It starts from {{the assumption that the}} professor is a really learned man whose <b>sole</b> <b>interest</b> lies in his own sphere: and that a student, or at least the only student with whom the university cares to reckon seriously, is a young man who desires to know. This is an ancient mediaeval attitude long since buried in more up-to-date places under successive strata of compulsory education, state teaching, the democratisation of knowledge and the substitution of the shadow for the substance, and the casket for the gem. No doubt, in newer places the thing has got to be so. Higher education in America flourishes chiefly as a qualification for entrance into a money-making profession, and not as a thing in itself. But in Oxford one can still see the surviving outline of a nobler type of structure and a higher inspiration.|$|E
60|$|This sounded rather well.

With such an unobjectionable person to enact the part of lover, the prominent character of leading young lady or heroine, which Paula was to personate, was really the most satisfactory in the whole list for her. For although she was to be wooed hard, there was just as much love-making among the remaining personages; while, as Somerset had understood the play, there could occur no flingings of her person upon her lover's neck, or agonized downfalls upon the stage, in her whole performance, as there were in the parts chosen by Mrs. Camperton, the major's wife, {{and some of the other}} ladies.|$|E
60|$|They wish {{to destroy}} the State, which they regard as a {{capitalist}} institution, designed essentially to terrorize the workers.

They desire to see each industry self-governing, but as to the means of adjusting the relations between different industries, they are not very clear. They are anti-militarist because they are anti-State, and because French troops have often been employed against them in strikes; also because they are internationalists, who believe that the <b>sole</b> <b>interest</b> of the working man everywhere is to free himself from the tyranny of the capitalist. Their outlook on life is the very reverse of pacifist, but they oppose wars between States on the ground that these are not fought for objects that in any way concern the workers. Their anti-militarism, more than anything else, brought them into conflict with the authorities in the years preceding the war. But, as was to be expected, it did not survive the actual invasion of France.|$|E

The first deals with the {{regulating}} models of the Internet’s freedoms, and considers the automatic implementation of rules concerning off line rights, the absence of any rule whatsoever, or the creation of ones porous to the technical specifications of the means, but observing system guarantees. The second discusses whether and how to regulate the Internet. The author challenges the myth of uncontrolled self-regulation sensitive to the <b>sole</b> <b>interests</b> of “private governments”, in favour of a streamlined public presence, so as to prove decisive on the issues of Internet governance and the hierarchy of law’s sources. The red thread between the two parts unravels in the consideration of the individuation of supra-national values, the Internet’s democratic nature, and the effectiveness of new rights necessary for technological progress benefitting everybody, not only those already enjoying a commanding position in economic competition or democratic activity...|$|R

40|$|Michel Foucault in his {{historical}} {{account of}} govermentality defines {{the art of}} government as a tactical disposition of “things ” (techniques, technologies and strategies of power) with an end to benefit those upon whom power is exercised. Foucault traces the origin of modern art of government to the anti-Machiavellian discourses of government {{of the sixteenth century}} which denies the presence of the art of government in principality where power is exercise in the <b>sole</b> <b>interests</b> of the prince. However, such an account appears problematic since there is little coherence and continuity in Machiavelli‟s works: The Prince fundamentally differs from The Discourses on Livy in terms of his philosophical stances. This paper examines the presence of the art of government in Machiavelli‟s republicanism expounded in The Discourses. It deals with two basic questions: is the art of government really an anti-Machiavellian idea? Do Machiavelli‟s republican ideas possess any art of government? It finds that the art of government exists in Machiavelli‟s republican ideas {{within the framework of the}} reason of state in a more manifest form that it does in the Mercantilist police state, and indicates the possibility of the presence of art of government in political practices prior to the time of Machiavelli...|$|R

5000|$|Delaware's law {{has also}} {{followed}} the same general logic, {{even though it has}} no specific constituency or stakeholder statute. The standard is, however, contested largely among business circles which favor a view that directors should act in the <b>sole</b> <b>interests</b> of shareholder value. Judicial support for this aim is typically found in a case from Michigan in 1919, called Dodge v Ford Motor Company. Here, the Ford Motor Company president Henry Ford had publicly announced that he wished not merely to maximize shareholder returns but to raise employee wages, decrease the price of cars for consumers, because he wished, as he put it, [...] "to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number". A group of shareholders sued, and the Michigan Supreme Court said in an obiter dictum that a [...] "business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end." [...] However, in the case itself a damages claim against Ford did not succeed, and since then Michigan law has been changed. The US Supreme Court has also made it clear in Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc that shareholder value is not a default or overriding aim of corporate law, unless a corporation's rules expressly opt to define such an objective. In practice, many corporations do operate for the benefit of shareholders, but this is less because of duties, and more because shareholders typically exercise a monopoly on the control rights over electing the board. This assumes, however, that directors do not merely use their office to further their own personal goals over the interests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.|$|R
