The influences of the receiver area, the upper plate area, and the overlapping area between the receiver and the upper plate, on the melt spinning electric field, the spinning efficiency, and the fiber diameter, were investigated respectively. The results showed that when the other parameters were kept unchanged, with the increase of the receiver’s diameter, the electric field strength and spinning efficiency increased, and the fiber diameter increased at first and then decreased; the bigger the overlapping area between the receiver and the upper plate, the more stable the vertical <b>spinning</b> <b>path...</b>|$|E

Chadzitaskos have explained this property of position observables {{as a result of a}} path in the Feynman integral being mathematically defined as a product of incompatible states; that is, as a product of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). On the other hand, two consecutive measurements of a particle’s spin give identical results. This raises the question “what happens when <b>spin</b> <b>path</b> integrals are computed over products of MUBs? ” We show that the usual Pauli spin is obtained in the long time limit along with three generations of particles.

40|$|We discuss {{problems}} of functional integral formalisms in a constrained fermionic Fock space. A functional integral {{is set up}} for the Hubbard model using generalized coherent states which lie either in the constrained or in the full Fock space. The projection for the latter states is implemented through a reduction of the charge fluctuations which induce transitions between the constrained and full space. The Lagrangian is expressed in terms of two complex fields representing spin and charge excitations, and one Grassmann field signifying hole excitations. Here, the charge excitations denote transitions between states with empty and doubly occupied sites. The projection method is inspired by the observation that the local interaction in the model resembles a magnetic field in the space of charge fluctuations. Hence the projection is understood as an infinite magnetic field in a <b>spin</b> <b>path</b> integral. ...|$|R

In our study, we have considered zero temperature quantum nucleation of a single skyrmion from a ferromagnetic phase.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} Schrieffer-Wolff {{transformation}} and present a path integral {{version of this}} important canonical transformation. The equivalence between the low-energy sector of the Anderson model in the so-called local moment regime and the spin-isotropic Kondo model is usually established via a canonical transformation performed on the Hamiltonian, followed by a projection. Here we present a path integral formulation of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation which relates the functional integral form of the partition function of the Anderson model to that of its effective low-energy model. The resulting functional integral assumes {{the form of a}} <b>spin</b> <b>path</b> integral and includes a geometric phase factor, i. e. a Berry phase. Our approach stresses the underlying symmetries of the model and allows for a straightforward generalization of the transformation to more involved models. It thus not only sheds new light on a classic problem, it also offers a systematic route of obtaining effective low-energy models and higher order corrections. This is demonstrated by obtaining the effective low-energy model of a quantum dot attached to two ferromagnetic leads...|$|R

Using a coherent-state <b>spin</b> <b>path</b> integral formalism, we derive an effective action for the system in the presence of a magnetic field. We calculate the functional dependence of the magnetization and tunnel splitting on the magnetic field and show that the parameters of the spin Hamiltonian can be inferred from the magnetization curve. We study the spin dynamics in these systems and show that quantum tunneling of the Neel vector also results in tunneling of the total magnetization. Hence, the spin correlation function shows a signature of Neel vector tunneling, and electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques or AC susceptibility measurements can be used to measure both the tunneling and the decoherence rate. We compare our results with exact diagonalization studies on small ring systems. Our results can be easily generalized to a wide class of nanomagnets, such as ferritin.

40|$|Abstract. Measuring the {{position}} of a free electron gives it an unknown momentum. A second measurement will give a new position far away. On the other hand, consecutive measurements of spin give the same result. In this talk we attempt to unify these very different behaviors. Position and momentum are complementary observables. An eigenstate of position has no information about momentum and vice versa. For an N-dimensional Hilbert space we say that two bases ∣a j⟩, and ∣bk ⟩ are “mutually unbiased ” if all their transition probabilities are equal: ∣⟨a j∣bk⟩∣ 2 = 1 /N. Position and momentum are similar to mutually unbiased bases, but for an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. Svetlichny discovered that Feynman’s (position) path integral can be interpreted as a sum over products of mutually unbiased bases. This raises the question “what happens when we compute spin- 1 / 2 path integrals over mutually unbiased bases? ” There are three pairwise mutually unbiased bases for spin- 1 / 2.

40|$|The quantum {{critical}} {{properties of the}} sub-Ohmic spin- 1 / 2 spin-boson model and of the Bose-Fermi Kondo model have recently been discussed controversially. The role of the Berry phase in {{the breakdown of the}} quantum-to-classical mapping of quantum criticality in the spin-isotropic Bose-Fermi Kondo model has been discussed previously. In the present article, some of the subtleties underlying the functional integral representation of the spin-boson and related models with spin anisotropy are discussed. To this end, an introduction to spin coherent states and <b>spin</b> <b>path</b> integrals is presented with a focus on the spin-boson model. It is shown that, even for the Ising-anisotropic case as in the spin-boson model, the path integral in the continuum limit in the coherent state representation involves a Berry phase term. As a result, the effective action for the spin degrees of freedom does not assume the form of a Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson functional. The implications of the Berry-phase term for the quantum-critical behavior of the spin-boson model are discussed. The case of arbitrary spin is also considered.

We extend these effects to arbitrary direction of the magnetic dipole. The precise conditions for having nondispersive precession and interference effects in these generalized set ups are delineated both classically and quantally. Under these conditions the dipole is affected by a nonvanishing torque that causes pure precession around the directions defined by the ideal set ups. It is shown that the precession angles are in the quantal case linearly related to the ideal phase differences, and that the nonideal phase differences are nonlinearly related to the ideal phase differences. It is argued that the latter nonlinearity is due {{the appearance of a}} geometric phase associated with the nontrivial <b>spin</b> <b>path.</b> It is further demonstrated that the spatial force vanishes in all cases except in the classical treatment of the nonideal AC set up, where the occurring force has to be compensated by the experimental arrangement.
