Treloar and Bean convinced the Museum's governing committee that it needed to raise funds so that the Museum was not entirely dependent on Government funding for its permanent building. To this end, Treloar established a <b>sales</b> <b>section</b> in the Museum in 1921 and recruited salesmen to sell books, reproductions of artworks and photographs as well as surplus items from the collection such as German helmets and rifle cartridges. The Government was slow to commit to building a permanent home for the Museum's collection, however, and Treloar considered resigning in July 1922 {{to take up a}} position in the Department of Immigration. He ultimately decided against doing so, however. In mid-1923 he was temporarily released from the Museum and travelled to London as the secretary of Australia's contribution to the British Empire Exhibition. He returned to Australia in early 1925. During Treloar's absence the Museum moved to Sydney, where its collection was housed in the Sydney Exhibition Building from April 1925. The institution's title was also simplified to the [...] "Australian War Memorial" [...] during this year, and following the passage of the Australian War Memorial Act by the Parliament of Australia in September was formally established [...] as the national memorial to the Australians killed during World War I. This act specified that the Memorial would be overseen by a twelve-person Board of Management whose members were appointed by the Governor General of Australia. Treolar reported to this board, but it generally allowed him to run the Memorial as he saw fit. Treloar travelled to London again in 1927 to work on the British Empire Exhibition scheduled for that year, but returned after a few months when it was cancelled. On 8December 1927 Treloar {{and the rest of the}} War Memorial's staff were appointed permanently to their positions; prior to this date they had been employed under temporary arrangements and Treloar had technically been a member of the Army's headquarters.

In his speech Dr. Moore predicted that in the future, as in the past, the Mills Observatory would play a great part in the furtherance of amateur astronomy in Britain, and inspire some to take up astronomy as a career.|$|E

40|$|Forty {{years ago}} {{crocodile}} {{stocks in the}} wild were seriously depleted, {{but in recent years}} interest in crocodile farming as a means of both maintaining numbers and satisfying commercial demand has grown. FAO's conservation guide, The management of crocodiles in captivity, is therefore timely. In the 1970 s FAO set up two major crocodile management projects. One, in India, which involved hatching and rearing hundreds of the endangered Gavialis gangeticus, the other in Papua New Guinea, employed methods of management from which local people benefited. Since then there have been many other projects which have generated the knowledge and experience that have been incorporated into this manual. The book deals with the characteristics of the crocodile as a farm animal, management options, collection and incubation of eggs, care of hatchlings, handling, feeding and growth of young crocodiles, and enclosures. There are many charts, diagrams and drawings and also black and white prints.
