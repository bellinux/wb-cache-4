25|$|The war came in {{the midst}} of the Progressive Era, when {{efficiency}} and expertise were highly valued.

25|$|Capital {{punishment}} {{is a legal}} penalty in the United States, currently used by 31 <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government.

25|$|Especially {{in terms}} of the European tradition, the term {{federation}} is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federation — at least, not without qualification. It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature; and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states, a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> state.|$|E

50|$|The act {{also was}} {{supposed}} to regulate the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> level.

25|$|Recognizing that juries {{in capital}} cases found {{discretion}} in sentencing desirable, Tennessee, Alabama, and Louisiana afforded their juries this discretion in the 1840s. Finally, the jury could respond to mitigating factors {{about the crime}} or the criminal and withhold the death penalty even for convicted first-degree murderers. This development spread, and by 1900 23 <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government had discretionary sentencing in capital cases. Fourteen more states followed {{in the first two}} decades of the 20th century, and by 1963 all death-penalty jurisdictions employed discretionary sentencing.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} this clause is twofold. First, it makes clear the {{division}} of responsibility {{with respect to the}} conduct of the election of federal Senators and Representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government, not with the executive or judicial. As authorized by this clause, Congress has set a uniform date for federal elections: the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} other U.S. <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{government}}, Mississippi's government {{is based on the}} separation of legislative, executive and judicial power. Executive authority in the state rests with the Governor, currently Phil Bryant (R). The Lieutenant Governor, currently Tate Reeves (R), is elected on a separate ballot. Both the governor and lieutenant governor are elected to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the heads of major executive departments are elected by the citizens of Mississippi rather than appointed by the governor.|$|E
