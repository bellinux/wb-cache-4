This transfer was accentuated by both the Education Act of 2010 and the new teacher training established in 2011, which also included education particularly directed for leisure-time centres. The state’s intention with this discursive shift was to highlight education and learning within the activity in amore distinct way. This article is based on an ethnography-inspired study at one leisure-time centre called the Sunflower. The data are based on six weeks of field work including participating observations, field notes and walk-and-talk conversations. The study takes its point of departure from <b>representations</b> by <b>staff</b> concerning what they emphasise regarding the centre’s activity, how these representations are related to each other and which strategies staff members use when talking about and monitoring the pupils’ activities. The results show the strong presence of older traditions concerning values and practices regarding the performance at work: supporting children with good care, stressing the importance of children’s free play and using a peripheral subject position during work. The results also show that a stress on the child-to-staff ratio as circumscribing the activity which is enhanced by the pupils misallocated age distribution...|$|R

Whilst current research has emphasized important theories of corporate governance, little {{attention has been paid to}} the disparity between both sectors.

Six aspects of board composition were chosen to conduct this research: non-executive directors (or external members), board size, ethnicity representation, female directors, political connections and <b>staff</b> <b>representation.</b> By means of a qualitative analysis, we collected employees’ perceptions of each of these topics. We then undertook both content and narrative analyses to draw conclusions and compare them to the current literature’s findings. We find that some aspects of board composition may hold different degrees of importance and convey dissimilar models of governance to the employees depending on the sector they belong to. We also find that the current literature’s findings about boards of directors are more relevant to private than to public organizations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{topic of}} this thesis is trade unions that organise {{employees}} of EU institutions. There are several trade unions, {{also known as}} staff unions that only organise the staff of these institutions. They have received almost no scientific attention, and therefore, this study is of an explorative nature. However, four theoretical perspectives are introduced in order to interpret the empirical data. The study contributes {{to our understanding of}} EU through describing previously unknown actors within EU, and describing the relationship between employees and their employer in EU institutions. This relationship can be understood as a structure found at the national level that also exists on the EU level. The study is based on the staff unions in the Commission in Brussels as a selection of all staff unions in EU institutions. The six staff unions examined are: Union Syndicale (US), Renouveau et Démocratie (R&D), Fédération de la Fonction Publique Européenne (FFPE), Association des Fonctionnaires Indépendants pour la Défense de la Fonction Publique Européenne (TAO/AFI), Syndicat des Fonctionnaires Européens (SFE) and Syndicat des Fonctionnaires Internationaux (SFIE). Empirical data on who these staff unions are, how they work, and whether they are able to influence EU decision-making, is presented. The empirical data builds on interviews with staff union representatives, and one Commission official, and various documents. The staff unions are described through characteristics such as political ideology, organisation, size, and membership basis. There are two systems that the staff unions work within: The <b>staff</b> <b>representation</b> and the concertation. The <b>staff</b> <b>representation</b> is a system where representatives of staff give advice on practical matters in the running of the institution. The concertation is a system of negotiations between the staff unions and the institutions on changes that affect the staff policy of the institution. The staff unions’ influence is limited to their ability to shape changes in the staff policy area of EU decision-making. A small case study of the staff unions’ influence on the administrative reform of the Commission is presented. Four theoretical perspectives are applied to the empirical data in order to provide interpretations of the data. The four perspectives used are a liberal intergovernmental perspective, institutional perspectives, an organisational perspective and the multi level governance perspective. The liberal intergovernmental perspective contradicts the presence and influence of the staff unions, while the other perspectives present complementary interpretations of the empirical data...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical Framework Social Representations theory {{emphasizes}} the {{process through which}} social groups adapt technical knowledge to everyday needs.

Objectives and Procedures The research focuses on social representations of justice of two professional groups within juvenile system. The objective is to explore the existence of: a) a shared set of meanings within and between groups; b) potential differences in meanings organization between groups with emphasis on social dynamics in work context. Participants are the entire staff of the Social Service Office of Juvenile Court (USSM) (N. 20) and of the Juvenile Community Service (CPA) (N. 8) in Lecce, south Italy. An in-depth semi-structured interview was adopted mainly focusing on narratives (László, 2003). Three areas were addressed: a) justice episodes; b) ideal/real justice; c) justice/law. Interviews transcriptions were submitted to a content qualitative analysis through ATLAS. ti software. Results and Main Conclusion The two groups share a common system of meanings about justice shaped by technical law. Notwithstanding, differences emerge. In USSM justice representation, social work is the principle which organizes such a system in the context of an enriching network of social exchanges with other professional groups; on the opposite, the organizing principle of CPA <b>staff</b> <b>representation</b> of justice is the oppositional dichotomy between IN/OUT up to the point that two justices come out: the In-justice which involves young offenders and the Out-justice which concerns all the others.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{increase}} an understanding of what prevents the mandatory reporting law, based on the preschool staff's approach to mandatory reporting law about child abuse and neglect to social services, and how these barriers affect their decision to report. The study will also understand what preschool staff experience facilitates the mandatory reporting process and what can be done to improve the process even more. The questions of the study were based on the purpose of the study and have been formulated in two questions: What prevents the mandatory reporting law requirements for preschool staff and how can these barriers be removed? What facilitates for preschool staff to be confident in the decision to report child abuse and neglect, to social services? The study used qualitative semi-structured interviews with five people working at the preschool, including two preschool teachers and three childcare workers. An interview guide was designed as a help to answer the questions about what the barriers are and what it is that makes it easier for the preschool staff, regarding the decision to report cases of child abuse and neglect to social services. The results, based on the five interviews, shows preschool staff's thoughts of the knowledge on the mandatory reporting law, the mandatory reporting process, their perspective of the mandatory reporting law and the uncertainty surrounding the mandatory reporting law. The study's analysis consists of the results that have been analyzed using the theory of social representations, in which the analysis shows an understanding of how the preschool staff act and think about the mandatory reporting law requirements based on their everyday knowledge. The analysis shows what prevents and facilitates the preschool staff's mandatory reporting process and the analysis shows the main parts that are based on the preschool staff's views on the mandatory reporting law. The analysis shows the preschool staff's approach to mandatory reporting requirements and how it is divided in two parts, it also describes how the concept of suspicion is perceived as a feeling that is shared within the workgroup, and the analysis shows the preschool <b>staff's</b> <b>representation</b> of the social services.
