That same year, the synagogue's congregants went to court over an attempt by its rabbi and board members to sell the aging structure to an organization run by a Jesuit priest. The resultant <b>settlement</b> and <b>media</b> attention led to a resurgence in interest in the synagogue.

40|$|Heritage {{places are}} {{characteristically}} imbued with {{a multiplicity of}} meanings contingent on the specificities of the society, time and space in which such places are perceived. The interpretation of places also depends on the affordances of the representational medium through which these places are perceived {{and the ways in}} which such a medium is socially deployed and interpreted. Using the ancient settlement of Sirkap, located in modern-day Pakistan, as a case study, the present article demonstrates that a change in the representational medium entails a change in the interpretation of archaeological records. Most conventional historical accounts of Sirkap use two-dimensional site maps and city plans as the primary media to represent the urban fabric of the ancient <b>settlement.</b> These <b>media</b> lend themselves to interpreting the Block D Apsidal Temple complex as the dominant socio-religious structure in the affluent northern parts of the settlement. When the authors developed an interactive three-dimensional reconstruction of Sirkap using gaming technology – a medium that allows users, through their avatars, to explore the settlement from the standpoint of a pedestrian – it was immediately obvious that the aforementioned Block D Apsidal Temple complex did not demand such an interpretation. Instead, the authors argue that, at least in the affluent northern parts of the settlement, the northern gate, its adjacent fortifications, and the Block A stupa court were the dominant structures. Such an interpretation leads the authors to question the canonical understanding of the role of the state and its military apparatus in the socio-religious life of Sirkap...|$|R
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} rights-–copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, {{and related}} rights-–have {{become increasingly important}} {{with the advent of}} increased international trade, global and knowledge-based economy and fast developing technology. A strong intellectual property rights regime is necessary in order to attract foreign trade and direct investments. For this reason, the protection of intellectual property rights has become an important negotiating item in all FTAs which the United States has entered into. In view of the proposed RP-US FTA negotiations, this paper seeks to determine whether the existing intellectual property regime in the Philippines provides adequate and sufficient legal protection of intellectual property rights. It also seeks to determine whether the administrative and judicial processes are adequate and speedy and acceptable in the enforcement and protection of said rights in the light of FTAs already entered into by the United States with other countries, in general, and with Singapore, in particular, which will be the benchmark for the RP-US FTA. Other relevant issues in the protection of intellectual property rights such as the annual review of ountries by the United States Trade Representative in relation to Special 301 of the U. S. Trade Law; piracy of optical media, including books and pharmaceuticals; and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) are also discussed. The author proposes certain provisions {{to be added to the}} Intellectual Property Code; sustained, consistent and stricter implementation of intellectual property laws including more efforts at curbing piracy; and more importantly, a strong political will and a strong determination to strengthen intellectual property rights, as necessary to make the IPR regime up to par with U.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{contribution}} of media institutions to modernity and its wider institutional arrangements. It will consider how this relationship has normally been conceived, even mythified, and then, in its second half, review how the institutions that we now call ‘media’ are, potentially, disrupting, even deranging, modernity’s arrangements in profound ways. The article will suggest that, under conditions of increased complexity and radically transformed market competition, the changing set of institutions we call ‘media’ demand a major reinterpretation of how modernity ‘works’ through institutional concentration. The first main section reviews in schematic terms the role which media institutions (the press, radio, television, film, but also infrastructural media such as the telegraph) played in the institutional development of modernity from the late 18 th century, stabilising the circulation of information and contributing to the freedom associated with modernity, but {{in the course of}} this installing a ‘myth of the mediated centre’. The second section will review how this traditional <b>settlement</b> between <b>media</b> and modernity is now being deranged. This goes beyond the globalization of modernity and the complexification of culture landscapes through media and time-space compression. It is a matter, more fundamentally, of a change in the conditions under which media institutions exist and are able to ‘centralize’ communications flows. Today, communications are becoming centralised less through the production and circulation of elaborate media contents at/from global/national centres throughout the social domain (funded through audience-based advertising or state subsidy) and more through the stimulation to/from everywhere of symbolic interactions within a global information space (the internet, and its related apparatus) funded by the collection and sale of data ‘exhaust’ generated by those interactions. The result, paradoxically, is likely to be an increasing destabilisation of many traditional institutions of modernity, and the normalisation of unfreedom through continuous surveillance, undermining the legitimacy of institutional arrangements on which modernity has conventionally relied...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation {{of a social}} media approach to assess village domestic water services coverage by {{using a combination of}} known methods to capture placeholders. Placeholder is location based information given by local people who are familiar with a specific area due to a longer period of living in, using and managing that area. Placeholders as such represent experiences and perceptions of local people. This simulation has been realized during 2011 - 2012 in the Kondoa district of Dodoma region Tanzania to find out in what way local communities may support water services given the options of upcoming mobile technologies. Simulation has been done by collecting data through sketch mapping, geocoded transect walk, focus group discussion and cross-checked by interviews. Results of the simulation show that this type of community water service mapping supports collection and validation of relevant, accurate and representative information on water service coverage at village level. It depicts the intersections between seasonality and accessibility to water services, revealed yet unreported intra-village variation and has added value for updating the status of water services and assessing their adequacy at the village level, in the light of population change and development of new <b>settlements.</b> Regarding social <b>media</b> the acquisition and control of point based waterservice facilities may be an easy first step to set. However the link to a wider community accepted spatial context and options to update village demographics and settlements demand for baseline data and inclusion of social infastructures...|$|R
40|$|Following the Russo-Japanese War Japan {{acquired}} {{its second}} formal colony, Karafuto (southern Sakhalin), which became thoroughly integrated with mainland Japan, developing into an important supplier of marine products, lumber, paper and pulp, and coal. This sparsely populated colony offered {{the prospect of}} large scale settlement and {{over the course of}} the Japanese colonial period the population of the Karafuto increased to over 400, 000 before the Pacific War. This thesis traces the course of migration to Karafuto and assesses the role of settlement policy, and migratory labour in colonial <b>settlement.</b> Utilizing colonial <b>media,</b> government reports and local documents, as well as the recollections of former settlers, this study argues that the phenomenon of migratory labour acted as an indirect means for establishing a permanent settler community in Karafuto. This study stresses that the colonial government of Karafuto’s efforts towards the establishment of permanent settlements based on agriculture largely failed. Instead, it was industries that involved the utilization of migratory labour which acted as base-industries for economic life in the colony, and helped support Karafuto’s more enduring communities. Indeed, even in the few cases of successfully established government sponsored agricultural communities in Karafuto, seasonal migratory labour and nonagricultural activity were a persistently crucial component of the community’s economic life. A further implication of this study relates to the comprehensive integration of Karafuto with migratory labour markets in northern mainland Japan and Hokkaido. Evidence presented in this study allows us to question the prevalent notions that northern Japan was an isolated, or poorly connected, region. Instead, it is found that the prefectures of Japan’s northeast were actively engaged in northward bound settlement and migratory labour circuits...|$|R
40|$|Predatory lending is a real, pervasive, and {{destructive}} problem {{as demonstrated by}} record <b>settlements,</b> jury awards, <b>media</b> exposes, and {{a large body of}} empirical scholarship. Currently the national debate over predatory mortgage lending is shifting to the controversial question of who should bear liability for predatory lending practices. In today’s subprime mortgage market, originators and brokers quickly assign home loans through a complex and opaque series of transactions involving as many as a dozen different strategically organized companies. Loans are typically transferred into large pools, and then income from those loans is “structured” to appeal to different types of investors. This process, usually referred to as securitization, can lower the cost of funds for lenders, allowing them to offer better prices. But, it can also capitalize fly-by-night companies that specialize in fraud, deceptive practices, abusive collections, and other predatory behavior. This article makes three intellectual contributions to this national debate: First, it argues that the current notion of predatory lending has been cast too narrowly. Some of the businesses that sponsor securitization of residential mortgage loans are aware of and capable of preventing mortgage predation. Accordingly, the label “predatory structured finance” is suggested as a necessary addendum to the lexicon of predatory lending. Second, this article tracks the evolution of structured finance of home loans, suggesting that as our financial technology has outpaced consumer protection law, it has effectively deregulated much of the consumer mortgage market. Third, this article argues that the reform strategy favored by many legislators {{and a growing number of}} scholars—assignee liability law— is only a partial solution. While a necessary component of the law, these rules are by themselves inadequate because they excuse many of the most culpable parties from accountability. An efficient legal response to predatory structured finance must include further development in an emerging trend of common law imputed liability theories...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is: - Presentation of the {{critical}} points in management of cities and villages in the system of services institutions, which {{is essential to the}} proper functioning of society and the shaping of space. This subject was raised to answer the question whether the new social behavior can affect the classical principles of organization of space? In particular, can one affect the management of settlement units in the facilities of social services? Currently, in fact a man meets some of his needs in an unreal way (e. g., via electronic techniques), without any limits of distance, space (e. g., by means of transport), because of the development of social and economic life. - Propose planning solutions for mountain villages located in the Karkonosze, presenting opportunities for development or a stable existence. They have been prospering through its history blending with its architecture and arrangement of buildings in the mountain nature exemplary. Currently, some of which are experiencing difficulties caused by, among others, changes in the modern world, so-called fusion of real and virtual space. There are monofunctional or deprived of basic functions settlements not meeting the residents` needs. The issues were analyzed by the use of case studies method. This led to a selection of specific examples of the phenomenon of the social centers disappearance, shut down of service infrastructure, and on the contrary strengthen their local position. It was assumed that the combination of the contemporary image with their historical forms of settlement can help to find the synthesis of virtual and the real world. As a result of the analyze, it was found: - Elimination of the complementary network of services contributes to minimizing the village in the settlement system. New social customs may even intensify this state; - Gradual modernization of services leads to prosperity of <b>settlement,</b> using new <b>media</b> opportunities; - Reasonable use of potential space of information technology space can contribute to improved well- being and changes in the mountain village...|$|R
