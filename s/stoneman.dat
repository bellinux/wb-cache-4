5|$|<b>Stoneman</b> used troops under Brig. Gens. Alvan Gillem and Stephen Burbridge, {{including}} the 5th and the 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry Regimentsboth {{of which had}} participated in the previous attempt to destroy the salt works during the First Battle of Saltville. <b>Stoneman</b> ordered Burbridge to bring his division of 4,200 cavalrymen through the Cumberland Gap to join <b>Stoneman</b> and Gillem at Knoxville, Tennessee, where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1,500 men. <b>Stoneman</b> did not reveal the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates until three days after they had departed Knoxville on December 10. On December 12, Stoneman's force flanked and forced back Confederate Brig. Gen. Basil W. Duke's cavalry at Rogersville, Tennessee. Union forces defeated and scattered Confederate troops the next day at Kingsport, Tennessee. There Gillem captured 84 prisoners, including Col. Richard C. Morgan and the brigade's supply train.|$|E

5|$|In mid-November, Breckinridge led a raid into northeastern Tennessee, driving Alvan Cullem Gillem's forces back to Knoxville at the Battle of Bull's Gap. On December 17–18, {{he faced}} a two-pronged attack from Union cavalry under Major General George <b>Stoneman</b> at the Battle of Marion in Virginia. Badly outnumbered on either flank, Breckinridge {{resisted}} Stoneman's forces until he ran low on ammunition. Stoneman's forces {{were able to}} damage Confederate salt works, lead mines, and railroads in the area, and destroy supply depots at Bristol and Abingdon. Finally restocked with ammunition after three days, Breckinridge was able to drive <b>Stoneman</b> – whose men were now short of ammunition themselves – out of the area.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, President Grant's Indian peace policy, {{enforced}} {{and coordinated}} by Brig. Gen. George <b>Stoneman</b> in Arizona, required the Apache {{to be put}} on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education. The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers. In one raid, believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors, settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan, Arizona. The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant. 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville. Angered over the murders, the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians, 42 Mexicans, and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache. When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30, they murdered 144 Apaches, mostly women and children, in {{what became known as the}} Camp Grant Massacre. Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery. In May, an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise; during the chase they killed 13 Apache. Grant immediately removed <b>Stoneman</b> of his command in Arizona.|$|E

On February 3, 1952, Loring was reassigned to the 2353rd Personnel Processing Squadron at Camp <b>Stoneman</b> in Pittsburg, California. This unit was quickly moved to South Korea, where it was assigned to the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, Fifth Air Force, with the assignment of supervising training for replacement pilots before they were moved into combat units.

5|$|Soldiers of the Regiment who did {{either not}} qualify {{to return to}} the U.S., either due to having {{insufficient}} service points or their being otherwise ineligible, and those who chose to remain in the Philippines, were transferred to 2nd Filipino Infantry Battalion (Separate) in Quezon City. Returning to the United States aboard the USS General Calan on 8 April 1946, the rest of the Regiment was sent to Camp <b>Stoneman,</b> near Pittsburgh, California, where it was deactivated on 10 April 1946.|$|E
5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. They destroyed about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General <b>Stoneman</b> claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note that he was there. Within three months, the saltworks were back in full production. Carpenter later wrote a long letter home about this battle and how his men responded.|$|E

She wrote four novels, and several non-fiction books on regional topics including Florida birdwatching and David Fairchild, the entomologist turned biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami. Her autobiography entitled Marjory <b>Stoneman</b> Douglas: Voice of the River was written with John Rothchild in 1987. She {{had been working on}} a book about W. H.

40|$|One {{of three}} anti-Lincoln satires {{published}} by Nichols in Boston at {{around the same}} time. (It was deposited for copyright on June 30, 1863, along with "Oppression!! Suppressing the Press" and "The Great American What Is It? Chased by Copper-heads" nos. 1863 - 6 and 1863 - 8). The present cartoon criticizes the Lincoln administration's mismanagement of the war, the "Four Years Contract" being the presidency. A barefoot Lincoln sits on a log labeled "Fredericksburg" (site of a major Union defeat {{under the leadership of}} Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside) and holds an ax between his legs, as he receives four members of the "Committee on War" at left, who also carry axes. He says to himself, "My axe is as dull as theirs so I hid it between my legs. " The Committee on the Conduct of the War was formed in 1861 to investigate recent Union military failures. In front of them is a woodpile with logs inscribed with the names of Southern cities, such as "Richmond," "Mobile," and "Charleston. " Ensconced in the pile is a tiny black man who cries out, "Massar. r. r. " Beneath a nearby grindstone lurks a copperhead (nickname of the Peace Democrats, who opposed Lincoln's wartime policies). The members of the committee (from left to right) report: Man with top hat: "Mr. President. There is a nigger in the woodpile dont you here him holler. Old song. " Second man: "Abe., We found Fremont [Union Officer John C. Fremont] all run out, but we have fixed him up as good as new and I invented the first lie about McClellan. " In 1862 Gen. George B. McClellan was relieved from command of the Army of the Potomac (some said for political reasons) and later became the presidential candidate of the Peace Democrats. Bareheaded man: "Abe [...] I've been in Mac's Com-sary department and found the provisions good, as I stole a sheep that he left in Maryland and twas excellent. " Man carrying a large book "Committee on War Full Report": Mr. Pres. We've got axes to grind, as they got dreadful dull in trying to cut up McClellan's character & by the way cant you do something for us now?" Lincoln addresses them: "Sirs; Your report is recieved with profound pleasure, and your shall be great; but ther's a blasted Copperhead under the grindstone so that if you grind here you'll get bit and that is sure death. 'Mac' {{is the only one that}} can handle 'em, so I dont see what I'm going to do. 'Mac' gave that Richmond log a good crack and if I hadn't stole his Wedge, he would have split it sure and if my heels want so long I'd go to Trenton and get him back. I am this moment getting a despatch from Fr so I must bid you all good day. 1 st News Good, Good, Good. 2 nd News Thunderation!" The term "Copperhead" referred to Peace Democrats and others who advocated a negotiated reconciliation with the South. A Union officer behind Lincoln cuts with his ax into the Fredericksburg log, on which lies another copperhead. He announces, " 1 st Despatch Copperhead cut off, his capture certain. 2 nd Despatch He has escaped through the gap and threatened our positions. " In the right background, "Stone-Man" a figure made of stones standing on a horse, comments, "Mr. Pres. I have been to the rear and owing to my great weight I have broken down a number of bridges. " The figure no doubt represents Gen. John <b>Stonemen,</b> commander of Union cavalry during the recent defeat at Chancellorsville. At far left a two-headed man, "Wilke's Spirit by a Medium," observes, "Mac is a slow hoss but there's no use in trying to run him down. " In November 1861 Union naval officer Charles Wilkes captured Southern diplomats James Murray Mason and John Slidell on the "Trent," a British merchant ship. Beside him is a sign "Lies told for cash. " In the distance are a dog, a rooster, a horse, and a boxing match. Entered... 1863 by E. W. T. Nichols... Mass.

5|$|The 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment was a {{segregated}} United States Army infantry regiment {{made up of}} Filipino Americans from the continental United States and a few veterans of the Battle of the Philippines that saw combat during World War II. It was formed and activated at Camp San Luis Obispo, California, {{under the auspices of}} the California National Guard. Originally created as a battalion, it was declared a regiment on 13 July 1942. Deployed initially to New Guinea in 1944, it became a source of manpower for special forces and units that would serve in occupied territories. In 1945, it deployed to the Philippines, where it first saw combat as a unit. After major combat operations, it remained in the Philippines until it returned to California and was deactivated in 1946 at Camp <b>Stoneman.</b>|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{also served}} as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter {{organized}} in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8million for the Marjory <b>Stoneman</b> Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory <b>Stoneman</b> Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E

25|$|When Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston {{unexpectedly}} {{withdrew his}} {{forces from the}} Warwick Line at the Battle of Yorktown the night of May 3, Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was taken by surprise and was unprepared to mount an immediate pursuit. On May 4, he ordered cavalry commander Brig. Gen. George <b>Stoneman</b> to pursue Johnston's rearguard and sent approximately half of his Army of the Potomac along behind <b>Stoneman,</b> {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner.
