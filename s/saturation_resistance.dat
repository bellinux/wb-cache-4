40|$|AbstractÐThis paper {{considers}} aluminum interconnects in {{the presence}} of insulators, vias, and shunts. Subject to a temperature change and a direct electric current, such an interconnect evolvesÐafter a complicated sequence of eventsÐinto a stable state with a segment of aluminum depleted near the cathode, a linear distribution of pressure {{in the rest of the}} line, and no further mass di€usion. The electric current continues in the shunt layers where aluminum is depleted; the multilayer interconnect never opens, but its resistance has increased to a saturation level. Several aspects of this stable state are discussed, including the condition under which the high pressure near the anode does not cause the surrounding insulator to crack; the dependence of <b>saturation</b> <b>resistance</b> on shapes, materials, and loads; and the time scale for the interconnect to evolve to the stable state.

40|$|Field effect {{investigations}} on thin {{cadmium sulfide}} films have yielded {{a method of}} controlling the surface potential. The control of the surface potential is achieved by the successive evaporation of two dielectrics, GaF 2 and SiO. The SiO produces donor-like surface states at the CdS surface,, while CaF 2 produces acceptor-like surface states. By evaporating {{a thin layer of}} CaF 2 between the CdS and SiO., the effect of the donor-like surface states on the surface conduction of CdS may be reduced. Thus, by proper choice of the CaF 3 thickness, any surface potential between the limits of SiO and CaF 2 may be obtained. The analysis, construction, and performance of a new evaporated, thin-film transistor capable of withstanding over 300 V is described. This thin-film transistor will switch a current of 100 p. a with a gate voltage of less than 50 V, and is particularly suited as a transistor controlled switch. The large increase in operating voltage is achieved, by changes in the device geometry, material characteristics, and through careful control of the CdS surface potential by 2 ̆ 7 the method, described above. Devices were constructed with an incremental <b>saturation</b> <b>resistance</b> of 200 Mi 7, and a maximum operating voltage in excess of 350 V.

This thesis provides this knowledge {{through the development of}} an electromigration simulation MIT/EmSim and through experiments. The stress effect on diffusivity and alloying effects were incorporated into the MIT/EmSim model for Al-based interconnects, demonstrating Cu transport effects consistent with experiments by IBM. The void nucleation and growth process was modeled in long and short lines, and current density exponents for Black's equation determined for several failure conditions. Interconnects can also be immortal, either without void nucleation or by <b>resistance</b> <b>saturation.</b> This complex reliability behavior can be catalogued in the form of failure mechanism maps using simulation or analytical approximations, plotting failure or immortality mode as a function of current density and line length. To extend the MIT/EmSim model to Cu interconnects, experimental observation of void phenomenology and measurement of Cu-based electromigration parameters were performed using Cu/Ta interconnects specifically designed and fabricated at MIT. The knowledge gained from these experiments was used to develop an electromigration model for Cu, and incorporated into MIT/EmSim. Simulations comparing void growth in Al and Cu interconnects indicate that differences in failure times of these interconnects observed in accelerated tests may not necessarily be apparent at service conditions. (cont.) A failure mechanism map constructed for damascene Cu demonstrates the absence of immortality by <b>resistance</b> <b>saturation</b> due to the shunt structure. Finally, proposed damascene designs eliminating the diffusion barrier at the studs may be expected to have an adverse effect on interconnect reliability due to the loss of short length effects. The test structure developed in this thesis provides a simple means of testing the effects of new shunt and barrier layer technologies on the reliability of Cu-based interconnects.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of parasitic <b>resistances,</b> <b>saturation</b> current and diode ideality factor {{on the performance of}} photovoltaic devices, parameter extraction routines employing the standard iteration (SI) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method were developed to extract the series <b>resistance,</b> shunt <b>resistance,</b> <b>saturation</b> current and ideality factor from the I-V characteristics of solar cells and PV modules. The well-known one- and two-diode models were used to describe the behavior of the I-V curve and the parameters of the models were determined by approximation and iteration techniques. The SI and the PSO extraction programmes were used to assess the suitability of the one- and the two-diode solar cell models in describing the I-V characteristics of mono- and multicrystalline silicon solar cells, CISS- and CIGSS-based solar cells. This exercise revealed that the two-diode model provides more information regarding the different processes involved in solar cell operation. Between the two methods developed, the PSO method is faster, yielded fitted curves with lower standard deviation of residuals and, therefore, was the preferred extraction method. The PSO method was then used to extract the device parameters of CISS-based solar cells with the CISS layer selenized under different selenization process conditions and CIGSS-based solar cells with varying i-ZnO layer thickness. For the CISS-based solar cells, the detrimental effect of parasitic resistances on device performance increased when the temperature and duration of the selenization process was increased. For the CIGSS-based devices, photogeneration improved with increasing i-ZnO layer thickness. At high forward bias, bulk recombination and/or tunneling-assisted recombination were the dominant processes affecting the I-V characteristics of the devices. v Lastly, device and performance parameters of mono-, multicrystalline silicon and CIS modules derived from I-V characteristics obtained under dark and illuminated conditions were analyzed considering the effects of temperature on the performance of the devices. Results showed that the effects of parasitic resistances are greater under illumination and, under outdoor conditions, the values further declined due to increasing temperature. The saturation current and ideality factor also increased under outdoor conditions which suggest increased recombination and, coupled with the adverse effects of parasitic resistances, these factors result in lower FF and lower maximum power point.

Our method accounts (1) for the number of species present (NSP) when the species goes extinct rather than during its introduction; and (2) scaling patterns in bird body mass distributions that accounts for the hierarchical organization of ecosystems and the fact that interaction strength amongst species varies with scale. We found that when using NSP at the time of extinction, NSP was higher for failed introductions as compared to successful introductions, supporting the idea that increasing species richness and putative community <b>saturation</b> mediate invasion <b>resistance.</b> Accounting for scale-specific patterns in body size distributions further improved the relationship between NSP and introduction failure.

40|$|For {{materials}} synthesized with f-electron elements, {{the interaction}} between f-electrons and conduction electrons often leads to interesting physics. As the temperature is lowered, the f-electrons can hybridize with the conduction electrons in {{a process known as}} the Kondo effect. In a Kondo lattice material, the screening may become coherent at the so-called coherence temperature T*. The resulting material is often metallic, containing heavy bands with effective masses many times larger than the free electron mass. In some cases, the development of coherence leads to a filled heavy-electron band where the chemical potential lies within the hybridization gap, resulting in insulating behavior. CeAgBi 2 is an antiferromagnetic compound (TN = 6. 4 K) belonging to the former (metallic) case. The close energy scales of the Kondo coherence, antiferromagnetism, and crystal field levels results in complex physical properties. Transport measurements reveal a coupling between the different magnetic phases and Hall resistivity. As the field is increased, the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is suppressed to zero Kelvin. Typically, this is expected to result in a quantum critical point. However, due to strange transport behavior in the paramagnetic regime, the usual signatures of quantum criticality are hidden. SmB 6 is a Kondo insulator {{due to the fact that}} the hybridization results in the opening of a gap. However, as the temperature is further lowered, the resistance saturates. Originally believed to be due to in-gap conduction states in the bulk, the true reason for the <b>resistance</b> <b>saturation</b> is a robust conducting surface state. Several theories predict that the surface state is a result of SmB 6 belonging to a class of materials known as topological insulators. However, direct imaging of the spin-momentum locking of the surface states indicative of a topological insulator has proved elusive. Through transport and magnetic measurements, indirect evidence of the nature of the conducting surface state is presented...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{influence}} of pH (titration method) and of salt concentration and drying (drying method) upon {{the formation of}} synthetic AI, Fe, and Mg interlayers in montmorillonite and vermiculite was investigated. Interlayer formation was evaluated by X-ray diffraction measurements of basal spacings using a natural chlorite for comparison. The titration method was superior to the drying method with respect to aluminum, ferric iron, and magnesium interlayer formation. The various interlayers formed in montmorillonite by titration method were more stable than those produced in vermiculite. The most stable interlayers were made with magnesium and aluminum in montmorillonite by the titration method. The synthetic material, like the natural chlorite, did not show any expansion and exhibited practically no collapse after K treatment and heating to 300 ° and 550 °C. In montmorillonite, aluminum interlayers were formed in both acid and alkaline media, but those produced when the OH/AI solution ratio was less than 1. 00 and the pH less than 5. 8 exhibited the greatest stability. When the OH/Al ratio exceeded 1. 00, the interlayered montmorillonite exhibited a gradual expansion toward 17 A[superscript °] on solvation and partial collapse upon K treatment and heating. Magnesium interlayers were formed only in alkaline media at pH of about 10. 0 Increase in pH produced a slight dissolution of magnesium interlayers. Ferric iron interlayers were also formed in both acid and alkaline media. They always exhibited expansion upon solvation with ethylene gIycoI. The material retained a basal spacing of approximately 14 A[superscript °] at 300 °C. They showed also a slight resistance to collapse at 550 °C. The diffraction patterns of Fe-interlayered materials exhibited broad basal spacings and plateaus compared to AI and Mg interlayers. In vermiculite, only magnesium interlayers showed stability after K saturation and K saturation plus heating at 300 °C. However, this material showed no resistance to collapse at 550 °C. Aluminum and iron interlayers did not show this degree of perfection, for they exhibited a partial collapse after K <b>saturation,</b> a slight <b>resistance</b> to collapse at 300 °C, and no resistance at 550 °C. Aluminum and ferric iron interlayers were formed in montmorillonite and vermiculite with one drying cycle...|$|R
40|$|In the U. S., {{there are}} 400, 000 {{respiratory}} failure deaths. Conventional treatment for acute respiratory failure employs lung damaging mechanical ventilation. The only long term treatment for chronic respiratory failure is lung transplantation. However, only 1800 transplants are performed each year due to donor shortages, {{resulting in the}} need for a destination therapy. Extracorporeal gas exchangers have been used as an alternative to mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure and as a bridge to transplantation in chronic respiratory failure. Blood is diverted to an extracorporeal gas exchanger, where oxygen is added and carbon dioxide is removed before returning the blood to the patient. Current gas exchangers are limited by their high resistance and low biocompatibility that lead to patient complications and device clot formation. This dissertation discusses three gas exchangers; the compliant thoracic artificial lung (cTAL), the compact cardiopulmonary support device (CCSD), and the pulmonary assist device (PAD). Fourteen day in vivo studies evaluated the cTAL’s long term performance and biocompatibility. The uncoated cTAL was capable of 14 days of support without a resistance increase or clot formation. In the future, the cTAL will be coated with anti-coagulant coatings and tested in vivo for 2 months. Individual components of the CCSD were designed and when tested, met design goals. However, enclosure pressures of negative 197 mmHg at flowrates of 4 L/min were encountered in CCSD system testing, causing gas embolus formation. The risk of gas embolus resulted in the discontinuation of CCSD development. The PAD was designed for long term use as a bridge to transplantation and destination therapy. Computational simulations were used to design the PAD with a theoretical resistance of 1. 50 mmHg/(L/min) and a 98. 3 percent blood outlet oxyhemoglobin saturation at blood flowrates of 1. 25 L/min. In vitro testing of the PAD yielded lower gas exchange performance (88. 4 percent <b>saturation)</b> and higher <b>resistance</b> (3. 47 mmHg/(L/min)). However, the gas exchange performance was skewed negatively by two devices with fabrication defects. PADs without defects were closer to the gas exchange goal. Future computational models will be improved, and the PAD will be redesigned for lower resistance and higher gas exchange...|$|R
40|$|We face {{experiences}} {{in life that}} we cannot ignore; we approach them with uncertainty and understand them with what rational thought {{that we have to}} offer. But what about the elements of an event that we never fully understand, yet carry with us to pick apart and revisit time and time again? It is the tastes that linger in our mouths, thread through our thoughts and formulate our personalities. These are the memories that evolve us into the future and keep us searching for answers. We saturate ourselves with these uncertainties, waiting for a bit of light, a chance to dry out and the opportunity to look back at the encounter as nothing but a stain. In my work I am addressing these leftover elements of my personal experiences, the histories that saturate me with lingering sensations. Continually evolving these ideas in my art, I am addressing situations of my self, family, genetics, habits and hardships. These are the thoughts that I carry with me each day, constantly trying to process that which is unresolved. These are the trials that make me human, and through visual investigation, weave me into the fabric of the universal. The process of staining and printing are in direct conversation with the experience of living. I bruise and fold paper, saturate fibers with liquid, monitor the absorption process, and provoke the resistance of materials with opposite chemical make ups. Similarly, we are built from these same elements; through the process of <b>saturation,</b> absorption and <b>resistance</b> we become the residue of what was there, the proof of existence, leaving each stain within us different from the last. I use abstract and decorative marks as the subject of my residual history. Such marks become symbols that act as the basis of my memories. They represent loved ones, childhood, snow, rain, freckles, fertility, age and fluid. When combining printed marks and saturated washes, a memory evolves for me. Temperature, perspective, layers and movement bring my work to a sense of place. The exposed fibers and scale allow me to bathe in the rich colors, follow the patterns and have a sense of vulnerability. Here is where my stains, my histories, can be understood. Through the act of creating, I look toward myself in an effort to understand the human condition. The saturations from our lives leave us lingering for answers. We all look toward our stains for identity and find that this imprinting process is never ending. We are continually accumulating new marks, dodging new obstacles and adapting to new situations. Our depths of memory become our badges of experience and wisdom, our key to future choices and our reference for empowerment. These are the stains J keep; these are the stains that penetrate...|$|R
40|$|Thermal energy {{harvesting}} devices have many promising applications due to no emission {{of greenhouse gases}} during the process. Thermoelectric generators convert heat (temperature gradient) to electricity and thus the waste heat from different energy sources such as heat engines, automobiles and industry can be recovered to generate electricity. Therefore, thermoelectric devices are promising candidates for {{energy harvesting}} technologies. The characterization of thin film based organic semiconducting materials is a rapidly developing research and has received great attention because of their applications in low cost fabrication of electronic and photonic devices, such as, light sensitive junction diodes, sensors, solar cells, ield-effect transistors, etc. In the research work reported in this dissertation thermoelectric, electrical, and photonic properties of the semiconducting thin films are undertaken for potential applications {{in the development of}} cost effective thermal energy harvesting technologies and electronic devices. In part I of this dissertation, energy harvesting from solution grown semiconductors via thermoelectric effect are discussed. For thermoelectric applications, three materials are investigated. The first material used is lead sulfide (PbS) grown from solution due to its inherent property of scalability. The solution grown PbS film consists of nanoclusters and has a high Seebeck coefficient, 450 μV/K. The high Seebeck coefficient {{may be the result of}} increased contributions from junctions and boundary scattering of carriers occurring at interfaces between nanocrystallites, consistent with the scanning electron microscopy study of the film morphology. The solution-grown PbS technology may be well suited for energy-harvesting applications. The second and third materials are carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and organic polymer Poly(3, 4 - ethylenedioxythiophene) Polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). In a homogeneous system (CNTs or PEDOT:PSS alone), the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity are interlocked by the Boltzman transport equation. Thus a heterogeneous layered system on a nano scale is developed from CNTs and PEDOT:PSS film to weaken the Boltzman transport and thus change the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity somewhat independently. Thus the thermoelectric properties are enhanced by making heterogeneous system. In part II, the electrical properties of sandwich type heterojunctions are presented. Thin film of organic material cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) were deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation on p- and n-Si with aluminum (Al) as top electrode. The charge transport mechanism was studied and the mobility of the organic thin films, with p- and n-Si as substrate, was calculated. Different parameters of the junctions were extracted from the electrical characteristics such as rectification ratio, reverse <b>saturation</b> current, series/shunt <b>resistances,</b> ideality factor and barrier height. The effect of light on current-voltage characteristics were also studied to show the photonic behavior of CoPc/n-Si heterojunction. The electrical characterization is useful as preliminary studies for further utilization of the CoPc in other electronic devices...|$|R
