5|$|On 22 May, the fleet—now {{reduced to}} only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho's caravel {{but also the}} nau captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost {{for over a year}} {{following}} the disaster in the South Atlantic. The nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades. Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{king of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom is Valagamba (103, 89–77 BC), {{also known}} as Vatthagamani Abhaya, who was overthrown by five invaders from South India. He regained his throne after {{defeating}} these invaders {{one by one and}} unified the country again under his rule. Saddha Tissa (137–119 BC), Mahaculi Mahatissa (77–63 BC), Vasabha (67–111), Gajabahu I (114–136), Dhatusena (455–473), Aggabodhi I (571–604) and Aggabodhi II (604–614) were among the rulers who held sway over the entire country after Dutthagamani and Valagamba. Rulers from Kutakanna Tissa (44–22 BC) to Amandagamani (29–19 BC) also managed to keep the whole country under the rule of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Other rulers could not maintain their rule over the whole island, and independent regions often existed in Ruhuna and Malayarata (hill country) for limited periods. During the final years of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, rebellions sprang up and the authority of the kings gradually declined. By the time of Mahinda V (982–1017), the last king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, the rule of the king had become <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> that he could not even properly organize the collection of taxes.|$|E
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is <b>so</b> <b>weak,</b> this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E

25|$|An {{earthquake}} (also {{known as}} a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of {{the surface of the}} Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.|$|E
25|$|Following Ramesses III's death {{there was}} endless bickering between his heirs. Three {{of his sons}} {{would go on to}} assume power as Ramesses IV, Ramesses VI and Ramesses VIII, respectively. However, at this time Egypt was also {{increasingly}} beset by a series of droughts, below-normal flooding levels of the Nile, famine, civil unrest and official corruption. The power of the last pharaoh, Ramesses XI, grew <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> that in the south the Theban High Priests of Amun became the effective de facto rulers of Upper Egypt, while Smendes controlled Lower Egypt even before Ramesses XI's death. Smendes would eventually found the Twenty-first Dynasty at Tanis.|$|E
25|$|Worcestershire were <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> {{the club}} could not {{compete in the}} Championship in 1919, and their form in 1920 – when they lost three {{successive}} games by an innings and over 200 runs – was probably the worst of any county side. Their form, with one remarkable exception, was woeful up to the early thirties. Fred Root, {{one of the first}} exponents of leg theory bowling, took over 1,500 wickets for the county and was a Test standard player in an otherwise fourth-rate team. In Cyril Walters and the Nawab of Pataudi the team acquired its first class batsmen since the Fosters, but both had to give up the game after playing brilliantly in 1933 – when the bowling was briefly very weak.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1827, the 16-year-old Gardner rented and planted {{eighteen}} acres of land, and worked on side jobs between planting and harvest. He went into St. Louis, Missouri on an unsuccessful quest for more work; so he hired on to a keelboat bound for Galena, Illinois, whose captain abandoned him there without pay after he was taken sick with fever. Weak with fever (<b>so</b> <b>weak</b> that he was obliged to lay down several times on his route to gain a little rest), he followed an Indian trail {{that led to a}} cabin owned by a half brother and a cousin in the mining regions near Galena, stumbling upon their place at midnight. The fever and subsequent shaking ague lasted nearly a year.|$|E
25|$|Although Surrey's {{champion}} 1860s team collapsed {{so badly}} that by 1871 Surrey had become <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> as to win none of thirteen county games, and their batting depth declined {{to the point of}} almost total dependence on Jupp, the erratic Humphrey brothers and Ted Pooley, this did not affect Jupp's ability. Harry Jupp first scored 1,000 runs in 1866, in which year he hit 165 against Lancashire, and toured North America in 1868. He reached four figures every year from 1869 to 1874. In the last named year Jupp achieved the amazing feat of carrying his bat through both innings of a match against Yorkshire, a feat equalled in England only by Sep Kinneir, Cecil Wood, Vijay Merchant and Jimmy Cook. The previous winter he had participated in the first English tour of Australia.|$|E
25|$|After Kelly {{returned}} to Hollywood in 1946, MGM had nothing planned and used {{him in a}} routine, black-and-white movie: Living in a Big Way. The film was considered <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> that the studio asked Kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines, and they noticed his ability to carry out such assignments. This led to a lead part in his next picture, with Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli— a musical film version of S.N. Behrman's play, The Pirate, with songs by Cole Porter, in which Kelly plays the lead. The Pirate gave full rein to Kelly's athleticism. It is also notable for Kelly's work with The Nicholas Brothers – the leading black dancers of their day – in a virtuoso dance routine. Now regarded as a classic, the film was {{ahead of its time}} but flopped at the box-office.|$|E

25|$|For most of {{its first}} 30 years on the air, channel 13 {{provided}} spotty coverage to {{the western part of}} the market because it is sandwiched between WLOS-TV in Asheville, North Carolina and WOWK-TV in Huntington, West Virginia. The station made numerous requests to move its transmitter closer to Roanoke. However, they were all turned down by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) each time due to concerns about interference, principally with WOWK. This was despite the fact that the Roanoke/Lynchburg and Huntington/Charleston markets do not border each other. However, the FCC believed that the two markets were close enough that the two channel 13 transmitters had to be as far apart as possible to avoid interference. Its signal was <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> in Roanoke that ABC actually granted an affiliation to a second station in the market, WRFT-TV (channel 27, frequency now occupied by WFXR), for much of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{at the age}} of thirty-seven, Voce played little cricket, but one {{excellent}} {{performance in}} a Test trial led him to be picked for his third tour of Australia for the 1946-47 Ashes series. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of rationing Australia was a 'land flowing with milk and honey' and he soon put on two stone (28 lbs) in weight. Whilst his classic action remained, he had none of the venom of old, was overweight and medium-paced, and in a controversial umpiring decision Bradman was given not out after being caught for 28 off his bowling in the First Test. Voce failed to take a Test wicket on the tour and played his last Test match against Australia at Melbourne in 1947, soon after which he announced his retirement from cricket to become county coach. However, <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> was Nottinghamshire's bowling attack, that he played five more matches for them, the last as late as 1952.|$|E

Len Maddocks won the toss and batted, but though Lawry made 47, Cowper 53 and Walters 46 no Tasmanian exceeded 11 and they were spun out for 119 by Fred Titmus (6/65). Geoff Boycott (156) and Eric Russell (58) made an opening stand of 107, captain Colin Cowdrey 70 and John Murray 83 not out as the MCC batted into the third and last day before declaring on 471/9. The Combined XI needed to make 272 runs to avoid an innings defeat and though Kevin Brown was out for a duck Lawry (126 not out) and Cowper (143 not out) made a second wicket stand of 273 in 257 minutes and the match was called off as a draw.|$|E
