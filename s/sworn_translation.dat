40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of working {{licences}} for sworn interpreters. Sworn interpretation is a service used in both the private and the state spheres when {{there is a need for}} <b>sworn</b> interpreting or <b>translation.</b> The interpreting work or translation is then performed by sworn interpreters appointed by the state. The conditions for appointing a sworn interpreter are subject to legislation. However, concisely speaking the service guarantees that the translation or interpreting work performed by a state-appointed sworn interpreter conforms to the original text. The translation or interpreting work is furnished with the sworn interpreter's personal seal, and can then be used during dealings with the authorities and so on. In this work I have examined the legislative framework of sworn interpreting, the economic justification for the working licences and the practical experience of translation agencies that make use of the services of sworn interpreters. I have contacted a total of 44 translation agencies through questionnaires and this has allowed me to make a genuine assessment of their experience. In addition to these agencies I have also contacted all the regional courts with powers to appoint sworn interpreters in order to ascertain their approach to the interpretation of legislation as it stands. In the conclusion I summarise all the theoretical and practical experience I have uncovered and the contribution of my work...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyse a body of {{documents}} in <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> from and to Portuguese in relation to French and Italian. Our objective has been to check the textual typology most requested for <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> in these languages and to outline {{a profile of the}} terminology recurrent in these types of text. We also present examples of interlinguistic terminological equivalence which become apparent when one translates some of the types of text in our corpus. The data presented here was obtained by the LexTraJu-O lexical project of <b>sworn</b> <b>translation,</b> of which the research is developed in the São José do Rio Preto campus of UNESP with the objective of obtaining resources for the improvement of the Translation Courses of this institution and of making a contribution to translation studies on the theme of <b>sworn</b> <b>translation...</b>|$|E
40|$|This article deals {{first with}} the genesis and {{enactment}} of professional certification for <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> and interpreting in Catalan, {{from the point of}} view of both responding to and fulfilling social needs and that of the subsequent legal framework shaped over the years. We then look at the ways professional certification can be obtained, one of which is examination by the competent authority (Secretaria de Política Lingüística) of the Generalitat de Catalunya. The examinations are described, as well as their conceptual underpinnings and why they serve as a professional guarantee to candidates. We also examine some of the problems that have arisen over the years in connection with the examinations, some resolved, others still being grappled with, as well as future challenges. Finally, we remark on the contribution of professional certification toward the standardization of specialized language, including statistical data spanning 1995 - 2006 (period corresponding to certification by examination), which provides an overview of professional certification for <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> and interpreting in the Catalan language...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study carried out at the Universitat Jaume I on the perception of the field of <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> held by the Law students from this university. The main goal of my research, following the lines of the ACTIVE group’s research, is to find out weak points and possible improvements in order to promote a professional view of <b>sworn</b> <b>translation.</b> I believe this profession is generally unfamiliar even to professionals of the field of Law and, as a consequence, it is also undervalued. However, the study of society offers possibilities for raising its status {{so that it can be}} granted the importance and prestige it deserves in our society. This paper offers an introduction to this study, followed by an exposition of the goals set and the research methods used. Next, a hypothesis is formulated, grounded on a particular theoretical framework based on proposals arising from the ACTIVE (Analysis of the Specialised Areas of the Translation and Interpreting Fields) project and Pierre Bourdieu’s social analysis. To test our hypothesis, we carried out an empirical study for which we selected a corpus made up of Law students from the Universitat Jaume I. The study implied the administration to students of several surveys designed to find out the attitudes and knowledge that they have about the field of <b>sworn</b> <b>translation.</b> Finally, the results obtained and the conclusions drawn are presented. Our findings show that the Law students from this university have neither any knowledge nor any acknowledgment of the sworn translator as a social agent. The research conducted revealed itself as particularly interesting and enriching as a preliminary pilot approach. However, it must be continued with similar studies to strengthen our perception of the social conditions affecting this field...|$|E
40|$|This article aims at {{reporting}} {{the process of}} extraction of specialized phraseological units (SPUs) taken from a study corpus made up of articles of incorporation submitted {{to the process of}} <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> into English and from a comparable corpus composed of the same kind of documents originally written in English. We also made some comparisons between the SPUs found in both corpora. In addition to that, we made some comments on problems arisen when translating articles of incorporation from Portuguese into English. After this discussion, we set the terms out of which we extracted the SPUs...|$|E
40|$|We deal {{here with}} the issue of {{professional}} certification for legal translation and interpreting from and into Galician, procedure regulated by Decreto 267 / 2002 of 13 June. First, we review the situation prior to legislation, passed after ten years of silence {{on the part of the}} autonomous administration. We then analyze the law and its application during its five-year implementation, including the first examination for certification of translators and interpreters announced in January 2007. Finally, we take brief stock of the job market for sworn translators from and into Galician, concluding with some remarks on the supply of translators and interpreters from and into Galician with respect to the demand for <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> and interpretation...|$|E
40|$|The {{professional}} {{certification of}} sworn translators and interpreters in the Basque language started in 1989 when the Oficina de Interpretación de Lenguas of the Spanish Foreign Ministry {{held its first}} examinations in Basque. As {{a result of the}} two examination sessions held, 10 sworn interpreters were certified. Since then, and particularly since the abovementioned Oficina discontinued the inclusion of Basque, Catalan and Galician in 1992, the Basque and Navarra autonomous governments have not created their own mechanisms for certifying new sworn translators and interpreters. As most sworn translators and interpreters are functionaries and are not allowed to work outside the purview of their institutional employment, only the Basque government, through its Official Translation Service, offers the possibility of certifying “the accuracy and legal equivalence of translations into Basque and from Basque to Spanish”. In this paper we present the Basque Language Translators Association’s (EIZIE) position and also the type of demand for <b>sworn</b> <b>translation</b> and interpretation in Basque...|$|E
