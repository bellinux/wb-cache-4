5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} <b>small</b> <b>ruminants,</b> usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result}} of selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E
5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in <b>small</b> <b>ruminants,</b> including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E

40|$|Part I of this {{working paper}} classifies <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> sub-systems in the mixed crop {{livestock}} system in Ethiopia. In Part II, important determinants of <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> productivity and producers’ input use and marketing strategies were analysed across the six <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> sub-systems identified in Part I. Classification of livestock production systems forms a useful {{framework for the}} spatial targeting of development interventions. Household and community level data collected from 497 communities and 2621 households were used to classify <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> sub-systems using principal components and cluster analyses. Exploratory analysis indicated variation and a clear structuring in livestock species and <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> flock composition and flock size in the mixed crop-livestock system. The variations were related to agro-ecologies and cropping patterns. Cluster analysis identified six clusters which were designated as sub-systems in the mixed crop-livestock system. The sub-systems were named following the dominant <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> species (sheep versus goat) {{and the degree of}} intensity/extensiveness of <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> production. The sub-systems were spatially characterized and described in terms of producers input use and marketing practices. <b>Small</b> <b>ruminant</b> production in Ethiopia could be classified into two systems (mixed crop-livestock and agro/pastoral) with six sub-systems within the mixed crop-livestock system or into seven systems (the six sub-systems and pastoral/agro-pastoral system).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the quantity of antibiotics and classes of antibiotics used in the <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> industry in the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012. Twelve large veterinary practices, located throughout the Netherlands were selected for this study. All <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> farms associated with these practices that had complete records on the quantity of antibiotics prescribed were included. The veterinary practices provided data on all antibiotics prescribed, and the estimated animal used daily dose of antibiotics per year (AUDD/Y) was calculated for each farm. The median AUDD/Y in <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> farms was zero in both years (mean 0. 60 in 2011, and 0. 62 in 2012). The largest quantity of antibiotic use was observed in the professional goat industry (herds of $ 32 goats) with a median AUDD/Y of 1. 22 in 2011 and 0. 73 in 2012. In the professional sheep industry (flocks of$ 32 sheep), the median AUDD/Y was 0 in 2011 and 0. 10 in 2012. In the small scale industry (flocks or herds of, 32 sheep or goats), the median AUDD/Y never exceeded 0. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics in the small scale industry and professional sheep farms belonged to the penicillin class. In professional goat farms, antibiotics of the aminoglycoside class were most frequently prescribed. This study provides the first assessment on the quantity of antibiotic use in the <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> industry. Given a comparable attitude towards antibiotic use, these results might be valid for <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> populations in other north-western European countries as well.

A <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> farmer {{was defined as a}} person who owns the animals, is involved in their maintenance and is the decision maker concerning management, selection and disposal. <b>Small</b> <b>ruminant</b> farmers identified themselves as sheep or goat farmers. A total of 301 sheep farmers (100 in Kano, 102 in Bobo Dioulasso and 99 in Sikasso) and 306 goat farmers (100 in Kano, 99 in Bobo Dioulasso and 107 in Sikasso) were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires which consisted of open and closed questions. The questionnaires covered information on the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents, reasons for keeping sheep or goats, the animals’ functions, flock sizes and structure, breeding practices and selection criteria for replacing breeding females and males. Respondents were first asked to list the production objectives and selection criteria for breeding females and males and then to rank them from the most important (1) to the least important (n). The questionnaires were pre-tested on 10 <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> farmers in each city to ensure that the questions were adapted to local conditions without affecting the comparability of information across locations.

However, the construction of private birkas (underground concrete water tanks), a development which started in the 1950s and later on dramatically increased after the 1970s, offered a solution to the absence of permanent water. While this encouraged birka owners to further diversify traditional animal husbandry beyond camels and <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> into water-dependent cattle, this also increased livestock population in an overpopulated region, putting additional pressure on shrinking resource base; the vicinity of almost every settlement in Aware have become overgrazed by cattle belonging to the villagers, thus driving away ideal nomads raising camels and <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> in the eternal search for pasture and water.|$|E
