Within these two eco-regions are five level four eco-regions: the Western Cascade Mountain Highlands, Cascade Crest Montane Forest, and Cascades Subalpine/Alpine within the Cascades eco-region and the Yakima Plateau and <b>Slopes</b> <b>and</b> Grand Fir Mixed Forest within the Eastern Cascades <b>Slopes</b> <b>and</b> Foothills eco-region.

5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep <b>slopes,</b> <b>and</b> deep in the lowlands.|$|E

5|$|Today, sandstone, shale, granite, and {{serpentine}} are {{the primary}} rock types in the Chetco region. Various forms of loam comprise its soil.

40|$|Variations in bony {{morphology}} {{have been}} associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} compare the tibial slope in the teenage pediatric population with open physes, with and without ACL injury. The secondary aims were to compare the notch width index (NWI) and determine the influence of gender and age on tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> NWI. Thirty-nine teenage pediatric subjects were included in this study, 16 with and 23 without ACL injury. Medial tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> lateral tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> NWI as measured on plain radiographs were compared between the groups using an independent t-test. Comparison of tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> NWI was also performed between male and female subjects. Pearson correlation coefficient between age <b>and</b> tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> NWI was calculated. The medial tibial slope averaged 10. 2 (± 3. 9) degrees, the lateral tibial slope 11. 5 (± 3. 9) degrees, and the NWI 0. 26. There was a significant difference in medial tibial slope between the ACL-injured (12. 1 degrees) subjects and the controls (8. 9 degrees) (P = 0. 009). There was no significant difference in lateral tibial slope or NWI between the groups. There was no significant difference in the medial tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> lateral tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> NWI between the male and female subjects. Subject age was not correlated with medial tibial <b>slope</b> <b>and</b> lateral tibial <b>slope</b> or NWI. There was an increased medial tibial slope in ACL-injured teenagers with open physes, when compared to a control group of teenager with open physes without ACL injur...|$|R

5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E
5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E

5|$|Mount Thielsen, or Big Cowhorn (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct {{shield volcano}} in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive {{activity}} ceased 250,000years ago, glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano's structure, creating precipitous <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational {{activities such as}} skiing and hiking.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is {{primarily}} terrestrial, but occasionally arboreal, especially where {{it occurs in}} forest. Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices. It is adapted to terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> dense forests. The black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.|$|E

5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|After an {{earthquake}} in 1853, the reliquary enclosing {{an image of}} Nuestra Señora del Carmen (Our Lady of Mount Carmel), originally situated at the Mount Carmel chapel, {{was moved to the}} Santa María de la Cabeza castle, where Santos Berrizbeitia built a new chapel in 1912 to protect the image; it was later moved to St. Agnes Church. The ditch was filled in for construction of the Mount Carmel chapel and the deteriorated parapets were demolished. The original <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> terraces present on Diaz Fajardo's 1737 map were probably also buried in the process. The chapel in the castle was the final resting place for Berrizbeitia; his remains, originally interred at Holy Trinity Cemetery (which he had built), were exhumed and moved five years after his death.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain <b>slopes</b> <b>and</b> tops, and in shale in gullies.|$|E

It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered with thin soil, such as road cuts, talus <b>slopes,</b> <b>and</b> asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle <b>slopes,</b> <b>and</b> fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
