5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more <b>spherical</b> <b>lens.</b> Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a <b>spherical</b> <b>lens.</b> The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} by Otto Ahlström in 1950 that most have aspheric surfaces. The best of the lenses have low spherical aberration, indicating that their surface profile was optimized to improve image quality. Most of the lenses, however, do not show any sign of optimization and produce worse images than a simple <b>spherical</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
40|$|With {{improvements}} in spectacle lens technology, several aspheric lens designs have become {{available in the}} moderate power range for prescribing by ophthalmic practitioners. Their manufacturers claim that these lenses improve cosmetic appearance and are lighter than equivalent <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses,</b> without sacrificing visual performance attributes such as good off-axis visual acuity and low distortion. We have made measurements of aspheric lenses made by Rodenstock, Essilor, Sola and Hoya, and have compared them with <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses</b> which have minimal off-axis power errors (best form design). Our results generally support the claims. Cosmetic appearance is considerably better for aspheric than for <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses.</b> The reduction in weight for plastic aspheric lenses is 8 - 32 per cent for 60 mm diameter. The percentage reductions would be less for smaller lenses. Except for a few exceptions, off-axis power errors of aspheric lenses {{are similar to those}} of similar power <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses.</b> All the aspheric lenses have similar or less rotatory distortion than <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses</b> of similar power...|$|R

500|$|Singer and Sigel {{credited}} Road to Perdition as {{a visual}} influence. Though Sigel shot the first X-Men in anamorphic format, he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, [...] "If you think about it, every anamorphic lens is simply a <b>spherical</b> <b>lens</b> with an anamorphizer on it. They'll never {{be as good as}} the spherical lenses that they emulate." [...] Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL, as well as an Aaton 35mm. Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films, while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments.|$|E

2500|$|The central corneal {{power is}} the second {{important}} factor in the calculation formula. To simplify the calculation, the cornea is assumed to be a thin <b>spherical</b> <b>lens</b> with a fixed anterior to posterior corneal curvature ratio and an index of refraction of 1.3375. Central corneal power can be measured by keratometry or corneal topography. Corneal radius of curvature relates to corneal power with the equation: [...] r = 337.5/K.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Whether either natural emmetropization or compen-sation for imposed {{spectacle}} lenses requires the visual system to distinguish myopic from hyperopic blur is controversial. Some {{have argued that}} the visual system need only respond to the magnitude of the blur. This study was undertaken to test whether adding large amounts of astigmatic image blur would cause myopia and interfere with compensation for positive or negative {{spectacle lenses}}. METHODS. Chicks were fitted with mixed astigmatic (toric) lenses with 5 D on one meridian and 5 D on the orthogonal meridian (Jackson crossed cylinders), thus producing massive blur while having no spherical equivalent power. Chicks wore these lenses either alone or in combination with 6 D, 3 D, 3 D, or 6 D <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses.</b> To produce a similar degree of image degradation in a different way, other chicks were fitted with weak diffusers, with or without <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses.</b> RESULTS. Eyes fitted with astigmatic lenses alone became mildly hyperopic, whereas those fitted with weak diffusers became mildly myopic. Eyes wearing both the astigmatic and <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses</b> compensated as completely for the <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses</b> as did the eyes wearing <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses</b> alone—the compensa-tion being caused by changes in both choroidal thickness and ocular length. Eyes wearing weak diffusers and <b>spherical</b> <b>lenses</b> also compensated but did so without a change in choroidal thickness. CONCLUSIONS. Severe astigmatic blur does not interfere with spectacle lens compensation. From this it can be inferred that the average amount of blur is not an important error signal for spectacle lens compensation and therefore probably not for emmetropization either. These results strengthen the case that the sign of defocus is used to direct eye growth. (Inves...|$|R

2500|$|Vision is its {{critical}} sense. Its {{eyes are}} proportionally large and contain a large <b>spherical</b> <b>lens,</b> improving its focusing ability. Its pupil is mobile {{to help it}} adapt to the intense glare of the Arctic ice. Its retina is rod-dominated and backed by a cat-like and reflective tapetum lucidum, enhancing its low light sensitivity. Its rods best sense blue-green, while its cones help with bright light and may provide some colour discrimination. Its cornea is sometimes tear-covered, {{to protect it from}} salt. Lacking tear ducts, it [...] "cries" [...] to remove its tears. On ice, the mother identifies her offspring by smell. This sense may also warn of an approaching predator. Underwater, this seal closes its nostrils and smells nothing. Its whiskers, called vibrissae, lie in horizontal rows on either side of its snout. They may provide a touch sense, and underwater, also respond to low-frequency vibrations, such as movement.|$|E
2500|$|They have elongated, {{cylindrical}} skulls, but possess {{no visible}} eyes, {{though in the}} original Alien film, {{the top of the}} creature's head was translucent, with empty, human-looking eye sockets within. In the novelization of Alien, the character Ash speculates that the Xenomorphs [...] "see" [...] by way of electrical impulse, similar to a shark's lateral line. [...] This method is illustrated in the original Alien vs Predator PC game, and reused for the [...] "Predalien" [...] 28 years later. There is a cyclopean species of Xenomorph, which is the creature in its original form, it has a single large eye under its natural silicon / keratin forehead which can give the creature 180 degree vision. The larval stage or [...] "facehugger" [...] does have a single eye. Whatever the original host was is unknown, it must have been something on the Xenomorph's home planet. The Aliens' inner set of jaws are powerful enough to smash through bone and metal. How the creatures see is uncertain; in Alien 3, a <b>spherical</b> <b>lens</b> was used to illustrate the Alien's point of view, so, when the film was projected anamorphically, the image exhibited severe distortion.
