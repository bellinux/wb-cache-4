This, I must say, that poetry, as distinguished from other modes of composition, does not rest in metre, and that it is not poetry, if it make no appeal to our passions or our imagination.

40|$|Abstract—In dynamic {{spectrum}} {{access networks}} (DySPANs), users share access to available spectrum while minimizing {{the likelihood of}} harmful interference. In this demonstration we present a dynamic spectrum access network which employs a re-configurable orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based waveform. In {{order to avoid the}} creation of harmful interference, the out-of-band (OOB) emissions of the waveform are dynamically tailored to the properties of spectrum neighbours through the use of OFDM pulse shaping. The demonstration network is built upon the highly reconfigurable Iris 2. 0 software radio platform and illustrates the capabilities of this platform as well as the utility of OFDM pulse shaping in the context of dynamic spectrum access networks. I. OFDM PULSE <b>SHAPING</b> Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a highly popular multicarrier modulation scheme due to its robustness against frequency-selective fading, use of a cyclic prefix to eliminate ISI and computationally-efficient imple-mentation. In the context of dynamic spectrum access, OFDM proves an attractive modulation scheme due to the ability to perform spectrum sculpting through parametric reconfigura-tion. For this demonstration, we focus on the ability to sculpt the spectrum of the waveform through dynamic pulse-shaping. An OFDM signal can be represented in a generic form as: x(t) ...|$|R

However, semi-aerodynamic and aerodynamic wheelsets tend to be heavier than more traditional spoked wheelsets due to the extra <b>shapings</b> of the rims and spokes. More importantly, the rims must be heavier when there are fewer spokes, as the unsupported span between spokes is greater.

A PROPOSAL OF A COHERENT THEORETICAL APPROACH FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF TOURISM ON REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. B. THE CONSTRUCTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF TOURISM DEVELOPMENT ON THE MAJOR MACRO - ECONOMIC FIGURES OF THE REGION TOURISM ECONOMY. C. THE <b>SHAPING</b> OF A GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF ANALYSIS BEING OF AN EXTREMELY USEFULNESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TOURISM POLICY ON A REGIONAL LEVEL. THE RESEARCH OF A THEORETICAL BASIS, PROPOSES EXAMINING TOURISM AS AN ECONOMIC PHENOMENON WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CONSUMPTION MACROECONOMIC THEORY. ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY, TOURISM IS CONSIDERED TO BE A PARTICULAR KIND OF CONSUMPTION, THAT IS THE SO - CALLED "TOURISM CONSUMPTION". IN SUCH A RESPECT OF THEORETICAL ANALYSIS APPROACH, TOURISM COMPRISES A FULLY CONSUMPTION CIRCUIT IN THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMY. IN AN EMPIRICAL LEVEL, THE RESEARCH PROPOSES THE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF "SYSTEM ANALYSIS". THE EMPIRICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WHOLE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TOURISM IMPACTS ON THE GREEK REGIONS FOR THE YEARS 1993 - 1995, HAS BEEN COMPLETED THROUGH THE SYSTEM EQUATIONS OF THE "TOURISM IMPACT MODEL". THE RESULTS OF EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS PROVIDE A NUMBER OF USEFUL CONCLUSIONS THAT FIND OUT THE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT LIMITS OF EVERYTOURIST ACTIVE GREEK REGION. ...|$|R

The risetime was improved by a peaking capacitor, with a tunable inductor to provide a locally flat pulse. The pulse was flattened by an adjustable droop inductor. Fine adjustment was provided by-pulse forming line tuners driven by stepping motors. Further risetime improvement will be obtained by a saturating ferrite-pulse sh&pener. The SLAC. Linear Collider (SLC) e- damping ring kickers must inject and extract 2 bunches on a single pulse, one for collision and one for e+ production, to produce full collision rate, The two bunches are 60 nsec apart, and must receive the same kick to 10 - 3 or better. The pulser risetime is marginal, and in addition the multigap thyratrons required for high voltage and fast rise time produce a series of prepulses as ths gaps break down. Neither of two different magnet designs has produced a field pulse with the desired risetime and flatness for 2 e- bunch extraction [l]. These problems combined to prevent operation with 2 bunches in the e- damping ring, allowing {{only half of the}} linac pulses to be used for collisions, with the other half used for e+ production. A program to produce a better magnet was undertaken, but progress was expected to be slow because the magnet faces additional constraints from size, high voltage, and radiation damage 121. A parallel program was therefore undertaken to control the pulse shape. II. <b>SHAPING</b> WITH LUMPED COMPONENTS The e- extraction kicker pulser [3] uses 2 thyratrons in an oil filled tank to switch charged cables at the anodes into output cables at the floating cathodes to the magnet and its terminating load. Each thyratron switches 2 parallel 50 ohm cables, and 4 cables are paralleled at the magnet. The first method of pulse shaping was to connect inductors (“droo...|$|R

The dissertation looks across the 49 th parallel to propose a semiotics and politics of North American women's writings about the West. As a {{part of an ongoing}} critical conversation about entanglements of body, and place, this study considers the way maps and bodies and the potential of new places open up opportunities for women writers. My dissertation reimagines as a community texts that have previously been narrowly categorized as, for example, nature writing, or western, or written by a woman, or regionalist American or Canadian. The group of writers I've chosen includes Americans Willa Cather, Martha Ostenso, Terry Tempest Williams and Louise Erdrich, and Canadians Margaret Laurence, Ethel Wilson, Gabrielle Roy, and Aritha van Herk. The texts written by this group consider intersections of gender, power, and the physical specificity of the land while redefining the terms belonging and Otherness {{in the context of a}} new space. Rethinking language leads to interrogation of the ways that bodies (nations, communities, people) both join and separate themselves from other bodies, including borders, houses, and the way maps of belonging are drawn. The work of feminist cultural geographers is crucial to my interrogation of geographic and political borders and borderlands, the physical bodies inhabiting those literal and fictional liminal spaces and the effects of the language used by and about women who choose to locate their work there. The lived experience of westering women pervades the texts in this study; recognition of the great fact of the body grounds each one in a physical reality. Admitting the previously unspeakable female body precludes the preservation of those mythological structures that accompany given spaces. These writers create an imaginative space in which images of containing structures (maps and bodies, houses and even cars) escape their definitions to deliver on the promise inherent in new places for women writers and their texts...|$|R
