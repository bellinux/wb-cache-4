It was also announced that these would be all out <b>strikes</b> with everybody walking out at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later called off in order for further talks to take place.|$|E

In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the <b>strikes</b> on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E

Even though a wider array of targets {{was assigned to the}} task groups, from the Pescadores to northern Luzon and Formosa, far fewer enemies were encountered in the air. Results of the day's strike operations were hard to ascertain due to the overcast. Pilots' reports from these two days of <b>strikes</b> helped uncover a larger network of air bases on Formosa than previously anticipated. This knowledge, combined with radio intercepts and the dusk <b>strikes</b> fended off the previous evening, led Commander Task Force 38 Mitscher to cancel any <b>strikes</b> scheduled to take off after 14:00 hours. Instead, the task groups prepared to defend against another night assault.|$|E

Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee.

Being unable to score a takedown due to Silva's constant violations of the ref's commands, Sonnen failed to connect with a high-risk spinning backfist strike, leaving Sonnen in a scooting position for Silva to land a knee to the chest, then with punches to stop Sonnen with a TKO at 1:55 of the second round.|$|E
