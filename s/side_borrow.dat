As a contribution to constructing a framework towards understanding controversies linked to scientific practices, we introduce the notion of borrowed epistemic credibility (BEC), to describe the situation in which scientists exploit fallacious similarities between accepted tenets in other fields to garner support for a given position in their own field. Our proposal is based on the analysis of a recent controversy in phylogeography, a biological subdiscipline concerned with the study of the historical causes of variation in genetic diversity within species in concrete biogeographical locations. Through a review of the arguments that support the two conflicting phylogeographic schools, we show that ‘theory’ plays essentially no role as a foundation of the controversy, whereas both <b>sides</b> <b>borrow</b> epistemic credibility from sources such as formal logic, similarity of results to those in other scientific areas, the authority of prominent scientists, or the presumed superiority of quantitative vs. verbal reasoning. Our case study underscores the indivisibility of theory and practice and provide a means to re-examine important philosophical issues such as the meaning of inference, rationality, justification, and objectivity in scientific practice...|$|R

These marks are called [...] "patterans;" [...] there are three patterans in common use. One is to pluck three large handfuls of grass and to throw them on the ground, at a short {{distance}} from one another, in the direction taken; another is, to draw a cross on the ground, with one arm much longer than the rest, as a pointer--a cross is better than any other simple mark, for it catches many different lights.

40|$|This note/essay {{examines}} {{the evidence on}} the effect of stronger IP laws introduced during the process of international IP law harmonization initiated by the TRIPS agreement, on the economic development of developing countries. It has been argued by proponents of harmonization that stronger IP laws will provide a needed boost to the economic development of developing (and even least-developed) countries. Critics of harmonization have argued that stronger IP laws will have the opposite effect. What has been largely overlooked in this debate is the strength of the evidentiary foundation upon which the arguments of both sides depend. Many of the economic arguments of both <b>sides</b> <b>borrow</b> background assumptions from the neoclassical school of economics, a paradigm that has lately come under intense criticism and scrutiny from both current students of economics and greatly respected economists. After briefly discussing the crisis of neoclassical economics and providing a demonstration of the deficiencies in the application of neoclassical modeling techniques to the IP 2 ̆ 6 development question, I examine some of the latest empirical evidence on the question, and then examine the history of the relationship between IP 2 ̆ 6 development. The conclusion of this examination is that empirical evidence does not clearly support either side; rather, a great deal more analysis is required, especially analysis of what one author calls “natural experiments. ” These natural experiments {{are to be found in}} history, and the historical relationship of IP 2 ̆ 6 development clearly demonstrates, if anything, an inverse relationship between strong IP laws and successful economic development. In light of this result, John Kenneth Galbraith’s phrase “conventional wisdom” is an apt description of the position, well-represented in the community of American IP legal scholars, that the international harmonization of IP laws will help the economies of developing nations to grow...|$|R
40|$|Italian local {{authorities}} share {{with those of}} other European countries a considerable degree of fragmentation. In addition, they suffer from the well-known North-South differential in economic conditions. On top of this, their management has long been split between the left-wing (mainly Communist) and the conservative (mainly Christian Democrat) political philosophy. This has rendered their performances and behaviour quite heterogeneous and has complicated the task of securing an equitable system of central - local financial relationships. For decades most of the southern authorities and the 'red' fraction of the centre-northern authorities have taken advantage of the possibility of borrowing for balancing the budget on the current account. This was a major loophole in the system until 1977. Bankruptcy was avoided ony through 'entente' between the Christian Democrats and the Communists in early 1978 (at the time of Mr Moro's murder), whereby all outstanding debt of {{local authorities}} was cancelled and transferred to the Central Government. In spite of an officially proclaimed 'restraint' there followed a period of real 'Renaissance' in local budgets, especially on the capital <b>side.</b> <b>Borrowing</b> [...] this time for capital expenditure [...] was again at the root of this development. Part of the deal was a revival of the 'fiscal effort' on the local side, making use of the few sources of own revenue left to local authorities after the fiscal reform of 1973 - 1974. Meanwhile, the 'equalisation issue' was raised with regard to the distribution of the general grant. Distribution criteria have been constantly changing since 1982. A completely new approach is now under consideration at the Ministry of Interior, based on the notion of 'equal grant' for 'normal' local authorities. Such an approach will eventually put aside the 'past expenditure' criterion which is still {{at the core of the}} grant distribution. While waiting for this reform, local authorities will almost certainly get a new local tax ('tax for the financing of services') starting in 1986. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the events}} of the 2007 Crisis unfolded, {{it was clear that the}} failure or even rumors about the failure of one single {{institution}} could trigger freezes in numerous capital markets and widespread default in other financial institutions. How this was brought about, however, was everything but clear. Ten years later, as we stand today, the literature has progressed but many questions remain unresolved. The first question at hand is of course how banks were related and how these bilateral relationships were able to act as a passage of contagion. On the liability <b>side,</b> <b>borrowing</b> between banks provides liquidity insurance against their idiosyncratic shocks. In bad times however, insurance networks malfunctioned, and more centrally connected banks were able to monopolize on their market power to secure a larger surplus in the scramble for liquidity. My first paper further explores the relationship between network position and the ability to hoard liquidity. In addition, assets on bank balance comprise another important channel of contagion and one should ask to which extent cross holding of asset portfolios is optimal. When does the benefit from diversification over idiosyncratic risks dominate? And when does market risk increase systemic risk of common portfolio holdings? The second essay analyzes these questions from the perspectives of private and social welfare. In the end, one must also wonder how these networks were formed at the beginning and how the endogenous formation correlates with the structural implications. The third paper takes a step back and begins with a world where banks optimally choose links, prices and the amounts of trade. This endogenously determined network structure then serves as a coherent laboratory for understanding various frictions in the interbank market such as market freezes. Financial networks are complex and so is the research about them. Hence, in this thesis, I have attempted to shed light on them from various angles, utilizing both bilateral network data as well as theoretical analytical tools. It is my hope that taken together, this set of essays can contribute to a holistic understanding of interconnectedness in financial market...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Some recent {{comparative}} studies {{have revealed that}} regulatory regions can retain function over large evolutionary distances, even though the DNA sequences are divergent and difficult to align. It is also known that such enhancers can drive very similar expression patterns. This poses a challenge for the in silico detection of biologically related sequences, as they can only be discovered using alignment-free methods. Results: Here, we present a new computational framework called Regulatory Region Scoring (RRS) model {{for the detection of}} functional conservation of regulatory sequences using predicted occupancy levels of transcription factors of interest. We demonstrate that our model can detect the functional and/or evolutionary links between some non-alignable enhancers with a strong statistical significance. We also identify groups of enhancers that are likely to be similarly regulated. Our model is motivated by previous work on prediction of expression patterns and it can capture similarity by strong binding sites, weak binding sites and even the statistically significant absence of sites. Our results support the hypothesis that weak binding sites contribute to the functional similarity of sequences. Our model fills a gap between two families of models: detailed, data-intensive models for the prediction of precise spatio-temporal expression patterns on the one side, and crude, generally applicable models on the other <b>side.</b> Our model <b>borrows</b> some of the strengths of each group and addresses their drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|All user {{interfaces}} {{have to be}} designed. This seemingly empty statement still holds a lesson, because all too often programmers just implement the first idea they have, without asking themselves if there are alternatives. Programmers are not typical users, {{and even if they}} try to place themselves in the user’s position, what seems a good choice at rst {{may turn out to be}} less than optimal in the long run. User interface design can be approached from different perspectives. There is the view from sociology: how do computers infuence the behaviour of their users? Do computers make tasks more enjoyable, easier, and less stressful? Psychology can look at the way people’s skills, learning ability and character are cooperating with or working against certain styles of interaction. Ergonomics studies the relation between various measures of people’s abilities to perform a task and measurable properties of their tools, both hardware and software. Last, but not least, there is computer science, which concentrates on the hardware and software that makes various styles of interaction possible. Computer science studies effIciency both with respect to the machine and with respect to the user; it creates new methods and develops the coordination between software, documentation and training. A book on Human Computer Interaction (hci) could focus on many aspects of the interface between computers and people. This book only treats interfaces (software only) that are created for traditional and widely available hardware, viz., keyboard, screen and mouse. It brings ideas from the above mentioned four disciplines together, but it focusses on the computer science <b>side.</b> Insights <b>borrowed</b> from all of them result in a list of desired features, but it is not possible to give exact rules about what is good in interface design and what isn’t: science just has not progressed that far. But we can create the means to experiment, to create different interfaces easily, so we can empirically find out what is best in concrete situations. The purpose of the book, then, is to provide means to design good, user-friendly interfaces. An additional goal is to provide these means to programmers and non-programmers alike, in other words: the tools themselves should be easy to use. The book describes various systems that have been created with this or a similar goal in mind and compares them to the system that the author himself developed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of the international debt crisis in the 1980 s is typically explained through exogenous shocks to the global economic system, first generating excess liquidity and then creating conditions which render previously attractive lending operations unprofitable. Thus, the international debt crisis is explained as a historical accident, driven by exogenous changes in the global markets. In fact, however, this debt crisis was not a unique occurrence, but rather the last event in a sequence of debt crises. Latin America alone has now experienced {{a total of five}} severe crises since the early 19 th century. The central argument of this dissertation is that all these crises are characterized by the same structural forces which drive borrowing countries to take on an excess amount of capital, while commercial lenders are driven to engage in excessive lending. ^ On the <b>borrowing</b> <b>side,</b> populist behavior was pervasive during the borrowing binges throughout history. Political leaders made use of the availability of capital from abroad to soothe social dissatisfaction at home and to strengthen their alliances in order to improve their leadership position. In fact, during the 1970 s, borrowing volumes almost invariably increased substantially during periods of political instability or at times of elections. In a formal approach, such behavior can only be captured by substituting the political leader as crucial decision-making agent for the standard planner, typically used in economic modeling. A game-theoretic sequential equilibrium model is used to reveal the incentives for the politician to borrow beyond the socially optimal level. ^ On the lending side, commercial creditors can consistently be separated into leaders and followers, be it in the form of investment banks and bondholders or money-center banks and small regional banking houses. Invariably, the leaders derived additional benefits from the lending operations which did not accrue to the followers. It therefore paid for the leaders to expand the lending volume, and required them to convince the followers of the profitability of these loans. A formal model based on informational asymmetries resulting from the segmentation of the banking industry during the 1970 s shows the tendency to lend in excess of the social optimum. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{year was}} 2006, {{the housing market}} was booming, and {{it seemed as though}} any {{borrower}} was able to get a loan. The housing bubble finally burst in 2007 - 2008 leading to the worst financial crisis since the 1930 ’s Great Depression. This crisis threatened the collapse of many large financial institutions and was prevented only because of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. A bailout of $ 831 billion between 2009 through 2019 led to capital regulations of big banks. These requirements are put in place to ensure these institutions do not take on excess leverage and become insolvent. By establishing these regulations, financial institutions are forced to hold enough capital to ensure continuation of a safe and efficient market and withstand any foreseeable problems. However, these capital requirements make it harder for the average American to receive a loan from the banks, and near impossible for low FICO score individuals to receive a loan. This has forced many borrowers to turn elsewhere to find a loan. Lending Club is a relatively new form of investing and borrowing founded in 2006. It takes the age- old concept of lending money to a friend and combines it with the advancements in technology to create a new form of borrowing called peer-to-peer lending. Soaring in popularity for its ease of use and ability to receive loans, Lending Club has claimed 15. 98 B in loans through December 31 st 2015. In August of 2014 they launched their IPO on the NYSE and saw the stock rise 56 % by the next day. This valued the company at 8. 5 B. Although a relatively young industry, peer-to-peer lending has been picking up steam and generating extreme interest across the country. Lending Club offers two forms of business, the lending and the <b>borrowing</b> <b>side.</b> My project, Forget the Bank: The Future is Peer-to-Peer Lending, focused on the lending aspect of Lending Club and began with a personal seed investment of $ 500. This allowed me to invest in 20 “partial” $ 25 notes of larger borrowing requests. Although I am not able to meet the borrower face to face, Lending Club offers key statistic’s that allow me to generate an investment profile of the borrower. These statistics include monthly income, FICO Credit score, job title, debt to income ratio, and delinquencies in the last 3 years. Using these statistics I was able to generate an idea of to whom I would be lending money. Lending Club then ranks the loans according to possible risk on a scale from A-G. From there, I can build a portfolio based on the amount of risk and ideal return I want to garner. My goal was to take a personal investment of $ 500 and achieve a 12 % interest rate throughout the 3 months of my Honors study. During this time I researched the industry of peer-to-peer lending, generated an investment profile, and dug deep into the backbone of Lending Clubs business model...|$|R
40|$|The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a {{historic}} construction. It is a monetary union among sovereign states that have surrendered their monetary policy and entered a fixed exchange rate regime, while maintaining an autonomous fiscal policy. Internal and external macroeconomic imbalances have developed between the member states since {{the creation of the}} monetary union, but the effect of this development became more visible after the financial crisis, as it led to some European states requiring emergency assistance from the IMF and the EU. This thesis studies whether the development of imbalances in three southern European countries, namely Greece, Italy and Spain, were: (a) the result of purely domestic sources; (b) the result of domestic difficulties amplified by EMU membership; or (c) the result of these countries joining the EMU, regardless of their domestic state of affairs prior to membership. The purpose is to understand what caused the imbalances to develop, as this has implications for the long run survival of the EMU, as well as how to construct potential new monetary unions between sovereign states. The method used is a country-specific case study of Greece, Italy and Spain, highlighting the differences and similarities of macroeconomic and microeconomic variables as well as policies between the countries from 1992 until 2011. To reveal when the imbalances started to develop the sample years have been divided into three periods: a pre-EMU, a core-EMU and a crisis-response period. The results are discussed for each country to discover the sources of the internal and external imbalances, and to evaluated whether the already suggest policy measures will remedy and hinder reoccurrence of the current problems in the EMU. The outcome of the case study is that the EMU membership amplified existing domestic imbalances in Greece, Italy and Spain. This amplification happened due to the more integrated financial market that led to the disappearance of the long-term interest rate spreads, resulting in easier access to credit for the government. Italy and Greece took advantage of this, while in Spain, the more integrated financial market caused the private sector to take on excessive debt. Greece, Italy and Spain experienced higher cost growth relative to the other EMU member countries, causing above average inflation and an appreciation of the real exchange rate. The countries lost competitive power relative to the other EMU member states and emerging markets. Identified sources of external imbalances were declining private and public saving rates combined with increased investment that created balance of trade deficits. Italy and Greece exemplify that a monetary union between sovereign states is doomed to fail when the regulatory framework lacks strong sanction possibilities. This is due to moral hazard on both the lending side, represented by the financial institutions, and on the <b>borrowing</b> <b>side,</b> represented by the governments. The presented evidence suggests that stricter financial regulation and firmer sanctions in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) are needed if the EMU is to survive in the long run, as the control mechanisms of the countries’ fiscal policy were too weak, relative to the large negative spillover effects from reckless borrowing. The policy implications that inform this, is that the EMU do not need to form a federal state or a fiscal union to survive in the long run, if the new macroeconomic surveillance regime as well as the SGP is obeyed to by all member states, in addition to implementation of an EMU-wide financial regulation framework. The main findings of this study can be generalized to other potential monetary unions in the making without a fiscal union, keeping in mind the limited nature of examining only three of the current 17 EMU member states...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{has brought to}} the fore the need to better understand systemic risk, that is, the risk of collapse of {{a large part of}} the financial system and its potential effects on the real economy. In this thesis, we argue that a proper assessment of systemic risk must include an analysis of the network of interdependencies that exists between the different financial institutions. In fact, today's level of financial interconnectedness between and among markets has proven to have ambiguous effects. On the one hand, a highly connected system allows to diversify risk at the micro level. On the other hand, too much interdependencies provide various paths for contagion to take place and propagate at the macro level. In what follows, we analyze financial markets as networks of interactions and dependencies between financial agents. Through this lens, we investigate three major aspects: (i) how the structure of financial networks can amplify or mitigate the propagation of financial distress, (ii) what are the implications for macro-prudential regulation and (iii) which patterns of interactions characterize real financial networks. We start out by delivering a stability analysis of a network model of interbank contagion that accounts for panics and bank runs. We identify the effects of market architecture, banks' capital ratios, market liquidity and shocks. Our results show that no single network architecture is always superior to others. In particular, highly concentrated networks can both be the most robust and the most fragile depending on other market characteristics, mainly, liquidity. We then move on to tackle issues related to the building of regulatory frameworks that adequately account for the effects of financial interdependencies. We propose a new methodology to compute individual and systemic probabilities of default and show that certain network characteristics give rise to uncertainty. More precisely, we find that network cycles are responsible for the emergence of multiple equilibria even in the presence of complete knowledge. In turn, multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty for the regulator in the determination of default probabilities. We also quantify the effects of network structures, leverage, volatility and correlations. Having introduced a way to overcome multiplicity, we deliver a method that quantifies the price of complexity in financial markets based on the above mentioned model. This method consists of determining the scope of possible levels of systemic risk that can be obtained when some parameters are subject to small deviations from their true value. The results show a price to the interconnected nature of credit markets even when the equilibrium is unique: small errors can lead to large mistakes in measuring the likelihood of systemic default. Extending the model to account for derivative contracts, we show that error effects increase dramatically as more types of contracts are present in the system. While there is an intuition for such phenomenon, our framework formalizes the idea and quantifies its determinants. In the last part of this thesis, we contribute to the quantitative analysis of real financial networks. We start with a temporal network analysis of one of the major national interbank markets, that is, the German interbank market. We report on the structural evolution of two of the most important over-the-counter markets for liquidity: the interbank market for credit and for derivatives. We find that the majority of interactions is concentrated onto a set of few market participants. There also exists an important correlation between the borrowing and lending activities for each bank in terms of numbers of counterparties. In contrast with other works, we find little impact of the 2008 crisis on the structure of the credit market. The derivative market however exhibits a peak of concentration in the run up to the crisis. Globally, both markets exhibit large levels of stability for most of the network metrics and high correlation amongst them. Finally, we analyze how banks interact with the real economy by investigating the network of loans from banks to industries in Japan. We find evidence of a particular structure of interactions resulting from the coexistence of specific strategies both on the lending <b>side</b> and the <b>borrowing</b> side: generalist agents and specialist agents. Generalist banks have a diversified portfolio (i. e. they provide liquidity to almost all industries) while specialist banks focus their activity on a narrow set of industries. Similarly, generalists industries obtain credit from all banks while specialist industries have a restricted number of creditors. Moreover, the arrangement of interactions is such that specialists tend to only interact with generalists from the other side. Our model allows to structurally characterize highly persistent, and economically meaningful, sets of generalists and specialists. We further provide an analysis of the factors that predict whether a given bank or industry is a generalist. We show that size is an important determinant, both for banks and industries, but we also highlight additional relevant factors. Finally, we find that generalist banks tend to be less vulnerable. Hence, how banks position themselves in the network has important implications for their risk profile. Overall the results presented in this thesis highlight the complex role played by financial interlinkages. Therefore, they demonstrate the need to embed the network dimension in the regulatory framework to properly assess the stability profile of financial systems. Such findings are relevant for both theoretical modeling and empirical investigations. We believe that they also shed light on crucial aspects of systemic risk relevant for policy making and regulation of today's complex financial systems.
