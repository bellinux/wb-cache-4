30|$|Whereas site {{conditions}} are {{reflected by the}} water potential at pre-dawn, the adaptation of the different species {{is illustrated by the}} plant water potential at midday (compare Table 2 and Fig. 6). Comparing E. pseudebenus (<b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> <b>numbers</b> 3 and 8) with neighbouring V. erioloba, it is observable that E. pseudebenus shows a more ‘excessive character’ regarding its water potential. By withstanding a similar or even higher pre-dawn water potential than the neighbouring trees, it applies a remarkably lower midday water potential. Gebrehiwot et al. (2005) reveal comparable characteristics of various species by using the same methods in the N-Ethiopian drylands. This difference in the species’ water-usage-character could support an explanation for the different distribution and dominance of the tree species (Mitlöhner 1998). While V. erioloba is widely distributed in the Namib Desert, the species E. pseudebenus, illustrating a ‘more excessive character’, is usually found along dry watercourses and in riverine fringe forests (vide Van Wyk and Van Wyk 1997; Palgrave 2002).|$|R
30|$|The {{observations}} at Homeb {{reveal the}} underground water {{supply of the}} Kuiseb, considering that the pre-dawn water potential reflects the availability of soil water independently from the species which has been assessed: The trees located close to the riverbed seem to enjoy sufficient water supply. The maximum values of the plant water potential at midday close to the riverbed (e.g. <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> 4, 5 and 9) are even higher (indicating a lower water potential) than the relaxation values reflecting soil water availability (pre-dawn plant water potential) of <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> are ca. 75  m further away (e.g. <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> <b>numbers</b> 1, 2 and 11). Figure  6 illustrates different values of water availability according to the sample trees’ position {{in relation to the}} riverbed: The abundant ground-water supply, illustrated by all species as the pre-dawn plant water potential, reflects a site-specific value. As long as the assessed tree species root within the same depth and site, the different species reflect the same parameter of soil water condition. Summarising these findings, the availability of ground water is implied by the pre-dawn water potentials of the sample trees: The closer the <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> are located to the riverbed, the greater the availability of plant-available soil water (Fig. 6). Salinity might be expected to increase with distance away from the riverbed; although the soil samples did not provide clear results for this assumption (Table 1). However, the soil sample depth is questionable and thus limits the information value. Horton et al. (2001 b) describe similar experiences with native riparian tree species in Arizona, where the pre-dawn water potential described the availability or the reduction of available soil water according to river-flow regulation. Comparable results are available from Otieno et al. (2005 b), who recorded leaf water potentials to assess root access to soil water at varying soil depths and how this affects the expression of morphological and physiological traits developed during drought in the savannah region of Kenya.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} theory of the so called reconstruction method to estimate the Young’s modulus (E) and modulus of rupture (SR) of coconut logs. The reconstruction method includes among others; flexure test on small-clear specimens, which were taken from locations distributed along the horizontal as well as vertical direction inside the logs. Further, the estimated E and SR were acquired by arranging systematically each of the small clear specimens as if back in the original location in the logs. The estimation was assisted by mechanical theory, statistics (best fit multiple regression equations), mathematics (calculus), and geometry approach. This reconstruction method successfully estimates E and SR of the coconut logs. The average estimated E and SR value as acquired from <b>tree</b> <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> 1 and 2 were 8, 118 – 8, 596 MPa, and 118 – 124 MPa, respectively. Those two values were still comparable to common US wood species used for construction i. e. 6, 660 – 15, 000 MPa (for E); and 58 – 132 MPa (for SR). Moreover those estimations of E and SR correlated significantly with each other. This again strengthens the reliability and representativeness of the E and SR values for coconut logs as acquired using the proposed reconstruction methods...|$|R

The objective was to determine the best aspect on the <b>tree,</b> <b>number</b> of needle age classes, and <b>number</b> of <b>trees</b> that would best predict top height in these plantations at age 20. Needles were sampled from thirty subplots representative of the geographical and productivity range of this species. On the fifth whorl of each <b>sample</b> <b>tree,</b> random groups of 10 fascicles were collected from various trees, aspects, and age classes and measured for average needle length. Total height, height to the first and sixth whorls above breast height and diameter at breast height were measured on each <b>sample</b> <b>tree.</b> Weighted simple linear regression models quantified the relationship between needle length and top height of the stand at 20 years, with top height specified as the mean height of four possible stand components. Mean needle lengths were computed as plot-level means for each age class-aspect combination as well as plot-level means for 2 - to 5 -consecutive years by aspect. To assess for the necessity of sampling from a fixed aspect, the null hypothesis of no differences between aspects was tested on a plantation-, plot-, and tree-level. Only the current year's needle lengths had a significant difference in needle lengths (NL) between NW and SE aspects. The stand component representing the 100 -most dominant stems per hectare by diameter was selected for the final model because on average this dimension was more reliably predicted. Because precipitation is thought to have an effect on needle length, and because precipitation fluctuates widely between years, it is advisable to measure as many age classes of needles as possible to obtain accurate estimates of potential site productivity...|$|R
