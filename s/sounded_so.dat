25|$|In February 1996, the Billboard posted {{information}} that singer {{was putting the}} finishing touches to her new studio album, I'm Movin' On, slated for its release in May. Judging from the magazine’s earlier preview of several cuts, Billboard published that Peniston was about to explore more mature jeep-soul fare a la Faith Evans, and that she has never <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> assured and convincingly soulful. Though I'm Movin' On with a noticeably slimmed-down Peniston adorning its cover was not released until September, a similarly sleek sound marked its title single delivered to the radio stations on July 17, while hitting music stores one week later.|$|E
500|$|The album Sound-Dust {{followed}} in 2001, {{and rose to}} number 178 on the Billboard 200. Again featuring producers McEntire and O'Rourke, it was more warmly received than Cobra and Phases Group.... Critic Joshua Klein said that [...] "the emphasis this time sounds less on unfocused experimentation and more on melody...a breezy and welcome return to form for the British band." [...] Klein also commented that [...] "never has it been harder to discern just what [...] is singing, but rarely has her gibberish <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> pleasant." ...|$|E
500|$|Foley artist Casey Crabtree {{provided}} sounds for horse hoof movements, {{work that}} was praised by sounds effects industry expert David Yewdall. He said of Crabtree's work on Brisco, [...] "Her horses <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> natural and real– their hooves, {{the sound of their}} hooves on the texture of the ground, the sound of saddle movement, bridle jingles– it was as good as anything I would want for a feature film, and this was episodic television." [...] The make-up on many of Briscos episodes was done by veteran artist Mel Berns Jr.|$|E

500|$|Chesimard {{changed her}} name to Assata Olugbala Shakur in 1971. Assata is a West African name, derived from the Arabic name Aisha, said to mean [...] "she who struggles", while Shakur means [...] "thankful one" [...] in Arabic. Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: “It <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> strange when people called me Joanne. It really {{had nothing to do}} with me. I didn’t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. I felt like an African woman”.|$|E
500|$|They moved {{again to}} Mount Vernon, New York {{where she worked}} at the local health and welfare council. Brown's efforts in the {{election}} campaign to elect an African-American proved successful and Harold Wood {{was elected to the}} Westchester County Board of Supervisors. She wrote, [...] "At one point the plan we projected for electing a black to the County Board of Supervisors <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> convincing we decided we really ought to try it... Harold Wood won the election to become the first back to serve on the Westchester County Board of Supervisors".|$|E
500|$|After Stefani and Kanal {{finished}} writing [...] "Luxurious", {{they visited}} record producer Nellee Hooper, who suggested {{a sample of}} The Isley Brothers' 1983 song [...] "Between the Sheets". The song had previously been sampled in several songs such as Da Brat's [...] "Funkdafied", Jim Jones' [...] "Summer wit Miami", The Notorious B.I.G.'s [...] "Big Poppa", and Whitney Houston's [...] "One of Those Days". Stefani was reluctant to use the sample because it would mean losing some of the publishing rights to the song. Nevertheless, she decided to use it because [...] "it <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> amazing and meant to be".|$|E

500|$|Before Korn {{developed}} a name, {{they had moved}} into a small house together in Huntington Beach, California, south of Los Angeles, where they began working on songs. Soon after moving, they rented Underground Chicken Sounds, a recording studio, from Jeff Creath, who had previously allowed lead singer Jonathan Davis to live in his garage. While they were recording at the studio, they attracted {{a crowd of people}} when performing the prelude to [...] "Clown". The band's bass guitarist, Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu, said that the crowd gathered because the band's style <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> [...] "different".|$|E
500|$|Doggystyle {{is seen by}} many hip hop pundits as a [...] "classic" [...] and an [...] "essential" [...] album. It is {{credited}} with defining West Coast hip hop; shifting the emphasis to more melodious, synth-driven, and funk-induced beats. About.com stated during the period the album was released, [...] "Gangsta rap never <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> sweet." [...] The album {{is credited}} for further establishment of the slurred [...] "lazy drawl" [...] that sacrificed lyrical complexity for clarity and rhythmic cadence on Doggystyle and The Chronic. The album is considered {{as one of the}} first G-funk albums the style of which many rappers duplicated in later years.|$|E
500|$|The band {{immediately}} started {{to search for}} a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, [...] "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> clean. But the more I listened to it, I realized there's some really good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|E

500|$|For London seasons, Carte engaged guest conductors, first Geoffrey Toye, then Malcolm Sargent, who {{examined}} Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions. [...] So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent {{that the press}} thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error. [...] In a letter to The Times, he noted that [...] "the details of the orchestration <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> fresh {{that some of the}} critics thought them actually new... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan." [...] Carte also hired Harry Norris, who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} Evanescence as a whole, Catucci of Rolling Stone {{called the}} song [...] "pummeling but pretty." [...] In another review {{for the same}} publication, Matthew Perpetua wrote that the [...] "heaviness is less top-heavy" [...] in the song before adding that the band [...] "never <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> brisk and dynamic". Camille Dodero of the same publication called [...] "What You Want" [...] a [...] "hair-blowingly grandiose" [...] song. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a B rating and said, [...] "the song's grinding guitars, massive drums, goth-princess piano frills, and warrior-grrrl vocal rage feel like 2007 all over again." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix praised the chorus lines saying {{that it should have}} been chosen as a theme song for the film Contagion.|$|E
500|$|Dookie was {{released}} to critical acclaim. Bill Lamb at About.com regards {{it as an}} album that only gets better with time, calling it [...] "one of the landmark albums of the 1990s". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Dookie as [...] "a stellar piece of modern punk that many tried to emulate but nobody bettered". In 1994, Time claimed Dookie as the third best album of the year, and the best rock album of 1994. Jon Pareles from The New York Times, in early 1995, described the sound of Dookie as, [...] "Punk turns into pop in fast, funny, catchy, high-powered songs about whining and channel-surfing; apathy has rarely <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> passionate." [...] Rolling Stones Paul Evans described Green Day as [...] "convincing mainly because they've got punk's snotty anti-values down cold: blame, self-pity, arrogant self-hatred, humor, narcissism, fun".|$|E

500|$|Townshend {{played a}} 1959 Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins hollow body guitar fed through an Edwards volume pedal to a Fender Bandmaster amp, {{all of which}} he had been given by Joe Walsh while in New York. This {{combination}} became his main electric guitar recording setup for subsequent albums. Although intended as a demo recording, the end result <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> good to the band and Johns, they decided to use it as the final take. Overdubs, including an acoustic guitar part played by Townshend, were recorded at Olympic Studios at the end of April. The track was mixed at Island Studios by Johns on 28 May. After Lifehouse was abandoned as a project, Johns felt [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", along with other songs, were so good that they could simply be released as a standalone single album, which became Who's Next.|$|E
500|$|That {{the album}} <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> {{contemporary}} in 1970 contributed to All Things Must Pass seeming dated and faddish {{later in the}} decade. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, having bemoaned in 1971 that the album was characterised by [...] "overblown fatuity" [...] and uninteresting music, wrote in a 1981 review of its [...] "featurelessness", [...] "right down to the anonymity of the multitracked vocals". In their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler were likewise lukewarm in their assessment, criticising the [...] "homogeneity" [...] of the production and [...] "the lugubrious nature of Harrison's composing". Writing in The Beatles Forever in 1977, however, Nicholas Schaffner praised the album as the [...] "crowning glory" [...] of Harrison and Spector's careers, and highlighted [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] and [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] as the [...] "two most eloquent songs... musically as well as lyrically".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "their focus {{has never been}} clearer, nor has their music been catchier". [...] His review concluded, [...] "Never before have U2's big messages <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> direct and personal." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Bill Wyman wrote that the album combined [...] "easy-to-grasp themes — alienation and an outsider’s ambivalent view of America — with an extremely focused musical attack". A 2008 retrospective by Q said [...] "their reinvention of stadium rock sounds as impassioned as ever" [...] and that the album strikes [...] "a finely balanced mix of intimacy and power". Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone compared the album to Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A., stating that both records [...] "lifted a populist artist to mega-stardom", and that the musicians' uplifting live shows and the [...] "sheer aural pleasure" [...] of the two records obscured their foreboding nature. DeCurtis summarized The Joshua Trees examination of America both lyrically and musically as such: ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell exalted the lyricism of the song, {{stating that}} [...] "Sophie's music has never <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> lyrically rich" [...] and her [...] "storytelling skills" [...] were visible in it. Considine named the song a [...] "welcome break from lullabies (such as 'The Deer and the Wolf') that risk monotony" [...] on the album. Conversely, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{described}} [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] as a [...] "bogged down in pretension" [...] moment in Wanderlust; Erlewine {{went on to}} criticize the song's [...] "ceaseless pomp". Kate Bennett of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] was [...] "more of the same" [...] "heroine-gazing-forlornly-into-the-distance." [...] She elaborated, [...] "You'd {{have to have a}} heart of cold, igneous rock not to enjoy [...] just a little, but if you were never a member of your local youth theatre company the sticky-sweetness of it all quickly becomes cloying." [...] The song peaked at number 32 on the UK Airplay Chart, while on the UK Indie chart it reached number 33.|$|E
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used to listen to it a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E
