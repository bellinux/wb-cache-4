25|$|The four major, largely {{independent}} underpinnings {{that the}} nuclear winter concept has {{and continues to}} receive criticism over, are regarded as: firstly, would cities readily firestorm, and if <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> soot would be generated. Secondly, atmospheric longevity; would the quantities of soot assumed in the models remain in the atmosphere {{for as long as}} projected or would far more soot precipitate as black rain much sooner. Third, timing of events; how realistic is it to start the firestorms or war modelling in late spring or summer, which almost all US-Soviet winter papers assume, so as to depict the maximum possible cooling results. Lastly, the issue of darkness or opacity; how much light-blocking effect the assumed quality of the soot reaching the atmosphere would have.|$|E

25|$|All of {{this would}} go to waste however, when Henry VI died of a fever in Messina on 28 September 1197. Following his death many of the higher ranking nobles {{abandoned}} the crusade to protect their interests in the Holy Roman Empire. When civil war broke out shortly after, the crusade found itself leaderless and in 1198 the crusaders retreated back to Tyre and sailed for home. The result was that the crusade had the detrimental effect of destroying Byzantium's dignity and wealth whilst failing to assist her against the Turks. It must be said however that the Byzantines after 1180 entertained no serious plans to reclaim Anatolia from the Turks, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> territory Henry VI or his predecessor Frederick I seized may have been of little consequence in the long run.|$|E

Duke responded on his personal website by saying that he had not actually endorsed Trump. He later clarified that while he viewed Trump as [...] "the best of the lot", due to his stance on immigration, Trump's support for Israel was a dealbreaker for him. Duke claimed that [...] "Trump has {{made it very clear that}} he's 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> is left over for America?" [...] In December 2015, Duke said Donald Trump speaks more radically than he does, advising that Trump's radical speech is both a positive and a negative. In February 2016, Duke urged his listeners to vote Trump, saying that voting for anyone besides Donald Trump “is really treason to your heritage.” In 2016, someone claiming to be David Duke filed a lawsuit in a federal court attempting to bar Trump from the Florida presidential primary. The real Duke referred to the hoax as [...] "the biggest, dirtiest trick I've seen recently".|$|E

6000|$|... "For in {{the image}} of God made he man." [...] This seems as the reason of this equal law; because no man can slay his neighbour, but he striketh at the image of God. It is counted a heinous crime for a man to run his sword at the picture of a king, how much more to shed the blood of the image of God? [...] "He that mocketh, or oppresseth, the poor reproacheth his Maker; but he that honoureth him, hath mercy on the poor" [...] (Pro 14:31; 17:5). And if <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more do they reproach, yea, despise and abhor their Maker, that slay and murder his image! But most of all those do prove {{themselves}} the enemies of God, that make the holiness, the goodness, the religion and sobriety that is found in the people of God, the object of their wrath and hellish cruelty. Hence murder is, in the New Testament, imputed to that man that hated holy and godly man: [...] "He that hateth his brother, is a murderer; and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him" [...] (1 John 3:15).|$|E
60|$|Mr. Roby senior, having {{escaped from}} the House, was of course the last, and had indeed kept all the other guests waiting half-an-hour,--as becomes a {{parliamentary}} magnate {{in the heat of}} the Session. Mr. Wharton, who had been early, saw all the other guests arrive, and among them Mr. Ferdinand Lopez. There was also Mr. Mills Happerton,--partner in Hunky and Sons,--with his wife, respecting whom Mr. Wharton at once concluded that he was there as being the friend of Ferdinand Lopez. If <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> influence must Ferdinand Lopez have in that house! Nevertheless, Mr. Mills Happerton was in his way a great man, and a credit to Mrs. Roby. And there were Sir Damask and Lady Monogram, who were people moving quite in the first circles. Sir Damask shot pigeons, and so did also Dick Roby,--whence had perhaps arisen an intimacy. But Lady Monogram was not at all a person to dine with Mrs. Dick Roby without other cause than this. But a great official among one's acquaintance can do so much for one! It was probable that Lady Monogram's presence was among the first fruits of the happy family reconciliation that had taken place. Then there was Mrs. Leslie, a pretty widow, rather poor, who was glad to receive civilities from Mrs. Roby, and was Emily Wharton's pet aversion. Mrs. Leslie had said impertinent things to her about Ferdinand Lopez, and she had snubbed Mrs. Leslie. But Mrs. Leslie was serviceable to Mrs. Roby, and had now been asked to her great dinner party.|$|E
60|$|Three {{times in}} the twenty-four hours, Blunt, while at sea, {{regularly}} rubbed in his liniments; but though the first bottle was soon exhausted by his copious applications, and the second half gone, he still stuck to it, {{that by the time}} we got to Liverpool, his exertions would be crowned with success. And he was not a little delighted, that this gradual change would be operating while we were at sea; so as not to expose him to the invidious observations of people ashore; on the same principle that dandies go into the country when they purpose raising whiskers. He would often ask his shipmates, whether they noticed any change yet; and if <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of a change? And to tell the truth, there was a very great change indeed; for the constant soaking of his hair with oil, operating in conjunction with the neglect of his toilet, and want of a brush and comb, had matted his locks together like a wild horse's mane, and imparted to it a blackish and extremely glossy hue. Besides his collection of hair-oils, Blunt had also provided himself with several boxes of pills, which he had purchased from a sailor doctor in New York, who by placards stuck on the posts along the wharves, advertised to remain standing at the northeast corner of Catharine Market, every Monday and Friday, between the hours of ten and twelve in the morning, to receive calls from patients, distribute medicines, and give advice gratis.|$|E
