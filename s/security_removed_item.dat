40|$|Abstract. This paper {{estimates}} {{the development of}} a security process in four cases. This paper is intended to help the design lifecycle and progress manage-ment in ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria). There are many defects that cause the security requirement problems during the software development. This paper explores the areas of the lifecycle and progress management that remove the se-curity requirements and also manage the schedule and quality problems. For projects in similar domains, it is possible to <b>remove</b> <b>security</b> risk <b>items</b> and to manage progress by using security lifecycle and progress milestone, which can greatly improve the software process. ...|$|R
