The sounds of <b>Someone</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> bounced off every wall and tugged at every heart-string, making it a truly special moment and something that every member of the Apollo crowd will never forget."

In 1954, she had starred in a stage production of The Constant Nymph, {{but it was not until}} 1981, at the urging of her children, that she returned to legitimate theatre, starring as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music in London's West End. Opening to positive reviews and what was then the largest advance sale in British theatre history, Clark—proclaimed by Maria Von Trapp herself as [...] "the best Maria ever"—extended her initial six-month run to 13 to accommodate the huge demand for tickets. In 1983, she took on the title role in George Bernard Shaw's Candida. Later stage work includes <b>Someone</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> in 1989 and 1990, for which she composed the score, Blood Brothers, in which she made her Broadway debut in 1993 at the Music Box Theatre, followed by the American tour; and Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard, appearing in both the West End and American touring productions from 1995 to 2000. In 2004, she repeated her performance of Norma Desmond in a production at the Opera House in Cork, Ireland, which was later broadcast by the BBC.

[...] Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the piano melody is gorgeous and combined with Adele's heartfelt reading of her words, the effect is highly emotional. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike." [...] Lamb went to write that the song is one of the [...] "top songs of 2011" [...] and that [...] "romantic pain has rarely been so utterly beautiful." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters called the song an [...] "absolute magic" [...] and praised Adele's performance by saying, [...] "Though it is unquestionably her finest vocal showcase to date, it is less remarkable for its more powerful moments than for the small ones where her voice dips, with rueful melancholy on the line 'I heard that your dreams came true' or cracks on the 'I beg' in the chorus, like she's startled at the revelation of her own vulnerability." [...] He further called her vocal performance of the song [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "finally worthy of her talents".|$|E

Qiao Xuan was surprised to see Cao Cao and he told him, [...] "The world is about to enter a state of chaos. You're the person who will restore peace and order!" [...] At the time, Qiao Xuan and He Yong were the only two persons who felt that Cao Cao was extraordinary. Cao Cao later often said that Qiao Xuan was someone who really understood him.

The Shishuo Xinyu recorded that when Qiao Xuan met Cao Cao, who was still a youth then, he told him, [...] "The world is in chaos and warlords are fighting for supremacy. Aren't you the person who will eliminate all of them and restore order? You're actually a hero in chaotic times but a villain in times of peace. It's a pity that I'm old already because I won't be able to see you become wealthy and powerful. I entrust my descendants to you."

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} end of Adele's first [...] "real relationship" [...] with her long-time friend and lover and it shows her confronting his marriage. At the {{beginning}} of the song, she sings the lines [...] "I heard that you're settled down/That you found a girl and you're married now. I heard that your dreams came true/Guess she gave you things I [...] couldn't give to you" [...] with a softly voice and accompanied just by a simple piano melody. The lyrics of [...] "Someone like You" [...] are talking about what once was and what could have been as stated by a writer of Daily Herald. Finding the strength to bounce back from hardship and heartache, Adele sings the lines, [...] "Never mind, I'll find <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> <b>you.</b> I wish nothing but the best for you, too/Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said/Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead." [...] Talking about the meaning and the composition of the song, Jer Fairall of PopMatters said: [...] "The song's subject—Adele mentally addressing an old lover who has since found happiness elsewhere—is familiar, but the detail she colors it with are vibrantly tactile and resonant, from the sense-memory setting of 'we were born and raised in a summer haze' to her recollection of his cruel kiss-off line 'I remember you said, 'sometimes it lasts in love and sometimes it hurts instead' and how she comes to take solace in the statement as an empowering mantra." ...|$|E

Online {{praised the}} {{performance}} saying, [...] "When Adele {{took the stage}} to perform her understatedly stripped-down and hugely impactful performance of 'Someone Like You,' there were no pyrotechnics, no acrobatics, no lavender hair, and no autotune. And guess what? We didn't miss it. There may be hope yet for MTV to remember just what the 'M' in their name actually stands for." [...] Writing about the performance, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound concluded that [...] "Someone like You", [...] "highlighted the power a bare-bones, booming performance can have in netting people's attention. Simple {{is not a bad}} word, pop music." [...] Giving the performance an A+, Lindsey Ward of Jam! said: [...] "When I learned British chart-topper Adele would be performing at Sunday's awards I thought, 'Whew – at least we're guaranteed five solid, meaningful minutes of quality music television'. I was right; her frill-free performance of breakup ballad <b>Someone</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> was just that." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the performance calling it [...] "one of the best performances of the show." [...] Another writer of the same publication gave the performance a grade of A+ and wrote: [...] "It takes a real super power to make the seizure-inducing lasers stop, and that power's name is Adele. The broadcast temporarily abandoned its frantic mission of nonstop overstimulation, bowing to the 23-year-old English soulstress's soaring, nearly a cappella (well done, subtle piano man) rendition of her heart-wrecking ballad [...] "Someone Like You." [...] In a modest black dress and with a few spare hand movements, she delivered all the shock and awe of a million-watt showstopper. Who needs special effects, when God gave you your own? Even Britney Spears looked like she had to fix her mascara when it was all over." ...|$|E

5000|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a young, {{hesitant}} romance that is ultimately more self-centered and defensive than caring, capturing the subtle insecurities of teenage love.

The approach on this was different because Mega actually {{had a lot to}} do with the production. I was kind of giving him basic ideas; that’s how I start anyway. I start to format it a certain way and then as we start to build it I add on to it. The process was definitely outside of anything I’ve ever done before. I’m pretty much always control. Mega got a few of the sounds, like on the “Industry” song with the Lauryn Hill ad-lib. Mega put a lot into that kind of stuff. It’s a challenge work with one producer for a whole album. But, it’s Large Professor; he’s one of the greatest producers that’s ever existed. It’s not debatable. So when you get an opportunity with <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> that, <b>you</b> do it.
