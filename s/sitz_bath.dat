50|$|Kuhne's {{friction}} <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> and hip baths both {{involved the}} patient {{sitting in a}} tub filled with relatively cold water (about 10—14°C for the friction bath in the original instructions, although slightly higher temperatures are preferred today) and rubbing the lower abdomen, hips, or genitals with a rough linen cloth. The resulting nerve stimulation by the cold water was supposed to help eliminate toxins. Immediately after the bath the patient is put to bed to warm him up again.Louis Kuhne created a unique hydrotherapy panacea, including the friction <b>sitz</b> <b>bath,</b> to successfully heal {{a wide spectrum of}} diseases.|$|E
50|$|Such hip baths were {{originally}} a European custom, although modern sitz baths are used mainly for therapeutic purposes. The term <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> {{is derived from}} the German word Sitzbad, meaning a bath (Bad) in which one sits (sitzen).|$|E

Seven patients were withdrawn owing to failure {{to adhere to the}} trial protocol. After one and two weeks of treatment symptomatic relief was significantly better among patients treated with <b>sitz</b> <b>baths</b> and bran than among patients treated with lignocaine ointment or hydrocortisone ointment. After three weeks {{there was no difference in}} symptomatic relief among the three groups. Patients treated with lignocaine, however, had significantly fewer healed fissures (60 %) than patients treated with hydrocortisone (82. 4 %) or warm <b>sitz</b> <b>baths</b> and bran (87 %). In this study warm <b>sitz</b> <b>baths</b> plus an intake of unprocessed bran came out as the treatment of choice for an acute first episode of posterior anal fissure.

50|$|According to Kuhne, when waste matter accumulates in {{the body}} it pushes {{outwards}} and upward to areas from which {{it can no longer}} be eliminated, and consequently causes organ malfunction and disease. The function of the friction <b>sitz</b> <b>bath,</b> as he advocated it, (and the Detox Bath) is to push back the excess load of accumulated waste matter and toxins and redirect it back towards the intestines, from which it is later evacuated.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> or hip bath is a bath {{in which}} a person sits in water up to the hips.

5000|$|Dr Benjamin Lust called Louis Kuhne a [...] "Genius {{in the art}} of healing". Kuhne {{created the}} {{friction}} <b>sitz</b> <b>bath,</b> on which the Detox Bath is based. He believed that the origin of all disease is an accumulation of waste matter and toxins in the body. He reckoned that this deposited matter could sometimes even deform the body, as in spinal distortion for instance. This realisation gave birth to his doctrine of the [...] "Unity of Diseases".|$|E
50|$|This {{excess load}} makes the body {{incapable}} of normal elimination and nutrient absorption. The {{result is an}} accumulation of toxic deposits and fats that develops first around the stomach, hips, buttocks and thighs, and later travels towards the upper body and extremities. Kuhne devised the friction <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> (Father of the Detox Bath) specifically {{to deal with this}} action and redirect waste matter and toxins back towards the intestines for elimination. He demonstrated how, when used regularly, this particular bath could rid the body of disease and excess fat and help maintain optimal health.|$|E
5000|$|... water Kuhne {{demonstrated}} {{through his}} {{doctrine of the}} Unity of Diseases that the origin of all disease is a lifelong accumulation of waste matter and toxins in the body, either inherited or acquired, which manifests in various organs depending on heredity or genes. He observed that poor digestion {{was the cause of}} all subsequent ailments and that the body can only be healthy if the digestive organs are functioning correctly. This discovery allowed Kuhne to create a unique cure system for all disease manifestations. Kuhne's cure consisted chiefly in altering his patient's diet to vegetarian, coupled with frequent and regular steam, hip and especially friction <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> treatments.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} not {{available}} through ChesterRep. This article discusses the evidence reported from quasi randomised trials and randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and acceptability of localised cooling methods in alleviating perineal trauma. Two types of cooling methods were identified: iced <b>sitz</b> <b>baths</b> and cooling devices. The review suggests that cooling may lower the levels of reported perineal pain after childbirth and reduce the inflammatory response associated with perineal trauma. However, women's preferences {{as well as the}} efficacy of the cooling method should be taken into consideration. Women's natural reluctance to sit in iced <b>sitz</b> <b>baths</b> suggests that this cooling method is unpleasant and may explain why there has been a decline in this method being used in clinical practice over the last two decades.

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of warm water sitz baths in patients who have undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) owing to lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records of 1, 783 patients who had undergone TURP between 2001 and 2009. In the warm water <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> group, patients were instructed {{to sit in a}} tub containing lukewarm water at 40 - 45 o C for 10 minutes each time. Patients were advised to perform the procedure for at least 5 days immediately after the removal of a Foley urethral catheter. The differences in post-TURP complications between the warm water <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> group and the no <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> group were compared. Results: After TURP, 359 of the 1, 561 patients performed a warm water <b>sitz</b> <b>bath.</b> Complications after TURP, such as hemorrhage, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, and acute urinary retention were found in 19 (5. 3 %) and 75 (6. 2 %) patients in the <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> and no <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> groups, respectively (p= 0. 09). There was a significant difference in postoperative complications such as urethral stricture between the warm <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> group and the no <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> group (p= 0. 04). The group that did not undergo warm water <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> treatment showed a 1. 13 -fold increased risk of rehospitalization within 1 month after TURP due to postoperative complications compared with the warm water <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> group (odds ratio [OR]= 1. 134; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 022 to 1. 193; p= 0. 06). Conclusions: Warm water <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> treatment reduced postoperative complications such as urethral stricture.

40|$|Introduction: Episiotomy {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{surgeries}} in the world with few complication and perineal pain. Since the olive oil has antiseptic and healing effects, this study was performed to evaluate the effects of olive oil <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> on improvement of perineal injury after delivery. Materials and Methods: This double blind clinical trial was carried out on 60 selected eligible women who they had mediolateral episiotomy or perineal tear grade 1 and 2. Following repairing episiotomy, the subjects were randomly allocated into two groups: the Study group was undergone care by olive oil <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> and the control group by distilled water <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> for 10 days. Data were collected through demographic data, REEDA scale and visual analog scale of pain. Results: There was {{a significant difference between the}} study and control group with regards to pain severity after 5 and 10 days (p< 0. 05), wound redness after 5 days (p< 0. 0001) and redness (p< 0. 000), edema (p< 0. 05) 10 days after delivery. Any case of ecchymosis, discharge and approximation (distance between the wound edges) was not observed in the olive group but those signs were observed in the control group.

40|$|Aims: <b>Sitz</b> <b>bath</b> is a warm or cold bath {{used for}} healing or {{cleansing}} purposes. With over 85 % of women having a vaginal birth who sustain {{some form of}} perineal trauma and placed on <b>Sitz</b> <b>bath</b> without really effectively applying it, we thought of proposing an alternative simpler and relatively effective method: iodine based antiseptic(betadine) imbibed gauze cleansing. Study design: A randomized prospective trial. Setting and period: January 2009 to June 2009 in the central maternity of the Yaoundé Central Hospital because of the diversity and inflow of patients. Methodology: All women who suffered a perineal or a vaginal injury during delivery and who gave consent were recruited, into different treatment groups depending on randomization, by filling a pre-established and tested questionnaire. Randomization was done {{with respect to the}} day of the week they suffered the injury. They were then followed up with specific appointments for 9 days and the parameters of efficacy evaluated and compared among the randomly selected participants. Results were analyzed using the V 9 SAS software analytical system and significance value was tested with p < 0. 05 and CHI square. Results: We registered a 8 % (94 / 1045) injury prevalence, episiotomies and tears together. After 9 days follow up of the randomized groups, the efficacy (degree of healing, infections, pain) was similar in the different treatment groups although compliance was better in the antiseptic imbibed gauze group than the <b>sitz</b> <b>bath</b> group. Conclusion: Our results permitted us to conclude that the efficacies are comparable although the compliance was better with betadine gauze cleaning than <b>Sitz</b> <b>bath.</b> We recommend that a large scale with bigger sample size be carried out. While awaiting a broader scale that imbibed gauze cleaning of perineal injuries be used instead of <b>Sitz</b> <b>bath</b> as this will facilitate applicability and reduce perineal infections postpartum.
