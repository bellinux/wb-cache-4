5|$|The {{identity}} {{of the old man}} remains unclear, though context implies that he may be Pattern Recognition's protagonist Cayce Pollard's father, having removed himself from the channels of normal life to focus on disrupting what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> criminal elements operating in the United States Government.|$|E
5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced {{the issues raised by}} The Da Vinci Code and other critics.|$|E

5|$|Jürgen von Beckerath is less {{assertive}} about Sheshi's {{identity and}} assigns {{him to his}} combined 15th/16th Dynasty, where he regroups Hyksos rulers whose chronological position is uncertain together with kings whom he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> vassals of the Hyksos. Von Beckerath's analysis relies on the hypothesis that Manetho's 16th Dynasty comprised minor rulers of the Nile Delta region, called lesser Hyksos, who served the great Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty such as Khyan and Apophis.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{is known}} to be outspoken, and in the last decade, he has been openly {{critical}} of promotions that he feels have mistreated either himself personally or the talent in general. He has been particularly outspoken against what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> racism against Latino wrestlers in United States promotions – he butted heads with TNA over treatment of himself and Ron Killings, and WWE over issues regarding Latino wrestlers Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio, but he has also come into conflict with AAA over what he alleged was non-payment of talent.|$|E
5|$|Referring {{to the two}} ontological {{arguments}} {{proposed by}} Anselm in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Proslogion, Malcolm supported Kant's criticism of Anselm's argument in Chapter 2: that existence cannot be a perfection of something. However, he identified what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the second ontological argument in Chapter 3 which is not susceptible to such criticism.|$|E

5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries. In the Sermons, Skarga discusses what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the problems of the ailing Commonwealth: lack of patriotism, internal quarrels, tolerance of heretics, the king's relative powerlessness, perverse laws (a critique of the nobility's Golden Freedoms), and immorality. Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E
5|$|The South African comics writer Anton Kannemeyer has parodied the {{perceived}} racist {{nature of the}} book to highlight what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his Pappa in Afrika (2010), a satire of Tintin in the Congo, he portrays Tintin as an Afrikaner with racist views of indigenous Africans.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{interview}} {{the cast and}} crew as suspects, discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths—producer Kenny Neiderman had been having an affair with Danbury; Rowdy Beeman replaced Carroll as director; Ruby Dahl and Ramona Tangent, whose roles in the film will expand without Danbury; and Mark Bianco, a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet Black, whose role he plays. Also questioned is Hugo Winston, the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a disrespectful production.|$|E

5|$|With The Birds a box-office success, Hitchcock and Hedren {{begin work}} on Marnie. However, Hedren finds the film's content (including a marital-rape scene) and Hitchcock's {{obsession}} with her mentally and emotionally exhausting. The director is frustrated {{by what he}} <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> Hedren's coldness towards him. During a conversation with writer Evan Hunter, Hitchcock admits that he has erectile dysfunction and his only sexual partner is his wife (screenwriter Alma Reville). He later declares his love for Hedren; she walks away, leaving him frustrated and further rejected.|$|E
5|$|Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, the {{daughter}} of the leader of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest. The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated. Saldana has also signed on for potential sequels.|$|E
5|$|Anniyan (English: Outsider or Stranger) is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The plot centres on a disillusioned everyman whose frustration at what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to right the system. Vikram stars as Ramanujam, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who suffers from multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a metrosexual fashion model Remo and a vigilante serial killer named Anniyan. Sadha plays his love interest, Nandini. Actors Vivek, Prakash Raj, Nedumudi Venu and Nassar also feature in the film.|$|E

25|$|In the P/Q {{classification}} schema, {{the first}} language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars <b>see</b> <b>as</b> archaic, but others <b>see</b> <b>as</b> also {{being in the}} Brittonic languages (see Schmidt).

5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings {{form the basis of}} the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Chandrakumar is {{attacked}} by his company's labourers {{because he had}} suspended their union leader. Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has {{fallen in love with}} him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets Chandrakumar gave her shortly after their marriage but, irritated by what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> Divya's immaturity, Chandrakumar asks her to return to her parents home and books her trip. At the railway station, Chandrakumar gives Divya the divorce papers that she had requested as a wedding gift. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him, and they reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Heins recounts how the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{advocated}} for its associated organizations to add Parental Advisory warnings on labels of music albums {{as a way}} to advise parents about possible offensive content. She describes how the Parents Music Resource Center, co-founded by Tipper Gore, and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, which included Senator Al Gore, led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins suggests that this subsequently led to the industry's self-regulation, which the author <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> self-censorship, and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores.|$|E
5000|$|Faith as contradicting rationality: In this view, {{faith is}} <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> those views that one holds despite {{evidence}} and reason to the contrary. Accordingly, faith is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> pernicious {{with respect to}} rationality, as it interferes with our ability to think, and inversely rationality is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the enemy of faith by interfering with our beliefs.|$|R

Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.|$|E

5|$|No East Anglian {{charters}} (and {{few other}} documents) have survived to modern times and those mediaeval chronicles that {{refer to the}} East Angles are treated with great caution by scholars.

25|$|Buddhism understands life {{as being}} pervaded by Dukkha, as {{unsatisfactory}} and stressful. Ending one's life to escape present suffering is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> futile because one {{will just be}} reborn again, and again. One of the three forms of craving is craving for annihilation (vibhava tanha), and this form of craving {{is the root of}} future suffering. Dying with an unwholesome and agitated state of mind is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> leading to a bad rebirth, so suicide is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> creating negative karma. Ending one's life is also <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> throwing away the precious opportunity to generate positive karma. While suicide {{does not seem to be}} interpreted as a breaking of the first precept (not killing other beings) it is still <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a grave and unwholesome action.|$|R
