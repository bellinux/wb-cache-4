He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E

Halfway through the final lap, Cummings gave up and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> and since winning was the main concern today, George slowed to a walk when he was far enough ahead. Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards {{in a time of}} 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap.|$|E

In the event, however, he appeared at the crease to join Bert Sutcliffe, who had already <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> off the field. The packed crowd stood in silence.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's success, the entire show was {{overhauled}} in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the new Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo format now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute Scooby and Scrappy cartoons, who in previous Scooby series had been revealed to be human criminals in costume, were now real {{within the context of}} the series.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fourth}} day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua during India's tour of West Indies, 2006, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's flick off Dave Mohammed to the midwicket region was caught by Daren Ganga. As the batsman <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back, captain Rahul Dravid {{declared}} the innings. The confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder had stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, Lara, {{the captain of the}} West Indies side, felt that Dhoni should walk off, based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes. Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid's declaration was effected, although the game was delayed.

The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and Lara's temper was on display with finger wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire Asad Rauf. Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara's action was criticised by the commentators and former players. Lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions but he was not fined.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 17 July 2008, a woman was {{approached}} by Ghazni Province police officers {{in the city of}} Ghazni outside the Ghazni governor's compound. She was holding two small bags at her side while crouching on the ground. This aroused the officer's suspicion, raising concerns that she might be concealing a bomb under her burqa. Previously, a shopkeeper had noticed a woman in a burqa drawing a map, which is suspicious in Afghanistan where women are generally illiterate. There had also been a report that a Pakistani woman in a burqa with a boy were traveling in Afghanistan urging women to volunteer for suicide bombing. She was accompanied by a young boy that she said was her adopted son. She said her name was Saliha, that she was from Multan in Pakistan, and that the boy's name was Ali Hassan. Discovering that she did not speak either of Afghanistan's main languages, Pashtu or Dari, the officers regarded her as suspicious. She told the police she was looking for her husband, needed no help, and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away. She was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. She initially claimed the boy was her stepson, Ali Hassan. (The woman was not identified as Siddiqui until after hospitalized and fingerprinted. She subsequently admitted he was her biological son when DNA testing proved the boy to be Ahmed.|$|E
25|$|On the SmackDown! {{before the}} Royal Rumble, Kane was {{involved}} in a six-man elimination over-the-top-rope battle royal, with King Booker, MVP, The Miz, Chris Benoit and Finlay. This match went to a no contest as The Undertaker interrupted after Kane had been eliminated and punished by the remaining opponents. At the Royal Rumble, Kane eliminated King Booker, but Booker re-entered the ring and eliminated Kane. A couple weeks later on SmackDown!, while receiving the key to the city in his hometown of Houston, Booker was attacked by Kane starting a feud between the two. At No Way Out, Kane defeated King Booker. On February 23, Kane lost to King Booker in a Falls Count Anywhere Money in the Bank Qualifying match after interference from The Great Khali, sparking a feud between the two. Prior to WrestleMania 23, Kane <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around with a hook, similar to the hook he used as Jacob Goodnight in See No Evil. At the event, Kane was defeated by Khali. During the match, in homage to Hulk Hogan slamming André the Giant twenty years earlier at WrestleMania III, Kane picked up Khali {{for the first time and}} body-slammed him to the mat. After WrestleMania, he began to feud with William Regal and Dave Taylor. The Boogeyman then joined the feud, teaming up with Kane. On the May 4 episode of SmackDown!, Kane competed in a number one contender's match for the United States Championship held by MVP. Kane lost due to interference by Regal and Taylor. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown!, Kane competed in a fatal four-way number one contender's match for the World Heavyweight Championship which was won by Batista. Kane then entered a short feud with Mark Henry. Kane was defeated by Henry in a Lumberjack match at One Night Stand due to interference from lumberjacks Kenny Dykstra and Chavo Guerrero and then took a short hiatus.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at two in the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E
500|$|They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, {{followed}} by {{three days of}} rehearsals at Black Island Studios.

[...] At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of that hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters commented on their almost twenty years of animosity: [...] "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Allegheny Mountains have no {{volcanic}} {{peaks and}} {{have very little}} earthquake activity. These mountains were formed by an Orogeny effect of the North American Plate. The Taconic Orogeny {{near the end of}} Ordovician time formed a much higher mountainous area in eastern West Virginia approximately 350 million to 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. The West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey conducted in 2006 reported, [...] "These highlands formed the main source of sediments for the succeeding Silurian Period (443 million years ago) and part of the Devonian Period (416 million years ago)." [...] Devonian was about the time lobe-finned fish developed legs (Tiktaalik) as they <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> on land as tetrapods.

Singh checked into a busy line of 30 people for the CP flight from Vancouver to Toronto, which was scheduled to leave at 9:18am. He asked agent Jeannie Adams to check his dark brown, hard-sided Samsonite suitcase, and have it transferred to Air India Flight 181 and then to Flight 182 to India. The agent initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage since his seat from Toronto to Montreal and from Montreal to Bombay was unconfirmed. He insisted, but the agent again rebuffed him, telling him, [...] "Your ticket doesn't read that you're confirmed" [...] and [...] "we're not supposed to check your baggage through." [...] The man said, [...] "Wait, I'll get my brother for you." [...] As he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away, she relented and agreed to accept the bag, but {{told him he would}} have to check in again with Air India in Toronto.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{comparative}} study on the response of two related parasitoids to kairomone of their hosts. Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson) attacks larvae of Drosophila in fermenting fruits and Leptopilina fimbriata (Kieffer) attacks larvae of mainly Scaptomyza pallida (Zetterstedt) in decaying plants. In both species the response to water-soluble kairomone involves a reduction in walking speed {{and an increase in}} the frequency with which the substrate is probed. However, essential differences in some of the behavioural parameters between the two species were also discovered. Upon encountering a substrate with kairomone L. heterotoma <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> more with longer strolls, whereas L. fimbriata is arrested more strongly and <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> less with shorter strolls. The differences in response are possibly adaptations to differences in natural host distribution and density as found in the two microhabitats...|$|R
