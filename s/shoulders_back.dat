5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.|$|E
25|$|Décolletage is {{the upper}} part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, {{comprising}} her neck, <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back</b> and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Other {{areas of}} the skin are similarly, though {{slightly}} less, sensitive to androgens and androgenic hair typically appears somewhat later. In rough sequence of sensitivity to androgens and appearance of androgenic hair, are the armpits (axillae), perianal area, upper lip, preauricular areas (sideburns), periareolar areas (nipples), middle of the chest, neck under the chin, remainder of chest and beard area, limbs and <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> and buttocks.|$|E

25|$|Gymnastics is a sport {{practiced by}} men and women that {{requires}} balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, endurance and control. The movements involved in gymnastics {{contribute to the development of}} the arms, legs, <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> chest and abdominal muscle groups. Alertness, precision, daring, self-confidence and self-discipline are mental traits that can also be developed through gymnastics. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.|$|E
25|$|Body hair (on the chest, <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> abdomen, buttocks, thighs, tops of hands, and tops of feet) turns, over time, from {{terminal}} ("normal") hairs to tiny, blonde vellus hairs. Arm, perianal, and perineal hair {{is reduced}} {{but may not}} turn to vellus hair on the latter two regions (some cisgender women also have hair in these areas). Underarm hair changes slightly in texture and length, and pubic hair becomes more typically female in pattern. Lower leg hair becomes less dense. All of these changes depend to some degree on genetics.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} 18th century stays was {{to support the}} bust and confer the fashionable conical shape while drawing the <b>shoulders</b> <b>back.</b> At this time, the eyelets were {{reinforced}} with stitches and were not placed across from one another, but instead staggered. This allowed the stays to be spiral laced. One end of the stay lace was inserted and knotted in the bottom eyelet; the other end was wound through the stays' eyelets and tightened on the top. Tight-lacing was not the purpose of stays during this time period. Women in all societal levels, from ladies of the court to street vendors, wore stays.|$|E

25|$|On April 12, {{the detainees}} {{were taken to}} the {{headquarters}} of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros for an informal press conference. More than 250 international journalists arrived at the scene to take pictures and ask them questions. The four suspects were paraded from the building's balcony and were allowed to answer questions from reporters. Elio stated that he was an ordained executioner under Constanzo and that Kilroy was murdered by Constanzo. As the cameras zoomed in on the suspects, Elio showed his membership scars on his <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> arms, and chest. These were arrow-like cuts made with a hot blade. The marks were given to selected cult members with the authority to perform human sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Tàijíquán's martial aspect {{relies on}} {{sensitivity}} to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact, is trained as {{the primary goal of}} the martial t‘ai-chi ch‘üan student. The sensitivity needed to capture the centre is acquired over thousands of hours of first yin (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding yang (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through taolu (forms), tuishou (pushing hands), and sanshou (sparring). Tàijíquán trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long, and then everything in between. Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip, depending on style. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. Chin na, which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used. Most tàijíquán teachers expect their students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained.|$|E
500|$|A small swallow, {{the golden}} swallow measures, on average, [...] The adult of the {{nominate}} subspecies' upperparts, including {{the sides of}} the head, the cheek, and the chin, are an iridescent bronze. The ear coverts and lores are duller, and the forehead, crown, and nape are more green. This contrasts with the golden or coppery-bronze colouring of the mantle, <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> rump, and uppertail-coverts. The lesser and median-coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary wing-coverts being more green and dusky. The edges of the greater coverts and tertials are more golden. The primaries, secondaries, tail, axillaries, and underwing-coverts are dusky bronze-green, with the axillaries and underwing-coverts only having this colour on the edges. The tail is only slightly forked on the nominate subspecies, unlike the more deeply forked tail of the other subspecies, sclateri. Its underparts are white, with dusky bronze streaks on the flanks. The legs and the feet are dark brown and the bill is black. Its irides are also dark brown. The female is similar, although some of the underparts, specifically the breast and occasionally the throat and undertail-coverts, are mottled grey-brown. The mottling around the breast and collar is likely to decrease over time. The juvenile, like the female, is mottled grey-brown. The juvenile also has less glossy plumage and the sides of its head are a dusky grey.|$|E

2500|$|The stays or corset of {{the early}} 18th century were long-waisting and cut with a narrow back, wide front, and {{shoulder}} straps; the most fashionable stays pulled the <b>shoulders</b> <b>back</b> until the shoulder blades almost touched. [...] The resulting [...] silhouette, with shoulders thrown back, very erect posture and a high, full bosom, is characteristic of this period and no other.|$|E
2500|$|Women's stays of the 18th {{century were}} laced behind {{and drew the}} <b>shoulders</b> <b>back</b> to form a high, round bosom and erect posture. Coloured stays were popular. With the relaxed country styles {{of the end of}} the century, stays became shorter and were unboned or only lightly boned, and were now called corsets. As tight waists became fashionable in the 1820s, the corset was again boned and laced to form the figure. By the 1860s, a tiny ("wasp") waist came to be seen as a symbol of beauty, and the corsets were {{stiffened}} with whalebone or steel to accomplish this. Tight lacing of a corset sometimes led to a woman needing to retire to the fainting room. By the 1880s, the dress reform movement was campaigning against the pain and damage to internal organs and bones caused by tight lacing. Inez Gaches-Sarraute invented the [...] "health corset", with a straight-fronted bust made to help support the wearer's muscles.|$|E
2500|$|French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville {{published}} {{notes on}} Baartman's dissection in 1816, which were republished by Cuvier in the Memoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in 1817. [...] "Her personality," [...] Cuvier wrote {{of her in}} his monograph, [...] "was lively, her memory good and, after a gap of some weeks, she recognised someone she had seen only the once. She spoke reasonable Dutch, which she had learned in The Cape, knew some English, and was beginning {{to say a few}} words in French. She danced according to the fashion of her own country, and played on the instrument they call the 'jew's harp' quite by ear ... her <b>shoulders,</b> <b>back,</b> and upper chest were graceful ... Her arms (rather slender) were very well-made, and her hand charming. Her foot was also very pretty..." [...] Despite his impressions of her, Cuvier interpreted her remains, in accordance with his theories on racial evolution, as evidencing ape-like traits. He thought her small ears were similar to those of an orangutan and also compared her vivacity, when alive, to the quickness of a monkey.|$|E

2500|$|Bottleneck rifle {{cartridges}} {{are particularly}} prone to encounter incipient head separations {{if they are}} full-length re-sized and re-trimmed to their maximum permitted case lengths each time they are reloaded. [...] In some such cartridges, such as the [...]303 British when used in Enfield rifles, as few as 1 or 2 re-loadings can be the limit, before {{the head of the}} cartridge will physically separate from the body of the cartridge when fired. [...] The solution to this problem, of avoiding overstretching of the brass case, and thereby avoiding the excessive thinning of the wall thickness of the brass case due to case stretching, is to use what is called a [...] "head space gauge". [...] Contrary to its name, it does not actually measure a rifle's headspace. [...] Rather, it measures the distance from the head of the cartridge {{to the middle of the}} shoulder of the bottleneck cartridge case. [...] For semi-automatic and automatic rifles, customary practice is to move the midpoint of this shoulder back by no more than 0.005 inches, for reliable operation, when resizing the case. [...] For bolt-action rifles, with their additional camming action, customary practice is to move this shoulder back by only 0.001 to 0.002 inches when resizing the case. [...] In contrast to full-length resizing of bottleneck rifle cartridges, which can rapidly thin out the wall thickness of bottleneck rifle cartridges due to case stretching that occurs each time when fired, partial length re-sizing of the bottleneck case that pushes <b>shoulders</b> <b>back</b> only a few thousandths of an inch will often permit a case to be safely reloaded 5 times or more, even up to 10 times, or more for very light loads.|$|E
