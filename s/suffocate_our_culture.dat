On the whole it's not a bad version.It's a bit like Bruce Springsteen's 'Born to Run'. And yet another song about drinking." [...] Chris Difford said, [...] "'I've Returned' could have been on East Side Story. It's a lyric that reflects our early writing, so I suppose we were beginning to repeat ourselves. We were cocooned {{in a web of}} touring and it was <b>suffocating</b> <b>our</b> skills. We didn't have any time to observe.|$|R

40|$|As a culture, {{we often}} use music to accent events that would {{otherwise}} not need them. Many of these events utilize what is considered ‘classical’ music, and within the Classical Music world a select few works get copious amounts of play time, and thus get heavily imprinted in our minds’ ear. Certain correlations between these situations and musical phrases have become so ingrained in <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> that it is almost alien to not have them be together. Many of the works that are implanted in <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> {{come out of a}} specific location and time: the Romantic era in Russia. Of all the composers to come out of Russia during that time, six have left a mark on <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> as a whole. These six men are: Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, Modest Mussorgsky, Cӕsar Cui, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Pytor Ilich Tchaikovsky. The music of these men is very well implanted in <b>our</b> <b>culture.</b> They have roots in far-reaching corners of <b>our</b> <b>culture,</b> ranging from your favorite Saturday Morning Cartoons, to radio show intros, to the fundamental idea behind multimillion dollar motion pictures. This cross-examination of the connections between the works of the composers and the cultural aspects in which they take place shows some phenomenal connections...|$|R
