40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the {{smartphone}} market and its increasing revenue has motivated developers to target multiple platforms. Market leaders, such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, develop their <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> complying with their platform specifications. The specification of each platform makes a platform-dedicated application incompatible with other platforms due to the diversity of operating systems, programming languages, and design patterns. Conventional development methodologies are applied to <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications,</b> yet they perform less well. <b>Smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> have unique hardware and software requirements. All previous factors push smartphone developers to build less sophisticated and low-quality products when targeting multiple smartphone platforms. Model-driven development have been considered to generate <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> from abstract models to alleviate smartphones platform fragmentation. Reusing these abstract models for other platforms was not considered {{because they do not}} fit new platforms requirements. It is possible that defining <b>smartphone</b> <b>applications</b> using a portability-driven modeling notation would facilitate smartphone developers to understand better their applications to be ported to other platforms. We call for a portability-driven modeling notation to be used within a smartphone development process. Our in-process research work will be manifested through the application of a domain-specific language complying with the three software portability principles and three design factors.
