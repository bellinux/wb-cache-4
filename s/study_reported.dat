40|$|Background The {{quality of}} harms {{reporting}} in journal publications is often poor, which can impede the risk-benefit {{interpretation of a}} clinical trial. Clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> can provide more reliable, complete, and informative data on harms compared to the corresponding journal publication. This case study compares {{the quality and quantity}} of harms data reported in journal publications and clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> of orlistat trials. Methods Publications related to clinical trials of orlistat were identified through comprehensive literature searches. A request was made to Roche (Genentech; South San Francisco, CA, USA) for clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> related to the orlistat trials identified in our search. We compared adverse events, serious adverse events, and the reporting of 15 harms criteria in both document types and compared meta-analytic results using data from the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> against the journal publications. Results Five journal publications with matching clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> were available for five independent clinical trials. Journal publications did not always report the complete list of identified adverse events and serious adverse events. We found some differences in the magnitude of the pooled risk difference between both document types with a statistically significant risk difference for three adverse events and two serious adverse events using data reported in the clinical study reports; these events were of mild intensity and unrelated to the orlistat. The CONSORT harms reporting criteria were often satisfied in the methods section of the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> (70 – 90 % of the methods section criteria satisfied in the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> compared to 10 – 50 % in the journal publications), but both document types satisfied 80 – 100 % of the results section criteria, albeit with greater detail being provided in the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports.</b> Conclusions In this case study, journal publications provided insufficient information on harms outcomes of clinical trials and did not specify that a subset of harms data were being presented. Clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> often present data on harms, including serious adverse events, which are not reported or mentioned in the journal publications. Therefore, clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> could support a more complete, accurate, and reliable investigation, and researchers undertaking evidence synthesis of harm outcomes should not rely only on incomplete published data that are presented in the journal publications...|$|R

5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 <b>study</b> <b>reported</b> that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch <b>study</b> <b>reported</b> a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E

Death rates have dropped since the mid-twentieth century; in Sweden poisoning is common, though life-threatening poisonings have not been detected and there was no fatality reported over the 50 years from 1952 to 2002. Gyromitra poisonings are rare in Spain, due to the widespread practice of drying the mushrooms before preparation and consumption, but has a mortality rate of about 25%.|$|E

A 2005 <b>study</b> <b>reported</b> that previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting {{doubt on the}} existence of similar dimorphism between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed <b>study</b> <b>reported</b> that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
