2500|$|While the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> saw {{its most}} {{dramatic}} growth after World War II under Toda's leadership, Ikeda led the international {{growth of the}} <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> {{and turned it into}} what is considered the largest, most diverse international lay Buddhist association in the world. He reformed many of the organization's practices, including the aggressive conversion style (known as shakubuku) for which the group had become known in Japan, and improved the organization's public image, though it was sometimes still viewed with suspicion in Japan. By the 1970s, Ikeda's leadership had expanded the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> into an <b>international</b> lay Buddhist movement increasingly active in peace, cultural, and educational activities." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{educational}} {{activities of the}} <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> are often subsumed under the title of [...] "Soka education". Several educational institutions were either founded by the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> or were inspired by the educational writings of the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai's</b> three presidents.|$|R

25|$|Formally, the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International</b> is the {{umbrella}} organization for all national organizations, while Soka Gakkai by itself {{refers to the}} Japanese arm.

50|$|On April 24, 1979, <b>Sōka</b> <b>Gakkai's</b> President Daisaku Ikeda {{stepped down}} to take {{responsibility}} for the incident. At the 40th General Meeting of the <b>Sōka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> on May 3, 1979, the contemporary high priest, 66th High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi, declared his decision to accept the organization's apology and forgive the matter on condition that <b>Sōka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> observe its promise to uphold Nichiren Shōshū doctrine. Separately, he instructed priests to stop open criticism of <b>Sōka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> and to cease encouraging <b>Sōka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> members to affiliate themselves directly with the temples.|$|R
5000|$|In 1953, {{he became}} an {{adherent}} of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> (the then Nichiren Shōshū). He attended Tokyo Metropolitan Bunkyo High School (now Tokyo Metropolitan Bunkyo Secondary Education School). He graduated from the University of Tokyo with the Bachelor of Economics degree. According to <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai,</b> he was a left-wing protester and a student activist like participating in the demonstration into the National Diet Building in the 1960s. He was {{the manager of the}} Student Division and the Youth Division of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai,</b> and the one of some Vice-Presidents of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai.</b> In 2001, He was appointed the one of some Vice-Chairmen of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai's</b> initial global {{expansion}} {{began after}} the World War II, when some <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> members married mostly American servicemen {{and moved away}} from Japan. Expansion efforts gained a further boost in 1960 when Daisaku Ikeda succeeded Jōsei Toda {{as president of the}} <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai.</b> In the first year of his presidency, Ikeda visited the United States, Canada, and Brazil, and the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai's</b> first American headquarters officially opened in Los Angeles in 1963.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. {{branch of}} <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International,</b> a Japan-based new {{religious}} movement (Japanese new religion) influenced by Nichiren Buddhism, announced in 1995 that they would start holding wedding ceremonies for same-sex couples, and in 2001 established a conference for LGBT members and their supporters. A Buddhist temple in Salt Lake City connected with Jodo Shinshu, another Japanese school of Buddhism, also holds religious rites for same-sex couples.|$|E
25|$|Cepeda began {{practicing}} Nichiren Buddhism as {{a member}} of the Buddhist association <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International</b> in 1983. One year later, he moved to Los Angeles, renting an apartment in Burbank. During this timeframe, his relationship with Fernandez deteriorated. She eventually left the house and returned to Puerto Rico with Malcom and Ali and filed a divorce suit. A friend introduced Cepeda to Mirian Ortiz, whom he eventually married.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s {{there was a}} series of {{conflicts}} between the Soka Gakkai administration and Nichiren Shoshu. The series of speeches Ikeda gave in 1977, redefining the relationship between laity and clergy, alarmed elements of the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood and was a factor in Ikeda's resignation on April 24, 1979. Ikeda retained only an honorary title but maintained the presidency of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International.</b> It seems likely the conflict with the Nichiren priesthood was behind Ikeda's departure, and {{it has been suggested that}} the Nichiren priesthood demanded Ikeda's resignation as a way to reassert its own authority and relevance.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, a {{prominent}} university professor named Fujiwara Hirotatsu authored the book I Denounce <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> (<b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> o kiru) {{in which he}} severely criticized the Gakkai. The Gakkai and Kōmeitō attempted to use their political power to suppress its publication. When Fujiwara went public with the attempted suppression, the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> was harshly criticized in the Japanese media.|$|R

There were reports of isolated incidents of violence conducted by <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> members but also incidents directed toward them. Fisker-Nielsen doubts whether claimed tactics such as coercion and intimidation could satisfactorily explain the ongoing success of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai's</b> campaigns.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1960, {{two years}} after Toda's death, Ikeda, then 32 years old, succeeded him as {{president}} of the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai.</b> Soon after, Ikeda began to travel overseas to build connections between <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> members living abroad and expand the movement globally. The expansion of the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> movement internationally was, in Ikeda's words, [...] "Toda's will for the future." [...] With his assumption of the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> presidency, Ikeda [...] "continued the task begun by [...] Tsunesaburo Makiguchi of fusing the ideas and principles of educational pragmatism with the elements of Buddhist doctrine." ...|$|R
25|$|There are monasteries and Dharma centres {{from all}} three major traditions of Buddhism in Singapore: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Most Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese and are of the Mahayana tradition, with missionaries having come into the country from Taiwan and China for several decades. However, Thailand's Theravada Buddhism has seen growing {{popularity}} among the populace (not only the Chinese) during the past decade. The religion of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International,</b> a Japanese Buddhist organisation, is practised by many people in Singapore, but mostly by those of Chinese descent. Tibetan Buddhism has also made slow inroads into the country in recent years.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Ikeda {{resigned}} {{as president of}} the Soka Gakkai (in Japan), accepting responsibility for the organization's purported deviation from Nichiren Shōshū doctrines and accompanying conflict with its priesthood. Nichiren Shōshū was the Buddhist denomination with which the Soka Gakkai had been associated since its founding, but {{the relationship between the two}} organizations was often strained. Hiroshi Hojo succeeded Ikeda as Soka Gakkai president, and Ikeda remained president of the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International.</b> Ikeda was also made honorary president of the Soka Gakkai in Japan. From 1964 to 1990, Ikeda held the title of Sokoto (lay leader) among Nichiren Shōshū adherents.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2001, the Buddhist {{association}} <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International</b> USA donated the cost of 100 Cherry blossom trees {{to the city of}} Torrance as part of Torrance's Living Tree Dedication program that began in 1993. The plan for the program was to plant 10 cherry trees at Columbia Park as part of a ceremony each year for ten years beginning in 2001. This donation in particular was part of Sōka Gakkai's campaign to plant trees in cities across the nation as a way to [...] "create a peaceful environment" [...] in society and better the communities they live in. In August 2001, ten of those cherry trees were planted at Columbia Park. By April 2007, seventy cherry trees had been planted in Columbia Park. In November of that year, <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International</b> USA increased its donation from ten to thirty cherry trees per year.|$|E

50|$|Shokun was {{critical}} of New Komeito and <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> just like its sister publications Bungeishunju and Shukan Bunshun. In addition to the lead column Shinshi to Shukujo, which frequently brought to attention the words and deeds of <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> President Daisaku Ikeda, {{the part of the}} magazine which took the harshest stance towards the organization was a series of editorials entitled Gekkan <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> Mondai ("This Month’s <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> Problem") which were written by Kunio Naito, {{a former member of the}} Mainichi Shimbun editorial team, over a period of more than 10 years until his death in 1999.|$|R
2500|$|Soka Gakkai has, {{together}} with its international offshoot <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International</b> (SGI), {{been described as}} [...] "the world's largest Buddhist lay group and America's most diverse". <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International</b> claims a total of over 12 million adherents.

2500|$|Starting in {{the mid-1970s}} the Soka Gakkai began to reconceptualize itself as an {{organization}} promoting the theme of [...] "peace, culture, and education." [...] The three themes were concretized in the 1995 charter of the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> <b>International.</b>|$|E

25|$|In April 1957, a {{group of}} young <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> members in Osaka were arrested for {{allegedly}} distributing money, cigarettes and candies to support the political campaign of a local electoral candidate (who was also a <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> member). Ikeda was later arrested and detained in jail for two weeks, charged with allegedly overseeing these activities. Ikeda's arrest came at a time when <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> Buddhist candidates were achieving success at both national and local levels. With the growing influence of this liberal grassroots movement, factions of the conservative political establishment initiated a series of media attacks on the <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai,</b> culminating in Ikeda's arrest. After a lengthy court case that lasted until 1962, Ikeda was cleared of all charges. The <b>Soka</b> <b>Gakkai</b> characterized this as a triumph over corrupt tyranny, which galvanized its movement.|$|R
