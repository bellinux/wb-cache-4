2500|$|Working on the {{assumption}} that the discoveries at the Acheron could challenge the traditional assumptions about the Odysseys geography, Tim Severin sailed a replica Greek sailing vessel (originally built for his attempt to retrace the steps of Jason and the Argonauts) along the [...] "natural" [...] route from Troy to Ithaca, following the sailing directions that could be teased out of the Odyssey. Along the way he found locations at the natural turning and dislocation points which, he claimed, agreed with the text much more closely than the usual identifications. However, he also came to the conclusion that the sequence of adventures from Circe onwards derived from a separate itinerary to the sequence that ended with the Laestrygonians and was possibly derived from the stories of the Argonauts. He placed many of the later episodes on the north west Greek coast, near the Acheron. Along the way he found on the map Cape <b>Skilla</b> (at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf) and other names that implied traditional links with the Odyssey. Severin agrees with the common opinion that the Lotus Eaters are in North Africa (although he placed them in modern Libya rather than Tunisia) and that Scherie is Corcyra.|$|E

Effect of Reasoning Abilityon the Writing Skill Viewed {{from the}} Parents’Socio Economic Status (A Study of Expost Facto at State Junior Secondary Schools 1 and 2 of Slogohimo). Thesis. The Study Program Indonesian Language Education, Postgraduate Program, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta. The {{aims of the}} {{research}} are to know about: (1) whether the writing skillof students who have high reasoning abilityis better than that of students who have low reasoning ability; (2) whether the writing skillof students whose parents have a high socio economy status is better than that of students whose parents have a low socio economy status; and (3) {{whether or not there}} is an interaction between reasoning ability and the parents’ economic status in influencing their writing skill. This research applied an ex post facto method with a factorial design of 2 x 2. The population of the research was all of SMPNegeri 1 dan 2 SlogohimoWonogiri students. Samples of the research included 80 students, at Grade VIIIand were taken through a simplerandom sampling. Data of the research were gathered by using test and questionaire. The test was used to gather the data of writing skill and reasoning ability. Meanwhile, the questionnaire was used to gather the data of the parents’socio economy status. The data were analyzed by using a Two-Way analysis of variants (ANAVA). The results of the analysis show that: (1) the writing skillof students who have high reasoning ability is significantly better than that of students who have low reasoning ability as indicated by Fh= 63. 16 > Ft= 3. 97 at the significance level of α = 0. 05 with a quantifying dk of 1 and a denominating dk of 76; (b) the writing skillof students whose parents have a high socio economy status is significantly better than that of students whose parents have a low socio economyas shown by Fh= 95. 85 > Ft = 3. 97 at the significance level of α = 0. 05 a quantifying dk of 1 and a denominating dk of 76; and (3) there is a very significant interaction between reasoning ability and and the parents’ economic status in influencing their writing <b>skillas</b> suggested by Fh = 20. 72 > Ft= 3. 97 at the significance level of α = 0. 05 with a quantifying dk of 1 and a denominating dk of 76...|$|R

40|$|Epidemics of {{seasonal}} influenza inflict a huge burden in temperate climes such as Melbourne (Australia) {{where there is}} also significant variability in their timing and magnitude. Particle filters combined with mechanistic transmission models for the spread of influenza have emerged as a popular method for forecasting the progression of these epidemics. Despite extensive research it is still unclear what the optimal models are for forecasting influenza, and how one even measures forecast performance. In this paper, we present a likelihood-based method, akin to Bayes factors, for model selection when {{the aim is to}} select for predictive skill. Here, âpredictive <b>skillâ</b> is measured by the probability of the data after the forecasting date, conditional on the data from before the forecasting date. Using this method we choose an optimal model of influenza transmission to forecast the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza in Melbourne in each of the 2010 â 15 epidemics. The basic transmission model considered has the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered structure with extensions allowing for the effects of absolute humidity and inhomogeneous mixing in the population. While neither of the extensions provides a significant improvement in fit to the data they do differ in terms of their predictive skill. Both measurements of absolute humidity and a sinusoidal approximation of those measurements are observed to increase the predictive skill of the forecasts, while allowing for inhomogeneous mixing reduces the skill. We discuss how our work could be integrated into a forecasting system and how the model selection method could be used to evaluate forecasts when comparing to multiple surveillance systems providing disparate views of influenza activity...|$|E
