5|$|Cuba and Puerto Rico, {{neither of}} which were {{expected}} to experience the worst of Dean's strength, prepared more modestly. Cuba's Civil Defense evacuated 350,000people from the coastal provinces. The government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm. Soldiers and emergency officials were prepared to convert <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> government buildings into temporary shelters, but stood down when it became evident {{that they would not}} needed. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed a five-member team to Puerto Rico ahead of Hurricane Dean. They were equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video-teleconferencing and help make real-time assessments of any damage.|$|E

At 0300 UTC August 19 {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for portions of central Cuba: Ciego de Ávila, Sancti Spíritus, Cienfuegos, Matanzas, and Isla de la Juventud. Had it been necessary, soldiers and emergency officials were prepared to convert <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> government buildings into temporary shelters. More than 350,000people were evacuated by the Civil Defense in the coastal provinces, and the government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm.|$|E
5|$|On August 18 {{authorities}} began evacuating {{people from}} parts of Quintana Roo, moving 2,500people from Holbox Island and a further 80,000 tourists from {{elsewhere in the}} state. Air-evacuations of tourists were stopped when Dean's outer rainbands closed almost a dozen Cancún and Cozumel airports {{on the evening of}} August 20. The Campeche airport closed shortly thereafter. The state government set up 530storm shelters in <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> public buildings, prepared to hold 73,000people.

5|$|The Anglican Church St Andrews {{has held}} {{services}} since the 1840s. For some time the town {{also had a}} Wesleyan Chapel. A private school opened in 1843 and a government one in the 1870s. By the late 1930s both schools had closed. Carrick hosts Agfest, the state's largest single event and one of Australia's largest agricultural field days. The 1848 Anglican church, 1833 hotel {{and a few other}} establishments serve the townspeople. A brewery, steam and water mill, butcher, <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> hotels are all long since closed. Carrick has a long association with horse racing, starting prior to the race course's formation in 1848. For a time the town held the oldest horse race in Australia. Today regular harness racing, speedway racing and cycling events have replaced this.|$|E
5|$|The {{borough of}} Crawley, in West Sussex, England, has 43 churches, chapels and other {{buildings}} used specifically for worship. Other religious communities meet in community centres, <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> buildings whose primary function is secular. Three other former {{places of worship}} are no longer used by their original congregation, although {{only one of these}} has fallen out of use entirely. The borough covers the NewTown of Crawley, whose development began in the late 1940s, and Gatwick Airport—an international airport which has two multi-faith chapels of its own. The New Town absorbed three villages with a long history of Christian worship, and later extensions to the boundary have brought other churches into the borough.|$|E
5|$|With Hurricane Dean's path {{predicted}} well {{in advance}} of the storm, the Government of Mexico was able to make ample preparations. On August 17, a state of emergency was declared for the state of Quintana Roo where Dean was expected to make landfall. On August 18 authorities began evacuating tourists and those residents living in the most vulnerable parts of Quintana Roo. The state government set up storm shelters in <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> public buildings. With emergency supplies at the ready, the state of Yucatán, Quintana Roo's neighbour to the northwest, declared a green alert.

5|$|Ships {{and other}} water craft were advised {{to avoid the}} Cape Cod area as the storm was {{forecast}} to brush that area, which was put under a hurricane warning by the National Hurricane Center. In Massachusetts, schools were closed and emergency shelters were opened to accommodate evacuees. Evacuations were ordered for residents living in low-lying areas in Cape Cod. In Boston, {{the threat of the}} storm caused both elementary and middle schools to close at noon while high schools were closed at 1 p.m. (est). The approach of the storm also postponed a fair at a local hospital and planes at Otis Air Force Base were quickly moved to their hangars. Much of southeastern Massachusetts civil defense and fire departments were alerted in preparation of the storm's impact. In Rhode Island, <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> buildings were used as shelter to house evacuees. As Hurricane Gerda sped up the East Coast of the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended the hurricane warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Eastport, Maine. At Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, two ships of the United States Navy left their berths to ride out the storm. One of which was the Comsixthflt flagship USS Puget Sound (AD-38).|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both {{clergy and}} laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade {{the use of}} Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties. Soegijapranata attempted to resist these seizures, at times filling the locations with people to make them unmanageable or indicating that other buildings, such as cinemas, would serve Japanese needs better. When the Japanese attempted to seize Randusari Cathedral, Soegijapranata replied that they could take it only after decapitating him; the Japanese later found another location for their office. He prevented the Japanese from taking Gedangan Presbytery, where he lived, and assigned guardians for <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> facilities to prevent seizure. These efforts were not always successful, however, and several Church-run institutions were seized, as were church funds.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{base for}} the KJRM was in the Bay of Kotor on the {{southern}} Adriatic coast. It encompassed the Tivat Arsenal {{and a number of}} <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> establishments. Other bases were located at Šibenik in central Dalmatia and Selce, a small port nestled behind the island of Krk in the northern Adriatic. The Yugoslav coastline extended for , and there were over 600 Yugoslav islands in the Adriatic. The main riverine port was at Novi Sad on the Danube. Throughout its existence, the KJRM struggled with logistical difficulties associated with foreign-made ships and naval armament. The KJRM grew from slightly over 3,000 officers and men soon after its establishment to a strength of more than 9,000 immediately prior to World War II. Ship crews ranged from 240 for the flotilla leader Dubrovnik and 145 for the Beograd-class destroyers, to just five for the Uskok-class MTBs.|$|E

5|$|Tvrđa's {{military}} importance decreased {{after the}} Berlin Congress of 1878, {{with the increasing}} stability of the surrounding region. Most of the fort walls and fortifications were destroyed in the 1920s due to the obstacle they presented {{to the development of}} Osijek. While the fortifications have largely been removed, the fort's interior core remains intact and is now home to churches, museums, <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> public buildings, as well as numerous bars and restaurants. Of the fortification system, only the northern side of the walls now remain intact, as well as parts of the first and eighth bastions along with the northern gate known as the 'water gate' ('vodena vrata'). Tvrđa sustained significant damage during the Croatian War of Independence during the 1990s and was featured on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. It now features on Croatia's 'tentative list' for consideration as a nominee for a World Heritage Site.|$|E

The European Community Humanitarian Aid Office donated about €800,000 ($944,000 USD) to the country. The World Food Programme distributed meals to about 10,000families, while the World Health Organization provided water purification tablets, typhoid vaccines, and health kits to about 100,000people. During a peace agreement amid the ongoing civil war, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka sent trucks with clothing and food to the affected areas. In July 2004, the Asian Development Bank provided $12.5million of the $17.5million needed to repair the damaged infrastructure, while the Sri Lankan government provided the remaining $5million.|$|E
