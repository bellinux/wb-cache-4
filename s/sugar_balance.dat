For that, one year old plants were subjected successively to 1) a temperature decrease (0. 5 °C a day) from 25 / 20 °C to 13 / 8 °C (acclimation period), 2) a three day chilling cycle (3 x 13 / 4 °C) and to 3) a recovery period of 14 days (25 / 20 °C). In Catucaí (less cold sensitive {{when compared to}} clone 02) there was an increased activity in the respiratory enzymes malate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. Furthermore, Catucaí showed significant increases along the cold imposition and the higher absolute values after chilling exposure of the soluble sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose, raffinose, arabinose and mannitol) that are frequently involved in osmoregulation and membrane stabilization/protection.

Notably, various types of oligofructans showed specific distribution patterns.

The chelate effect of the EDTA solution was kept reliable for about a whole day, and photoassimilate flux was most enhanced in the solution bath of 20 mM EDTA and under the larger rates of replenishment with the fresh EDTA. Dynamic changes in the photoassimilate flux caused by lighting and leaf excision were evaluated clearly at a short sampling interval of 20 min.

40|$|The {{recommendations}} {{for a healthy}} diet for the general population now also apply to diabetics. For years a strict diet with a ban on sugar and the exact counting of bread units (BUs) {{was part of the}} daily life of diabetics. In order {{to make it easier for}} diabetics to comply with their diet instructions, industry developed special foods for them. A study indicates that today almost 50 % of diabetics regularly consume special diabetic products although they are no longer recommended by scientific circles. For a long time diabetics had to strictly control the sugar in their food or replace it with sugar substitutes like fructose. However, diabetes is not just a disease which changes the sugar balance; it likewise involves disruptions of protein and fat metabolism. Hence treatment that only regulates <b>sugar</b> <b>balance</b> is not adequate. People suffering from type 2 diabetes in particular are afflicted by metabolic disorders long before the disease is diagnosed. In order to prevent the disease or to treat it later, individual food patterns must be changed. This includes things like the daily consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables because these foods contain a great deal of roughage in addition to antioxidative substances. In contrast, special diabetic foods are not necessary. Against this backdrop BfR believes that special provisions for diabetic food are no longer necessary. Reduced sugar foods should not, therefore, be sold as dietetic foods. According to current scientific knowledge there are no criteria which justify this classification. For the above-mentioned disease all the claims on food like “suitable for diabetics” should be removed...|$|E
40|$|Steroid hormones have {{a pivotal}} role in many {{physiological}} processes. For example, the glucocorticoids are crucial in the regulation and maintenance of <b>sugar</b> <b>balance,</b> immunity, stress response, and mood, whereas the mineralocorticoids are involved in electrolyte- and water balance thus regulating blood pressure. Androgens are crucial for muscle function, cardiovascular system and the development and maintenance of male characteristics. Therefore, the disruption of the steroidogenesis is associated with severe diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, immune disorders, impaired brain function, and developmental dysfunctions. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we were interested in the in vitro investigation of xenobiotics affecting the human steroidogenesis. We focused on the adrenal steroidogenesis, which is rather neglected by many regulatory agencies, despite its pivotal role in humans. We provided a critical overview of the current available cell lines used to screen for potential endocrine disruptors and to study their effects on adrenal steroidogenesis. Moreover, we discussed their advantages/disadvantages, and the need for improvements of the well-established human carcinoma cell line H 295 R and the associated validated OECD test guideline 456, namely the “H 295 R steroidogenesis assay”. This resulted in a refined version of the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay, which is distinguished from the currently used OECD protocols by analyzing multiple adrenal steroids simultaneously with exclusive separation techniques combined with mass spectrometry, as well as including additional controls, such as medium composition at the starting time and reference compounds with known mechanism. The obtained results of the steroid changes can then be further combined with the observed effects on gene expression, providing first mechanistic hints on steroidogenesis disruption. By using the newly established refined version of the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay, we demonstrated that exposure of H 295 R cells to the UV-filter octyl methoxycinnamate and the plasticizer acetyl tributylcitrate resulted in increased corticosteroid levels, as well as enhanced CYP 11 B 2 expression, similar to the corticosteroid inducer torcetrapib (positive control). To summarize, the refined H 295 R steroidogenesis assay is a valuable in vitro tool to screen and study chemicals potentially disrupting the production of adrenal steroids and provides initial mechanistic evidence in combination with gene expression data. Many psychoactive drugs can lead to immense increases in cortisol by stimulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, a comprehensive analysis of drug induced changes of several steroids, such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens along with their full time courses is missing. In the second part of this thesis, we studied the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which has sparked a renewed interest in psychiatric research, lisdexamfetamine, a new drug for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and D-amphetamine on the circulating steroids in vivo. Plasma samples were obtained from two individual clinical trials, where healthy volunteers were administered a single dose of either LSD (200 µg), lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (100 mg) or immediate-release D-amphetamine sulfate (40. 3 mg) at equimolar doses. Both studies were conducted using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design and plasma steroids for the concentration–time profiles were quantified by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). We could demonstrate, that LSD produces significant acute effects on circulating steroids compared to placebo in 16 healthy volunteers. The glucocorticoids cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone and 11 -dehydrocorticosterone were significantly increased following LSD administration, indicating HPA axis stimulation. Cortisol and corticosterone reached the maximum concentration (cmax) after 2. 5 h and 1. 9 h of LSD administration, respectively. Evaluation of the relationship between the LSD concentration in plasma and the glucocorticoid response to LSD indicated no acute pharmacological tolerance. Furthermore, the androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (cmax and the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 10 h (AUC 10)) and androstenedione (AUC 10) were significantly increased by LSD, but not the other androgens, mineralocorticoids or progestogens compared to placebo. We showed, that the administration of equivalent doses of lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine exhibit an identical pharmacokinetic profile for plasma D-amphetamine. However, lisdexamfetamine administration showed a significantly longer onset time (1. 4 vs. 0. 8 h) and tmax (4. 4 vs. 3. 2 h) for plasma D-amphetamine compared to D-amphetamine administration, due to the rate-limiting hydrolysis of lisdexamfetamine. Furthermore, lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine showed a similar enhancement of glucocorticoid production (cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11 -dehydrocorticosterone, and 11 -deoxycortisol), increases in androgen precursors (dehydroepiandrosterone, its sulphated metabolite, and androstenedione) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in plasma in 24 healthy volunteers. This suggests a HPA axis stimulation. Moreover, an acute pharmacological tolerance of the drug-induced change in active glucocorticoids was demonstrated. The other circulating steroids, such as the mineralocorticoids (aldosterone and 11 -deoxycorticosteone), androgens (testosterone and androsterone) and progestins (17 α-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone (but not the male progesterone levels)), were not affected by lisdexamfetamine or D-amphetamine. In conclusion, LSD, lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine had an acute and profound effect on the circulating steroids, especially on the glucocorticoids, suggesting HPA stimulation. This emphasizes the need for further research to understand drug induced changes in steroid homeostasis during chronic administration of amphetamine based ADHD treatments, notably in the pediatric population. Obtained results, should then support an appropriate benefit-risk assessment of these drugs. ...|$|E

The current paper presents a simple and cheap high-throughput screening (HTS) assay based on AGE fluorescence and suitable for plant extract screening.

However, interference was noted when fluorescent compounds and/or complex mixtures were tested.

In a batch of medicinal and food plant extracts, hits were selected as soon as fluorescence decreased under a fixed threshold for at least one wavelength.

30|$|The {{first set}} of {{experiments}} with BQ (Series A) showed that concentrations that were 20  mg/l or higher strongly inhibited glucose consumption (Fig.  2 a), YEtOH (ethanol yield) on consumed <b>sugar,</b> BEY (<b>Balanced</b> Ethanol Yield), and QEtOH (ethanol productivity) (Table  3). In {{the second set of}} experiments (Series B) (Fig.  2 b; Table  3), lower concentrations of BQ (2 – 20  mg/l) were studied. As Fig.  2 b shows, all concentrations of BQ in the lower range (2 – 20  mg/l) had at least some inhibitory effect. In the concentration range of 2 – 15  mg/l BQ, the values for glucose consumption, YEtOH on consumed sugar, and BEY were at least 89  % of the corresponding values of the reference fermentation (Table  3). However, as indicated by Fig.  2 b and by the low volumetric ethanol productivity values (Q =  0.17 – 0.35  g l− 1  h− 1) compared to that of the reference fermentation (Q =  0.75  g l− 1  h− 1) (Table  3), the time required to achieve complete glucose consumption and high ethanol yield was much longer when 2 – 15  mg/l BQ were present in the medium. For the highest concentration of BQ in Series B, 20  mg/l, the values for BEY and QEtOH were 4 – 7  % of that of the reference fermentation, while the glucose consumption reached 11  % of that observed for the reference fermentation. The discrepancy between ethanol formation and glucose consumption can be explained by a decrease in YEtOH on consumed glucose, as cultures with 20  mg/l BQ had a YEtOH on consumed glucose that was only 54  % of that of the reference fermentation.|$|R

5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine).

30|$|The SSF {{profiles}} of various combinations implicated an interesting {{relation between the}} rate of saccharification, rate of sugar utilization {{and the rate of}} ethanol formation. A sinusoidal behavior was represented in most cases of the dynamic profile of reducing <b>sugar</b> depicting a <b>balance</b> between the rate of saccharification and utilization of sugar for growth and ethanol fermentation. In some cases, specifically, in bioreactor SSF, the accumulation of reducing sugar in the broth repressed activity of cellulase enzyme which in turn resulted in decreased rate of hydrolysis concluding the inverse relationship between the enzyme activity and the reducing sugar content. A glucose concentration of 20 g L- 1 is reported to have 75 % repressive effect on the cellulase activity [21]. Thus, the sinusoidal behaviour observed in all batch SSF experiments (Figures  3, 4 and 5) may be attributed to the combined effect of decrease of saccharification and in turn its subsequent utilization for growth and ethanol production. On the other hand, a sugar concentration below a threshold level decreased the repressive effect on cellulase activity. An interesting behaviour in our batch SSF experiments between depletion of sugars without any further rise in ethanol concentration indicated the utilization of sugars for maintenance and survival of the fermentative microbes (Figures  3, 4 and 5).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study was to describe the daily care routines of persons managing diabetes. Managing diabetes {{on a daily basis}} is a complex occupational demand that requires sophisticated understandings of medical routines, the balancing of diet and exercise, and ongoing judgment of how engagement in different occupations will impact blood <b>sugar</b> levels. <b>Balancing</b> engagement in desired and necessary daily occupations against compliance with medical recommendations for effective management of blood sugar levels is primarily the responsibility of the person with diabetes. Specific self care activities involved in self-management of diabetes include, but are not limited to, counting carbohydrates at each meal, exercising regularly, eating a low fat and high fiber diet, taking daily medications or insulin, regularly checking blood glucose levels with a finger stick, and monitoring feet for sores or infections. Although many studies have examined the medical management of diabetes, little research has examined the experience of daily diabetic care from an occupational perspective. This research contributes to occupational science by describing the use of habits and routines in managing chronic conditions. Preliminary data was collected by means of participant photography and interviews. Participants included 10 persons with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Analysis combined photo-elicitation with a grounded theory approach. Methods were modeled on a study of quality of life in African American survivors of breast cancer that combined photographic data collection with grounded theory. For this study, photos were taken by participants in response to a suggested focus for their content. Participants were instructed to photograph daily self-care related to diabetes management. Photograph could be representative. Interviews were elicited through discussion of the photos. Analysis was ongoing with comparison across all data as new data was collected. As is common practice in grounded theory analysis, a theoretical description was developed through the following steps: derivation of an initial coding scheme, open data coding, memo writing, developing a second coding scheme, coding for axial themes, and development of the description from further memos. Results suggest that understanding occupations as an individual’s unique experience of constructing personally-tailored daily routines to manage diabetes is critical to a full understanding of effective diabetes management. Current results and planned research will be discussed. Author Objectives: Describe the activities and occupations of daily self-management of diabetics.

Herein, we set to gain insight into these effects, {{particularly with regard to}} carbohydrate metabolism, and to contribute to unravel the underlying mechanisms and consequences for health conditions. We measured the activity level of GIT carbohydrate-active enzymes toward 23 distinct sugars in adults patients (n = 2) receiving 14 -d ß-lactam therapy and in obese (n = 7) and lean (n = 5) adolescents. We observed that both 14 d antibiotic-treated and obese subjects showed higher and less <b>balanced</b> <b>sugar</b> anabolic capacities, with 40 % carbohydrates being preferentially processed as compared with non-treated and lean patients. Metaproteome-wide metabolic reconstructions confirmed that the impaired utilization of sugars propagated throughout the pentose phosphate metabolism, which had adverse consequences for the metabolic status of the GIT microbiota. The results point to an age-independent positive association between GIT glycosidase activity and the body mass index, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance (r (2) = 0. 95).

Methods for assessing water deficit stress were compared. Methods and results: Vine water status was assessed on three soil types during four vintages by means of stem water potential and carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugar. Regional water deficit was compared {{for a range of}} over 30 vintages by means of water balance modelling. It was shown that water deficit stress anticipated shoot growth slackening, limited berry weight and enhanced berry anthocyanin content. Berry sugar content was greatest when water deficit was mild. It was shown that stem water potential measurements and carbon isotope discrimination are accurate tools for assessing vine water status at plot scale. Seasonal water deficit at a regional scale can be correctly estimated by water balance models. Vintage quality in Bordeaux is determined by the intensity of water deficit stress rather than by the level of the temperatures. Conclusions: Vine phenology and grape ripening are highly dependent on water uptake conditions. Mild water deficit stress enhances grape quality for the production of red wines. Vine water status can accurately be assessed by means of stem water potential or carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugars. Quality losses through severe water stress can be avoided through the use of drought-adapted plant material, appropriate canopy management, yield reduction or the implementation of deficit irrigation. Significance and impact of the study: This study shows the key role of water deficits in the production of quality grapes for red wine production. Methods for assessing vine water status are compared and discussed.

The volunteers were fasted and attended four visits: two control visits (bread, water, <b>balancing</b> <b>sugars)</b> and two test visits (single and double dose of PFRF) where they consumed bread, water and PFRF. Blood samples were collected at 0 (fasted), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after consumption. The PFRF components were tested for α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory potential in vitro. Plasma glucose was lower after consumption of both doses compared with controls: lower dose, change in mean incremental areas under the glucose curves (IAUC) =− 27 · 4 (SD 7 · 5) %, P< 0 · 001; higher dose, IAUC =− 49 · 0 (SD 15 · 3) %, P< 0 · 001; insulin IAUC was also attenuated by − 46 · 9 (SD 13 · 4) %, P< 0 · 01. Consistent with this, the polyphenol components of the PFRF inhibited α-amylase (green tea, strawberry, blackberry and blackcurrant) and α-glucosidase (green tea) activities in vitro. The PFRF have a pronounced and significant lowering effect on postprandial blood glucose and insulin response in humans, due in part to inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, as well as glucose transport...|$|R
40|$|Background: Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is an {{economically}} important fruit crop. Quality-determining grape components such as sugars, acids, flavors, anthocyanins, tannins, etc., accumulate {{in the different}} grape berry development stages. Thus, correlating the proteomic profiles with the biochemical and physiological changes occurring in grape {{is of paramount importance}} to advance in our understanding of berry development and ripening processes. Results: We report the developmental analysis of Vitis vinifera cv. Muscat Hamburg berries at the protein level from fruit set to full ripening. An iTRAQ-based bottom-up proteomic approach followed by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification and quantitation of 411 and 630 proteins in the green and ripening phases, respectively. Two key points in development relating to changes in protein level were detected: end of the first growth period (7 mm-to- 15 mm) and onset of ripening (15 mm-to-V 100, V 100 -to- 110). A functional analysis was performed using the Blast 2 GO software based on the enrichment of GO terms during berry growth. Conclusions: The study of the proteome contributes to decipher the biological processes and metabolic pathways involved in the development and quality traits of fruit and its derived products. These findings lie mainly in metabolism and storage of sugars and malate, energy-related pathways such as respiration, photosynthesis and fermentation, and the synthesis of polyphenolics as major secondary metabolites in grape berry. In addition, some key steps in carbohydrate and malate metabolism have been identified in this study, i. e., PFP-PFK or SuSy-INV switches among others, which may influence the final <b>sugar</b> and acid <b>balance</b> in ripe fruit. In conclusion, some proteins not reported to date have been detected to be deregulated in specific tissues and developmental stages, leading to formulate new hypotheses on the metabolic processes underlying grape berry development. These results open up new lines to decipher the processes controlling grape berry development and ripening...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an optimum <b>sugar</b> / acid <b>balance</b> in a changing context, winegrowers of the Coteaux du Layon PDO, a sweet wine of the middle Loire valley, wish to know if a final alcohol content (TAV) lower than the minimum imposed by the regulation of the PDO (11 % vol. today) would affect the typicality of the wines. To answer this question, a study {{was carried out in}} 4 steps. 1) To know the expected typicality of these wines, focus groups were conducted with 26 professionals. 2) In order to assess the acceptability of lower TAV wines, based on a sample of 24 wines (commercial wines and experimental wines with TAV between 8 % vol. and 10 % vol.), 31 professionals scored levels of exemplarity. 3) A trained panel made a fine sensory description. 4) Finally, a selection of 8 wines from these 24 were evaluated by 163 consumers, they scored levels of preference. The results of steps 1) and 2) show a strong consensus among professionals to assess the exemplarity of wines. Experimental wines obtained exemplary scores above the average of the scale and can therefore be considered as good examples. In step 3), the trained panel generated the sensory attributes to describe the wines: 21 descriptors of odors and aromas and 6 of flavors, which reveal the sensory complexity of the wines. In stage 4), in general, the 8 wines evaluated by the consumers were all appreciated. The results suggest that a sufficiently high amount of residual sugar content would enhance the acceptability of lower TAV wines by both professionals and consumers. The winegrowers of the syndicate of Coteaux du Layon PDO thus have factual elements to update the specification of the PDO (decreasing the minimum TAV threshold), in interaction with INAO (the French national institute of origin and quality) ...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{is one of}} most afflicting {{diseases}} in society which {{is caused by the}} inability of the body to appropriately use insulin to <b>balance</b> <b>sugar</b> levels. Type 1 diabetics require monitoring of their glucose levels to ensure a normal glucose level is maintained between 90 and 130 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Unfortunately, current methods of monitoring are based on invasive and painful sampling of the blood. It was imperative that noninvasive and painless methods of monitoring glucose should be explored. A proven noninvasive technique utilizing infrared light to detect the fluctuations in the heart rate was used to determine if levels of glucose could be accurately determined within regions of safety. The optical absorption properties of blood were used to obtain photoplethysmographic (PPG) data and processed to gather information about the subject 2 ̆ 7 s heart rate variations (HRV). The system developed for this study consisted of simultaneously recorded ECG, PPG, and temperature. The data were analyzed on the PDA or {{through the use of a}} desktop computer with a custom HRV analysis program written in LabView. Glucose levels were simultaneously measured using a portable glucose monitor. This research study consisted of three primary goals: confirm the reliability of the developed HRV system, determine if HRV data collected from ten subjects without diabetes would correlate to their glucose levels, and finally to determine if HRV data collected from six subjects diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes could be correlated to their glucose levels. The ultimate focus was to develop a complete portable system that could reliably detect changing glucose levels in a non invasive manner. A noninvasive and portable glucose monitor would greatly enhance the lives of diabetics. ^ The normal blood sugar range of the ten non-diabetic subjects was 70 mg/dL - 150 mg/dL. These were the expected values for normal individuals with no history of diabetes or other glycemic ailments. After evaluating the population means and standard deviations, it was concluded that there were very little variations (coefficients of variation less than 7...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Major: Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics. Advisor: Michael B. O'Connor. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 178 pages, appendices I-IV. Developmental timing, growth and homeostasis form the cornerstones that shape the genesis and subsequent {{maintenance of a}} healthy adult for all multicellular organisms. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate these processes has important implications both {{from the perspective of}} our understanding of basic biology and also for our understanding of complex biological disorders involving these processes. My work explores the mechanisms regulating developmental timing, homeostasis and growth using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. In this thesis I report involvement of three novel players in the regulation of timing, homeostasis and growth in the Drosophila larvae. Firstly, my work unearths the mechanism by which the developmental gap gene, giant, regulates developmental timing in Drosophila larvae. While the effect of Giant (Gt) on larval developmental timing was long known, the mechanism by which Gt exerted this effect was not known. I find that Gt affects developmental timing by influencing the developmental fate of the prothoracicotropic hormone producing PG neurons that are essential for determining the timing of larval developmental transitions. Additionally, I show that Gt is required for PG neuron axon targeting. Secondly, I show that TGF-beta/Activin signaling mediated by the Activin-like ligand Dawdle (Daw) regulates <b>sugar</b> homeostasis, pH <b>balance</b> and mitochondrial metabolism in Drosophila larvae. Canonical signaling by Daw regulates sugar homeostasis primarily by affecting release of insulin in the larvae. The effect of Daw on pH is mediated independently by Daw's action on mitochondrial metabolism and production of metabolic acids. Interestingly, Daw affects both phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and over-expression/gain-of-function experiments, thereby providing evidence for a hormonal role of Daw in regulating systemic homeostasis. Lastly, I show that eukaryotic uracil salvaging enzyme uracil phospho-ribosyltransferase (UPRT), that was considered inactive in higher eukaryotes including Drosophila, is active in the Drosophila larvae. The Drosophila UPRT homologue, Krishah, can actively incorporate a uracil derivative (4 TU) into RNA indicating that the enzyme is active in vivo. Interestingly, I find that Krishah is also essential for larval growth as knocking out the gene leads to impaired larval growth and increased larval and pupal lethality...|$|R
40|$|A survey {{has been}} carried out in two {{experimental}} organic orchards located at the INRA experimental station of Gotheron near Valence (Southeastern France). The program also associated the GRAB (Groupe de Recherche en Agriculture Biologique, Avignon). The aims were:(i) to acquire references about peach and apple organic farming; (ii) to improve the management of organic orchards by integrating some results of previous research; and (iii) to measure on the long term the effect of organic farming on the soil and on the arthropod community of the orchard. Soils were shallow and washed out stone soils presenting low pH, low organic matter content and low CEC (Cationic Exchange Capacity). Both orchards had been organically managed since planting, realised in 1994 for the apple orchard (Smoothee 2832 T(r) cultivar), and in 1999 for the peach orchard (Bénédicte(r) cultivar). Several parameters measuring the growth of the trees, the yield and the fruit quality were monitored. The low ability of the soil to store and supply nutrients to fulfill the tree requirements implied: (i) to use appropriate types of fertilizers, such as compost in autumn, with additional organic fertilizers which quickly mineralized in spring; (ii) to decrease the dose of fertilizers increasing therefore the number of doses; and (iii) to make additional sprays with oligoelements (Mn, B) in apple orchard. This strategy allowed to increase the pH, to improve the organic matter soil content and to preserve or to increase the availability of the soil nutrients. PEACH ORCHARD The yield was balanced at about 20 tons per ha with a high fruit quality (high <b>sugar</b> content, well <b>balanced</b> sugar/acidity ratio), that was favoured by a water supply restriction during the fruit first growth stages. Most probably because of a well-balanced nutrition and because of a non-disruptive pest management, aphids did not cause any damages: the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) was very seldom monitored and Brachycaudus persicae did not affect seriously the trees. Most of all other pests were under control, using mating disruption against the oriental moth (Cydia molesta), sulphur against powdery mildew and mineral oils in winter against wintering arthropods. The main worrying pest was leaf curl due to Taphrina deformans. With a susceptible period lasting 6 to 7 weeks in winter, and a control of this desease relying on the use of copper, the total amount of this compound sprayed in one year can be high, unless the cultivar is not highly susceptible. APPLE ORCHARD The yield has increased regularly since planting until 2000. In 2001, the decrease in yield was most probably related to aphid infestation in 2000, which is lileky to have induced biennal bearing. The most prevailing pest was the apple rosy aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea) which proved {{to be very difficult to}} control and could damage seriously trees and fruits. Granulosis virus was sprayed against codling moth (Cydia pomonella), which allowed to control the level of wintering populations even if damages at harvest were sometimes high (from 4...|$|R
