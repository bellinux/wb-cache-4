5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult,</b> as {{in the rest of}} the country. Each group {{tolerate}} the other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.|$|E
5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E

25|$|Among petrologists, {{chalcedony}} {{is sometimes}} considered separately from chert {{due to its}} fibrous structure. Since many cherts contain both microcrystalline and microfibrous quartz, it is <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> to classify a rock as completely chalcedony, thus its general inclusion as a variety of chert.|$|E

25|$|The {{other group}} is formed by five smaller species {{that have more}} rounded flowers with petals and sepals that are wide open and flatter.

Four of them are very similar and <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{public schools}} were {{funded by a}} {{combination}} of population-based state reimbursement, taxes, and tuition paid by parents. In 1867, tuition was abolished, making public education free to all. At that time, attending school was voluntary, but by 1874, it became mandatory for students aged 8 to 14. Enforcement was <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> though, especially considering the agricultural economy that the area depended upon at the time.|$|E

The 1945–46 full season was instituted as a precursor to the resumption of the previous divisional split in force prior to World War II. As the war had only just finished travel was <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> to arrange, many of the players were still away and the teams often included guests.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{when exercising}} {{judicial}} review of administrative action, the Court's task is only {{to ensure that the}} decision in question was made according to the law. Even though it may disagree with the decision, it will not substitute its own decision for that of the decision-maker. In practice, however, it is <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> to tell whether the Court is applying that principle. The branch of law dealing with this facet of the Court's jurisdiction is administrative law.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of individuals are cognitively impaired, which is <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish from other symptoms {{because of the}} behavioral disturbances and motor deficits associated with the syndrome. In many ways, the behaviors {{may be seen as}} a psychological extension of the compulsion to cause self-injury, and include rejecting desired treats or travel, repaying kindness with coldness or rage, failing to answer test questions correctly despite study and a desire to succeed, provoking anger from caregivers when affection is desired.|$|E

25|$|Piecing {{together}} landscapes {{requires a}} <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> union between natural and social sciences, {{close attention to}} geographic and temporal scales, {{a knowledge of the}} range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings {{in a way that is}} useful to researchers in many fields. Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from geography, biology, ecology, history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, ethnographic interviews, and landscape reconstructions.|$|E
25|$|Other critiques {{have been}} made over the author’s {{position}} on the agricultural revolution. The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture {{is not necessarily a}} one way process. It has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy, which may still be exploited, if necessary, when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists. In fact, it is <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult</b> to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies, especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion that has occurred in the last 10,000 years.|$|E
25|$|Writing {{was from}} right to left except in archaic inscriptions, which {{occasionally}} used boustrophedon. An example found at Cerveteri used left to right. In the earliest inscriptions, the words are continuous. From the sixth century BC, they are separated by a dot or a colon, which symbol might also be used to separate syllables. Writing was phonetic; the letters represented the sounds and not conventional spellings. On the other hand, many inscriptions are highly abbreviated and often casually formed, so the identification of individual letters is <b>sometimes</b> <b>difficult.</b> Spelling might vary from city to city, probably reflecting differences of pronunciation.|$|E
