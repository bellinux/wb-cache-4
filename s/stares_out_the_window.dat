5000|$|The two meet, but Sheryl {{seems to}} have come to an {{understanding}} regarding her situation. She decides {{that she wants to}} put the baby up for adoption. She also suggests that her situation is too complicated for a young woman such as herself to realistically see through a life with Rick, a baby, and no money or viable career opportunities for either of them. Rick is upset, and hands her an engagement ring that he planned to propose with, suggesting that she could pawn it. Alice then talks to Sheryl, asking her what happened to her earlier views regarding how nothing could stop true love. Sheryl tells her that she is simply too young to understand. As Alice suggests the three of them running away together, Sheryl tells Alice that she mustn't leave her loved ones. As Alice is put on a bus back to Long Island and <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at Rick, Sheryl comes out, and the two embrace.|$|E
50|$|The {{caretaker}} {{tries to}} telephone the remote cabin, but nobody answers. He tries {{to hide his}} concern, but nobody's fooled. While Takashi takes over trying to ring the cabin, Machiko <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> into the deepening storm. She catches sight of a shadowy figure shambling toward the lodge. A fur-clad young woman named Chika (Akemi Negishi), {{who lives in a}} remote village somewhere deep in the mountains. Chika is none too pleased to see so many visitors in the lodge, since the people of her village shun all contact with outsiders. However, the night is so brutal that she has little choice but to join them if she wants to stay warm. There is still no response from the cabin; and the little group is horrified to hear the sound of an avalanche thundering down a nearby slope. The lodge telephone starts ringing. Machiko runs to the phone; but no sooner has she put it up to her ear when she throws it back down again in horror. Through the earpiece comes the sound of screams, followed by a single gunshot. There is a moment of silence. Takashi picks up the receiver, he hears another agonized scream and the line goes dead. Chika puts her furs back on and slips away, unnoticed by the others.|$|E

50|$|G.B. Grayson {{was born}} in rural Ashe County, North Carolina in 1887 to Benjamin Carrol and Martha Jane Roark Grayson. According to his sister, when G.B. was six weeks old, his sight was damaged when he <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at bright snow for several hours.

5000|$|The narrator spends {{four days}} hitchhiking from Saginaw to join Kathy in Pittsburgh, where {{together}} they board a Greyhound bus {{to continue the}} journey. The narrator begins with a lighthearted and optimistic outlook ("Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together") that fades {{over the course of}} the song. To pass time, he and Kathy play games and try to guess the backgrounds of their fellow passengers. Over the course of their journey, they smoke all their cigarettes. Kathy reads a magazine before falling asleep, leaving the narrator awake to reflect on the meaning of the journey alone. In the final verse, the narrator is able to speak his true emotions to Kathy, now that she is sleeping and cannot hear or answer. [...] "I'm empty and aching and I don't know why" [...] captures the longing and angst of the 1960s in nine simple words. The narrator then <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> [...] "counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike." [...] Many other empty, aching, and lost souls are on the highway, each on their own journey alone even if someone is traveling with them. The soaring harmony lines and crashing cymbals create a powerful and poignant end to the song's final verse: [...] "They've all come to look for America." [...] Pete Fornatale interprets this lyric as a [...] "metaphor to remind us all of the lost souls wandering the highways and byways of mid-sixties America, struggling to navigate the rapids of despair and hope, optimism and disillusionment." ...|$|E
50|$|Walt {{meets with}} Jack {{and his men}} at their hideout, where Jesse is still {{performing}} slave labor for the gang in an adjacent Quonset hut. Jack refuses Walt's offer and orders him killed. Walt diverts Jack's attention by accusing him of partnering with Jesse; Jack responds by ordering that Jesse join them. Upon seeing Jesse, Walt tackles him and uses his car keys to remote-fire the machine gun (which he has connected to a pivoting turret rigged to the car key's remote unlock button) from his car. Jack's men are killed in the barrage of gunfire; Jack and Walt are wounded while Todd and Jesse are unharmed. As Todd <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in amazement at the now-empty machine gun pivoting in its turret, Jesse strangles and kills Todd with the chain attached to his handcuffs, and then frees himself by taking a key from Todd's pocket. After Walt picks up a dropped handgun, Jack pleads for his life, attempting to bargain with {{the location of the}} stolen money, but Walt coldly kills Jack. Walt gives the gun to Jesse and asks Jesse to kill him. Jesse notices Walt's wound and refuses, telling Walt to kill himself. As Jesse and Walt leave Jack's house, Walt answers a call on Todd's phone from a visibly ill Lydia. He informs her that her business partners are dead and asks if she's feeling a little under the weather, revealing that he had earlier put ricin in her stevia at the coffee shop. Jesse and Walt exchange a farewell glance before Jesse leaves. Jesse flees in Todd's El Camino, crying with joy.|$|E
5000|$|Several months pass, and Hester {{has begun}} to enter labor as David, J.B., Shory, and Gus wait downstairs {{for the child to}} be born. Beeves tries to {{convince}} Gus to take over sixty percent of his business ventures so he can raise enough money to purchase more mink. Gus refuses on the basis that David could lose everything he owns if his mink perish, to which he replies that he has already mortgaged most of his assets. As things escalate into quarrel, David divulges that Hester has fallen and that {{it is possible that the}} child could be delivered as a stillbirth or deformed. David is convinced that this catastrophe is his final payment for all of the luck that has pursued him throughout his recent life. Ironically, the child is born a healthy boy, and David continues to feel ashamed and guilty about his prosperity. A month later, Gus and Hester learn that Dan Dibbleâs mink have all died after consuming contaminated feed - David uses the same feed for his own mink. Both decide to hold off on telling him; Gus fearing that his psychological and emotional stability might come into jeopardy, and Hester believing that such a loss would eventually make him happy in the long run. Dibble eventually calls the house and informs David, who begins to chastise Hester. She makes the decision to leave him, the reasoning behind this misconstrued by David as Gus having an affair with his wife. Just as things come to an emotional climax, Dibble arrives and assuages their fears - he and David both realize that the careful monitoring of the feed has saved his mink. David has an epiphany after Gus points out that only Beevesâ hard work and meticulous care giving could have saved the mink, not luck. He then departs. Hester asks David to come up for bed, and as thunder roars in the distance, he <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> with apprehension.|$|E

60|$|Edward Cossey did not reject this {{suggestion}} with the contempt {{that might have}} been expected; on the contrary he appeared to be turning the matter over in his mind, for he drummed a little tune with his knuckles and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Go Getters", Gregory {{approaches}} Maggie and Sasha and insists {{they need to}} leave {{and go back to}} Alexandria. Jesus tries to reason with him, but Gregory says they must leave by morning. At night, Maggie and Sasha wake up to loud music coming from a car parked on the Hilltop's interior, with the Hilltop gates open. Walkers are being attracted by the music and multiple fires that have been set inside the Hilltop. Gregory <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the house, but does not take action, while Maggie, Sasha, and Jesus intervene. The next day, Gregory and Jesus discuss what to do about Maggie and Sasha when some Saviors show up. Gregory tells Jesus to hide Maggie and Sasha in the closet. Gregory opens the door for Simon and the other Saviors at the Hilltop. Simon tells Gregory they should talk in private in the study. Gregory said the message last night was received loud and clear: He is the Hilltop's [...] "Negan" [...] now. Simon asks if there is anything else he should be made aware of and Gregory stays silent. He says that there actually is something and Gregory leads Simon to the corridor closest, opening the door to reveal bottles of classic scotch. Simon asks Gregory to kneel before they continue and Gregory instantly obliges. Simon tells him it's a solid kneel, and pats his head like a child. After the Saviors leave, Gregory finds Sasha and Maggie in his room, where they were hiding in a closet. Jesus puts his foot down and says the women are staying, and he will knock Gregory out of power if he disagrees. Gregory says the Saviors can be quite reasonable and Maggie punches him in the face. In the mid-season finale [...] "Hearts Still Beating", Gregory warns Maggie not to let her popularity with the Hilltop residents get to her head.|$|E
60|$|Neighbours in London! The Ramboats did {{not know}} the names of the people on either side of them. As I waited for Marion before we started off upon our honeymoon flight, Mr. Ramboat, I remember, came and stood beside me and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|The slatternly general servant re{{appeared}} {{with the}} chops and tinned salmon {{he had asked}} Madam Gadow to prepare for them.

60|$|He {{turned his}} back upon it and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> over <b>the</b> trees and greenery. The balcony was {{decorated}} with white and pink geraniums in pots painted black and gold, and the railings of the balcony were black and gold with crimson shape like squares wildly out of drawing.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{after this}} time Gilberto's father, upset by JoÃ£o's bizarre singing style and refusal to take [...] "normal" [...] work, {{committed}} {{him to a}} mental hospital. In a psychological interview there, Gilberto <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and remarked, âLook at the wind depilating the treesâ. The psychologist replied, âBut trees have no hair, JoÃ£oâ, to which Gilberto responded, âAnd {{there are people who}} have no poetryâ. He was released after a week. The next year (1956) he returned to Rio and struck up old acquaintances, most significantly AntÃ´nio Carlos Jobim, who was by then working as a composer, producer and arranger with Odeon Records. Jobim was impressed with Gilberto's new style of guitar playing, and set about finding a suitable song to pitch the style to Odeon management.|$|R
5000|$|Pulitzer-prize-winning LA {{restaurant}} critic Jonathan Gold put Carney's on {{his list}} of 99 essential Los Angeles restaurants and wrote that, [...] "Carneyâs is a restaurant in the real Los Angeles tradition, two ancient Union Pacific cars transported to West Hollywood at great expense and mounted overlooking the Strip, where a mad parade of bass players and catalog models, hustlers and high school kids, movie guys and industry suits <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> old train, onto the profusion of German tourists and Japanese cars that flow down this section of Sunset so steadily that after a few beers and a chili dog or two, the train can appear to be lurching down the track." [...] KTVU movie critic Bob Shaw was fond of Carney's burgers. Carney's serves a chocolate-dipped frozen banana on a stick for dessert.|$|R

6000|$|I {{could think}} of nothing else.

[...] And I, not knowing how to enter upon so terrible a tale, whined out, [...] "I'm sick, I want to go home." ...|$|R
6000|$|He put off {{the luxury}} of opening the letter till after the rites of {{brushing}} his teeth, putting on his slippers, pounding his rocking-chair cushion into softness.

He sighed joyously and read: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped and}} stared at me. I felt all that foolish {{incapacity}} an Englishman feels on such occasions.

When at last I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles.|$|R
