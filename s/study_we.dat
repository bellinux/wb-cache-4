60|$|In our <b>study</b> <b>we</b> {{have noted}} (1) the Poets of Romanticism: the {{importance}} of the Lyrical Ballads of 1798; the life and work of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, Byron, Shelley, and Keats; (2) the Prose Writers: the novels of Scott; the development of literary criticism; the life and work of the essayists, Lamb, De Quincey, Landor, and of the novelist Jane Austen.|$|E
30|$|For {{the threat}} of missing {{critical}} primary <b>studies,</b> <b>we</b> used two secondary studies {{as a source of}} primary <b>studies.</b> <b>We</b> obtained a set of 20 studies reporting evidence on Kanban, which is a high number in SE considering that they report the same effects (i.e., benefits and drawbacks of Kanban).
