In the project, the tiling pattern {{is used to}} create the structural <b>sub-framing</b> for the facades, allowing for the facades to be fabricated off-site, in a factory and later erected to form the facades. The pinwheel tiling system {{was based on the}} single triangular element, composed of zinc, perforated zinc, sandstone or glass (known as a tile), which was joined to 4 other similar tiles on an aluminum frame, to form a [...] "panel". Five panels were affixed to a galvanized steel frame, forming a [...] "mega-panel", which were then hoisted onto support frames for the facade. The rotational positioning of the tiles gives the facades a more random, uncertain compositional quality, even though the process of its construction is based on pre-fabrication and repetition. The same pinwheel tiling system is used {{in the development of the}} structural frame and glazing for the [...] "Atrium" [...] at Federation Square, although in this instance, the pin-wheel grid has been made [...] "3-dimensional" [...] to form a portal frame structure.|$|E

50|$|Wobulation {{works by}} {{overlapping}} pixels. It does so by generating multiple <b>sub-frames</b> of data while an optical image shifting mechanism (e.g. {{the mirror of}} a digital micromirror device) then displaces the projected image of each <b>sub-frame</b> by {{a fraction of a}} pixel (e.g. one-half or one-third). The <b>sub-frames</b> are then projected in rapid succession, and appear to the human eye as if they are being projected simultaneously and superimposed. For example, a high-resolution HDTV video frame is divided into two <b>sub-frames,</b> A and B. <b>Sub-frame</b> A is projected, and then the miniature mirror on a digital micromirror device switches and displaces <b>sub-frame</b> B one half pixel length as it is projected. When projected in rapid succession, the <b>sub-frames</b> superimpose, and create to the human eye a complete and seamless image. If the video <b>sub-frames</b> are aligned so that the corners of the pixels in the second <b>sub-frame</b> are projected at the centers of the first, the illusion of double the resolution is achieved, like in an interlaced CRT display. Thus a lower resolution fixed pixel device using wobulation can emulate the picture of higher resolution fixed device, at a reduced cost.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{extend a}} two-user {{cooperative}} diversity system by exploiting the proposed ARQ protocols as follows. A whole cooperative frame {{is divided into}} three <b>sub-frames.</b> The first <b>sub-frame</b> is allocated for user 1 (U 1) to transmit its data packet. The second <b>sub-frame</b> is assigned to user 2 (U 2) to transmit its data packet. The third <b>sub-frame</b> is shared between both users and is used to relay each other's message to the destination. The cyclic redundancy checksum (CRC) is used to facilitate error detection. If one user receives a correct <b>sub-frame</b> of its partner, it will relay the received information in cooperative <b>sub-frame.</b> Otherwise, the relaying user will do nothing in the third <b>sub-frame.</b> To utilize DASTBC to achieve diversity, U 1 relays the packet of U 2 with a negative conjugate form. Similarly, U 2 transmits a conjugate packet of U 1. Then, the destination uses maximum ratio combine (MRC) to receive data packets.|$|R

40|$|Real-time video {{streaming}} over wireless channel {{has become an}} important issue due to the limited bandwidth that is unable to handle {{the flow of information}} of the video frames. The characteristics of wireless networks in terms of the available bandwidth, frame delay, and frame losses cannot be known in advance.

40|$|Watermark bits {{embedded}} in audio signals considering the sample’s relative {{state in a}} frame may strengthen the attack-invariant features of audio watermarking algorithm. In this work, we propose to embed watermarks in an audio signal considering {{the relation between the}} mean values of consecutive groups of samples which shows robustness by overcoming common watermarking challenges. Here, we divide the host audio signal into equal-sized non-overlapping frames which in turn is split into four equalsized non-overlapping <b>sub-frames.</b> After, transforming these <b>sub-frames</b> in cepstrum domain we finally use the relation between the differences of first two <b>sub-frames</b> and last two <b>sub-frames</b> to embed watermarks. Depending on the watermark bit (either 0 or 1) to be embed, our embedding technique either interchange or update the differences between these groups of samples by distorting the sample values in <b>sub-frames</b> selectively. Thus, watermarks are embedded by making a little or no distortion of the <b>sub-frames</b> which helps our scheme to be imperceptible in nature. Moreover, use of such embedding technique lead our watermarking scheme to a computationally less complex extraction method. Simulation results also justify our claim of the proposed scheme to be both robust and imperceptible...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of a vehicle <b>sub-frame</b> is often discussed in vehicle compatibility.

The most forward placement of the <b>sub-frame</b> had a stiffer response than the other configurations as observed in acceleration pulse and barrier wall loads. Self protection also tended to be improved over the baseline configuration. In car-car testing, it was difficult to identify a clear subframe configuration that provided improved compatibility.

As estimated in the previous section, the RN backhaul link resource requirement in case of 10 RNs per DeNB cell deployment is in the range of 51 - 88 %.

30|$|Literatures {{have studied}} varied dynamic TDD schemes, {{including}} the proportion method, greedy method, evolutionary game method, and soft reconfiguration method. For the proportion method [6], the TDD frame configuration whose UL/DL <b>sub-frame</b> ratio {{is closest to}} the UL/DL traffic ratio is adopted. The commonly used proportion method includes traffic volume-based schemes [7, 8] and buffer-based schemes [9 – 11]. The proportion method is simple, but it cannot fully reflect {{the needs of the}} network because it {{does not take into account}} the order of UL/DL <b>sub-frames.</b> Due to its simplicity, the proportion method is often used as the baseline scheme to measure the performance of newly proposed dynamic TDD schemes. The greedy method [12, 13] firstly calculates the gain of each <b>sub-frame</b> supposing it is an uplink <b>sub-frame</b> or a downlink <b>sub-frame</b> and configures the <b>sub-frame</b> following the direction that with larger gain. The greedy method is able to adapt to the instantaneous network load, but it might not be optimal during a long period of time. The central idea of evolutionary game algorithm [14] includes “choice” operation and “mutation” operation.
