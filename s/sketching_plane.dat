The reconstruction task usually separates a 3 D symmetric shape into {{two types of}} shape components, that is, the self-symmetric shape component and the mutual-symmetric shape components. Each type can be created in an intuitive manner. Using a uniform symmetry plane, the user first draws 2 D sketch lines for each shape component on a <b>sketching</b> <b>plane.</b> The z-depth information of the hand-drawn input sketches can be calculated using their property of mirror symmetry to generate 3 D construction curves. In order to provide more freedom for controlling the local geometric features of the reconstructed free-form shapes (e.g., non-circular cross-sections), our modeling system creates each shape component from four construction curves. Using one pair of symmetric curves and one pair of general curves, an improved cross-sectional surface blending scheme is applied to generate a parametric surface for each component. The final symmetric free-form shape is progressively created, and is represented by 3 D triangular mesh. Experimental results illustrate that our system can generate complex symmetric free-form shapes effectively and conveniently.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a feature-based free-form shape {{modelling}} technique based on solving a fundamental problem of reconstructing the depth information from 2 D <b>sketch</b> <b>planes.</b> First, to mathematically define {{the problem with the}} human perception, the proposed technique (1) formulates the 2 D shaded regions on sketches by a hybrid thin plate surface model that can exhibit controlled continuity over the recovered 3 D surface and (2) formulates the 1 D salient open free-form curves and salient corners as linear sketch constraints. The 3 D free-form shape from <b>sketch</b> <b>planes</b> is then achieved by solving a linearly constrained quadratic optimization problem which unifies both 2 D region-based and 1 D contour-based shape information over 2 D sketches. Secondly, to solve the formulated optimization problem with an interactive-rate performance, a fast and stable numerical engine is proposed with a rigorous proof that for our specially formulated problem, system decomposition with reduced computational cost is always possible. Stability, accuracy and efficiency are studied in depth for the proposed numerical engine. Finally a prototype system utilizing the proposed technique is presented with two applications that demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Generalized {{cylinders}} are {{a versatile}} class of ob-jects commonly constructed from a spine and cross-sections orthogonal to it. We propose a novel method for the intuitive sketch-based specification of arbitrarily complex spines, in-cluding those that loop over and under themselves. A two-dimensional {{sketch of the}} spine is drawn using a pen and a graphics tablet first. This {{is surrounded by a}} swept-sphere bounding volume representing the generalized cylinder. Any overlapping sections are automatically offset perpendicular to the <b>sketch</b> <b>plane,</b> their ordering controlled by pen pres-sure. The user may adjust the resulting shape by oversketch-ing or rotating the view and dragging points in the spine. All user input is processed by an optimization that generates a smooth, non-intersecting shape at interactive speeds...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for {{the reconstruction of}} a three-dimensional object from a single two-dimensional freehand sketch composed of strokes connected at vertices. The proposed algorithm uses the angular distribution of the strokes in the <b>sketch</b> <b>plane</b> to determine one or more orthogonal three-dimensional axis systems whose projection correlates with observed stroke orientations, and then uses these axis systems to calculate a plausible depth for each vertex to reconstruct a 3 D object from the sketch. The proposed approach is effective for reconstructing objects that are mostly comprised of orthogonal features, as commonly found in many engineering-oriented sketches. We demonstrate an implementation of the algorithm using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization that permits reconstruction of a typical object with over 100 strokes in interactive time...|$|R
40|$|This paper describes, Napkin Sketch, a 3 D {{sketching}} interface which {{attempts to}} support sketch-based artistic expression in 3 D, mimicking {{some of the}} qualities of conventional sketching media and tools {{both in terms of}} physical properties and interaction experience. A portable tablet PC is used as the sketching platform, and handheld mixed reality techniques are employed to allow 3 D sketches to be created on top of a physical napkin. Intuitive manipulation and navigation within the 3 D design space is achieved by visually tracking the tablet PC with a camera and mixed reality markers. For artistic expression using sketch input, we improve upon the projective 3 D sketching approach with a one stroke <b>sketch</b> <b>plane</b> definition technique. This coupled with the hardware setup produces a natural and fluid sketching experience...|$|R

30|$|We {{conclude}} {{from this}} study that well-structured engineering experiences provide {{opportunities for students to}} engage in the design processes connected to an aerospace context. Although only slight improvements occurred in the sketches between the design and redesign phases, the study reveals that students could <b>sketch</b> <b>planes</b> of varying levels of sophistication that translated into models. We suggest that scaffolding by the teacher about how to improve designs for increased detail could be included in subsequent experiences (cf. Anning 1997). In the last two phases of our engineering framework (evaluation, redesign), students began to apply disciplinary knowledge when recommending an improved launch technique and when explaining changes for their second design. The study highlights the importance of affording students the opportunity to complete their initial designs, then build and test their models, and subsequently negotiate and create a second design. This opportunity appeared to have contributed to students’ improved application of disciplinary knowledge in the final phases of our engineering framework.|$|R
40|$|We present EverybodyLovesSketch, a gesture-based 3 D curve {{sketching}} {{system for}} rapid ideation and visualization of 3 D forms, {{aimed at a}} broad audience. We first analyze traditional perspective drawing in professional practice. We then design a system built upon the paradigm of ILoveSketch, a 3 D curve drawing system for design professionals. The new system incorporates many interaction aspects of perspective drawing with judicious automation to enable novices with no perspective training to proficiently create 3 D curve sketches. EverybodyLovesSketch supports a number of novel interactions: tick-based <b>sketch</b> <b>plane</b> selection, single view definition of arbitrary extrusion vectors, multiple extruded surface sketching, copy-and-project of 3 D curves, freeform surface sketching, and an interactive perspective grid. Finally, we present a study involving 49 high school students (with no formal artistic training) who each learned and used the system over 11 days, which provides detailed insights into the popularity, power and usability of the various techniques, and shows our system to be easily learnt and effectively used, with broad appeal.

40|$|The “Automatic Construction of a Polyhedron from a Single Sketch” {{is still}} an unsolved problem, even for the plainest case where the {{polyhedron}} is trihedral and planar. This doctoral thesis presents an algorithm for the “Construction of a Polyhedron from a Single Plane Sketch” and provides a new interactive sketching-based environment for the conceptual design phase. The proposed solution is based on Graph Theory, Solid Modeling, Euclidean Geometry and Topology combining with heuristic criteria whenever mathematical theories are proved to be inadequate (eg., a <b>plane</b> <b>sketch</b> is not always sufficient enough {{in order for the}} corresponding polyhedron to be constructed). The proposed algorithm proceeds in two steps. In the first step a topological- and geometrical-correct wireframe sketch is constructed from the initial plane sketch: (a) the topological and geometrical features of the <b>plane</b> <b>sketch</b> are obtained and the minimum number of hidden lines, junctions and regions are calculated, (b) a topological correct “rich” wireframe sketch is constructed, and then minimized and (c) the geometry of the hidden elements of the minimal wireframe sketch is calculated. In the second step a polyhedron is constructed from the minimal wireframe sketch, {{in such a way that}} the orthographic projection of the constructed polyhedron identifies with the initial <b>plane</b> <b>sketch.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In source-based path selection, {{the sender}} chooses {{the path to}} the {{destination}} from a set of available paths and embeds the forward-ing information in the packets. Future Internet proposals have em-ployed this scheme to realize the benefits of source routing without the inherent scalability problems of path computation at the source.

However, the implications on the forwarding performance of these novel routing schemes have not been studied in detail. In this paper, we study the data plane of source-based path selec-tion schemes. We take SCION—a future Internet proposal—as an example and <b>sketch</b> its data <b>plane</b> implementation.

50|$|Hercules {{is caught}} in a rare moment of repose. Leaning on his knobby club which is draped with the pelt of the Nemean Lion, he holds the apples of the Hesperides, but conceals them behind his back cradled in his right hand. Many {{engravings}} and woodcuts spread the fame of the Farnese's Hercules. By 1562 the find was already included in the set of engravings for Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae ("Mirror of Rome's Magnificence") and connoisseurs, artists, and tourists gaped at the original, which stood {{in the courtyard of}} the Palazzo Farnese, protected under the arcade. In 1590-91, during his trip to Rome, Hendrik Goltzius sketched the statue in the palazzo courtyard. Later (in 1591) Goltzius recorded the less-common rear view, in a bravura engraving (illustration, right), which emphasizes the already exaggerated muscular form with swelling and tapering lines that flow over the contours. The young Rubens made quick <b>sketches</b> of the <b>planes</b> and massing of the statue of Hercules. Before photography, prints were the only way to put the image into many hands.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the system of {{automatic}} reconstruction of curved solids using three orthographic projections consisting of straight lines and circular and elliptical arcs. There is a need for tools helping convert <b>plane</b> <b>sketches</b> into solid models when using systems of 3 -d solid modeling (Solid Works, Solid Edge etc). Although there are many systems of this kind techniques of automatic modeling have not been introduces so far. The key problem here is that the methods currently used in these systems are not complete and imply further elaboration. Moreover, their authors only paid attention to the approaches and algorithms they used, but leaved out such important points as sketch format and import, results visualization method and their export to existing systems of 3 D modeling. In this paper the authors conceived of the approach eliminating these drawbacks.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} {{an investigation of}} fifteen second-semester calculus students 2 ̆ 7 understanding {{of the concept of}} parametric function, as a special relation from a subset of R to a subset of R 2. A substantial amount of research has revealed that the concept of function, in general, is very difficult for students to understand. Furthermore, several studies have investigated students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of various types of functions. However, very little is known about how students reason about parametric functions. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature. Employing Action [...] Process [...] Object [...] Schema (APOS) theory as the guiding theoretical perspective, this study proposes a preliminary genetic decomposition for how a student might construct the concept of parametric function. To determine whether the students in this study made the constructions called for by the preliminary genetic decomposition or other constructions not considered in the preliminary genetic decomposition, data is analyzed regarding students 2 ̆ 7 reasoning about parametric functions. In particular, this study explores (1) students 2 ̆ 7 personal definitions of parametric function; (2) students 2 ̆ 7 reasoning about parametric functions given in the form p(t) =(f(t),g(t)); (3) students 2 ̆ 7 reasoning about parametric functions on a variety of tasks, such as converting from parametric to standard form, <b>sketching</b> a <b>plane</b> curve defined parametrically, and constructing a parametric function to describe a real-world situation; and (4) students 2 ̆ 7 reasoning about the invariant relationship between two quantities varying simultaneously when described in both a graph and a real-world problem. Then the genetic decomposition is revised {{based on the results of}} the data analysis. This study concludes with implications for teaching the concept of parametric function and suggestions for further research on this topic...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{geometric}} representation of ideas {{during the early}} stages of design. When a designer's ideas are still in gestation, the exploration of form is more important than its precise specification. Digital modelers facilitate such exploration, but only for forms built with discrete collections of high-level geometric primitives; we introduce techniques that operate on designers' medium of choice, 2 -D sketches. Designers' explorations also shift between 2 -D and 3 -D, yet 3 -D form must also be specified with these high-level primitives, requiring an entirely different mindset from 2 -D sketching. We introduce a new approach to transform existing 2 -D sketches directly into a new kind of sketch-like 3 -D model. Finally, we present a novel sketching technique that removes the distinction between 2 -D and 3 -D altogether. This thesis makes five contributions: point-dragging and curve-drawing techniques for editing sketches; two techniques to help designers bring 2 -D sketches to 3 -D; and a sketching interface that dissolves the boundaries between 2 -D and 3 -D representation. The first two contributions of this thesis introduce smooth exploration techniques that work on sketched form composed of strokes, in 2 -D or 3 -D. First, we present a technique, inspired by classical painting practices, whereby the designer can explore a range of curves with a single stroke. As the user draws near an existing curve, our technique automatically and interactively replaces sections of the old curve with the new one. Second, we present a method to enable smooth exploration of sketched form by point-dragging. The user constructs a high-level "proxy" description that can be used, somewhat like a skeleton, to deform a sketch independent of(cont.) the internal stroke description. Next, we leverage the proxy deformation capability to help the designer move directly from existing 2 -D sketches to 3 -D models. Our reconstruction techniques generate a novel kind of 3 -D model which maintains the appearance and stroke structure of the original 2 -D sketch. One technique transforms a single sketch with help from annotations by the designer; the other combines two sketches. Since these interfaces are user-guided, they can operate on ambiguous sketches, relying on the designer to choose an interpretation. Finally, we present an interface to build an even sparser, more suggestive, type of 3 -D model, either from existing sketches or from scratch. "Camera planes" provide a complex 3 -D scaffolding on which to hang sketches, which can still be drawn as rapidly and freely as before. A sparse set of 2 -D <b>sketches</b> placed on <b>planes</b> provides a novel visualization of 3 -D form, with enough information present to suggest 3 -D shape, but enough missing that the designer can 'read into' the form, seeing multiple possibilities.
