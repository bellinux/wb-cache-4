5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle <b>system</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, {{pushing through the}} bunker <b>system</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Dutch {{graduate}} student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made {{a determination of}} the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter and published posthumously in 1938. Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, {{as well as the other}} planets in the inner Solar <b>System,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> planet's gravitational perturbations of the asteroid. His estimated margin of error was 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.|$|E

5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake <b>system</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating <b>system</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Báthory's reign {{marks the}} end of szlachta's reform movement. The foreign king was skeptical of the Polish {{parliamentary}} system and had little appreciation for what the execution movement activists had been trying to accomplish. Batory's relations with Sienicki soon deteriorated, while other szlachta leaders had advanced within the nobility ranks, becoming senators or being otherwise preoccupied with their own careers. The reformers managed to move in 1578 in Poland and in 1581 in Lithuania the out-of-date appellate court <b>system</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> monarch's domain to the Crown and Lithuanian Tribunals run by the nobility. The cumbersome sejm and sejmiks system, the ad hoc confederations, and the lack of efficient mechanisms for the implementation of the laws escaped the reformers' attention or will to persevere. Many thought that the glorified nobility rule had approached perfection.|$|E

5|$|The English law legal system, {{developed}} over the centuries, {{is the basis of}} common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana).

5|$|The {{number of}} {{combined}} restaurants and stores owned by Cracker Barrel increased between 1997 and 2000, {{to more than}} 420 locations. In 2000 and 2001, the company addressed staffing and infrastructure issues related to this rapid growth by implementing a more rigorous recruitment strategy and introducing new technology, including an order-placement <b>system.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the company focused on opening new locations in residential areas to attract local residents and workers as customers. It updated its marketing in 2006 to encourage new customers, changing the design of its highway billboard advertisements to include images of menu items. Previously the signs had featured only the company's logo. By 2011, Cracker Barrel had opened more than 600 restaurants in 42 states. On January 17, 2012, company founder Dan Evins died of bladder cancer.|$|E
5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a toxic protein and an RNA antitoxin. The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the ToxIN <b>system</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E
