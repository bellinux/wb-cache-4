5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (<b>sneezewort)</b> in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E
500|$|Tansy beetles are herbivorous and {{primarily}} use tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) {{as their}} host plant.

50|$|The {{fields on}} either side of the lane are {{traditionally}} managed, some grazed by horses and others managed as hay meadows. Three fields which have escaped agricultural improvement support wild flowers typical of old grassland, such as <b>sneezewort</b> and pignut.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} typical {{unimproved}} London Clay grassland. Damp, herb rich areas have uncommon plants characteristic of old meadows such as great burnet, <b>sneezewort</b> and devil's bit scabious. The brook is lined by sedges and water-cress, while breeding birds include yellowhammer and spotted flycatcher.|$|E
50|$|Sylvia's Meadow is {{an example}} of {{unimproved}} herb-rich pasture land containing some rare plant species. It is famed for the orchids that grow there, which include the lesser butterfly orchid and heath spotted orchid.

50|$|There is a drier area of {{heathland}} {{around the}} marsh which supports creeping willow, <b>sneezewort,</b> common fleabane, devil's-bit scabious, purple moor-grass, heather, cross-leaved heath heather and bell heather. The {{boundaries of the}} reserve are edged with bramble, gorse, silver birch and willow. rosebay willowherb flourishes in one corner and its spread is controlled.|$|E
50|$|The area to {{the north}} of the central {{embankment}} is heathland which supports Purple Moor-grass and Mat-grass. Petty Whin grows in abundance on this site and is the only recorded occurrence in the county. Heather and European Gorse are also present. A range of typical heathland flowers flourish, including Heath Bedstraw, Lousewort, Tormentil and <b>Sneezewort.</b>|$|E

Other plants that grow here, {{including}} some protected species, are the: white water-lily, downy birch, water soldier, woody nightshade, flatleaf bladderwort, small bur-reed, tufted loosestrife, <b>sneezewort,</b> branched bur-reed, cowbane (very poisonous), six-stamened waterwort, yellow flag, Eupatorium.|$|E
50|$|Wetter {{areas of}} the site are {{dominated}} by soft rush Juncus effusus, and stable wet areas exhibit Sphagnum moss. Other areas have sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and herbs such as water mint Mentha aquatica and <b>sneezewort</b> Achillea ptarmica. The bulrush Typha latifolia, floating sweet-grass Glyceria fluitans and common spike-rush Eleocharis palustris are also found.|$|E
50|$|The {{main part}} of the site {{consists}} of a large area of uncultivated grassland and old hedgerows between Totteridge Common and Mays Lane, crossing Dollis Brook, which is also an SINC. The grassland has a wide range of wildflowers, such as <b>sneezewort</b> and harebell. The site also hosts the declining skylark and several rare beetles and spiders.|$|E

50|$|The reserve {{consists}} of pastures grazed by horses around Mill Hill Electricity Substation. These contain patches of unimproved herb-rich pasture on damp clay soil. Locally uncommon plants include devil's bit scabious, <b>sneezewort,</b> pepper-saxifrage and red bartsia. The dividing hedges {{appear to be}} very old, and Burtonhole Brook, a tributary of Folly Brook, flows through the site, adding to its diversity of habitat. The hedgerows and woodland provide a refuge for birds.|$|E

50|$|The {{last four}} gnomes in Great Britain live beside Folly Brook in Warwickshire; they are {{named after the}} flowers Baldmoney, <b>Sneezewort,</b> Dodder and Cloudberry. After Cloudberry goes {{exploring}} one day and does not return, the others make the tremendous decision to build a boat {{and set out to}} find him. This {{is the story of the}} gnomes' epic journey, set against the background of the English countryside, beginning in spring, continuing through summer, and concluding in autumn, when the first frosts are starting to arrive.|$|E

50|$|Rich {{wetlands}} occur {{especially at}} {{the east of the}} moors and have species mixes arising in part out of the effects of a limestone understratum dominated by purple moor-grass with, in less-grazed areas, bog-myrtle (Myrica gale), and in more-grazed areas, cross-leaved heath and tormentil, with sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), compact rush (Juncus conglomeratus), <b>sneezewort</b> (Achillea ptramica), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre) and wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), and limestone indicators including carnation, glaucous and flea sedges (Carex panicea, C. flacca and C. pulicaris), fen bedstraw (Galium uliginosum), tufted vetch (Vicia cracca) and moss (Hylocomium splendens).|$|E
5000|$|Totteridge Croft Field is a 2.4 hectare Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade I, between Totteridge Green and Darland's Lake at Grid Ref [...] It {{is a field}} {{bounded by}} tall {{unmanaged}} hedges on unimproved clay grassland. It {{appears to have been}} a hay meadow in the past which is now reverting to rough grassland and scrub. Much of the field is covered with tufted hair-grass, and it has scattered oak and crab apple trees and a good variety of wild flowers. There are some uncommon species, such as <b>sneezewort</b> and pignut. The field provides a good habitat for birds and cover for mammals such as rabbits and muntjac. It is private land with no public access.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of our ongoing {{screening}} of plants of the family Asteraceae for antiprotozoal activity, a CH 2 Cl 2 -extract from the flowering aerial parts of Achillea ptarmica L. (<b>sneezewort</b> yarrow) was found to be active in vitro against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (IC 50 = 0. 67 µg/mL) and Plasmodium falciparum (IC 50 = 6. 6 μg/mL). Bioassay guided fractionation led to the isolation and identification of five alkamides from the most active fractions. Pellitorine and 8, 9 -Z-dehyropellitorine are the main components of the extract. Beside these olefinic acid amides, four alkamides with diene-diyne structures were isolated. All alkamides were tested for antiprotozoal activity in vitro. Pellitorine was the most active compound so far within this study against P. falciparum (IC 50 = 3. 3 µg/mL), while 8, 9 -Z-dehydropellitorine was most active against T. b. rhodesiense (IC 50 = 2. 0 µg/mL). The activity of pure pellitorine against Plasmodium is higher than that of the crude extract and thus explains the activity of the latter. None of the isolated alkamides, however, was as active against T. b. rhodesiense as the crude extract whose antitrypanosomal activity must therfore be due to a synergistic effect of the isolated compounds or to more active yet to be identified constituents...|$|E
