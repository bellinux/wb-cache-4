40|$|The current {{investigation}} {{examined the effects}} of internal and external <b>supervisors</b> (i. e., formally installed institutions that hold employees accountable for their actions) on employees’ self-serving decisions.

The findings further suggest that the presence of both <b>supervisors</b> did not provide additive advantages, as employees primarily responded to internal <b>supervisors.</b> We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we utilize the {{qualitative}} research method of phenomenography to explore what Ph. D <b>supervisors</b> understand research supervision {{to be and}} how they enact this understanding {{in the practice of}} supervising doctoral students. In total twenty phenomenographic interviews, designed to uncover the 'lived' experience of Ph. D supervision, were undertaken with <b>supervisors</b> of doctoral students at three Australian universities. Five qualitatively different ways of conceiving a <b>supervisor's</b> role emerged from the analysis of the interview transcripts. <b>Supervisors</b> expressing the conception of Quality Assurer seek the outcome of a completed Ph. D free of fundamental flaws. <b>Supervisors</b> expressing the conception of Supportive Guide also desire a completed Ph. D but for these <b>supervisors,</b> completion is achieved through nurturing, encouraging and supporting the student. <b>Supervisors</b> expressing the conception of Researcher Trainer seek to develop a future autonomous researcher and see supervision as an apprenticeship. <b>Supervisors</b> expressing the conception of Mentor are concerned with developing insightful researchers in a specific research area and see supervision as a partnership. Finally, <b>supervisors</b> expressing the conception of Knowledge Enthusiast seek new insight and knowledge as they push the student on a journey of discovery. Our findings suggest that while <b>supervisors</b> undertake similar tasks in the practice of Ph. D supervision, different <b>supervisors</b> approach these tasks differently because of qualitatively different understandings of what supervision is. Therefore, fundamental changes in the practice of supervision can only occur through <b>supervisors</b> changing their underlying conception of what supervision is through reflection and experience.
