5|$|Due to {{friction}} {{within the}} Republican Party caucus, Boehner decided {{to step down}} as speaker and resign his seat in Congress. He scheduled a Republican caucus non-binding vote for speaker on October 8, and a full floor vote on October 29. Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and second-in-command to the <b>Speaker,</b> <b>was</b> initially viewed as the favorite to win the Speakership. However, due to the opposition of the Freedom Caucus, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8, and the caucus vote was postponed.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} and {{managing}} days, <b>Speaker</b> <b>was</b> an entrepreneur and salesman. By 1937, Speaker had opened a wholesale liquor business {{and worked as}} a state sales representative for a steel company. He chaired Cleveland's boxing commission between 1936 and 1943. Newspaper coverage credited Speaker with several key reforms to boxing in Cleveland, including the recruitment of new officials and protections against fight fixing. Under Speaker, fight payouts went directly to boxers rather than managers. Speaker sorted out a scheduling conflict for a 1940 boxing match in Cleveland involving former middleweight champion Teddy Yarosz. Yarosz defeated Jimmy Reeves in ten rounds and the fight attracted over 8,300 spectators.|$|E

5|$|Randall {{believed}} he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless {{in support of his}} party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, in keeping with the customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as <b>Speaker</b> <b>was</b> at an end.|$|E
5|$|The 1874 House {{elections}} {{produced a}} Democratic majority for the 44th Congress, and Blaine’s time as <b>Speaker</b> <b>was</b> at an end. This gave Blaine {{more time to}} concentrate on his presidential ambitions, and to develop new policy ideas. One result was a foray into education policy. In late 1875, President Grant made several speeches {{on the importance of}} {{the separation of church and}} state and the duty of the states to provide free public education. Blaine saw in this an issue that would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground. In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1967, Reddy {{was elected to}} the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as <b>Speaker</b> <b>was</b> marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt {{of the house and the}} setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} experiment, Exp. 1, native Arabic <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} {{in both the}} training and the testing. The WestPoint corpus is divided {{in such a way}} that 61 % of the corpus is used for the training and 39 % for the test regardless of either gender or scripts. In the second experiment, Exp. 2, native <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test phase. Then, the training uses 85 % of the corpus (native speakers), while 15 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. In Exp. 3, all nonnative Arabic <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> used for the training and all Arabic native speakers for the test. In the fourth experiment, Exp. 4, only nonnative Arabic <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> used in both training and testing systems. The nonnative speakers' part of the corpus is divided to obtain 67 % for the training, and 33 % for the test. In the fifth experiment, Exp. 5, both native and nonnative Arabic utterances are pooled to constitute the training data (69 % of the corpus) and testing data (31 % of the corpus). Experiments Exp. 6 to Exp. 9 are set up by varying the gender of the speakers in training and testing data. In Exp. 6, native male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only nonnative male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. Thus the training uses 82 % of the corpus (male speakers only), while 18 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. In Exp. 7, native female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only nonnative female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. Hence the training uses 90 % of the corpus (female speakers only), while 10 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. In Exp. 8, nonnative male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only native male <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. In this case, the training uses 18 % of the corpus (male speakers), while 82 % of the corpus composed of native male <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. Finally, in Exp. 9, nonnative female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> used for the training and only native female <b>speakers</b> <b>are</b> involved in the test. Thus the training uses 10 % of the corpus (female speakers), while 90 % of the corpus composed of nonnative <b>speakers</b> <b>is</b> used for the test. The bigram language model was always derived from the total of prompts provided by WestPoint. This means that we use the same language model for all experiments.|$|R

5|$|The final {{decision}} was made at the 83rd FIDE Congress in September 2012 in Istanbul. Out of the three bidding cities, the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting. Thereafter, discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised. The first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan, who stated that the Armenian chess players would {{find it difficult to}} play in Baku, since the two nations were in armed conflict. The second concern was related to the difficulties that the participants may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country. In his speech during the congress, Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions, where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met, and no incident was ever recorded. He also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win. With regard to the visa issue, Rahimov mentioned the positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants received their visas on arrival at the airport without any problem. He also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily. The next <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who suggested that the 42nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event.|$|E
5|$|The voters {{returned}} Sherman {{to office}} for a third term in 1858. After a brief special session in March 1859, the 36th Congress adjourned, and Sherman and his wife went on vacation to Europe. When they returned that December, the situation {{was similar to that}} of four years earlier: no party had an absolute majority. Republicans held 109 seats, Democrats 101, and Know Nothings 27. Again, sectional tension had increased while Congress was in recess, this time due to John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The election for Speaker of the House promised to be contentious. This time, Sherman was among the leading candidates, receiving the second-largest number of votes on the first ballot, with no candidate receiving a majority. The election for <b>Speaker</b> <b>was</b> sidetracked immediately by a furor over an anti-slavery book, The Impending Crisis of the South, written by Hinton Rowan Helper and endorsed by many Republican members. Southerners accused Sherman of having endorsed the book, while he protested that he only endorsed its use as a campaign tool and had never read it. After two months of balloting, no decision had been reached. After their attempts to adopt a plurality rule failed, Sherman accepted that he could not be elected, and withdrew. Republicans then shifted their support to William Pennington, who was elected on the forty-fourth ballot.|$|E
