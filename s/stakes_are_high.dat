25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if the <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> <b>high</b> enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts {{the effects of}} ego depletion. This may seem surprising {{but in fact it}} may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength. When people do exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> <b>high,</b> like for a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E
