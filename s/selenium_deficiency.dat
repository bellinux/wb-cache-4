40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{importance}} of adequate selenium in diets of native wild herbivores canonly {{be inferred from}} data for beef cattle where minimum dietary concentrations range from 50 to 100 ppb. Concern about possible <b>selenium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in wild herbivores {{is based on a}} few reports of symp-toms in wildlife, a paucity of data on selenium in their forages, and the idea that excessive atmospheric sulfur may increase the incidence of <b>selenium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in herbivores. Concentrations of selenium in sedges, Carex spp., and reedgrasses, calamagrosris spp., the main food plants of bison, Bison bison, in northwestern Canada, varied from 9 to 800 ppb in samples collected at three lowland locations. However, approximately three-quarters of all the samples of plant species consumed by bison were dietarily deficient by the beef cattle standard.

5|$|Selenium {{interacts with}} other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of <b>selenium</b> <b>deficiency</b> on health remains uncertain, {{particularly}} {{in relation to}} Kashin-Beck disease.

5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted.

40|$|<b>Selenium</b> and iodine <b>deficiencies</b> are {{frequently}} present in cattle in Europe {{with a negative}} impact on animal health, reproduction and production. Deficiencies in animals also influence human health owing to consumption of their products. These deficiencies must be correctly diagnosed in order to avoid lack of diagnosis or wrong diagnosis. Since there are many interactions between nutrients, a nutritional approach only is of limited interest. Therefore, the diagnosis based on samples obtained on the animals is more reliable.

As <b>selenium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in celiac disease are observed, the aim {{of the study was to}} determine the sele-nium content in 27 grain gluten-free products available on the European Union (EU) market. Moreover, selenium content in products based on popular gluten-free cereals like corn, rice, and buckwheat and in relatively new or less popular products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was compared. Sele-nium content in the tested products ranged from 0. 9 to 24. 5 μg/ 100 g. The average content of selenium in products based on popular gluten-free cereals was 2. 8 μg/ 100 g and in products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was 10. 8 μg/ 100 g. It indicates that products based on less popular grains, especially on oat, should be more frequently chosen as a source of selenium by people on gluten-free diet than tradi-tionally consumed gluten-free grains...|$|R

Participants received either micronutrient‐fortified (n = 177) or unfortified (n = 183) milk for six months. Academic performance, motivation, and learning strategies were estimated by end‐of‐term tests and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for micronutrients. In total, 296 students (82. 2 %) completed this study. Compared with the control group, students in the intervention group reported higher scores in several academic subjects (p < 0. 05), including languages, mathematics, ethics, and physical performance {{at the end of}} follow‐up. Students in the intervention group showed greater self‐efficacy and use of cognitive strategies in learning, and reported less test anxiety (p < 0. 001). Moreover, vitamin B 2 deficiency (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 18, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 11 ~ 0. 30) and iron deficiency (OR = 0. 34, 95 % CI: 0. 14 ~ 0. 81) were less likely in the students of the intervention group, whereas vitamin D, vitamin B 12, and <b>selenium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> were not significantly different. “Cognitive strategy” had a partial mediating effect on the test scores of English (95 % CI: 1. 26 ~ 3. 79) and Chinese (95 % CI: 0. 53 ~ 2. 21).

Methods: Long-term survivors (> 6 months) of PD for peri-ampullary neoplasia and healthy controls (patients' spouse/partner) were enrolled in the study. Specific clinical parameters were recorded, serum micronutrient levels were measured and subjects completed 7 -day food diaries. Results: Thirty-seven patients were studied, 25 with paired controls. All were well nourished, as defined by body mass index and food diary analysis. Patients with paired controls were representative of all patients studied. Patients had raised transferrin (median 2. 60 vs. 2. 16 g/l, p = 0. 001) and low ferritin levels (34. 9 vs. 119. 0 g/ l, p < 0. 001) indicating relative iron deficiency. Patients also demonstrated lower levels of the anti-oxidants selenium (0. 77 vs. 0. 93 mu mol/l, p < 0. 001) and vitamin E (23. 2 vs. 35. 7 mu mol/ l, p < 0. 001) with 57 % of patients having frank <b>selenium</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Patients had lower levels of vitamin D than controls (15. 7 vs. 19. 6 mu mol/l, p = 0. 001) and 30 % of patients had a raised parathyroid hormone level, suggesting compensatory mechanisms operate to maintain normocalcaemia. Conclusions: Long-term survivors of PD are relatively deficient in several micronutrients compared to non-operated controls taking the same diet.

Soil samples including the surface layer (0 - 20 cm) and the subsurface layer (20 - 40 cm) in the cultivated and natural soil profiles were collected, and the mechanical composite and total concentration of arsenic, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc were determined. Concentrations of arsenic, iron, manganese, copper, and selenium in the surface soil were lower than those in the subsurface soil. The same was true of physical clay in the soil profiles. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the different soil layers. The concentrations of selenium, molybdenum, and mercury were somewhat lower compared with the average concentrations of soils in China. Deficiencies of molybdenum and selenium both play a critical role in occurrence of KBD, but whether or not soil mercury at a low level contributes to KBD is still unclear. A correlation analysis of soil elements showed that there is a positive correlation between iron, cobalt, and manganese due to their similar chemical characteristics. Selenium concentrations in soil as well as the physical clay and iron descend with the deterioration of KBD, but mercury concentrations in soil ascend with the aggravation of the disease. The results show that <b>selenium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> greatly influence the disease, and a deficiency of molybdenum is likely another important factor in inducing KBD. Moreover, determining whether low levels of soil mercury contribute to KBD should be investigated in the future...|$|R
