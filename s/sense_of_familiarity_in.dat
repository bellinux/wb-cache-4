A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of deja vu. The temporal lobe, in particular the perirhinal cortex, responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected with the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>in</b> humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. Specifically, stimulation at 30–40Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; {{but it did not}} lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones — they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.|$|E

Yet despite its anomalies Wordworth's Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood remains captivating and comprehensible because it both describes and conveys nostalgia [...] the pleasurable impression that something one has never known is in fact merely forgotten. Nostalgia in this sense is not a Wordsworthian invention but is well-known in a number of contexts.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{emotional}} mood states on remembering scenes along a route of travel {{were examined in}} two experiments.

Conscious recollection, but not familiarity, was adversely affected by being in an emotional mood state during exposure. For Experiment 2, 24 participants given neutral mood induction were divided according to self-reports of induced mood. Participants in the sad mood group selected more old frames such as 2 ̆ 2 looking sad 2 ̆ 2 in a later test of implicit memory (unconscious retrieval) than did those in the happy mood group.

5000|$|According to Marianne Meye Thompson, in the Old Testament, God {{is called}} [...] "Father" [...] {{with a unique}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity.</b> <b>In</b> {{addition}} to {{the sense in which}} God is [...] "Father" [...] to all men because he created the world (and in that sense [...] "fathered" [...] the world), the same God is also uniquely the law-giver to his chosen people. He maintains a special, covenantal father-child relationship with the people, giving them the Shabbat, stewardship of his prophecies, and a unique heritage in the things of God, calling Israel [...] "my son" [...] because he delivered the descendants of Jacob out of slavery in Egypt [...] according to his covenants and oaths to their fathers, Avraham, Isaac and Yaacov. In the Hebrew Scriptures, in Isaiah 63:16 (JP) it reads: [...] "For You are our father, for Abraham did not know us, neither did Israel recognize us; You, O Lord, are our father; our redeemer of old is your name." [...] To God, according to Judaism, is attributed the fatherly role of protector. He is titled the Father of the poor, of the orphan and the widow, their guarantor of justice. He is also titled the Father of the king, as the teacher and helper over the judge of Israel. According to Alon Goshen-Gottstein, in the Old Testament [...] "Father" [...] is generally a metaphor; it is not a proper name for God but rather one of many titles by which Jews speak of and to God. In Christianity fatherhood is taken in a more literal and substantive sense, and is explicit about the need for the Son as a means of accessing the Father, making for a more metaphysical rather than metaphorical interpretation.|$|E
50|$|Jauss {{describes}} the reader as a functioning participant of the 'triangle' of text, writer and audience {{and that it}} is only the 'communication' between reader and text that will result in a shifting horizon of expectation. Interaction with a text can be emotive for the reader as their acquaintance with familiar features of genre can produce expectations for the 'middle and end' after the 'beginning' has provoked such anticipation. The horizon of expectations and rubrics invoked for a reader from previous texts will be aroused by a new text and are adjusted, transformed or merely replicated depending on the boundaries of the genre. A 'horizon of change' occurs when a reader's interaction with a new text results in invalidation of a 'familiar experience' or provides a new encounter. The 'distance' between the horizon of expectation and the horizon of change is called the 'aesthetic distance'. A text of which no horizon of change occurs fulfills all of the expectations of the reader and can be considered 'light reading'. These interactions satisfy the reader's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>in</b> the way of 'beauty', romanticism and the expected happy ending. If a composition challenges a reader's expectation, it can do so either with a positive result {{in the way of a}} new perception, or a negative one as in an unpleasant new experience. These expectations however may dissolve, or a negative aspect of a new text may become explicit, and thus form its own familiar expectation and become 'part of the horizon of future aesthetic experience'. Texts which are not aimed at a particular readership but which still penetrate 'the familiar horizon of expectations' so that those readers acquire them to the point that they become largely conventional, can result in other formerly celebrated texts judged as passe and thus completely disregarded. Liggins and Maunder (2004) use the example of the decline in regard toward the work of female Victorian writers by the start of the twentieth century by critics and audiences alike as a change in the expectation of both of these audiences occurred.|$|E

30|$|Talking avatars, {{with their}} {{capability}} of infusing social cues in e-commerce sites, {{have been shown}} to enhance website trusts in online shoppers [4 – 6]. From a theoretical perspective, the facilitating effects of conversational avatars on trust can be attributed to two reasons. First, it is instructive to note that trust is built upon familiarity [36]. The rich amalgam of verbal and nonverbal signals by avatars can produce a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>in</b> users, who are generally accustomed to sensory experiences acquired in conventional physical stores (e.g., interaction with sales advocates). In this regard, the social presence simulated by talking avatars meet the expectations of consumers to encounter “familiar human elements” when shopping online. Second, social cues such as body gestures, eye contact, facial expressions, and voice tones are crucial factors in trust formation. Resonating with this notion, the visual and auditory aspects of talking avatars can serve as “assurance” signals to users. In order to reduce social uncertainty in a new environment, people naturally seek peripheral cues that add to their sense of familiarity. Similarly, when consumers visit an online store, their first objective is to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity by searching for any peripheral cues. Social cues afforded by conversational avatars allow consumers to form social and psychological impressions of the technologically-mediated agent, thus reducing the perceived ambiguity regarding the intentions and expected behaviours of the medium and the e-tailer. With the reduction in uncertainty and ambiguity related to websites and vendors, trust is facilitated.|$|E
40|$|Ageing-in-place {{policies}} have been implemented by many Western governments in order to delay and decrease older adults’ reliance on expensive institutionalised care. Such policies stimulate older adults to remain {{in their own homes}} and neighbourhoods {{for as long as possible}} and stress that this is in their own best interests as they can then age in a familiar, predictable and supportive environment. This thesis shows, by highlighting its subjective dimensions, that the realities of ageing in place are not as straightforward as these policies suggest. Here, older adults’ experiences of everyday life in urban neighbourhoods take centre stage. These experiences are addressed in four themes: neighbourhood renewal; the meaning of local social contacts; everyday practices of ageing in the neighbourhood (including walking); and the daily rhythms of ageing. Through these themes, the social, physical and temporal obstacles to and opportunities for local social interactions and support are addressed. Such aspects can pose challenges to retaining a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>in</b> a changing environment that increasingly involves community care and challenges older adults’ social integration. Further, the subjective dimensions of walking, which are important in shaping the walkability of urban neighbourhoods for older adults, are considered. Overall, this thesis highlights how feelings of belonging, exclusion and wellbeing come into being in later life in the context of a neighbourhood. The insights into the realities of ageing-in-place that this thesis offers are relevant to public policy and planning practice in realising age-friendly neighbourhoods...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This {{qualitative}} study examines the unique challenges of multilingual students (referred {{to in the}} study as "L 2 students") in a first-year writing class at a large public U. S. university. Following a case-study approach, the experiences of three L 2 students, three native English-speaking students (referred to in the study as "L 1 students"), and their instructor, {{all in the same}} first-year writing class, were observed. Data for the study consisted of classroom observations, multiple interviews with each participant, and student writing samples that were collected throughout the quarter. These data were then analyzed through a grounded theory approach using the computer software program ATLAS. ti, and the student writing samples were examined through the scope of intertextual analysis. Analysis of the data revealed that the L 2 and the L 1 students were surprisingly similar in their initial approach to the class: Students in both groups were clear in their early interviews that they had enrolled in the class only because it was a requirement, and they did not think the class would be relevant to their academic goals and interests. However, in the process of actually taking the class, the L 1 students viewed it as familiar and predictable, while the L 2 students expressed feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. For the group of L 2 students, these feelings of uncertainty and anxiety prompted them to actively participate in the class, while the L 1 students, in relying on a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>in</b> the class, were content in only minimally participating in the class. Despite this emergent difference between the L 2 and the L 1 students, both groups of students found institutional success in the course in that each participant earned an above-passing grade and the subsequent core credit. At the same time, only the L 2 students expressed an actual sense of learning in taking the class, indicating a significant change from their initial thinking that the class was irrelevant to a new belief that the class had in fact contributed to perceptible, relevant academic literacy development...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to document, through {{observation}} and research, architectural elements of a culture that {{have contributed to the}} development of another. As such it represents a way of thinking about the impact of architecture on culture and of culture on architecture. The len~ for this focus is the contributions of African people brought to the Caribbean during the European Slave Trade (1520 's [...] 1860 's). As it essentially was a world region where the influence of indigenous people was negligible due to their early demise and general lack of an extensively developed architecture, it may almost be regarded as a 'clean slate' upon which the Europeans and Africans devised an architecture based on climate, materials, and tradition modified by colonization/enslavement. As climate and materials were generally similar to those found in Africa, tradition may be considered {{the most important aspect of}} this process and is the basis for this thesis and for the exploration of the following questions: What did Africans do to contribute to the architecture of the Caribbean; how did they say, "We are here?" What may have been present in the physical landscape, built and natural, that gave Africans brought to the New World any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> place <b>in</b> an otherwise alien environment? What are some of their contributions that have survived, either through transferal or transformation, physically tangible or attitudinal, that are present in the Caribbean today?

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{aspects of}} hunting in later medieval Ireland, with particular {{reference to the}} Anglo-Norman period, from 1169 to c. 1350. The focus is on deer hunting and on parks, in which fallow deer could be kept. To date no detailed study of hunting in high medieval Ireland has been carried out, {{and as a result}} the study uses an interdisciplinary approach in order to maximise the scope of coverage. The aim of this thesis is to understand how parks and deer hunting were used to create and maintain identities, and how these functioned as a form of social and cultural expression in high medieval Ireland. Deer hunting was central to elite society, having symbolic significance, as well as developing military skills and forging social bonds. Fallow deer were unusual, but not rare in later medieval Ireland. They were limited to the east of the country and to the highest tier of Anglo-Norman lordly society, being relatively common finds from castle excavations. Notably, the evidence suggests that the bones of all species of wild mammals are much less frequently found on Irish castle sites than on English elite sites. The study identifies thirty-nine documented high medieval parks, and includes detailed examination of five of these. All thirty-nine were in Anglo-Norman areas, with no high medieval parks found in Gaelic Ireland. Today, the parks have been forgotten, however survey has shown that physical features do survive at the sites of many of those surveyed. Parks were integral to Anglo-Norman identity, being used to create a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and <b>familiarity</b> <b>in</b> a foreign land. Unlike England, however, they did not become widespread, and few were stocked with deer. 2018 - 05 - 1...|$|R

Many of them, being strangers among strangers, were interested in finding an Orthodox church. From the beginning, they found refuge and support in the arms of the Korean Orthodox Church. The then Bishop of Zela Soterios embraced them all with his love and paternal affection and slowly created the first nucleus of Slavic-speaking Orthodox faithful. He himself learned how to celebrate the Divine Liturgy in Slavonic and since 1992 in Seoul (in the chapel of the Dormition) or at the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Kapeong, where the pilgrims spent many weekend, he celebrated the Divine Liturgy for them. He also held special services for Slavophones on Christmas Day and other Feast days with the old Calendar in order to give them a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> and belonging. <b>In</b> 1995, during his historic first official visit to Korea, His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew laid the foundation stone of the chapel of Saint Maximus the Greek. Since then all Slavophones attend the prayer services and the Divine Liturgy at this chapel in their own language. In 1998, Bishop Soterios of Zela made a special request to the Patriarchate of Moscowthrough the Ecumenical Patriarchate. He asked for a Russian Priest to be sent to Korea in order to undertake the pastoral care of Russians and other Slavic-speaking believers.59 The Ecumenical Patriarchate approved the request. On this application, his Grace Soterios {{made it clear that the}} priest would belong to the Korean Church, from which he would receive his salary, and that he would be under the jurisdiction of and would commemorate the name of the local Bishop.60 The Patriarchate of Moscow did not respond to the requests immediately. Two years went by and finally in 2000 the Russian-Korean Priest-monk Theophane Kim was sent by the Patriarchate of Moscow.

Conclusions : Evidence from neuro- and cognitive psychology indicates that elders with dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) have impaired explicit memory but preserved implicit memory.
