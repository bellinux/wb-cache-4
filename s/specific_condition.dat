The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 {{medicinal plant}}s are used across the world. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew more conservatively estimated in 2016 that 17,810 plant species have a medicinal use, out of some 30,000 plants for which a use of any kind is documented.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, scepticism {{about food}} {{intolerance}} as a <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> influenced doctors' (GPs') perceptions {{of patients and}} of the patients' underlying problems. However, rather than risk damaging the doctor-patient relationship, GPs chose - despite their scepticism and guided by an element of awareness {{of the limitations of}} modern medicine - to negotiate mutually acceptable ground with patients and with patients' beliefs. As a result, whether due to a placebo effect, a secondary benefit, or a biophysical result of excluding a food from the diet, the GPs acknowledge both personal and therapeutic benefits.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, Sir William J. Gage (owner of Gage Publishing, a {{publishing}} house specializing in school text books) purchased a 3.25 acres (1.3 hectares) {{part of the}} gardens and lawns of the Alder Lea estate (now called Alderlea) that had been built on Main Street by Kenneth Chisolm in 1867 to 1870. (Chisholm, a merchant and founding father of Brampton, had been the Town reeve, then warden of Peel County, then MPP for Brampton and eventually, Registrar of Peel County.) Sir William donated 1.7 acres (0.7 hectares) of the property to the town, with a <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> that it {{be made into a}} park. Citizens donated $1,054 and the town used the funds to purchase extra land to ensure a larger park.|$|E
25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests, but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends to step on the brake during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on the gas pedal instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of rudder system failure.|$|E

500|$|Southard {{experienced}} chronic {{headaches and}} minor seizures (sometimes accompanied by partial vision loss for several hours), which he attributed to mental strain. A 1901 episode {{kept him in}} Boston City Hospital for a week, and Southard said {{he was diagnosed with}} [...] "acute brain tire". A similar event several years later was diagnosed as vascular neurosis. According to Gay, a physical examination several months before Southard's death may have indicated an endocrine gland problem, but no <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> was diagnosed.|$|E
500|$|In October Edward Ochab, the First Secretary of the Party and the Polish Prime Minister, {{proposed}} Władysław Gomułka {{election for}} the First Secretary of the Party during 8th Plenum meeting. Gomułka was a moderate {{who had been}} the First Secretary of the Party 1943-48 and had been ousted and [...] imprisoned in 1951 after [...] "right-wing nationalist deviation" [...] accusation by Stalinist hardliners' with Bierut. Gomułka proved to be acceptable to both factions of Polish communists: the reformers, who were arguing for liberalization of the system, and the hardliners, who realized that they needed to compromise. Gomułka insisted that he be given real power to implement reforms. One <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> he set was that Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, who had mobilized troops against the Poznań workers, be removed from the Polish Politburo and Defense Ministry, to which Ochab agreed. The majority of the Polish leadership, backed by both the army and the Internal Security Corps, brought Gomułka and several associates into the Politburo and designated Gomułka as First Secretary. Untouched by the scandals of Stalinism, Gomułka was acceptable to the Polish masses, but at first was viewed with much suspicion by Moscow.|$|E

2500|$|Terence Hines {{wrote in}} 2003 that the {{ganzfeld}} studies {{could not be}} said to provide evidence for psi as the alleged evidence disappears as the tightness of experimental controls is increased. As research progresses variables in science become clearer as more studies are published that describe under what <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> the particular effect can be demonstrated. This is in opposition to the ganzfeld studies. According to Hines, there was [...] "no clear way to obtain results showing any psychic phenomenon reliably" [...] and that [...] "the most reasonable conclusion" [...] was that the effect did not exist and had never existed.|$|E
2500|$|The Communications Act, 2003, {{which came}} into force on 25 July 2003, {{introduced}} a new industry regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), to replace the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel). It also {{introduced a new}} regulatory framework. The licensing regime {{was replaced by a}} general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement and, in some instances, specific conditions. [...] Under a <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> BT retained its universal service obligation (USO) for GB, excluding the Hull area. The USO included connecting consumers to the fixed telephone network, schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of call box services.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "sciatica" [...] {{describes}} a symptom—pain along the sciatic nerve pathway—rather than a <b>specific</b> <b>condition,</b> illness, or disease. Some {{use it to}} mean any pain starting in the lower back and going down the leg. Others use the term more specifically to mean a nerve dysfunction caused by compression {{of one or more}} lumbar or sacral nerve roots from a spinal disc herniation. though in this second use it is a diagnosis (i.e., it indicates a cause and effect). [...] Pain typically occurs in the distribution of a dermatome and goes below the knee to the foot. It may be associated with neurological dysfunction, such as weakness. The pain is characteristically of a shooting type, quickly traveling along the course of the nerve.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{difficult}} {{but not impossible}} to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture. Due to acupuncture's invasive nature, {{one of the major}} challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate placebo control group. For efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects, [...] "sham" [...] forms of acupuncture where the patient, practitioner, and analyst are blinded seem the most acceptable approach. [...] Sham acupuncture uses non-penetrating needles or needling at non-acupuncture points, e.g. inserting needles on meridians not related to the <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> being studied, or in places not associated with meridians. [...] The under-performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non-specific effects, or that the sham treatments are not inert, or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Reverse {{engineering}} {{of existing}} systems is expressly permitted under the Act under the <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> of a safe harbor, where circumvention {{is necessary to}} achieve interoperability with other software [...] See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201(f). Open-source software to decrypt content scrambled with the Content Scrambling System and other encryption techniques presents an intractable problem with {{the application of the}} Act. Much depends on the intent of the actor. If the decryption is done for the purpose of achieving interoperability of open source operating systems with proprietary operating systems, it would be protected by Section 1201(f) the Act.

However, dissemination of such software for the purpose of violating or encouraging others to violate copyrights has been held illegal. See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F.
