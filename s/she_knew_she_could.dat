60|$|Her painful hesitancy brought Frona to a {{realization}} {{of her own}} thoughtlessness. But she had made the step, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not retrace it.|$|E
6000|$|Slone had {{attacked}} Lucy in her one weak point. She felt a force rending her. She dared {{not look at}} Wildfire. Yes--all, that was true Slone had said. How desperately {{hard to think of}} forfeiting the great race <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> win! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{straightforward}} course had, nevertheless, so much {{to recommend}} it, so well avoided the disadvantage of future revelation which a private repetition of the ceremony would entail, that assuming she could depend upon Swithin, as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do, good sense counselled its serious consideration.|$|E
60|$|How {{long that}} first sleep lasted, <b>she</b> never <b>knew.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only remember, in the after-time, that she woke instantly.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Carbury {{was again}} in tears. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not hope to}} get a word of truth from her son. 'What {{do you mean by}} a large sum?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shut his}} eyes as if to forget the horrors of which he spoke. They were fresh and real to him. Frida {{did not like to}} {{question}} him further. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> to what he referred, and in a dim, vague way (for she was less wise than he, <b>she</b> <b>knew)</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> imagine why he found it all so terrible.|$|R
60|$|He {{moved about}} {{the room with a}} certain sureness of touch, swift and {{relentless}} and quiet. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not cope with him. He would escape like a weasel out of her hands. Yet without him her life would trail on lifeless. Brooding, she touched the flowers.|$|E
60|$|The DAY DREAM had set sail, and Marguerite Blakeney {{stood alone}} {{on the edge of}} the cliff over an hour, {{watching}} those white sails, which bore so swiftly away from her the only being who really cared for her, whom she dared to love, whom <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> trust.|$|E
60|$|She stood helplessly {{stranded}} on his world. He continued his work. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not help him. A little bit forlorn, {{at last she}} turned away, {{and ran down the}} garden, away from him, as fast as she could go away from him, to forget him and his work.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} have your sister do if a man came to her then, whom <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never marry? Would you have her submit to his embrace because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> him to be honest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I must go, Aunty! I must go!" [...] {{the girl}} cried feverishly. She was afraid Mrs. Cameron {{would try to}} prevent her going, {{and all at once}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear that.|$|R
60|$|She {{would not}} go back to her room just yet. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not rest. Though the room was empty there seemed {{something}} of him still in it, even in its cold and deserted aspect.|$|R
60|$|The {{beautiful}} {{lady with}} the silvery hair sat and gazed on him admiringly. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> trust him; {{she knew he}} would keep it in. But she knew at the same time how desperate a struggle the effort cost him; and visionary though he was, she loved and admired him for it.|$|E
60|$|She {{wished for}} some {{one to go}} to for advice. Mrs. Thayer, she knew, would exclaim in horror over the matter. The Major had hinted the course {{she would have to}} take, which was to show Arthur he had no {{connection}} with her life--if she could. But deep in her heart <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do that.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stelling {{liked her}} prattle immensely, {{and they were}} on the best of terms. She told Tom she should like to go to school to Mr. Stelling, as he did, and learn just the same things. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do Euclid, for she had looked into it again, and she saw what ABC meant--they were the names of the lines.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the only}} tune <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> but that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play with one finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} do agree {{about going to}} church," [...] said Dorothy. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have made no speech more stupid, more senseless, more inefficacious;--but what was she to say in answer to such an assurance? ...|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not like}} this, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have {{everything}} at once. [...] "You must know," [...] she said, [...] "that there is a bargain between me and Papa. I told him that I should tell you everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How thoughtless {{people are}} {{to put things}} where a hungry mouse cannot get at them," [...] said Mamma Mouse to herself, with a sigh. But just then she espied a barrel of flour {{standing}} upon the floor; and that gave her new courage, for <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> easily gnaw through that, and the flour would do to eat {{just as well as}} the bread.|$|E
6000|$|And {{when the}} trance was o'er, the maid [...] Paused awhile, and inly prayed: [...] Then falling at the Baron's feet, [...] 615 [...] "By my mother's soul, do I entreat [...] That thou this woman send away!" [...] She said: and more {{she could not}} say: [...] For what <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not tell, [...] O'er-mastered by the mighty spell. [...] 620 ...|$|E
6000|$|She liked him, too; he amused her and {{interested}} her. She admired his splendid flesh and his clear, laughing eyes. It seemed {{the easiest thing}} in the world--to an outsider. She felt that Isabel was working hard to have her see young Harvey at his best, and she felt, too, that Mrs. Harvey was taking unusual interest in her, and in her secret heart <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry into that fine family, but-- ...|$|E
50|$|Anita, {{a single}} woman, meets a man online thanks to {{encouragement}} from a friend. At first he treats {{her like a}} queen, they get married and then the craziness begins. When things change, Anita turns into a woman that <b>she</b> never <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> or would become.|$|R
50|$|Oshin finds {{a letter}} from Kayo among her belongings. Kayo <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> did not have long to live, but after meeting Oshin again, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> entrust Nozomi to Oshin's care. Oshin swears that from that day on, she will regard Nozomi as her own son.|$|R
60|$|And yet, {{what had}} <b>she</b> <b>known?</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not {{remember}} it any more. She pressed her eyeballs until they struck stars and suns into her darkness. She convinced {{herself that she}} was stirring among ashes. She desisted. She was astonished at her discovery. She did not love Ralph any more. She looked back dazed into the room, and her eyes rested upon the table with its lamp-lit papers. The steady radiance seemed for a second to have its counterpart within her; she shut her eyes; she opened them {{and looked at the}} lamp again; another love burnt in the place of the old one, or so, in a momentary glance of amazement, she guessed before the revelation was over and the old surroundings asserted themselves. She leant in silence against the mantelpiece.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the far end}} of the Row {{she cried}} out: [...] "Let's go on to Richmond now," [...] and trotted off into the road, as if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do with him what she wished. And, {{following}} meekly, he asked himself: Why? What was there in her to make up to him for all that he was losing--his power of work, his dignity, his self-respect? What was there? Just those eyes, and lips, and hair? ...|$|E
60|$|From their counsel, {{or their}} conversation, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> receive no assistance, their {{tenderness}} and sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, {{and her own}} good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh, {{it was possible for}} them to be.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How well I soon shall {{know them}} all,' said Albinia, {{looking at her}} husband, though <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not see his face, as he leant back silently in his corner, {{and she tried to}} say no more. She was sure that coming home was painful to him; he had been so willing to put it off, and to prolong those {{pleasant}} seaside days, when there had been such pleasant reading, walking, musing, {{and a great deal of}} happy silence.|$|E
6000|$|Laverick drank {{his wine}} slowly. The woman knew! Impossible! Her eyes were {{watching}} his face, {{but he held}} himself bravely. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> guess? ...|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Clifford sat on, on {{the sofa}} where Elma left her, and cried to herself silently, silently, silently. What a mother should do in these hateful {{circumstances}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly even guess. <b>She</b> only <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never speak it out, and even if she did, Elma would never have the courage or the heart to listen to her.|$|R
6000|$|Opening her eyes, she saw {{a sturdy}} tramp leaning over the low gate, so ragged, dusty, worn, and weary that she forgave the look of admiration in the bold black eyes which had been fixed on her longer than <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> Before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> answer, however, Aunt Liddy, a hospitable old soul, called out from within,-- ...|$|R
60|$|His evident {{agitation}} {{made her}} pause. They were alone, {{the outer office}} deserted, and the Ditmar she saw now, whom she had summoned up with ridiculous ease by virtue of that mysterious power within her, {{was no longer the}} agent of the Chippering Mill, a boy filled with enthusiasm by a business achievement, but a man, the incarnation and expression of masculine desire desire for her. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> compel him, if she chose, to throw caution to the winds.|$|E
60|$|She trembled, as {{she stood}} in her room, with {{excitement}} and awful exhilaration. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> outwit him. She could depend on her presence of mind, and on her wits. But it was a fight to the death, she knew it now. One slip, and she was lost. She had a strange, tense, exhilarated sickness in her body, as one who is in peril of falling from a great height, but who does not look down, does not admit the fear.|$|E
60|$|Lister was delirious, {{and for two}} {{or three}} days the doctors doubted his recovery. Then, one morning, they said his {{temperature}} had fallen and there was hope. Next morning they admitted that he was slowly making progress. Barbara did not leave the hotel, lest she miss the latest news from the sick-room. She was not allowed to go in, and when evening came <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not sleep. She had not slept much since they carried Lister up the steps.|$|E
60|$|In very fact, {{little as}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> it, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have defended herself better than by this humble question, {{throwing}} the whole guidance of her conduct upon her aunt. If {{she had been}} affronted, Mrs. Curtis could have been displeased; but to be thus set to prescribe the right conduct, was at once mollifying and perplexing.|$|R
40|$|Even angels have a {{hard time}} playing fair. The Little Angel of Fairness wants to treat all of her friends the same way, but {{sometimes}} it isn 2 ̆ 7 t easy. She 2 ̆ 7 s trying hard to earn her wings, and she really wants to get the best Angel assignments. But is it fair if her friends are sometimes left behind? Jessica knows {{what it feels like to}} be left behind. She wants to hang out with her older brother, Hank. But sometimes Hank wants to do things that are for 2 ̆ 2 boys only 2 ̆ 2 [...] like dressing up in a pirate costume for the big town parade. Jessica wants to dress up, too. And <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> come up with a great costume. Can the Little Angel of Fairness help her show Hank that girls are just as good as boys? Be fair...|$|R
60|$|Life {{and hope}} were ash in her mouth. She shuddered with discord. Despair grated between her teeth. This dreariness {{was worse than}} any her dreary, lonely life had <b>known.</b> <b>She</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear it no longer.|$|R
