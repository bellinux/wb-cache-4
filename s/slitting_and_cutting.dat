40|$|Coevolution is {{important}} for the maintenance of the interaction between a ligand and its receptor during evolution. The interaction between axon guidance molecule <b>Slit</b> <b>and</b> its receptor Robo is critical for the axon repulsion in neural tissues, which is evolutionarily conserved from planarians to humans. However, the mechanism of coevolution between <b>Slit</b> <b>and</b> Robo remains unclear. In this study, we found that coordinated amino acid changes took place at interacting sites of <b>Slit</b> <b>and</b> Robo by comparing the amino acids at these sites among different organisms. In addition, the high level correlation between evolutionary rate of <b>Slit</b> <b>and</b> Robo was identified in vertebrates. Furthermore, the sites under positive selection of <b>slit</b> <b>and</b> robo were detected in the same lineage such as mosquito and teleost. Overall, our results provide evidence for the coevolution between <b>Slit</b> <b>and</b> Robo...|$|R
