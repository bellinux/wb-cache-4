60|$|Nick {{regarded}} {{her for a}} moment, and then his face lighted up with that smile which won every one he met, which inevitably made them <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> at him.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} not to <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> as he nibbled the crisp Mexican cake and drank the old mission wine. And Susy's tongue trilled an accompaniment to his thanks.|$|E
50|$|Lisa Westberg Peters, October <b>Smiled</b> <b>Back,</b> 1996.|$|R
60|$|I <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> at her. It was {{impossible}} to take her seriously.|$|R
60|$|The judges <b>smiled</b> <b>back,</b> and the Colonel led {{us out of}} the building.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not entirely, I think. Some {{faces are}} so true {{an index of}} {{character}} that one cannot be mistaken. If you doubt this look down into the river, and such an one will inevitably <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> at you." ...|$|E
60|$|We had all {{moved out}} into the moonlight, and there was Champion Harrison with a big bundle on his arm,--and such a look of amazement upon his face as would have brought a <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> on to mine had my heart not still been cramped with fear.|$|E
60|$|Whatever devastating happenings {{had been}} going on in his home, it was plain a moment later that Gerald had managed to survive them: for there came the sound of a {{dragging}} footstep, and the door opened. Gerald stood on the threshold, the weak <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> on his face.|$|E
60|$|He {{patted her}} hand. She {{looked at him}} pathetically and he <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> again.|$|R
60|$|He <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> at her. The reawakening of {{her sense}} of humour was something.|$|R
60|$|Barney Custer {{smiled up}} at her in encouragement, and the girl <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I gave ’er a smile—I {{thought she}} {{deserved}} it—but she didn’t <b>smile</b> <b>back.</b> She was rather a nice-looking {{woman in the}} ordinary way, but I could easy see ’ow temper spoils a woman’s looks. She stood there giving little shivers and looking {{as if she wanted}} to bite somebody.|$|E
60|$|He {{had taken}} {{it out of his}} pocket, and he held it, smiling fondly upon it. Alice seemed to <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> at him. He had lost her in the {{reluctance}} of his father and sisters; and now his mother--it was his mother who had given her to him again. He thought how tenderly he loved his mother.|$|E
60|$|I bit my lip, {{and tried}} to <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> again. Absurd that a man should be made miserable about such a trifle; and yet I will freely confess that at that moment, {{in spite of my}} uncle's twelve hundred a year, I felt utterly wretched. I bowed to pretty little Ruby as well as I was able, and took a couple more turns by myself hurriedly around the terrace.|$|E
60|$|He {{smiled and}} left his {{sentence}} unfinished, and she <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> at him to show she understood.|$|R

[...] Lady Surrey gave a little short breath, brought back her eyes from dreamland, and turned with a sudden <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> to the portfolio. For the rest of the evening, the candid historian must admit that they both felt like a pair of fools. Conversation lagged, and I don't think either of them was sorry when the time came for retiring.|$|E
60|$|When Aunt Olivia {{came out}} to go home the Story Girl asked her {{permission}} to stay all night with Felicity and Cecily. Aunt Olivia assented lightly, swinging her hat on her arm and including us all in a friendly smile. She looked very pretty, with her big blue eyes and warm-hued golden hair. We loved Aunt Olivia; but just now we resented her having laughed at us with Aunt Janet, and we refused to <b>smile</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What is not {{generally}} understood {{is that this}} whole industrial matter isn't a question of economics. It's essentially and {{only a matter of}} Love, and of the practical application of the Christian religion! Imagine a factory--instead of committees of workmen alienating the boss, the boss goes among them smiling, and they <b>smile</b> <b>back,</b> the elder brother and the younger. Brothers, that's what they must be, loving brothers, and then strikes would be as inconceivable as hatred in the home!" ...|$|E
60|$|And she had <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> at him bravely. Such was {{the first}} {{acknowledgment}} between them that the world existed.|$|R

60|$|Amos Green {{hesitated a}} little, and then mounting, he soon overtook his companion. The latter, however, {{was still in}} no very sweet temper, and rode with a rigid neck, without a glance or a word for his comrade. Suddenly his eyes caught {{something}} in the gloom which brought a <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> to his face. Away in front of them, between two dark tree clumps, lay {{a vast number of}} shimmering, glittering yellow points, as thick as flowers in a garden. They were the lights of Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{this will}} trouble {{you for a}} little while," [...] the Doctor said. [...] "When I came to the University the first time I seemed like a cat in a bath tub. I thought {{everybody}} was laughing at me, but, {{as a matter of}} fact, nobody paid any attention to me at all. Then I got mad, and I said, 'Well, I'll make you pay attention to me before I'm done.'" [...] The Doctor smiled at her and she had the courage to <b>smile</b> <b>back.</b> It was wonderful how well he understood her.|$|E
60|$|We {{never saw}} that boy ag'in. He never turned up for 'is box, and 'e didn't {{show up to}} draw 'is pay. Everybody else was there, of course, and arter I'd got mine and come outside I see pore Bill with 'is back up ag'in a wall, staring 'ard at the second mate, who was looking at 'im with a kind smile, and asking 'im 'ow he'd slept. The last thing I saw of Bill, the pore chap 'ad got 'is 'ands in 'is {{trousers}} pockets, and was trying 'is hardest to <b>smile</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'Sing, Tessa; sing! Quick! quick!' cried Tommo, twanging {{away with}} all his might, and showing his white teeth, as he <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> at the little gentle-folk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You'll be all right, Joyce,' he said, smiling to {{the child}} and pushing the blonde hair off her brow. She <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> winsomely into his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I ken it wasna for me you did it,' she said, 'but for him; but, oh, Mr. Whamond, {{will that}} make me think the less o' you? He's my all,' she says, wi' that <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> in her face, and a look mixed up wi't that said as plain, 'and I need no more.' I thocht o' saying that some builds their house upon the sand, but--dagont, dominie, it's a solemn thing the pride mithers has in their laddies. I mind aince my ain mither--what the devil are you glowering at, Andrew Luke? Do you think I'm greeting? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’d {{often took}} a bit o’ notice o’ the gal; just giving ’er a kind smile {{now and then}} as she sat on deck, and sometimes—when ’er father wasn’t looking—she’d <b>smile</b> <b>back.</b> Once, when ’e was down below, she laughed right out. She was afraid of ’im, and by and by I noticed that she daren’t even get off the ship and {{walk up and down}} the wharf without asking ’im. When she went out ’e was with ’er, and, from one or two nasty little snacks I ’appened to overhear when the skipper thought I was too far away, I began to see that {{something}} was up.|$|E
60|$|After {{that day}} it was all up with Bob, for I told my neighbors Joe's story, and we kept him {{trotting}} busily, adding little gifts, and taking the sort of interest in him that comforted the lonely fellow, and made him feel {{that he had not}} outlived his usefulness. I never looked out when he was at his post that he did not <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> at me; I never passed him in the street that the red cap was not touched with a military flourish; and, when any of us beckoned to him, no twinge of rheumatism was too sharp to keep him from hurrying to do our errands, as if he had Mercury's winged feet.|$|E
60|$|But {{sometimes}} the grey eyes would open and smile with delicate winsomeness at Alvina, and Alvina <b>smiled</b> <b>back,</b> with a cheery, answering winsomeness. But that costs something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, isn't it? And {{so early}} in the voyage, too." [...] She looked at me, and when I could not forbear a smile of {{appreciation}} she <b>smiled</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I am much {{obliged to}} {{you for what you}} did," [...] {{answered}} Dave, <b>smiling</b> <b>back.</b> [...] "A fellow is at a disadvantage when he can't speak the language." ...|$|R
