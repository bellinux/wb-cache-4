Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, <b>speckled</b> <b>alder,</b> spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by <b>speckled</b> <b>alder.</b> It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E

25|$|In {{the eastern}} US, the gypsy moth prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, <b>speckled</b> <b>alder,</b> basswood, gray birch, paper birch, poplar, willow, and hawthorns, among other species. Older larvae feed on {{several species of}} {{softwood}} that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and pine and spruce species native to the east. The gypsy moth avoids ash trees, tulip-tree, American sycamore, butternut, black walnut, catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, cedar, American holly, and mountain laurel and rhododendron shrubs, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high.|$|E
500|$|A diverse {{number of}} plant species {{reside in the}} {{watershed}} as well. Red, white, and black spruce, red maple, white birch, and trembling aspen are the most common. Jack pine is commonly found in regions that fires have repeatedly ravished, while cedar is found in bogs and areas where gypsum and limestone are present. Higher altitude slopes and ridgetops house sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch trees. Zelazny et al. note that [...] " [...] high frequency of disturbed sites dominated by aspen stands reveals the degree of historical and recent human disturbance along the Petitcodiac River."

50|$|These spruce-edged {{sphagnum}} bogs {{are found}} in the upper sections of Red Creek and its tributaries, often in association with thickets of <b>speckled</b> <b>alder.</b> There are similar areas throughout the High Alleghenies, most famously the Cranberry Glades. The largest one at Dolly Sods is about a mile long and half a mile wide. The thick carpet of sphagnum moss and the polytrichum moss hummocks also sustain cotton grass, round leaf sundew and the lichen known as reindeer moss. In addition to the spruce, the bog margins are frequented by ferns, sedges and the occasional balsam fir. The three-toothed cinquefoil (Sibbaldiopsis tridentata) is often abundant and orchids — for example the pink lady's slipper — are sometimes seen.|$|E
50|$|Tamarack stands cast light {{shade and}} so {{usually have a}} dense {{undergrowth}} of shrubs and herbs.
