500|$|Homer {{attempts}} to appease Grimes by inviting {{him to his}} home for a lobster dinner {{in order to make}} him and his enemy co-worker friends. Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments (such as being friends with former president Gerald Ford, going on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, going into space, and winning a Grammy) despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes has to live a life of hard work and all he has to show for it is a battered briefcase, a bad haircut, and a single room apartment between two bowling alleys. Declaring Homer a [...] "fraud", a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, makes further {{attempts to}} earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy dream house, and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need <b>safety</b> <b>gloves</b> because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral (with a headstone that simply reads [...] "Grimes"), Homer unintentionally and unknowingly gets the last laugh as he falls asleep and in a drowsy state tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing all the attendees to burst into laughter and completely ignore Grimes' coffin as it's lowered into the earth.|$|E

50|$|Lantz’s {{contribution}} to the Reddy Kilowatt story is considerable. Prior to 1946, Reddy Kilowatt was usually portrayed as a lanky and sometimes awkward-looking creature. Lantz’s animators refined Reddy’s look to make his body shorter and more proportional. Reddy’s wide-cuffed (and five-fingered) <b>safety</b> <b>gloves</b> were replaced with four-fingered white gloves of the type traditionally worn by Mickey Mouse and other popular cartoon creatures. Most important, the Lantz artists broadened Reddy’s grin and added whites to his eyes, instantly increasing his range of expression.|$|E

50|$|The {{toxicological}} {{properties of}} Gallium (III) telluride {{have not been}} thoroughly investigated. However elemental tellurium has relatively low toxicity. It is converted in the body to dimethyl telluride which imparts a garlic-like odor to the breath and sweat.

Proper precautions should be taken when handling this compound, including lab goggles and <b>safety</b> <b>gloves.</b> This compound should be handled in a well ventilated area.|$|E

50|$|In 1911, {{the rights}} of the timber lease were {{transferred}} from the Gordon brothers to the Dryden Timber and Power Company because the building they were constructing burned down in 1910, and they did not have means to complete their project.

Power chain saws, safety pants and <b>safety</b> <b>gloves</b> were introduced with the ownership of Dryden Paper Company in the early 1960s, resulting in a tremendous increase in productivity for the loggers.|$|E

5000|$|There are 2 {{common types}} of <b>safety</b> <b>gloves</b> that {{are widely used}} in high school or {{university}} laboratory, Latex and Nitrile gloves. Latex gloves have a high sensitivity {{when it comes to}} contact and fine control which is very suitable for surgery. On the other hands, Nitrile gloves are the gloves that do not have latex protein which cost twice. It was known as the most durable, resisted to tear and many chemicals. Beside all the benefits, Nitrile gloves also have drawbacks since it can oxidize silver and high reactive metals as these metals can react with sulfur. Therefore, wearer should have an extra care while wearing this type of protective gloves.|$|E
50|$|Wetterhahn's death shocked {{not only}} the entire {{chemistry}} department at Dartmouth, but also regulatory agencies, as the accidental exposure occurred despite her having taken all required measures known at that time. These included the use of latex gloves, a fume hood, and adherence to standard safety procedures. After Wetterhahn's mercury poisoning was discovered, her colleagues tested various <b>safety</b> <b>gloves</b> against dimethylmercury {{and found that the}} small, apolar molecule diffuses through most of them in seconds, much more quickly than expected. As a result, it is now recommended to wear highly resistant, flexible, plastic-laminate gloves when handling dimethylmercury and other similarly dangerous substances. For increased protection, such thin gloves can be worn under long-cuffed, heavy-duty outer gloves made of, for example, neoprene.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} lab-scale {{procedure}} to recycle lithium ion batteries, which can be scaled up to an industrial process in the future. SUBJECTS: The batteries utilized for this project were from A 123 Systems and contained a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) cathode active material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The process developed included dismantling a battery cell inside a <b>safety</b> <b>glove</b> box with fume hood, using an acid leaching method for both the anode (sulfuric acid for copper) and cathode (nitric acid for aluminum) separation process. ANALYSES: The optimum recycling procedure was identified as allowing for the successful dismantling of an A 123 cylindrical LiFePO 4 cell and complete separation of the coatings from the anode (copper) and cathode (aluminum) foils by utilizing the least amount of leaching agent, at the lowest temperature, and under the shortest time period. RESULTS: Full separation of the graphite coating from the anode’s copper foil was achieved by using 0. 5 mol/L of H 2 SO 4 (sulfuric acid) at 40 °C for 2 min. Full separation of the LiFePO 4 from the cathode’s aluminum foil was achieved by using 0. 5 mol/L of HNO 3 (nitric acid) at 50 °C for 2 min. Alternative material separation methods have also been explored, but the optimal results were obtained from the acid leaching method. Conclusions: This project determined the first step of the LiFePO 4 battery recycle process {{and will continue to be}} studied for development of a commercial recycling process...|$|R

50|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment (PPE) must be worn on the worker's {{body and}} is the least desirable option for controlling hazards. It is used when other controls are not effective, have not been evaluated, or while doing maintenance or in emergency situations such as spill response. PPE normally used for typical chemicals are also appropriate for nanomaterials, including wearing long pants, long-sleeve shirts, and closed-toed shoes, {{and the use of}} <b>safety</b> <b>gloves,</b> goggles, and impervious laboratory coats. Nitrile gloves are preferred because latex gloves do not provide protection from most chemical solvents and may present an allergy hazard. Face shields are not an acceptable replacement for goggles because they do not protect against unbound dry materials. Woven cotton lab coats are not recommended for nanomaterials, as they can become contaminated with nanomaterials and release them later. PPE should be donned and removed in a changing room to prevent contamination of outside areas.|$|E

Thus, protective equipment, like rubber <b>gloves,</b> <b>safety</b> clothing and eye protection, should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.|$|R
