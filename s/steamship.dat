5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts {{and other}} early {{automobiles}} increasingly {{took to the}} roads in the 1920s, inland <b>steamship</b> lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats. By the Depression-ravaged 1930s, however, the Old Bay Line {{became one of the}} first inland <b>steamship</b> companies to promote the carriage of automobiles as a means of filling its ships' empty cargo holds. The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. <b>steamship</b> lines in the 1930s, as historic companies such as the Fall River Line ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the U.S. at its demise in 1932.|$|E

5|$|By October 1938, {{the ship}} had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic <b>Steamship</b> Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman <b>Steamship</b> Company.

5|$|In 1839 Samuel Cunard, a Prince Edward Island shipowner, {{was awarded}} the first British transatlantic <b>steamship</b> mail contract, {{and the next year}} formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company {{together}} with Robert Napier, the famous Scottish <b>steamship</b> engine designer and builder, to operate the line's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool–Halifax–Boston route. For most of the next 30 years, Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage. However, in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals, the White Star Line and the Inman Line. To meet this competition, in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard <b>Steamship</b> Company, Ltd, to raise capital.|$|E

5|$|On June 14, 1941, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company's owner, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with a consortium of railroads and <b>steamship</b> companies to merge the Chesapeake <b>Steamship</b> Company into the Old Bay Line. The railroad group, consisting of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Southern Railway, and the SAL, together controlled the Baltimore Steam Packet Company and the Chesapeake <b>Steamship</b> Company. As a result, the Old Bay Line took over the Chesapeake Line's business and assets and became the sole operator of passenger and freight <b>steamship</b> transportation between the important ports of Baltimore and Norfolk. As part of this agreement, half of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was assigned to Chesapeake <b>Steamship</b> Company, which was one-third owned by Southern Railway and two-thirds owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. With the amalgamation, two of the Chesapeake Line's steamboats, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond, were transferred to the Old Bay Line.

The company began overnight paddlewheel <b>steamship</b> passenger and freight service daily except Sundays between Baltimore and Norfolk. By 1848, the company's <b>steamship</b> Herald was making the trip in less than 12hours, a time which the line would maintain until the end in 1962.

Remembering his earlier struggles riding Pennsylvania rail cars, he endeavored to assert his right to ride in otherwise white rail cars in the south as well.|$|R
50|$|Steam-powered vessels include steamboats and <b>steamships.</b> Smaller steamboats were {{developed}} first. They {{were replaced by}} larger <b>steamships</b> which were often ocean-going. <b>Steamships</b> required a change in propulsion technology from sail to paddlewheel to screw to steam turbines. The latter innovation changed the design of vessels to one that could move faster through the water. Engine propulsion changed to Steam turbine in the early 20th century. In {{the latter part of}} the 20th century, these, in turn, were replaced by gas turbines.|$|R

While Cunard did not then own a <b>steamship,</b> he had been an investor in an earlier <b>steamship</b> venture, Royal William, and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia. Cunard's major backer was Robert Napier whose Robert Napier and Sons was the Royal Navy's supplier of steam engines.
