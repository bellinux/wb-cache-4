5|$|Despite the Holderness scheme, {{there were}} still {{problems}} near Leven and Weel, and William Jessop spent a month inspecting the area before writing a report in July 1786. His plan advocated separating the water which fell on the uplands {{to the north and}} flowed through the low-lying areas, from the local drainage of those low-lying areas. George Plummer carried out most of the <b>subsequent</b> <b>survey</b> work on Jessop's behalf, although Jessop surveyed the River Hull in 1787, to identify how the outfall could be improved. Jessop visited the works from time to time, making seven visits between 1789 and 1792, while the day to day oversight of the scheme was handled by Plummer as resident engineer. Plummer was succeeded by Anthony Bower, who was engineer from 1792 to 1795, and the whole scheme was completed in 1805, having cost £16,000.|$|E

A <b>subsequent</b> <b>survey</b> done in 1753 by David Schultz for a road from Easton to Reading, of which present-day Union and Jackson streets were links, shows {{the location of}} a log house owned by Allen, situated near the western bank of Jordan Creek, which was believed to have been built around 1740. Used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge, here Allen entertained prominent guests including his brother-in-law, James Hamilton, and colonial Pennsylvania governor John Penn.|$|E

The entire island, only [...] in length, experienced typhoon force winds. Yap International Airport recorded a peak wind gust of 181km/h (112mph); a <b>subsequent</b> <b>survey</b> estimated wind gusts on the island reached 226km/h (140mph). Heavy rainfall occurred during Sudal's passage, including 20.0cm (7.88inches) in a 48‑hour period at the airport.

2500|$|In 1957, the country's first {{conservation}} law ensured {{the protection}} of rhinos and their habitat. In 1959, Edward Pritchard Gee undertook {{a survey of the}} Chitwan Valley, and recommended the creation of a protected area north of the Rapti River and of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of 10 years. After his <b>subsequent</b> <b>survey</b> of Chitwan in 1963, he recommended extension of the sanctuary to the south. By the end of the 1960s, only 95 rhinos remained in the Chitwan Valley. The dramatic decline of the rhino population and the extent of poaching prompted the government to institute the Gaida Gasti – a rhino reconnaissance patrol of 130 armed men and a network of guard posts all over Chitwan. To prevent the extinction of rhinos, the Chitwan National Park was gazetted in December 1970, with borders delineated the following year and established in 1973, initially encompassing an area of [...] Since 1973, the population has recovered well and increased to 645 animals in 2015. To ensure the survival of rhinos in case of epidemics, animals were translocated annually from Chitwan to the Bardia National Park and the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve since 1986.|$|E
2500|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, {{the town}} prospered from {{the growth of}} {{industry}} and this led to improvements {{in the quality of}} life for the residents. They were now able to experience new luxuries such as seafood. Products were 10% more expensive in Sutton Coldfield than in neighbouring towns and villages. The town also grew, due in part to the wealthy industrialists of Birmingham seeing Sutton Coldfield as a suitable location for their country houses, away from the pollution of the larger town. A survey of the parish in 1630 reported that there were 298 houses, and this number had increased to 310 when another survey was conducted in 1698. Of these houses would have been 20 High Street, which was built around 1675. A survey of the parish in 1721 noted that the number of houses in Sutton Coldfield had increased to 360. In 1636, King Charles I imposed the ship money tax of £80 on the town, compared to £100 for Birmingham and Warwick, £266 for Coventry, and £50 for Stafford, reflecting the wealth of the town at the time. In 1663, an Act was passed to order and collect [...] "Hearth Duty", which led to a <b>subsequent</b> <b>survey</b> of all houses in the country and the noting of all properties with hearths and stoves. The survey of Sutton Coldfield found that there were 67 hearths and stoves, of which 30 were attributed to two houses owned by the Willoughby family.|$|E

It was suffered to fade out of sight or be reckoned a venial matter, in the Honorable Judge Pyncheon's long <b>subsequent</b> <b>survey</b> of his own life.
