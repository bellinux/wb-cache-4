2500|$|Most {{adult stem}} cells are lineage-restricted (multipotent) and are {{generally}} referred to by their tissue origin (mesenchymal stem cell, adipose-derived stem cell, endothelial stem cell, dental pulp stem cell, etc.). [...] Muse cells (multi-lineage differentiating stress enduring cells) are a recently discovered pluripotent stem cell type found in multiple adult tissues, including adipose, dermal fibroblasts, and bone marrow. While rare, muse cells are identifiable by their expression of SSEA-3, a marker for undifferentiated stem cells, and general mesenchymal stem cells markers such as CD105.

40|$|The {{potential}} of cell suspension and ‘hairy root’ cultures of horseradish for production of peroxidase was assessed and the factors limiting production in culture were examined.

The growth and peroxidase activity of cell <b>suspension</b> <b>cultures</b> are limited by both phosphate and sucrose and the rate of oxygenation of the culture is critical for maximising growth rate, biomass accumulation and peroxidase activity.

The level of 3 SSO 4 * ~ incorporation into cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitable material by these cells depended upon the subsequent <b>culturing</b> con-ditions. <b>Suspension</b> <b>cultures</b> incorporated more "SOj'^/cell than monolayer cultures.
