25|$|A {{warm welcome}} back to {{those of you who}} made it, and a {{friendly}} word of warning, something you won't find in any guidebook.

Or you may find yourself a permanent resident... of the Twilight Zone.|$|E
25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> would be as sorry to see as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E

25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted {{to give them an}} ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don’t get reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Yiftach Klein {{was cast}} to act {{alongside}} her as Yochay Goldberg. Burshtein remarked that Klein [...] "is {{a big star}} in Israel, and has played a pimp, a homosexual, and a cop (among many other roles), so I was not <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> could really believe him as this Orthodox guy. But his audition, and then his chemistry with Hadas were just perfect".|$|E
500|$|Price was so infuriated by Stinson's {{negative}} {{review that}} {{he wrote a letter}} to the critic, saying, [...] "I find I must break a 25-year determination never to answer a critic. [...] Since your review of The Pit and the Pendulum was obviously not meant to be instructive, and therefore constructive, but only to hurt and humiliate, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> would enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that it did. My only consolation…is that it is the second-greatest box-office attraction in the country." ...|$|E

Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: [...] "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favourite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And… make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> get plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!" ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with XXL magazine, rapper Fat Joe claimed that he helped produce the track while working with producer Scott Storch. He stated: [...] "I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ... Scott called me like 50 times, 100 times: 'Yo, you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't want to use it? 50 Cent called me. 50 Cent want it.' I {{never had a problem}} with this dude. I was like, 'Go ahead.'"

500|$|... "I {{learn that}} the park {{commission}} are seriously thinking of a building at Minnehaha {{for the express purpose}} of taking photographs—on the site heretofore profaned by a shanty for that purpose. I cannot remain silent in view of this proposed vandalism which I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> cannot sanction—and which I am equally sure will forever be a stigma upon Minneapolis and elicit the anathema of every man of sense and taste who visits the place. If erected it will simply be pandering to the tastes of the army of boobies who think to boost themselves into notoriety by connecting their own stupid features with the representation of one of the most beautiful of God’s works.” ...|$|E
500|$|After {{nearly three}} hours of shouts from the angry crowd, {{officers}} moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car he shouted to a reporter [...] "Make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> put {{in the paper that}} I ate too many Twinkies." [...] Sixty officers were injured, and about two dozen arrests were made.|$|E
