50|$|The {{computer}} file hosts is an operating system file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is a plain text file. Originally a file named HOSTS.TXT was manually maintained and made available via file sharing by Stanford Research Institute for the ARPANET membership, containing the hostnames and address of hosts as contributed for inclusion by member organizations. The Domain Name System, first described in 1983 and implemented in 1984, automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname {{resolution in the}} rapidly growing network. In modern operating systems, the hosts file remains an alternative name resolution mechanism, configurable often as part of facilities such as the Name <b>Service</b> <b>Switch</b> as either the primary method or as a fallback method.|$|E
5000|$|Providers use SS7 {{to route}} calls {{throughout}} the US/Canada network. SS7 accesses databases for various {{services such as}} CNAM, LIDB, Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) and LNP. Calls to ported numbers are completed when a customer who calls a ported number sends the dialed number to a provider's SSP (<b>Service</b> <b>Switch</b> Point), where it is identified either as a local call or not. If the call is local, the switch has the NPA-NXX in its routing table as portable, so it sends a routing request to the Signal Transfer Point (STP) which accesses a local database that is updated by an LSMS (Local Service Management System) which holds all routing for all ported numbers to which the carrier is responsible for completing calls. If routing information is found, a response {{is sent to the}} [...] "query" [...] containing the information necessary to properly route the call. If it is not a local number, the call is passed on to the STP and routed until it gets to a local carrier who will perform the [...] "query" [...] mentioned earlier and route the call accordingly.|$|E

40|$|Marcel Neuts Prize 2003 International audienceThe {{infinite}} source Poisson {{model is}} a fluid queue approximation of network data transmission that assumes that sources begin constant rate transmissions of data at Poisson time points for random lengths of time. This model has been a popular one as analysts attempt to provide explanations for observed features in telecommunications data such as self-similarity, long range dependence and heavy tails. We survey some features of this model in cases where transmission length distributions have (a) tails so heavy that means are infinite, (b) heavy tails with finite mean and infinite variance and (c) finite variance. We survey the self-similarity properties of various descriptor processes in this model and then present analyses of four data sets which show that certain features of the model {{are consistent with the}} data while others are contradicted. The data sets are 1) the Boston University 1995 study of web sessions, 2) the UC Berkeley home IP HTTP data collected in November 1996, 3) traces collected in end of 1997 at a Customer <b>Service</b> <b>Switch</b> in Munich, and 4) detailed data from a corporate Ericsson WWW server from October 1998...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Modern {{smart meters}} {{commonly}} provide a <b>service</b> <b>switch</b> which allows remote connection or disconnection (RCD) of electrical service over a utility’s communication network. While this feature is valuable for utilities, researchers have {{raised concerns about}} possible (ab) use by malicious attackers, noting the high economic cost of blackouts, as well the potential for controlled on-off switching of meters to affect power grid stability, for example by disturbing its frequency. However, while security concerns have been identified, little {{work has been done}} to develop and assess concrete countermeasures that are specific to these attacks. In this paper, we design novel randomized time delay countermeasures for smart meter RCD attacks, and demonstrate their effectiveness under sophisticated attack scenarios. We show that even if an attacker successfully issues malicious RCD commands, a well-designed time delay countermeasure makes the smart grid more resilient by: 1) preventing rapid changes in overall system load; and 2) providing time for a utility to potentially detect and stop an attack in progress. In particular, we demonstrate that a geometric delay mechanism can greatly reduce the magnitude of an attack with little impact on a utility’s day-to-day operations. I...|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{was founded}} on a simple model in which the routers inside the network are {{responsible}} for forwarding packets from source to destination, and application programs run on the hosts connected {{to the edges of}} the network. However, the last few years have seen a blurring of the distinction between packet forwarding and application processing. In such a context we propose a new paradigm for modern networked services: the Service Switching. Composed by nodes capable to host services in addition to the traditional forwarding IP-based mechanism, the Service Switching infrastructure presents as its major feature the ability to implement a service migration mechanism among geographically distributed nodes, in order to make services seamlessly and transparently available to end-users regardless of their current location. A <b>Service</b> <b>Switch</b> can store and host different services and applications with their respective data providing a secure and differentiated execution environment, and it can coordinate its behavior with other Service Switches in order to develop and provide services in a distributed way, according to optimal resource utilization schemes. We propose an implementation of the Service Switching infrastructure based on virtualization mechanisms; such a technology allows to create isolated and self-contained virtual computing environments, completely independent from the underlying hardware...|$|E

40|$|The Multi-protocol Label Switching {{is one of}} the {{proposed}} technologies useful for traffic engineering in the specific aspects of measurement and control of Internet traffic and virtual Private network (VPN) is a concept that significant on the future of business communication, it replace existing private network with flexible architecture that is easily manage and at a same time it provide enhanced service. The Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) virtual Private network (VPN) is a popular IP VPN service based on RFC 2547 and its successor documents (dubbed 2547 bis). The main importance of MPLS is that it integrates the key features of both Layer 2 and Layer 3. Most importantly, it is not limited to any Layer 2 or Layer 3 protocol. In particular, MPLS has several applications and can be extended across multiple products segments (such as an MPLS router, an IP services switch/router, a multi <b>service</b> <b>switch,</b> an Optical Ethernet switch, as well as optical switches). Many service providers offer MPLS VPN to their large enterprise customers, who need only attach their local, customer edge (CE) site routers to the nearest service provider edge (PE) router and exchange routing information. MPLS reduces the complexity of forwarding using encapsulated fixedlength labels for making high speed forwarding decisions. The service provider distributes customer IP routing information to other customer sites and uses its backbone to forward customer IP packets from one customer site to another. This is done by very new concept which is called multicast virtual private networks (mVPNs) ...|$|E
40|$|The Grid is {{realizing the}} vision of {{providing}} computation as utility: computation jobs can be scheduled on-demand in Grid hosts based on available computation capacity. In this paper, we study another emerging usage of Grid utility: the hosting of application services. Different from a computation job, an application service such as e-Laboratory or on-line shopping has longer lifetime, and performs multiple jobs requested by its clients. A service Hosting Utility Platform (HUP) is formed {{by a set of}} servers in the Grid, and multiple application services will be hosted on the HUP. We present the design and implementation of SODA, a Service-On-Demand Architecture that enables on-demand creation of application services on a HUP. With SODA, an application service will be created {{in the form of a}} set of virtual service nodes; each node is a virtual machine which is physically a ‘slice ’ of a real host in the HUP. SODA involves both OS and middleware level techniques, and has the following salient capabilities: (1) on-demand service priming: the image of an application service as well as the OS on which it runs will be created on-demand and bootstrapped automatically; (2) better service isolation: services sharing the same HUP host are isolated with respect to administration, faults, attacks, and resources; (3) integrated service request management: for each service, a <b>service</b> <b>switch</b> will be created to direct client requests to appropriate virtual service nodes. Moreover, the application service provider can replace the default request switching policy with a service-specific policy. ...|$|E
