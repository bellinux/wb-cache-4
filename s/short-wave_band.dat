In this paper, effect of CdF 2 addition on thermal stability and upconversion luminescence properties in Tm 3 +-Yb 3 + codoped oxyfluoride silicate glasses have been systematically investigated. The experimental results indicate that, with the substitution CdF 2 for PbF 2, the glass thermal stability increases and the UV cutoff edge moves to <b>short-wave</b> <b>band</b> slightly. With increasing CdF 2 content, {{the blue and}} red upconversion luminescence intensity increases slightly at first, and then increases rapidly. While the near infrared (NIR) upconversion emission intensity increases notably {{at first and then}} increases slightly. However, the blue and NIR luminescence intensity are much stronger than that of red, indicating these oxyfluoride silicate glasses are more preferable for blue and NIR emissions than red emission. The possible upconversion mechanisms for the blue, red and NIR fluorescence are also estimated and evaluated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring of the earth’s surface {{by remote}} sensing in the <b>short-wave</b> <b>band</b> can provide quick {{identification}} of some characteristics of natural systems. This band range {{allows one to}} diagnose subsurface aspects of the earth, as the scattering parameter is affected by irregularities in the dielectric permittivity of subsurface structures.

The effect of SiO 2 addition on thermal stability, optical properties and structural characteristic on Bi 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 glass were systematically investigated by using XRD, DTA, ultraviolet-visible transmittance spectra, midinfrared transmittance spectra and Raman spectra. The experimental results demonstrate that, {{with the addition of}} SiO 2, thermal stability of glass samples has been obviously improved. Once the amount of SiO 2 is too much, the glass samples tend to be phase seperation which results in the decrease of thermal stability. With increasing SiO 2 content, the UV cutoff edge firstly shifts to <b>short-wave</b> <b>band</b> and then shifts to long-wave band, and the transmittance of mid-infrared has been greatly improved.

40|$|This work takes {{advantage}} of the stable distribution of deep convective cloud (DCC) reflectance measurements to assess the calibration stability and detector difference in Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflective bands. VIIRS Sensor Data Records (SDRs) from February 2012 to June 2015 are utilized to analyze the long-term trending, detector difference, and half angle mirror (HAM) side difference. VIIRS has two thermal emissive bands with coverage crossing 11 microns for DCC pixel identification. The comparison of the results of these two processing bands is one of the indicators of analysis reliability. The long-term stability analysis shows downward trends (up to approximately 0. 4 per year) for the visible and near-infrared bands and upward trends (up to 0. 5 per year) for the short- and mid-wave infrared bands. The detector difference for each band is calculated as the difference relative to the average reflectance overall detectors. Except for the slightly greater than 1 difference in the two bands at 1610 nm, the detector difference is less than 1 for other solar reflective bands. The detector differences show increasing trends for some <b>short-wave</b> <b>bands</b> with center wavelengths from 400 to 600 nm and remain unchanged for the bands with longer center wavelengths. The HAM side difference is insignificant and stable. Those <b>short-wave</b> <b>bands</b> from 400 to 600 nm also have relatively larger HAM side difference, up to 0. 25. Comparing the striped images from SDR and the smooth images after the correction validates the analyses of detector difference and HAM side difference.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} of small-scale internal wave packets with a large-scale internal solitary wave using high-resolution direct numerical simulations in two dimensions. A key finding is that for wave packets whose constituent waves are short {{in comparison to the}} solitary wave width, the interaction leads to an almost complete destruction of the short waves. For mode- 1 short waves in the packet, as the wavelength increases, a cutoff is reached, and for larger wavelengths the waves in the packet are able to maintain their structure after the interaction. This cutoff corresponds to the wavelength at which the phase speed of the short waves upstream of the solitary wave exceeds the maximum current induced by the solitary wave. For mode- 2 waves in the packet, however, no corresponding cutoff is found. Analysis based on linear theory suggests that the destruction of short waves occurs primarily due to the velocity shear induced by the solitary wave, which alters the vertical structure of the waves so that significant wave activity is found only above (below) the deformed pycnocline for overtaking (head-on) collisions. The deformation of vertical structure is more significant for waves with a smaller wavelength. Consequently, it is more difficult for these waves to adjust to the new solitary-wave-induced background environment. These results suggest that through the interaction with relatively smaller length scale waves, internal solitary waves can provide a means to decrease the power observed in the <b>short-wave</b> <b>band</b> in the coastal ocean...|$|E
40|$|Using the ISCCP–FD surface {{radiative}} flux {{data for}} the summer season (June to September) of the period 1992 to 1995, an analysis was done to understand the role of clouds on the surface radiation budget over the Asian monsoon region. At the top of atmosphere (TOA) of convective regions of the Asian monsoon region, the short wave radiative forcing (SWCRF) and long wave radiative forcing (LWCRF) do not cancel each other resulting in occurrence of the net cloud radiative forcing values exceeding − 30 W/m 2. This type of imbalance between SWCRF and LWCRF at TOA is reflected down on the earth surface–atmosphere system also as an imbalance between surface netcloud radiative forcing (NETCRF) and atmospheric NETCRF. Based on the regression analysis of the cloud effects on the surface radiation budget quantities, {{it has been observed}} that generally, the variance explained by multiple type cloud data is 50 % more than that of total cloud cover alone. In case of SWCRF, the total cloud cover can explain about 3 % (7 %) of the variance whereas the three cloud type descriptions of clouds can explain about 44 % (42 %) of the variance over oceanic (land) regions. This highlights the importance of cloud type information in explaining the variations of surface radiation budget. It has been observed that the clouds produce more cooling effect in <b>short-wave</b> <b>band</b> than the warming effect in long-wave band resulting in a net cooling at the surface. Over the oceanic region, variations in high cloud amount contribute more to variations in SWCRF while over land regions both middle and high cloud variations make substantial contributions to the variations in both SWCRF and NETCRF. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of dimensionality for the characteristics of simulations performed with cloud-system resolving models (CSRMs). In addition to intrinsic questions related to dimensionality in CSRMs, the issue has gained added interest since CSRMs can be utilized instead of conventional cloud parametrizations to represent deep convection within global climate models. Such CSRMs may be either two- or three-dimensional. CSRM simulations of five observed cases of deep convection are performed in both two and three dimensions (2 D and 3 D) {{with the aim of}} elucidating the impact of dimensionality on overall cloud statistics. Observed profiles of the large-scale average of advection of temperature and humidity are applied to initiate and maintain the convection. Two of the cases are from tropical oceanic regions. The other three cases are continental. The average ascent rate in deep convective, cloudy updraughts is about 20 - 50 % higher at mid-levels of the troposphere in 3 D than in 2 D, for all cases. This corresponds to an increase by a similar percentage in the vertical mass flux of deep updraughts in the oceanic cases. Furthermore, the weak ascent (0. 1 < w < 1 m s(- 1)) outside the deep convective updraughts is much less prevalent in 3 D than in 2 D, with vertical velocities being about 20 % lower for a given cumulative frequency and a lower vertical mass flux. Downdraughts are weaker in 3 D, for most cases. There is a substantial sensitivity of the vertical profiles of cloud liquid and cloud ice, and of other microphysical species, to dimensionality. This is consistent with the sensitivity of the dynamics of convection. Corresponding changes in radiative transfer, especially in the <b>short-wave</b> <b>band,</b> result from the cloud-radiative interactions. In particular, the peak in domain-averaged cloud liquid content in the melting layer is about 50 % higher in most of the 2 D simulations.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} concern amongst climate modelers, in particular, and atmospheric scientists, in general, {{that we may}} have been underestimating the absorption of solar radiation by the atmosphere by as much as 40 Wm- 2. This enhanced absorption, which was recognised by comparing model calculations with satellite-borne radiometric measurements, remains to be explained. Controversial explanations of this newly discovered fact have been offered and debated. A school of thought suggests that the enhanced absorption of the incoming short-wave solar radiation is due to erroneous depiction of the contribution by clouds in the atmosphere. Another school subscribes to the view that the enhanced absorption, which it believes is apparent in the clear-sky case as well, is due to under-estimation of the absorption in the <b>short-wave</b> <b>bands</b> of water vapor. The latter school also wonders if the absorption by water vapor differs from the conventional manner as the substance approaches and exceeds the limit of thermodynamic staturation, a situation not uncommon in the rims of clouds and in highly humid tropics ane equatorial regions.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{very low}} frequency (V. L. F.) radio waves propagating in an ionlzed medium, such as the ionosphere and exosphere, may exhibit markedly different characteristics from those of frequencies such as are used for communication in the <b>short-wave</b> <b>bands.</b> The anisotropy introduced into the medium {{by the presence of}} the earth's magnetic field has a significant effect, while at frequencies below about 5 KHz the presence of heavy positive ions may further affect propagation. In particular it is found that, under suitable conditions, V. L. F. signals may propagate along paths closely following the lines of force of the earth's magnetic field. The study of such signals has a practical interest in that, from consideration of their propagation times and dispersion properties, they can provide an inexpensive method of determining electron densities at well beyond the range of satellite investigation. For this reason, if for no other, theoretical investigation of the paths traced in a model exosphere may indicate how closely the model exosphere approximates the true one. A powerful method of tracing out these paths is by the use of "ray-tracing", provided the properties of the medium vary slowly in space, a condition not always fulfilled in practice. It {{has been the subject of}} this thesis to carry out ray-tracing studies, in particular noting the effects of the positive ions in the exosphere; effects which have not received much notice before as they were thought to be unimportant.

Spatial {{and temporal}} analysis were per-formed based on statistical separability and temporal changes. The objective of these analysis was to find out the most sensitive bands for burned land mapping in order to design spectral in-dices better adapted to the discrimination of burned areas. MODIS images were found to be more sensitive than AVHRR images, caused by both the better spatial and spectral resolution. The near infrared and <b>short-wave</b> infrared <b>bands</b> were found more adequate than visible channels to separate burned areas from other land covers, although the thermal channels of AVHRR also contributed significantly to separability indices.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{synthesise}} a large data set gathered {{from a wide}} variety of field deployments and integrate it with previously published results to identify the spectral signatures of swash from contrasting beach types. The field data set includes the full range of micro-tidal beach types (reflective, intermediate and dissipative), with beach gradients ranging from approximately 1 : 6 to 1 : 60 exposed to offshore significant wave heights of 0. 5 - 3. 0. m. The ratio of swash energy in the short-wave (f > 0. 05. Hz) to long-wave (f < 0. 05. Hz) frequency bands is found to be significantly different between the three beach types. Swash energy at short-wave frequencies is dominant on reflective and intermediate beaches and swash at long-wave frequencies is dominant on dissipative beaches; consistent with previously reported spectral signatures for the surf zone on these beach types. The available swash spectra were classified using an automated algorithm (CLARA) into five different classes. The ordered classes represent an evolution in the spectrum shape, described by a frequency downshifting of the energy peak from the short-wave into the long-wave frequency band and an increase in the long-wave swash energy level compared to a relatively minor variation in the short-wave swash energy level. A universally common feature of spectra from all beach-states was an f- 4 energy roll-off in the <b>short-wave</b> frequency <b>band.</b> In contrast to the broadly uniform appearance of the <b>short-wave</b> frequency <b>band,</b> the appearance of the long wave frequency band was highly variable across the beach-states. We incorporate the results presented here and previously published observations into the morphodynamic beach-state model, and propose an ordered sequence of swash spectra under increasing and decreasing incident wave energy level. This extension of the beach-state model to include the swash zone leads to the following propositions for morphodynamic controls on the nature of the swash spectrum. (1) The short-wave part of the swash spectrum is relatively constant in form across all beach-states (f- 4 energy roll-off) and the energy density per unit frequency is controlled by the beach face gradient alone. (2) The spectral bandwidth of the energy roll-off varies directly with offshore wave energy level and inversely with beach face gradient (or beach-state), in a manner consistent with the non-linear wave breaking criterion. (3) The infragravity part of the swash spectrum is highly variable in form across all beach-states and the energy level is related to the offshore wave energy level and surf zone morphology...|$|R

All VIs have shown an increasing trend from 1985 to 2015 which depicted increase of vegetation. Spectral reflectance of all bands is declining from 1985 to 2015 except in near-infrared (NIR) bands. High reflectance in NIR bands is due to increased vegetation greenness. The reduction was seen in the visible bands that show increased vegetation photosynthetic activity. In the <b>short-wave</b> infrared <b>bands</b> (SWIR) were observed reduced trend from 1985 to 2015 which is indicate increased vegetation.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the optical response of detectors designed for SAFARI, the far-infrared imaging spectrometer for the SPICA satellite. To {{take advantage of}} SPICA's cooled optics, SAFARI’s three bolometer arrays are populated with extremely sensitive (NEP~ 2 × 10 - 19 W/√Hz) transition edge sensors with a transition temperature close to 100 mK. The extreme sensitivity and low saturation power (~ 4 fW) of SAFARI’s detectors present challenges to characterizing them. We have therefore built up an ultra-low background test facility with a cryogen-free high-capacity dilution refrigerator, paying careful attention to stray-light exclusion. Our use of a pulse-tube cooler to pre-cool the dilution refrigerator required that the SAFARI Detector System Test Facility provide a high degree electrical, magnetic, and mechanical isolation for the detectors. We have carefully characterized {{the performance of the}} test facility in terms of background power loading. The test facility has been designed to be flexible and easily reconfigurable with internal illuminators that allow us to characterize the optical response of the detectors. We describe the test facility and some of the steps we took to create an ultra-low background test environment. We have {{measured the}} optical response of two detectors designed for SAFARI’s <b>short-wave</b> wavelength <b>band</b> in combination with a spherical backshort and conical feedhorn. We find an overall optical efficiency of 40 % for both, compared with an ideal-case predicted optical efficiency of 66 %...|$|R
40|$|The on-orbit radiometric {{response}} calibration of the VISible/Near InfraRed (VISNIR) and the <b>Short-Wave</b> InfraRed (SWIR) <b>bands</b> of the Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) {{aboard the}} Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite {{is carried out}} through a Solar Diffuser (SD). The transmittance of the SD screen and the SD's Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are measured before launch and tabulated, allowing the VIIRS sensor aperture spectral radiance to be accurately determined. The radiometric response of a detector is described by a quadratic polynomial of the detector?s digital number (dn). The coefficients were determined before launch. Once on orbit, the coefficients are assumed to change by a common factor: the F-factor. The radiance scattered from the SD allows {{the determination of the}} F-factor. In this Proceeding, we describe the methodology and the associated algorithms in the determination of the F-factors and discuss the results...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the reflectance behavior of textiles in the <b>short-wave</b> infrared (SWIR) <b>band</b> (1 – 2 microns) {{in order to}} identify/design potential diagnostic tools that allow the remote detection of human presence in a scene. Analyzing the spectral response of fabrics in the SWIR band has gained significant interest in the remote sensing community since it provides a potential path to discriminate camouflaged clothing from backgrounds that appear similar to the object {{of interest in the}} visible band. Existing research, originating primarily from the textiles community, has thoroughly documented the behavior of clothing fabrics in the visible band. Other work has shown that the differences in spectral response in the SWIR band allows for discrimination of materials that otherwise have the same visible spectral response. This work expands on those efforts in order to quantify the reflectance behavior and to better understand the physical basis for that behavior...|$|R
40|$|Observing System (EOS) Aqua {{spacecraft}} is a 36 -band instrument {{covering the}} region from 0. 4 to 14. 5 µm in spatial resolutions of 250 m, 500 m and 1 km. There {{is a similar}} MODIS instrument onboard the Terra spacecraft. The MODIS is especially suited for remote sensing of snow cover because of the band coverage over the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Snow characteris-tically has high reflectance in visible wavelengths and low reflectance in the short-wave infrared at about 1. 6 µm (MODIS band 6), a characteristic that allows for detection of snow by a ratio of a visible <b>band</b> and <b>short-wave</b> infrared <b>band.</b> That characteristic of snow is fairly constant {{over a wide range}} of land surfaces and illumination conditions. However the Aqua MODIS instrument has degraded data quality in band 6; 70 % of the band 6 detectors have been identified as non-functional. The problems with the Aqua MODIS band 6 detectors impact the quality of the Aqua MODIS Level 2 snow data product MYD 10 _L 2, by degrading the quality of the data and through impact to the MODIS cloud mask product that also uses band 6. Because of the band 6 non-functional detector problems an Aqua-specific algorithm using band 7, 2. 1 µm, in place of band 6 was developed and is used to map snow. Snow has similar reflectance in bands 6 and 7. SNOW ALGORITHM SYNOPSI...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The HSS (Hyperspectral Scanner System) was {{evaluated}} for characterization and spatialization of soils in Manaus, AM, Brazil, with 3 meter resolu-tion images. The images (37 bands between 0, 43 and 2, 37 μm) were converted from radiance values to surface reflectance using the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) applicative, {{based on the}} MODTRAN + 4 (Moderate Resolution Transmittance) a radioactive transfer model. Preceding collec-tion of soil samples, the main soil classes were identified through the SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper) method {{in order to facilitate}} analysis of the spectral characteristics of the studied area. Finally, for 13 samples, correlations among soil characteristics and spectral data from the HSS sensor, and spectral curves obtained in laboratory were carried out. Results indicated that: (a) the atmospheric correction accomplished with the FLAASH applicative was appropriate, despite difficulties for total removal of the water vapor feature at 0. 94 μm and at <b>short-wave</b> infrared <b>band,</b> near to 2. 0 μm. In general, a spectral coherence of the HSS sensor was confirmed with the information found in literature and the spectrum obtained in the laboratory; (b) a good capacity for spectral identification was observed with the SAM classifier as the results provided an appropriate soil preidentification, helping as well to define sites for field work; (c) the spectral curves representative of the soil classes are comparable both for laboratory and sensor data. Usually, correlations between both data acquisition environments (laboratory and HSS) are high...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) {{data have}} been {{extensively}} used for land cover classification, but Terra ASTER and SPOT High Resolution Geometric (HRG) data applications are just beginning. This paper compares {{the capabilities of}} TM, ASTER, and HRG in land cover classification in the Amazon basin. Maximum likelihood classification was used for selected multi-sensor image classification. This research indicates that different sensor data have their own merits for land cover classification and no single sensor data or image processing routine provide the best classification accuracy for all land cover classes. The SPOT data fusion result with its 5 m spatial resolution provides the best overall classification accuracies, with Kappa coefficients of 61. 8 % and 56. 3 % for 13 land cover classes and 9 vegetation classes, respectively. This is about 3 % higher than the second best classification results using SPOT multispectral data with 10 m spatial resolution and ASTER data; and about 4 % higher than TM data for 9 vegetation classes. The major errors are due to the confusion between successional stages, agroforestry, and degraded pasture. For the six land cover classification system, the SPOT data fusion provides the best classification accuracy, with overall classification accuracy of 80. 4 % and kappa coefficient of 75. 4 %. This research indicates the importance of <b>short-wave</b> infrared <b>bands</b> in land cover classification. Also, higher spatial resolution images provide better classification accuracy when the spectral wavelengths are similar...|$|R
40|$|Southern Peru {{contains}} several small- {{and medium-sized}} epithermal Au-Ag (± base metals) deposits related to Miocene-Pliocene metallogenetic belts. Specifically, {{the characterization of}} the geology and mapping of hydrothermal alteration zones of the Chapi Chiara prospect, Canahuire deposit, and Cerro Millo and San Antonio de Esquilache targets were done with data acquired by Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spaceborne sensor. ASTER mapping techniques included (1) band ratio and principal component analysis (Crósta technique) applied to the visible and near-infrared and <b>short-wave</b> infra-red <b>bands</b> to produce a regional hydrothermal alteration map (alunite and/or kaolinite, illite-muscovite and/ or smectite, iron-bearing minerals) and (2) spectral indices and selective principal component analysis applied to the thermal infrared bands to detect quartz- and carbonates-bearing targets, respectively. These methods were used to establish a hydrothermal zoning pattern in paleostratovolcanoes, where the Chapi Chiara, Cerro Millo, and San Antonio de Esquilache targets are located. This zoning pattern was used to infer erosion condi-tions {{and the potential for}} metal deposits based on the mineralogy, which was also analyzed using reflectance spectroscopy and petrography. In addition, ASTER data were used to characterize the carbonate host rocks, the quartz-bearing units of the Yura Group, and the quartz-poor unit associated with the phreatic and phreatomag-matic breccias in the Canahuire deposit region. This characterization {{led to the development of}} a favorability model for the occurrence of “Canahuire-type ” deposits based on spatial analysis using the fuzzy logic technique...|$|R
40|$|Multispectral Airborne Laser Scanning {{provides}} a new opportunity for airborne data collection. It provides high-density topographic surveying {{and is also}} {{a useful tool for}} land cover mapping. Use of a minimum of three intensity images from a multiwavelength laser scanner and 3 D information included in the digital surface model has the potential for land cover/use classification and a discussion about the application of this type of data in land cover/use mapping has recently begun. In the test study, three laser reflectance intensity images (orthogonalized point cloud) acquired in green, near-infrared and <b>short-wave</b> infrared <b>bands,</b> together with a digital surface model, were used in land cover/use classification where six classes were distinguished: water, sand and gravel, concrete and asphalt, low vegetation, trees and buildings. In the tested methods, different approaches for classification were applied: spectral (based only on laser reflectance intensity images), spectral with elevation data as additional input data, and spectro-textural, using morphological granulometry as a method of texture analysis of both types of data: spectral images and the digital surface model. The method of generating the intensity raster was also tested in the experiment. Reference data were created based on visual interpretation of ALS data and traditional optical aerial and satellite images. The results have shown that multispectral ALS data are unlike typical multispectral optical images, and they have a major potential for land cover/use classification. An overall accuracy of classification over 90...|$|R
