5000|$|Before PALs were introduced, {{designers}} of digital logic circuits would use <b>small-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>SSI)</b> components, {{such as those}} in the 7400 series TTL (transistor-transistor logic) family; the 7400 family included a variety of logic building blocks, such as gates (NOT, NAND, NOR, AND, OR), multiplexers (MUXes) and demultiplexers (DEMUXes), flip flops (D-type, JK, etc.) and others. One PAL device would typically replace dozens of such [...] "discrete" [...] logic packages, so the SSI business declined as the PAL business took off. PALs were used advantageously in many products, such as minicomputers, as documented in Tracy Kidder's best-selling book The Soul of a New Machine.|$|E
50|$|The Invention of the {{integrated}} circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce solved {{this problem by}} making all the components and the chip {{out of the same}} block (monolith) of semiconductor material. The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated. This led to the idea of integrating all components on a single silicon wafer, which led to <b>small-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>SSI)</b> in the early 1960s, medium-scale integration (MSI) in the late 1960s, and then large-scale integration (LSI) as well as VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, {{with tens of thousands of}} transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions (109)).|$|E
50|$|The first {{semiconductor}} chips held two transistors each. Subsequent advances added more transistors, {{and as a}} consequence, more individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The first integrated circuits held only a few devices, {{perhaps as many as}} ten diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors, making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device. Now known retrospectively as <b>small-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>SSI),</b> improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as medium-scale integration (MSI). Further improvements led to large-scale integration (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates. Current technology has moved far past this mark and today's microprocessors have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors.|$|E

50|$|Since the Kenbak-1 {{was invented}} {{before the first}} microprocessor, the machine didn't have a {{one-chip}} CPU but instead was based purely on <b>small-scale</b> <b>integration</b> TTL chips. The 8-bit machine offered 256 bytes of memory, implemented on Intel's type 1404 silicon gate MOS shift registers. The instruction cycle time was 1 microsecond (equivalent to an instruction clock speed of 1 MHz), but actual execution speed averaged below 1000 instructions per second due to architectural constraints such as slow access to serial memory.|$|R
5000|$|The 316 succeeded {{the earlier}} DDP-516 model and was {{promoted}} by Honeywell as suitable for industrial process control, data-acquisition systems, {{and as a}} communications concentrator and processor. The computer processor was made from <b>small-scale</b> <b>integration</b> DTL monolithic integrated circuits. Most parts of the system operated at 2.5 MHz, but some elements were clocked at 5 MHz. The computer was a bitwise-parallel 2's complement system with 16-bit word length. The instruction set was a single-address type with an index register. [...] Initially released with a capacity of 4096 through 16,384 words of memory, later expansion options allowed increasing memory space to 32,768 words. Memory cycle time was 1.6 microseconds; an integer register-to-register [...] "add" [...] instruction took 3.2 microseconds. An optional hardware arithmetic option was available to implement integer multiply and divide, double-precision load and store, and double-precision (31-bit) integer addition and subtraction operations.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on robust high speed {{intelligent}} power electronics, i. e. power electronics that provide increased survivability due to the robust nature of the system components. Silicon carbide (SiC), due to its wide bandgap and superior physical properties, is an attractive material for applications in harsh environments especially high temperature electronics applications. An ideal device for these applications is the bipolar junction transistor (BJT). To exploit the full temperature capabilities of SiC, this work entails an exploratory development effort to investigate and create monolithic bipolar integrated circuits (ICs) capable of robust operation at temperatures above 300 Â°C. These circuits will be suitable for <b>small-scale</b> <b>integration</b> applications in smart power, aerospace, automotive, and well logging applications. ^ For this research, various types of bipolar technologies are studied and analyzed. Simulation models are created for the bipolar transistor and are used to simulate {{the behavior of the}} circuits. ICs are designed in order to achieve excellent DC characteristics with high-speed capability. Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) technology is used for all ICs owing to its excellent DC and high-speed characteristics. To achieve high speeds, semi-insulating substrates are used and the design of the basic TTL gates is optimized. The fabricated ICs include basic logic gates with fan-outs of one and ten, an 11 -stage ring oscillator, a D flip-flop, and a half adder. These circuits are characterized over a wide range of supply voltages and temperatures, with results demonstrating the potential of bipolar integrated circuits in SiC for small-scale, high temperature applications. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} two concepts: the Query Web as a {{layer of}} interconnected queries over the document web and the semantic web, and a Query Web Integrator and Manager (QI) that enables the Query Web to evolve. QI permits users to write, save and reuse queries over any web accessible source, including other queries saved in other installations of QI. The saved queries may be in any language (e. g. SPARQL, XQuery); the only condition for interconnection is that the queries return their results {{in some form of}} XML. This condition allows queries to chain off each other, and to be written in whatever language is appropriate for the task. We illustrate the potential use of QI for several biomedical use cases, including ontology view generation using a combination of graph-based and logical approaches, value set generation for clinical data management, image annotation using terminology obtained from an ontology web service, ontology-driven brain imaging data <b>integration,</b> <b>small-scale</b> clinical data <b>integration,</b> and wider-scale clinical data integration. Such use cases illustrate the current range of applications of QI and lead us to speculate about the potential evolution from smaller groups of interconnected queries into a larger query network that layers over the document and semantic web.

In the context of Nigerian apiculture, which {{has the potential to}} provide employment and alleviate poverty for BOP farmers, this paper explores the knowledge transfer mechanisms used by beekeepers in Nigeria, with a view to improving productivity and unlocking social value. Drawing on responses from thirty-one Nigerian beekeepers, this research shows that beekeepers in Nigeria largely continue to use traditional production and harvesting methods. The findings also further highlight the willingness of the beekeepers to adopt mobile apps in sourcing/sharing information about beekeeping, of which a ready platform exists given the rapid penetration of mobile phone ownership among social entrepreneurs at the BOP.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a global {{challenge}} to both sustainable livelihoods and economic development. In Tanzania as in most African countries, farming depends almost entirely on rainfall, a situation that makes agriculture and thus rural livel i hoods especially in semiarid environments particularly vulnerable to climate change. This study analyses the impacts of climate change and variability on rural livelihoods with particular focus on agricultural production, food security and adaptive capacities in semiarid areas of Tanzania. The methods {{used in this study}} included focus group discussions, key informant interviews, household surveys and field observations. Results from the study indicate that communities understood climate change in terms of variability in rainfall patterns and amount, temperature patterns, wind, water availability, increased incidences of drought and decreased agricultural productivity. Communities in the study area acknowledged that while rainfall amounts have decreased over the last thirty years, temperatures have increased; an experience is also supported by meteorological data. Such changes were claimed to have reduced agricultural productivity particularly due to prolonged drought, inadequate and uneven distribution of rainfall as well as unpredictable onset and ending of rains. Stressors such as crop diseases and pests, low soil fertility and inadequate extension services were also reported to contribute to the decline in agricultural productivity and re-occurrence of food insecurity. In response, communities have developed multiple adaptation strategies, including growing of drought tolerant and early maturing crop varieties, increasing wetlands cultivation, water harvesting for small-scale irrigation and livestock keeping. However, households with limited livelihood assets are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and food insecurity. The study argues that diversification of adaptive strategies, such as water harvesting for <b>small-scale</b> irrigation, <b>integration</b> of livestock and crop production are crucial to ensuring sustainable livelihood in a changing climate. </p...|$|R

In a world with finite natural resources and increasing energy demand by developing countries, it calls for energy researchers {{to come up with}} systematic approaches for improving the design of energy systems and reducing the impact on the environment. Exergoeconomics is a powerful tool for understanding the interconnections between thermodynamics and economics, and thus viewed as an exergyâaided cost minimization technique crucial to the design and operation of a cost effective energy system.

40|$|For {{many small}} {{producers}} {{in developing countries}} coffee is a major income source. However, the coffee market is characterized by high price volatility and increased power concentration among buyers in consuming countries. Due to the very low international coffee prices during the recent coffee crisis and an increased demand among consumers for healthy and ethical products {{as well as for}} high quality, interest in standards and certification has increased substantially in coffee producing and consuming countries. Responding to the demand for differentiated products and accessing these new and potentially more profitable markets is especially challenging for poor small-scale farmers in developing countries. Although certification schemes and standards are widely applied and promoted, little research has been conducted identifying the complete value chains for certified coffee, their structure and gross income shares among the different chain actors. The framework for this study is based on the value chain concept. The research analyses selected conventional and Fairtrade value chains in terms of prices paid at different levels, information flows among chain actors, governance structures and upgrading strategies. The focus is on Nicaragua?s small-scale coffee producers, organised in cooperatives, and their upgrading strategies with special attention paid to organic and Fairtrade certification. Qualitative interviews have been conducted with all relevant chain actors. Results show that the structure of the value chain has a major influence on the benefits for individual farmers and their involvement in upgrading strategies. Although higher prices are paid to producers for organic-Fairtrade coffee than for conventional or conventional Fairtrade coffee, the producers? share on the final retail price is substantially lower in the certified chains than in the conventional chain. Producers face limited bargaining power on the quality premiums paid by buyers in consuming countries. The paper emphasizes the need for transparency and appropriate chain management to improve <b>small-scale</b> farmers? <b>integration</b> in value chain upgrading activities. An enhanced knowledge transfer among chain actors could increase farmers? understanding of differentiated markets and provide them with information on the coffee attributes sought by consumers. Being able to meet consumer expectations on attributes and quality standards could empower farmers with greater bargaining power and enable them to demand adequately higher prices.
