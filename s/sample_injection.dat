50|$|The {{components}} of a CCC system are similar to most liquid chromatography configurations such as high-performance liquid chromatography. One or more pumps deliver the phases to the column which is the CCC instrument itself. Samples are introduced into the column through a sample loop filled with an automated or manual syringe. The outflow is monitored with various detectors such as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. The operation of the pumps, CCC instrument, <b>sample</b> <b>injection,</b> and detection may be controlled manually or with a microprocessor.|$|E
50|$|EKI's can be {{leveraged}} {{for rapid}} mixing or can cause undesirable dispersion in <b>sample</b> <b>injection,</b> separation and stacking. These instabilities {{are caused by}} a coupling of electric fields and ionic conductivity gradients that results in an electric body force. This coupling results in an electric body force in the bulk liquid, outside the electric double layer, that can generate temporal, convective, and absolute flow instabilities. Electrokinetic flows with conductivity gradients become unstable when the electroviscous stretching and folding of conductivity interfaces grows faster than the dissipative effect of molecular diffusion.|$|E

50|$|Samples are {{injected}} into the system using a known amount of sample volume. This volume {{will depend on the}} AF4 instrument being utilized in the experiment. Starting fractionation immediately after <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> is not ideal because the sample is going to spread out randomly from the injection site, so the beginning velocity and place of the particles are not all the same. This leads to line broadening and insufficiency. In order to correct such an error, sample focusing is proposed. Modern AF4 Systems allow both: manual and auto injection.|$|E
5000|$|Column {{chromatography}} is {{an extremely}} time consuming stage in any lab and can quickly become the bottleneck for any process lab. Therefore, several manufacturers like Biotage, Buchi, Interchim and Teledyne Isco have developed automated flash chromatography systems (typically referred to as LPLC, low pressure liquid chromatography, around [...] ) that minimize human involvement in the purification process. Automated systems will include components normally found on more expensive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems such as a gradient pump, <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> ports, a UV detector and a fraction collector to collect the eluent. Typically these automated systems can separate samples from a few milligrams up to an industrial many kilogram scale and offer a much cheaper and quicker solution to doing multiple injections on prep-HPLC systems.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, picoSpin, {{based in}} Boulder, Colorado, {{launched}} a small (7 x 5.75 x 11.5”) 45 MHz spectrometer with good resolution (< 1.8 Hz) and mid-to-low-range sensitivity that weighs 4.76 kg (10.5 lbs) and can acquire a 1D 1H or 19F spectrum. picoSpin {{was acquired by}} Thermo Fisher Scientific in December 2012, and subsequently renamed the product Thermo Scientific picoSpin 45. [...] Instead of the traditional static 5 mm NMR tubes, the picoSpin 45 spectrometer uses a flow-through system that requires <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> into a 1/16” or 1/32” capillary. Deuterated solvents are optional due {{to the presence of}} a software lock. It needs only a web browser on any external computer or mobile device for control as the spectrometer has a built-in web server board; no installed software on a dedicated PC is required. In August 2013 a second version was introduced, the Thermo Scientific picoSpin 80, that operates at 82 MHz with a resolution of 1.48 Hz and weighs 19 kg.|$|E

50|$|The second {{generation}} of the FIA technique, called sequential injection analysis (SIA), was conceived in 1990 by Ruzicka and Marshal, and has been further developed and miniaturized {{over the course of}} the following decade. It uses flow programming instead of the continuous flow regime (as used by CFA and FIA), that allows the flow rate and flow direction to be tailored to the need of individual steps of analytical protocol. Reactants are mixed by flow reversals and a measurement is carried out while the reaction mixture is arrested within the detector by stepping the flow. Microminiaturized chromatography is carried out on microcolumns that are automatically renewed by microfluidic manipulations. The discrete pumping and metering of microliter sample and reagent volumes used in SI only generates waste per each <b>sample</b> <b>injection.</b> The enormous volume of FI and SI literature documents the versatility of FI and SI and their usefulness for routine assays (in soil, water, environmental, biochemical and biotechnological assays) has demonstrated their potential to be used as a versatile research tool.|$|E

With the further study of <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> length and the relationship between the capacity factors of solutes in two different zones and enhancement factors, it can he proved that the solubility of solutes in the micelle is the most important factor to affect the enhancement factors. The appropriate increase in the <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> length could be favorable to the enrichment without loss in resolution...|$|E

50|$|Individual {{monolith}} columns have a {{life cycle}} that generally exceeds that of its particulate competitors. When selecting an HPLC column supplier, column lifetime was second only to column-to-column reproducibility in importance to the purchaser. Chromolith columns, for example, have demonstrated reproducibility of 3,300 <b>sample</b> <b>injections</b> and 50,000 column volumes of mobile phase. Also important to {{the life cycle of}} the monolith is its increased mechanical robustness; polymeric monoliths are able to withstand pH ranges from 1 to 14, can endure elevated temperatures, and {{do not need to be}} handled delicately. “Monoliths are still teenagers,” affirms Frantisec Svec, a leader in the field of novel stationary phases for LC.|$|R
30|$|Ethylene {{oligomerization}} {{was performed}} in a transparent glass reaction vessel, equipped with a pressure meter and needle valves for <b>sample</b> <b>injections,</b> with magnetic stirring and heating in an oil bath. After evacuation and flushing with N 2 (three times) and ethylene (twice), the reaction vessel was charged with a quantity of cyclohexane and magnetically stirred under ambient ethylene atmosphere. When the desired reaction temperature was established, a quantity of MAO/alkylaluminum activator, PNP ligand and CrCl 3 (THF) 3 were injected into the reactor. Typically 30  min later, the mixture was rapidly cooled to 0  °C and then the reaction was quenched through the addition of EtOH/HCl (10  wt%). The catalytic activity was calculated from the increase in product weight.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to clarify the {{mechanism}} taking place in field-enhanced <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> coupled to sweeping and micellar EKC (FESI-Sweep-MEKC), with the utilization of two acidic high-conductivity buffers (HCBs), phosphoric acid or sodium phosphate buffer, in view of maximizing sensitivity enhancements. Using cationic model compounds in acidic media, a chemometric approach and simulations with SIMUL 5 were implemented. Experimental design first enabled to identify the significant factors and their potential interactions. Simulation demonstrates the formation of moving boundaries during <b>sample</b> <b>injection,</b> which originate at the initial sample/HCB and HCB/buffer discontinuities and gradually change the compositions of HCB and BGE. With sodium phosphate buffer, the HCB conductivity increased during the injection, leading to a more efficient preconcentration by staking (about 1. 6 times) than with phosphoric acid alone, for which conductivity decreased during injection. For the same injection time at constant voltage, however, a lower amount of analytes was injected with sodium phosphate buffer than with phosphoric acid. Consequently sensitivity enhancements were lower for the whole FESI-Sweep-MEKC process. This is why, {{in order to maximize}} sensitivity enhancements, it is proposed to work with sodium phosphate buffer as HCB and to use constant current during <b>sample</b> <b>injection...</b>|$|E

40|$|Investigation into {{persistent}} {{organic pollutants}} (POPs) in sea turtles is an important area of conservation research due to {{the harmful effects of}} these chemicals.

30|$|Glass prisms {{coated with}} a 50  nm gold layer were {{obtained}} from HORIBA-Scientific (Palaiseau, France). Peptides (100  μM) were grafted in duplicate on the biochip surface by electrochemical copolymerization (Villiers et al. [2011]), using an Omnigrid Micro-robotic arrayer (Horiba-Scientific). Ab binding on the grafted peptides was detected using Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi). This optical technique allows {{for the detection of}} protein-peptide interaction through a change in the intensity of the reflected light. Successive serum injections (1 : 50 in PBS) were performed as previously described (Villiers et al. [2011]). Stabilization of the peptide chip was ensured by twelve blank injection/regeneration cycles before <b>sample</b> analysis. Periodic <b>injections</b> of control rabbit anti-C 131 serum (1 : 200) allowed to monitor the reduction of signal along successive injections and to model it using polynomial curve. This curve was used to determine a correction factor to be applied to <b>sample</b> <b>injections</b> (Villiers et al. [2011]). SPR signals were monitored at 810  nm using a surface plasmon resonance imager SPRi-Plex from Horiba-Scientific. Measurements were performed using SPRi-dedicated software (Horiba-Scientific).|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} of flow injection (FI) extraction with mixed solvents is presented. The system was demonstrated with on-line chelation of copper using 5, 7 -dibromo- 8 -hydroxyquinoline, extraction into a mixed solvent of toluene:xylene (1 : 4), and determination of copper with flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Various parameters affecting the signal intensity, such as mixed solvent ratio, extraction coil length, sampling time and <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> time, flow rate of sample and extractant carrier streams, and aqueous-to-organic flow rate ratio, were optimized.

40|$|Although Polylactic acid (PLA) {{possesses}} many desirable properties, {{above all}} biodegradability, its {{heat deflection temperature}} is too low for many desirable applications. Similarly, to any other polymers, also for PLA the physical and mechanical properties in the solid state depend on the morphology and crystallinity degree, which in their turn {{are determined by the}} thermomechanical history experienced during solidification. A large crystallinity degree is highly desirable to increase the heat resistance of PLA but is rather difficult to reach during injection molding due to the very slow crystallization kinetics of this material. In this work, the crystallization kinetics of an injection molded PLA grade was assessed in function of the thermal history by using calorimetric analysis. The cold crystallization kinetics (starting from the amorphous glassy sample) turned out to be faster than melt crystallization kinetics. Following the indications gained from crystallization kinetics, some <b>samples</b> were <b>injection</b> molded imposing different thermal histories. The effect of molding conditions on crystallinity was determined. This finding was adopted to develop a post-molding stage which allows obtaining crystalline samples in times much shorter (of a factor about two) with respect to <b>samples</b> <b>injection</b> molded in a hot mold kept at temperatures close to the maximum crystallization rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of isotachophoresis in channels of sub micrometer and nanometer dimension is investigated. A <b>sample</b> <b>injection</b> volume of 0. 4 pL is focused and separated in a 330 nm deep channel. The sample {{consists of a}} biomatrix containing the fluorescently-labeled amino acids glutamate and phenylalanine, 20 attomoles of each. Isotachophoretic focusing is successfully demonstrated in a 50 nm deep channel. Separation of the two amino acids in the 50 nm deep channel however, could not be performed as the maximum applicable voltage was insufficient. This limit is imposed by bubble formation that we contribute to cavitation {{as a result of}} the mismatch in electro-osmotic flow, so called electrocavitation.

30|$|The MCT concept {{assumes that}} the PD(A/H) changes with {{increasing}} MI concentrations. Based on a decreasing peak-height value, the PD(A/H) value {{can be expected to}} increase with higher matrix ion concentrations. Our observations did not confirm this prognosis for the tested 500 – 700 MI solutions, resulting in PD(A/H)-values below that of the 400 MI solution (Table  2). Linearity (within the meaning of EPA 314.0) was obtained between 0 and 300  mg/L of matrix ions, and the respective MCT resulted to about 2000  µS/cm corresponding to roughly 250  mg/L of each spiked anion (Fig.  2). Applying the procedure of EPA 314.0, a conductivity of below 2000  µS/cm would result in a PD(A/H) below 20 % and would therefore allow the evaluation of signals after direct <b>sample</b> <b>injections</b> [3].|$|R
