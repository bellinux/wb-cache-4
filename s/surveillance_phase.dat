40|$|High level {{military}} {{decision making}} is often conducted under time pressure, stressful conditions and uncertainty in the information. It remains a human intensive process. Maritime operations can be characterized generally as consisting of a <b>surveillance</b> <b>phase</b> and an intervention phase. The intervention phase develops {{a course of action}} based on an analysis of the data and information collected the <b>surveillance</b> <b>phase.</b> However, the amount of data and information that is collected, produced and presented to an operator has increased greatly in recent years. In general, an individual does not have the ability to cope with this amount of information in an efficient manner and make timely operational decisions.

Rhodnius prolixus is one of the principal vectors and is targeted for elimination. The control method consisted of extensive residual insecticide spraying campaigns, followed by community-based surveillance with selective respraying. Interventions in nine endemic departments identified 317 villages with R. prolixus of 4, 417 villages surveyed. Two cycles of residual insecticide spraying covered over 98 % of the houses in the identified villages. Fourteen villages reinfestated were all resprayed. Between 2000 - 2003 and 2008, the number of infested villages decreased from 317 to two and the house infestation rate reduced from 0. 86 % to 0. 0036 %.

Allozyme frequencies were analysed {{in relation}} to geographical and climatic factors, and {{the presence or absence}} of #Trypanosoma cruzi$ infection. At one locality (Vallegrande, Bolivia), the frequency of 6 Pgd- 1 was significantly higher in infected (41 % of 85) than in uninfected (17 % of 83) adult #T. infestans$, although no such difference was found among nymphs (n= 347). From other localities, only insects infected with #T. cruzi$ were subjected to isosyme analysis. Populations of #T. infestans$ within villages showed panmixia, while genetic differenciation of #T. infestans$ between villages was correlated with the distance between them. The genetic structure of #T. infestans$ natural populations followed an "isolation by distance" model, involving a series of founder effects followed by genetic drift, rather than adaptation in response to differential selection pressures. This conforms with circumstantial evidence that #T. infestans$ spread, mainly in association with recent human migrations, from a source, probably in southern Bolivia.

40|$|A {{critical}} component of preventing the spread of vector borne diseases such as Chagas disease are door-to-door campaigns by public health officials that implement insecticide application in order to eradicate the vector infestation of households. The success of such campaigns depends on adequate household participation during the active phase {{as well as on}} sufficient follow-up during the <b>surveillance</b> <b>phase</b> when newly infested houses or infested houses that had not participated in the active phase will receive treatment. Queueing models which are widely used in operations management give us a mathematical representation of the operational efforts needed to contain the spread of infestation. By modeling the queue as consisting of all infested houses in a given locality, we capture the dynamics of the insect population due to prevalence of infestation and to the additional growth of infestation by redispersion, i. e. by the spread of infestation to previously uninfested houses during the wait time for treatment. In contrast to traditional queueing models, houses waiting for treatment are not known but must be identified through a search process by public health workers. Thus, both the arrival rate of houses to the queue as well as the removal rate from the queue depend on the current level of infestation. We incorporate these dependencies through a load dependent queueing model which allows us to estimate the long run average rate of removing houses from the queue and therefore the cost associated with a given surveillance program. The model is motivated by and applied to an ongoing Chagas disease control campaign in Arequipa, Peru...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{clinically}} significant endemic focus of onchocerciasis existing in Esmeraldas Province, coastal Ecuador {{has been under}} an ivermectin mass drug administration program since 1991. The main transmitting vector {{in this area is}} the voracious blackfly, Simulium exiguum. This paper describes the assessments made that support the decision to cease mass treatment. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Thirty-five rounds of ivermectin treatment occurred between 1991 - 2009 with 29 of these carrying > 85 % coverage. Following the guidelines set by WHO for ceasing ivermectin distribution the impact on parasite transmission was measured in the two vector species by an O- 150 PCR technique standard for assessing for the presence of Onchocerca volvulus. Up to seven collection sites in three major river systems were tested on four occasions between 1995 and 2008. The infectivity rates of 65. 0 (CI 39 - 101) and 72. 7 (CI 42 - 116) in 1995 dropped to zero at all seven collection sites by 2008. Assessment for the presence of antibodies against O. volvulus was made in 2001, 2006, 2007 and 2008 using standard ELISA assays for detecting anti-Ov 16 antibodies. None of total of 1810 children aged 1 - 15 years (between 82 and 98 % of children present in the surveyed villages) tested in the above years were found to be carrying antibodies to this antigen. These findings were the basis for the cessation of mass drug treatment with ivermectin in 2009. SIGNIFICANCE: This fulfillment of the criteria for cessation of mass distribution of ivermectin in the only known endemic zone of onchocerciasis in Ecuador moves the country into the <b>surveillance</b> <b>phase</b> of official verification for national elimination of transmission of infection. These findings indicate that ivermectin given twice a year with greater than 85 % of the community can move a program to the final stages of verification of transmission interruption...|$|E

Main Outcome Measures: Primary endpoints were changes in mean Likert scores for provider comfort level and self‐reported frequency of addressing sexual issues. A secondary endpoint was change in mean Likert scores for perception of access to sexual health resources/referrals. Results: Eligible respondents included 8 oncologists, 4 surgeons, and 62 nurses/other allied health. For total respondents, comparison of mean Likert scores for survey 1 (n = 71) and survey 2 (n = 36) demonstrated statistically significant increases for all parameters queried, including provider comfort level with bringing up (Pre mean Likert score = 3. 4, Post = 4. 3, P < 0. 0001) and coordinating care (Pre = 3. 5, Post = 4. 6, P < 0. 0001), and frequency of addressing sexual issues for both diagnosis/treatment and <b>surveillance</b> <b>phase</b> (Pre = 2. 4, Post = 3. 3, P ≤ 0. 0052). Conclusion: Brief, targeted sexual health training for oncology providers positively correlated with improved provider comfort level and frequency of addressing female cancer‐related sexual issues.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionSexual {{health care}} remains an unmet need {{for women with}} cancer. Many {{barriers}} are described, such as provider discomfort and lack of training; however, there is little evidence‐based guidance regarding how to effectively address these obstacles. AimThis pilot study was performed to determine whether brief, targeted sexual health training for oncology providers results in improved provider comfort level and frequency of addressing female cancer‐related sexual issues. MethodsA brief (30 – 45 minute), targeted sexual health training program focused on improving comfort level, knowledge and communication skills when addressing breast cancer–related sexual issues {{was developed by the}} primary author. Using a pretest‐posttest format, this educational program was provided to oncology providers (physicians and nurses/other allied health) from a suburban health‐care system. Surveys based on 5 ‐point Likert scales were provided before and 3 – 6 month post training.

40|$|Foi relatada a evolução do combate ao T. infestans, acentuando-se que inicialmente ocorreu uma queda na densidade de exemplares nos municípios periodicamente trabalhados. Esta foi acompanhada da queda dos índices de infecção pelo T. cruzi e das reações de Machado Guerreiro positivas. Quando as condições se tornaram adequadas, introduziu-se o método seletivo de Pedreira de Freitas, o qual possibilitou a melhoria das técnicas de borrifação e captura e ainda a ampliação da área protegida. Considerou-se que uma campanha de contrôle dos vetores domiciliários da doença de Chagas, apresenta distintas etapas. Procurou-se esclarecer quando e como, em São Paulo, conseguiu-se, em alguns municípios, chegar à fase de Vigilância, preconizada por Emmanuel Dias. Estabeleceu-se uma área pilôto, onde estão sendo estudados métodos de trabalho e adestrado o pessoal lotado nas áreas em Vigilância. Procurou-se mostrar que o T. sordida e o P. megistus não vêm respondendo satisfatòriamente aos atuais métodos de contrôle. The authors {{present at}} the beginning, the {{evolution}} of the attack against T. infestans, main vector of Chagas' Disease in the State of São Paulo (Brazil). They stress that at first there was a decline in the density of these insects in the counties worked periodically. This decline in density was followed by the reduction of the infection rate, by T. cruzi and Machado Guerreiro positive reactions. When the conditions became suitable, Pedreira de Freitas' Selective method was introduced, making possible the improvement of the spraying technique and capture as well as the amplification of the protected area. They consider that a control campaing of the domiciliary vectors of Chagas' Disease present different phases and they try to explain when and how, in some counties in the State of São Paulo they reached the <b>Surveillance</b> <b>phase</b> as preconized by Emmanuel Dias. A pilot area was established, where methods of work are being studied and people hired in the Surveillance areas are being trained. Finally, they show that T. sordida and P. megistus are not reacting satisfactorily to the present method of attack...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} three nonlinear estimation algorithms for {{impact point}} prediction (IPP) of ballistic targets. The paper assumes measurements {{are available from}} a 3 D <b>surveillance</b> radar or <b>phased</b> array radar over some portion of the ballistic trajectory. The ballistic target (BT) is tracked using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and a particle filter (PF). With the track estimate as an initial condition, the equations of motion for the BT are integrated to obtain a prediction of the impact point. This paper compares {{the performance of the}} three filters (EKF, UKF, and PF) for impact point prediction. The traditional Extended Kalman Filter equations are based on a first-order Taylor series approximation of the nonlinear transformations (expanded about the latest state estimate). Both the Unscented Kalman Filter and the Particle Filter allow nonlinear systems to be modeled without prior linearizion. The primary focus of the research presented in this paper is comparing the performance and accuracy of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and the Particle Filter (PF) for impact point prediction. The three filtering techniques are compared to the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) of estimation error...|$|R
40|$|As {{the major}} issue {{to limit the}} use of drugs, drug safety leads to the {{attrition}} or failure in clinical trials of drugs. Therefore, {{it would be more}} efficient to minimize therapeutic risks if it could be predicted before large-scale clinical trials. Here, we integrated a network topology analysis with cheminformatics measurements on drug information from the DrugBank database to detect the discrepancies between approved drugs and withdrawn drugs and give drug safety indications. Thus, 47 approved drugs were unfolded with higher similarity measurements to withdrawn ones by the same target and confirmed to be already withdrawn or discontinued in certain countries or regions in subsequent investigations. Accordingly, with the 2 D chemical fingerprint similarity calculation as a medium, the method was applied to predict pharmacovigilance for natural products from an in-house traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database. Among them, Silibinin was highlighted for the high similarity to the withdrawn drug Plicamycin although it was regarded as a promising drug candidate with a lower toxicity in existing reports. In summary, the network approach integrated with cheminformatics could provide drug safety indications effectively, especially for compounds with unknown targets or mechanisms like natural products. It would be helpful for drug safety <b>surveillance</b> in all <b>phases</b> of drug development...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} {{algorithms}} and reconfigurable multi-core architectures for streaming digital signal processing (DSP) applications. The multi-core concept {{has a number of}} advantages: (1) depending on the requirements more or fewer cores can be switched on/off, (2) the multi-core structure fits well to future process technologies, more cores will be available in advanced process technologies, but the complexity per core does not increase, (3) the multi-core concept is fault tolerant, faulty cores can be discarded and (4) multiple cores can be configured fast in parallel. Because in our approach processing and memory are combined in the cores, tasks can be executed efficiently on cores (locality of reference). There are a number of application domains that can be considered as streaming DSP applications: for example wireless baseband processing (for HiperLAN/ 2, WiMax, DAB, DRM, and DVB), multimedia processing (e. g. MPEG, MP 3 coding/decoding), medical image processing, colour image processing, sensor processing (e. g. remote <b>surveillance</b> cameras) and <b>phased</b> array radar systems. In this paper the key characteristics of streaming DSP applications are highlighted, and the characteristics of the processing architectures to efficiently support these types of applications are addressed. We present the initial results of the Annabelle chip that we designed with our approach...|$|R
