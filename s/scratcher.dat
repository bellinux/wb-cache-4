5|$|From its inception, the Virginia Lottery {{has sold}} instant (<b>scratcher)</b> games. Originally, all scratch tickets were $1 each; in the mid-1990s, the first Bingo <b>scratcher</b> was introduced; each Bingo ticket cost $2. Eventually, higher-priced scratchers (including $3, $5, and $10) with larger prizes were introduced. Currently, the most {{expensive}} scratchers in common circulation are $30 each. All $20 and up games currently in circulation and most $10 games offer a top prize of at least $1 million (annuitized). Winners of <b>scratcher</b> annuity prizes of at least $1 million can choose cash (just as in the top prizes in Powerball, Mega Millions, or Cash4Life).|$|E

The children played in a concert there on 19 July, accompanied by a local orchestra, about whose players Leopold made disparaging comments: Très médiocre [...] Un misérable italien détestable [...] Asini tutti [...] Un racleur (a <b>scratcher)</b> [...] Rotten.

60|$|Once {{there was}} a nice young hen that we will call Mrs. Feathertop. She was a hen of most {{excellent}} family, being a direct descendant of the Bolton Grays, and as pretty a young fowl as you could wish to see of a summer's day. She was, moreover, as fortunately situated in life as {{it was possible for}} a hen to be. She was bought by young Master Fred Little John, with four or five family connections of hers, and a lively young cock, who was held to be as brisk a <b>scratcher</b> and as capable a head of a family as any half-dozen sensible hens could desire.|$|E
60|$|None smiled; but {{all were}} sore perplexed, and looked {{one to the}} other in deep tribulation for counsel. But behold, here was a dead wall, and nothing in English history to tell how to get over it. The Master of Ceremonies was not present: there was no one who felt safe to venture upon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn problem. Alas! there was no Hereditary <b>Scratcher.</b> Meantime the tears had overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom's cheeks. His {{twitching}} nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. At last nature broke down the barriers of etiquette: Tom lifted up an inward prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.|$|E
6000|$|We {{usually find}} an encampment of Bedouins outside the gate. Their tents {{are worse than}} any gipsy's, low, smoky, and of the rudest construction. These people are a {{spectacle}} of savageness. Their huge heads of shock hair, dyed red and dripping with butter, are garnished with a Firin, or long three-pronged comb, a stick, which acts as <b>scratcher</b> when the owner {{does not wish to}} grease his fingers, and sometimes with the ominous ostrich feather, showing that the wearer has [...] "killed his man:" [...] a soiled and ragged cotton cloth covers their shoulders, and a similar article is wrapped round their loins.[18] All wear coarse sandals, and appear in the bravery of targe, spear, and dagger. Some of the women would be pretty did they not resemble the men in their scowling, Satanic expression of countenance: they are decidedly en deshabille, but a black skin always appears a garb. The cantonment is surrounded by asses, camels, and a troop of naked Flibertigibbets, who dance and jump in astonishment whenever they see me: [...] "The white man! the white man!" [...] they shriek; [...] "run away, run away, or we shall be eaten!" [...] [19] On one occasion, however, my amour propre was decidedly flattered by the attentions of a small black girl, apparently four or five years old, who followed me through the streets ejaculating [...] "Wa Wanaksan!"--"0 fine!" [...] The Bedouins, despite their fierce scowls, appear good-natured; the women flock out of the huts to stare and laugh, the men to look and wonder. I happened once to remark, [...] "Lo, we come forth to look at them and they look at us; we gaze at their complexion and they gaze at ours!" [...] A Bedouin who understood Arabic translated this speech to the others, and it excited great merriment. In the mining counties of civilised England, where the [...] "genial brickbat" [...] is thrown at the passing stranger, or in enlightened Scotland, where hair a few inches too long or a pair of mustachios justifies [...] "mobbing," [...] it would have been impossible for me to have mingled as I did with these wild people.|$|E

6000|$|In {{personal}} appearance {{the race is}} not unprepossessing. The crinal hair is hard and wiry, growing, {{like that of a}} half-caste West Indian, in stiff ringlets which sprout in tufts from the scalp, and, attaining a moderate length, which they rarely surpass, hang down. A few elders, savans, and the wealthy, who can afford the luxury of a turban, shave the head. More generally, each filament is duly picked out with the comb or a wooden <b>scratcher</b> like a knitting-needle, and the mass made to resemble a child's [...] "pudding," [...] an old bob-wig, a mop, a counsellor's peruke, or an old- fashioned coachman's wig,--there are a hundred ways of dressing the head. The Bedouins, true specimens of the [...] "greasy African race," [...] wear locks dripping with rancid butter, and accuse their citizen brethren of being more like birds than men. The colouring matter of the hair, naturally a bluish-black, is removed by a mixture of quicklime and water, or in the desert by a lessive of ashes [15]: this makes it a dull yellowish-white, which is converted into red permanently by henna, temporarily by ochreish earth kneaded with water. The ridiculous Somali peruke of crimsoned sheepskin,--almost as barbarous an article as the Welsh,--is apparently a foreign invention: I rarely saw one in the low country, although the hill tribes about Harar sometimes wear a black or white [...] "scratch-wig." [...] The head is rather long than round, and generally of the amiable variety, it is gracefully put on the shoulders, belongs equally to Africa and Arabia, and would be exceedingly weak but for the beauty of the brow. As far as the mouth, the face, with the exception of high cheek-bones, is good; the contour of the forehead ennobles it; the eyes are large and well-formed, and the upper features are frequently handsome and expressive. The jaw, however, is almost invariably prognathous and African; the broad, turned- out lips betray approximation to the Negro; and the chin projects {{to the detriment of the}} facial angle. The beard is represented by a few tufts; it is rare to see anything equal to even the Arab development: the long and ample eyebrows admired by the people are uncommon, and the mustachios are short and thin, often twisted outwards in two dwarf curls. The mouth is coarse as well as thick-lipped; the teeth rarely project as in the Negro, but they are not good; the habit of perpetually chewing coarse Surat tobacco stains them [16], the gums become black and mottled, and the use of ashes with the quid discolours the lips. The skin, amongst the tribes inhabiting the hot regions, is smooth, black, and glossy; as the altitude increases it becomes lighter, and about Harar it is generally of a cafe au lait colour. The Bedouins are fond of raising beauty marks in the shape of ghastly seams, and the thickness of the epidermis favours the size of these stigmates. The male figure is tall and somewhat ungainly. In only one instance I observed an approach to the steatopyge, making the shape to resemble the letter S; but the shoulders are high, the trunk is straight, the thighs fall off, the shin bones bow slightly forwards, and the feet, like the hands, are coarse, large, and flat. Yet with their hair, of a light straw colour, decked with the light waving feather, and their coal-black complexions set off by that most graceful of garments the clean white Tobe [17], the contrasts are decidedly effective.|$|E
