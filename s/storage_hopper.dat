One such alternative was wood pellets. Invented in the United States in the late 1970s, wood pellets are small eraser-sized capsules made of compressed sawdust. By the early 1980s, two men, Jerry Whitfield, a Boeing Aircraft engineer from Washington, and Joe Traeger, who ran a family-owned heating company in Oregon, were each experimenting with pellet-burning stoves. Although the stoves looked like traditional wood stoves, they worked much differently. Run by electricity, the pellet stoves utilized a motor-driven auger to deliver a specific amount of pellets from the <b>storage</b> <b>hopper</b> to a fire pot, where a fan aided combustion and blew the warm air from the stove.|$|E

It employs centrifugal force generated by a spinning gas stream to separate the particulate matter from the carrier gas. However, cyclone is efficient to collect coarse rather than fine particulate size fraction. In this regard, a study was carried out to determine the effect of creating more negative pressure at the <b>storage</b> <b>hopper</b> of a 100 mm diameter laboratory scale cyclone.

Interestingly, it was observed that more of the fine particulate matter was drawn from the gas stream as the suction flow rate increases. This is due to the suction velocity which exceeds the terminal falling velocities of the fine particles size range. There was a reduction by weight in the fine particle emitted from the cyclone ranging between 14 % to 52 % by introduction of the suction.

40|$|AbstractSlow flow of {{granular}} materials, {{which typically}} occurs during the emptying of industrial <b>storage</b> <b>hoppers</b> and bins, has great industrial relevance. In the present study, we have employed our newly developed dilatant double shearing model [H. Zhu, M. M. Mehrabadi, M.

Plast. 22 (2006) 628 â€“ 653] to study the slow flow of a frictional, dense granular material. Although most models pertain only to the fully developed granular flow, {{the application of the}} dilatant double shearing model is shown to be valid from the onset of granular flow to the fully developed granular flow. In this paper, we use the finite element program ABAQUS/Explicit to numerically simulate the granular Couette flow and the frictional granular flow in a silo. For the granular Couette flow, the relative density variation and the velocity profile obtained by using the dilatant double shearing model are in good quantitative agreement with those obtained from a DEM simulation. For the frictional flow in a silo, the major principal stress directions are obtained at various time steps after the onset of silo discharge. We find that, in the hopper zone, the arching of the granular material between the sloping hopper walls is clearly demonstrated by the change in direction of the major principal stress. We also compare the pressure distribution along the wall before and after the onset of silo discharge. The numerical results show that the dilatant double shearing model is capable of capturing the essential features of the frictional granular flow...|$|R

40|$|Granular {{materials}} are extensively used throughout many industries. In countries like Australia and South Africa, national economies are critically {{dependent on the}} agricultural and mining industries, {{and it is important}} to understand bulk material behaviour in order to handle these materials properly. There are many diverse approaches to modelling granular materials. In this thesis, the Coulomb-Mohr continuum mechanical theory of granular materials is utilised, and some exact analytical solutions are presented for both stress and velocity fields. These solutions are formally valid provided sin? = 1, where ? is the angle of internal friction, and they provide limiting solutions for so called highly frictional granular materials, for which sin? ï¿½ 1. The solutions so obtained are exploited for three real industrial granular problems, namely gravity flow from converging hoppers, the stress distribution in stockpiles and finally, the stress distribution within rat-holes. The flow of granular materials, in the presence of gravity, through a converging hopper is an important problem that occurs in many industrial processes. Here, for highly frictional granular materials for both wedge and conical hopper flows, exact analytical solutions are obtained to determine the stress and velocity fields within the neighborhood of the hopper outlet. For the same problem, these exact solutions are exploited as the leading order terms in a regular perturbation series, where the correction terms are of order 1 - sin?. In this way, approximate analytical solutions are obtained that can be used to describe the behaviour of more realistic granular materials. The practice of storing granular materials in stockpiles occurs throughout the world in many industrial situations. In this thesis, exact solutions for highly frictional granular {{materials are}} used for the determination of the stress distributions within two-dimensional and axially symmetric stockpiles. Stockpile profiles considered here include the standard wedge and cone, as well as two-dimensional parabolic and axially symmetric cubic curved shaped stockpiles. We emphasise that curved stockpiles have not previously been considered in the literature. Our model assumes that the stockpile is composed of two regions, namely an inner rigid region and an outer yield region. The exact solution applies in the outer yield region, which is then extended continuously into the inner rigid region. A rat-hole is the general term used to describe those stable cavities, which frequently occur in <b>storage</b> <b>hoppers</b> and stockpiles, whose formation prevents further material falling through the outlet. In this thesis, we present exact solutions for both two-dimensional and axially symmetric rat-holes, where it is assumed that the highly frictional granular material has flowed through a central outlet, until the point is reached when there is no further flow of material. The remaining material is assumed to be in limiting equilibrium, that is static but on the point of yield. In both two dimensions and axial symmetry, two types of rat-holes are studied. The first type has a sloping upper surface of infinite extent, where the material is resting on a sloping rigid base containing an infinitesimal central outlet. The second type has a curved upper surface, where the material is resting between vertical walls and a horizontal rigid plane containing an infinitesimal central outlet. Again, we emphasise that neither of these rat-hole problems have previously been investigated in the literature.

40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry uniform flow of powders {{is one of the}} most important considerations in solid dosage manufacture. Improper feeding of powders from <b>storage</b> <b>hoppers</b> into dye-presses can lead to inconsistent product quality, causing economic and health impacts. Investigation into the properties affecting powder flow is crucial. There were four objectives of the current research: 1. To determine the effect of moisture on the flow (Jenike flow index, Hausner Ratio and Carr Index, static and dynamic angle of repose) of selected pharmaceutical powders. 2. To study the effect of particle shape and size on Jenike flow index for selected starch and pharmaceutical powders. 3. To determine the effect of mixture compositions on the Jenike flow index of ordered mixtures of selected pharmaceutical powders. 4. To develop a novel flowability tester based on electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) that measures the dynamic angle of repose of powders. To address the first objective, to determine the effect of moisture content on the flow of four pharmaceutical powders; an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), aspartame, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and RespitoseÂ® ML 001 were selected. The API and RespitoseÂ® powders were found to be nonhygroscopic and were tested at near zero moisture contents only (in this case 0. 31 % and 0. 19 % respectively). Aspartame was tested at moisture contents of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 8 % and HPMC at moisture contents of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 10 %. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear index, the Hausner Ratio, the Carr Index and the static and dynamic angles of repose. The Jenike flow index of aspartame increased from 0. 885 to 3. 65 with an increase in moisture content, which was attributed to the formation of large, round agglomerates. The Jenike flow index of HPMC decreased from 3. 28 to 2. 65 with an increase in moisture content, which was attributed to the increasing strength of liquid bridges. The Jenike flow index was the only flowability indicator to capture this complex behaviour. In order to address the second objective, five starches (cow cockle, barley, rye, rice and tapioca), as well as four pharmaceutical ingredients (an API, aspartame, HPMC, and RespitoseÂ® ML 001), were characterised for size and shape, and then tested for flowability. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear test, the most widely accepted flowability standard in {{the pharmaceutical}} industry. It was found that the Jenike flow index decreased linearly with decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing roundness for the powders investigated. It was also determined that particle shape had a greater impact on flowability than size for powders under 30 microns in diameter. To address the third objective, ordered mixtures of pharmaceutical powders were examined to determine their flowability. Six combinations of RespitoseÂ® ML 001, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in varying concentrations were selected for investigation. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear test, the most widely accepted flowability standard in the industry. The Jenike flow indices of the ordered mixtures were indistinguishable from the Jenike flow index of pure RespitoseÂ® at the alpha = 0. 1 level. The fourth objective, to develop a novel flowability tester using electrical capacitance tomography to measure the dynamic angle of repose, was investigated at the same time as the effect of moisture content. It was determined that the results of the novel dynamic angle of repose tester did not correlate well with the Jenike shear test. More development is needed before the novel flowability tester is ready for industrial use. The Jenike shear cell remains the only acceptable flow test for complex flow behaviour...|$|R

40|$|As {{the working}} width of sowing {{implements}} increases, {{the use of}} conventional mechanical seed drills, with hoppers above all the implement working width, has reachedits limits. Any further increase of the working width (more than 4 - 6 m) or the coupling of conventional additional apparatus is expensive, complex and time-consuming. Air-seeding appears thus as the best solution to solve this problem. One <b>storage</b> <b>hopper</b> is able to supply the working width of 24 m or more. However, it should be noticed that to ensure uniform crop growing, a machine needs an accurate, technical solution to ensure seeding material to be distributed across the full implement working width. Indeed, low transversal distribution accuracy {{is one of the}} most important shortcomings of modem air-seeders. Even if air-seeding has been used for more than 50 years, few developments have been carried out on divider headers responsible for distribution accuracy. This paper deals with a study on the influence of divider head geometry and functioning conditions on the seed's distribution accuracy. The first part concerns the study of the influence of the air velocity and the material flow rate on the distribution accuracy. A second study deals with the influence of the outlet closing, of different outlet pipes lengths, of distribution head tightness, of the angle position of distribution heads. Finally the influence of the structural elements such as the pipe elbow, the tower configurations, the tower height and the cone shape deflectors' implementation on the divider lid is proposed. Moreover, observation of the seed's behaviour is undertaken using a high-speed camera system. These experimental results allowed for proposals of hypothesis about the parameters influencing the final result.

40|$|To combat {{adhesion}} loss, sand {{is fired}} into the wheelâ€“rail contact via a hose using compressed air typically from a <b>storage</b> <b>hopper</b> mounted to the under {{frame of the}} train. Many passenger trains in the UK are fitted with stepped braking controllers which range from 1 to 3 with a fourth step being â€˜emergency brakingâ€™. 1 Sand is fired automatically if wheel slip is detected from brake step level 2 upwards. 2 Sand is automatically fired when the emergency brakes are applied irrespective of whether low adhesion/wheel slip has been detected. 2 For adhesion loss in traction, sand can be applied at the driverâ€™s discretion. Current railway standards 2 govern the maximum permissible sand flow rate to protect against wheel/rail isolation of track circuits, but do not address the hose position. This results {{in a range of}} hose set-ups across different train types, some of which may not be effective at delivering sand. The work here was carried out using a full-scale laboratory railâ€“wheel test machine to find the position for the hose and sand flow rates that give optimum sand entrainment to the contact. It was found that ideally the hose should be aimed at the rail or nip and be as close to that contact as safely possible. The use of a 20 [*]mm bore nozzle {{on the end of a}} 25 [*]mm bore hose increased sand passing through the contact by up to 70 % relative to widely used 25 [*]mm bore hoses without a nozzle.

40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is an {{electricity}} generation technology that concentrates solar irradiation through heliostats onto a small area, the receiver, where a {{heat transfer fluid}} is used as heat carrier towards the heat storage and power block. It has been under the spotlight for a decade {{as one of the}} most potential or promising renewable and sustainable energy technology. The use of gas/solid suspensions as heat transfer fluid in CSP has been advocated for the first time in the 1980 's and this novel application relies on its possible use throughout the full CSP plant, i. e. in heat capture, conveying, storage and heat reuse, where it offers major advantages in comparison with water/steam, thermal fluids or molten salt, the current heat transfer fluids. Since the powder suspension has a heat capacity similar to that of molten salts, without temperature limitation except for the maximum allowable wall temperature of the receiver tube, suspension temperatures of about 800 Â°C can be tolerated, with additional high efficiency thermodynamic systems being applicable. This work reviews the development of CSP and assesses both its energy efficiency and the impact of the direct normal solar irradiance on the power yield of a CSP plant. A literature review of fluidized bed systems and their use as heat transfer medium is also included. A novel bubbling fluidized bed concept, the upflow bubbling fluidized bed is selected for use in a solar power tower plant for its excellent heat transfer and potential in moderate to high receiver capacities. Circulating fluidized beds could be interesting for very large scale operations. The selection accounts for sizes, complexity and operating costs. Both upflow bubbling fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed of fine particles feature excellent heat transfer. At the 1 MW solar furnace, PROMES CNRS France reported that a high heat transfer coefficient of 1100 W/mÂ²K was achieved with an upflow bubbling fluidized bed receiver at superficial gas velocities below 0. 2 m/s and solids circulation flux of 10 to 45 kg/mÂ²s. A moderate heat transfer coefficient of 60 to 300 W/mÂ²K was obtained in the circulating fluidized bed operation mode in this PhD. The values of the obtained heat transfer coefficients are dealt with by both empirical and mechanistic modeling approach, with fair to very good agreements obtained. Furthermore, the mechanistic surface renewal model provides guidelines in terms of dimensional scaling up, which is also a major contribution of the PhD. The particle circulation loop throughout the CSP installation is also examined for the remaining sections of the power generation concept, i. e. in the hot and cold <b>storage</b> <b>hoppers,</b> in the boilers of the thermal block, or as direct heat supply to the hot-side heat exchanger of a Stirling engine. Whereas in heat capture, mostly upflow bubbling or circulating fluidized beds seem appropriate, both moving beds or downcomers, and bubbling fluidized beds are recommended in the heat storage and re-use, and experimentally quantified. The novel concepts of thermal energy storage, using latent heat in phase change materials, or storing thermo-chemical heat through using reversible chemical reactions has been investigated with extensive interest. The thermal energy from a solar collection field or from transforming excess renewable electricity from wind turbines into heat can be stored for short or even long terms in such systems. However the concept applied at high temperatures is still at its early stage. Experimental phase change materials research was conducted and results illustrate the effect of different parameters. Another approach to thermal energy storage is the use of reversible chemical reactions, and they can be regenerated through the exothermic reverse reaction process. Unlike sensible or latent heat storage, mostly limited in time due to heat losses, chemical energy storage enables to bridge long duration gaps between supply and demand, hence making it particularly suitable for a stable {{electricity generation}}. Thermodynamic calculations and thermogravimetric analysis were conducted on selected reaction pairs. Results are of fundamental nature only, and it is far too early to imagine a pilot or large-scale application of thermo-chemical storage in the CSP concept. Since phase transformation or chemical reactions are involved, the materials need to be properly contained. The containment is discussed with respect to the selection concerns and criteria. The containing material or geometry should satisfy the required need of being closed and able to withstand the high temperatures envisaged, to resist possible chemical attacks by the contained materials, and to resist the pressure build up during the phase transition or reactions, in which expansion often occurs or gases and vapours are released. The PhD research is concluded by scale-up data and provides a preliminary view into the prospects and the overall economy of the system. Market prospects for both novel concentrated solar power and thermal energy storage applications are expected to be excellent. Although the PhD research provided lab-scale based design methods and equations for the key unit operations of a novel solar power tower CSP concept, there is ample scope for future development of several topics, as finally recommended. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Kurzfassung Innerhalb dieses Beitrags wird die numerische Simulationsmethode der Extended Discrete Element Methode (XDEM) vorgestellt, mit der die Wechselwirkung zwischen Reifen und steinigem Untergrund detailliert beschrieben werden kann. Dabei wird der Reifen als ein Kontinuum betrachtet, das mit der Finiten Element Methode (FEM) abgebildet wird. Der grobkÃ¶rnige Untergrund, wie beispielsweise Sand oder Kies, wird als granulares Medium betrachtet. Dieses kann sehr vorteilhaft mit der Diskreten Element Methode (DEM) behandelt werden, die eine Betrachtung der individuellen Partikel zulÃ¤sst. Basierend auf den Gesetzen von Newton werden Position und Orientierung aller Partikel berechnet, wobei KrÃ¤fte zwischen den Partikeln und dem Reifen berÃ¼cksichtigt werden. KrÃ¤fte zwischen Partikeln und Reifen treten als Randbedingungen in der FEM Struktur des Reifens auf, und fÃ¼hren damit zur Deformation und somit zu Spannungverteilung in der Reifenstrucktur. Eine Integration in der Zeit bestimmt sowohl den Zustand des Untergrunds als auch die Reaktion des Reifens.

Both domains are separated in physical space and numerical simulation domain. The proposed approach is relevant to almost all engineering applications that deal with granular matter such as <b>storage</b> in <b>hoppers,</b> transport on conveyor belts or displacement of granular material as in mixers or excavation of soil. For these applications an engineering device such as mixer blades or cutting tools are in contact with granular matter. Contacts with individual particles generate contact forces that act on both the engineering device and the granular material. The latter experiences a displacement of individual particles whereby the engineering structure responds with deformation and stresses. In order to predict and optimize both the behaviour and motion of granular material and the structures in contact, numerical simulation tools are increasingly employed [1]. Simulations are popular especially because experiments which are often expensive, time- consuming and sometimes even dangerous [2]. The continuous increase in computing power is now enabling researchers to implement numerical methods that do not focus on the granular assembly as an entity, but rather deduce its global characteristics from observing the individual behaviour of each grain. An interaction between granular media and a structure relies on a transfer of forces between them. Granular media consists of an ensemble of particles of which a number of particles may be in contact with a surface e. g. walls as surfaces of solid structures. The contact is resolved similar to inter-particle contacts by a representative overlap. It defines the position of impact {{as well as the}} force acting on the particle at this position. The same force, however, into the opposite direction defines a mechanical load for the structure. In order to determine the effect of forces on the solid structure, it is discretised by finite elements. The impact of the force is transferred to the nodes of the respective surface element and appears as a load for the finite element system. Hence, integrating particle dynamics and the response of the solid structure due to particle impacts advances both new position of particles and corresponding deformation and stress of the solid structure in time. Developing flexible software which is capable of performing simulation in different applications will enable the engineers to focus entirely on their specific problem and hence save them valuable time. This concept is supported by the software tools of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM) and Diffpack. Hence, the solid structure is analysed by the Finite Element Method under load due to the impact of individual particles that changes both in time and space. For this purpose traditional formulations of the Finite Element Method are employed that are available by the commercial multi-physics software package Diffpack. It represents object-oriented hierarchy of classes that provide an excellent interface to introduce external loads from particle impact onto the finite element structure. Diffpack is an object-oriented development environment, which comes as a rich set of C++ classes, for the numerical modelling and solution of arbitrary differential equations. User applications cover a wider range of engineering areas and span from simple educational applications to major product development projects. The behaviour of granular material is represented by the advanced software package of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM), which is based on the Discrete Element Method. It is designed to relieve users from underlying mathematics and software design and allows them to focus on physics and their applications. The software uses object oriented techniques that support objects representing three-dimensional particles of various shapes such as cylinders, discs or tetrahedrons for example, size and material properties. This makes it a highly versatile tool dealing with a large variety of different applications of granular matter arising in the automotive industry, such as road tire interaction. Various force models for the inter- particle and particle-wall contacts are also available. A minimal user interface easily allows extending the software further by adding user-defined impact models or material properties to an already available selection of materials and properties. Thus, the user is relieved of the underlying mathematics or software design, and therefore, is able to direct his focus entirely onto the application. The Discrete Particle Method is written in C++ programming language and works both in Linux and Windows environments...|$|R
