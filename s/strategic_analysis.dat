25|$|The 1839 Treaty of London {{recognised}} Belgium as {{an independent}} and neutral state. Until 1911, Belgian <b>strategic</b> <b>analysis</b> anticipated that if war came, the Germans would attack France across the Franco-German border and trap the French armies against the Belgian frontier, as they had done in 1870. British and French guarantees of Belgian independence were made before 1914 but the possibility of landings in Antwerp was floated by the British military attaché in 1906 and 1911, which led the Belgians {{to suspect that the}} British had come to see Belgian neutrality as a matter of British diplomatic and military advantage, rather than as an end in itself. The Agadir Crisis (1911) left the Belgian government in little doubt as to the risk of a European war and an invasion of Belgium by Germany. In September 1911, a government meeting concluded that Belgium must be prepared to resist a German invasion, to avoid accusations of collusion by the British and French governments. Britain, France and the Netherlands were also to continue to be treated as potential enemies. In 1913 and 1914, the Germans made inquires to the Belgian military attaché in Berlin, about the passage of German military forces through Belgium. If invaded, Belgium would need foreign help but would not treat foreign powers as allies or form objectives beyond the maintenance of Belgian independence. Neutrality forced the Belgian government into a strategy of military independence, based on a rearmament programme begun in 1909, which was expected to be complete in 1926. The Belgian plan was to have three army corps, to reduce the numerical advantage of the German armies over the French, intended to deter a German invasion.|$|E

The necessity of <b>strategic</b> financial <b>analysis</b> of capital as a methodological basis for study strategies is proved in modern conditions of a high level of dynamism, uncertainty and risk. The methodological elements of the <b>strategic</b> financial <b>analysis</b> of capital (the object of investigation, the indicators, the factors, the methods of study, the subjects of analysis, the sources of incoming and outgoing information) are justified in the system of financial management, allowing to improve its theoretical foundations. It is proved that the <b>strategic</b> financial <b>analysis</b> of capital is a continuous process, carried out in an appropriate sequence at each stage of capital circulation. The system of indexes is substantiated, based on the needs of the <b>strategic</b> financial <b>analysis.</b> The classification of factors determining the size and structure of company’s capital is grounded. The economic nature of capital of the company is clarified. We consider that capital is a stock of economic resources in the form of cash, tangible and intangible assets accumulated by savings, which is used by its owner as a factor of production and investment resource in the economic process in order to obtain profit, to ensure the growth of owners’ prosperity and to achieve social effect...|$|R
