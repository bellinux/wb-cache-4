5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
5|$|Under LSWR ownership, the N15s were {{initially}} well received by crews, though the batch soon {{gained a reputation}} for poor steaming on long runs. Through running of the class into Exeter was stopped in favour of engine changes at Salisbury, and Urie attributed the problem to poor driving technique. A series of trial runs changed this assumption, and demonstrated that <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> gradually decreased on the flat. The trials also revealed that the robust construction of the motion produced the heaviest hammerblow of any British locomotive class, and had caused cracked frames on the test locomotive.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of heat {{transfer}} rates performed with an experimental condensation heat exchanger are reported for a corrugated minichannel tube {{and for a}} straight minichannel tube. The two cases were compared at same flow regimes. The corrugation appears advantageous for relatively low <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> and flow rates where much higher {{heat transfer}} rates were observed close to the steam entrance, thus allowing shortening the heat exchanger with the associated advantages of costs lowering and smaller built-up space. At high <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> and high flow rates both tubes performed similarly...|$|R

25|$|Development of {{recovery}} boiler main <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature was rapid at the beginning. By 1955, not even 20 years from birth {{of recovery}} boiler highest steam pressures were 10.0 MPa and 480oC. The pressures and temperatures used then backed downward somewhat due to safety. By 1980 {{there were about}} 700 recovery boilers in the world.|$|E

40|$|Steam is {{the most}} common and {{economical}} way of transferring heat from one location to another. But most steam systems use the header <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> to do the job. The savings are substantially more than just the latent heat differences between the high and low <b>steam</b> <b>pressures.</b> The discussion below shows how the savings in using low <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> can be above 25 %! The key to the savings is not in the heat exchanger equipment or the steam trap, but is back at the powerhouse - the sensible heat requirement of the boiler feed water. Chart III shows potential steam energy savings and will be useful in estimating the steam energy savings of high pressure processes...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{productive}} means of obtaining conservation of energy lies in {{the improvement of the}} fuel-to-steam efficiency of high <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> generating boilers. Boilers operating at <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> of 100 psig and above are viable prospects. A properly designed and installed economizer can increase overall boiler efficiency to 85 to 90 percent. The maximum gain that can be safely achieved is largely governed by corrosion considerations. This paper will discuss economic and practical considerations in the selection and installation of an economizer...|$|R
25|$|Nuclear {{power is}} usually used {{by using a}} nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid such as water, which is then used to create <b>steam</b> <b>pressure,</b> which is {{converted}} into mechanical work {{for the purpose of}} generating electricity or propulsion in water. Today, more than 15% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power, and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built.|$|E
25|$|Watt {{was also}} {{concerned}} with fundamental {{research on the}} functioning of the steam engine. His most notable measuring device, still in use today, is the Watt indicator incorporating a manometer to measure <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> within the cylinder according to the position of the piston, enabling a diagram to be produced representing the pressure of the steam as a function of its volume throughout the cycle.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on August 5, {{conditions}} were nearly ideal for the attack. The tide was running in, so Farragut had his ships reduce <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in order to}} minimize damage if their boilers were hit; he relied on the current to give them speed. The southwest breeze that sprang up would carry smoke from the guns away from the fleet and into the faces of the artillerymen in Fort Morgan.|$|E
30|$|Fire tube boilers are {{the least}} used boilers now-a-days. In this, {{combustion}} products and high temperature gases flow in the tubes and water to be vaporized flows around these tubes [6]. The capacity of these boilers is up to 12, 000  kg/h. They produce low to medium <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 18  kg/cm 2 [7, 8].|$|R
50|$|The DRG H 02 1001 was a {{remarkable}} high-pressure steam locomotive, built by the engineering firm of Schwarzkopff {{to the design of}} Dr L. Löffler. The aim was not only to improve fuel economy - the usual reason for adopting high <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> - but also {{to increase the amount of}} power that could be produced within the German loading gauge.|$|R
50|$|The {{digestibility}} of the {{sorghum starch}} is relatively poor in its unprocessed form, varying between 33 and 48%. Processing of the grain by {{methods such as}} <b>steaming,</b> <b>pressure</b> cooking, flaking, puffing or micronization of the starch increases the digestibility of sorghum starch. This {{has been attributed to}} a release of starch granules from the protein matrix, rendering them more susceptible to enzymatic digestion.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{pressure}} in the boiler can be monitored by a gauge mounted in the cab and excessive <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> can be released manually by the driver or fireman. Alternatively, in conditions of high boiler pressure, a safety valve may be triggered to reduce pressure and prevent the boiler bursting violently, which had previously resulted in injuries and fatalities to nearby individuals, as well as extensive damage to the locomotive and nearby structures.|$|E

The bag is typically partially folded {{when it is}} placed in a microwave oven, and inflates {{as a result of}} <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> from the heated kernels. The earliest patent for the popcorn bag, U.S. patent #4,267,420 was filed on October 12, 1978 by William A. Brastad of Minneapolis and issued on May 12, 1981.|$|E
25|$|Primarily {{powered by}} coal, Britannia had oil {{sprayers}} installed during her construction, as {{did all of}} her sisters except , {{the first time this}} had been done in British battleships.

25|$|At 07:00 JST on 12 March, Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Daiichi {{director}} Masao Yoshida why {{his workers}} were not opening the valves to release rising <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> within the reactor. Yoshida answered {{that they could}} not open the electrical valves because of the power failure and the radiation was too high to send workers to manually open the valves. Nevertheless, with the pressure and temperatures continuing to rise, at 09:15, TEPCO sent workers to begin manually opening the valves. The high radiation slowed the work and the valves were not opened until 14:30.|$|E

40|$|A {{heat storage}} {{system that is}} used to {{generate}} steam directly by exploiting the dissolution phenomenon between CaBr 2 and water was studied. The performance of the system in terms of the coefficient of performance (COP) or volumetric heat capacity (VHC) yielded maximal values for the amount of water supplied. The COP was 0. 072 to 0. 115 for <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> of 20 - 50 kPa at x = 7. 5. VHC values recorded were 177. 2 to 250. 1 kJ/l for <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> of 20 - 50 kPa at x = 7. 5. This calculation was validated by comparing the calculated value with the experimental result. The pressure settled at the equilibrium state for a very short duration at the heat release step, proving that the dissolution phenomenon involved a high mass transfer rate and was able to transform the heat of dissolution into enthalpy of steam. The amount of steam generated in the experiment conformed very well to the calculations, thus validating the calculation method. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

25|$|Uniquely {{among the}} coal-powered King Edward VII-class ships, New Zealand {{did not have}} oil {{sprayers}} installed during her construction; their installation in the other seven ships {{was the first time}} this had been done in British battleships and allowed <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> to be increased rapidly, improving acceleration. The eight ships between them were given four different boiler installations for comparative purposes; New Zealands outfit of 12 (or 18, according to some sources) Niclausse boilers and three cylindrical boilers allowed her to exceed her designed speed on trials, but installation of oil sprayers was impractical in Niclausse boilers.|$|E
25|$|In active {{volcanic}} zones such as Yellowstone National Park, {{water may}} be heated by coming {{into contact with}} magma (molten rock). The high temperature gradient near magma may cause water to be heated enough that it boils or becomes superheated. If the water becomes so hot that it builds <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> and erupts in a jet above {{the surface of the}} Earth, it is called a geyser. If the water only reaches the surface in the form of steam, it is called a fumarole. If the water is mixed with mud and clay, it is called a mud pot.|$|E
25|$|A steam {{locomotive}} is normally controlled from the boiler's backhead, {{and the crew}} is usually protected from the elements by a cab. A crew {{of at least two}} people is normally required to operate a {{steam locomotive}}. One, the train driver or engineer (North America), is responsible for controlling the locomotive's starting, stopping and speed, and the fireman is responsible for maintaining the fire, regulating <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> and monitoring boiler and tender water levels. Due to the historical loss of operational infrastructure and staffing, preserved steam locomotives operating on the mainline will often have a support crew travelling with the train.|$|E
50|$|High-pressure {{locomotives}} {{were much}} more complicated than conventional designs. It was {{not simply a matter of}} building a normal fire-tube boiler with suitably increased strength and stoking harder. Structural strength requirements in the boiler shell make this impractical; it becomes impossibly thick and heavy. For high <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> the water-tube boiler is universally used. The steam drums and their interconnecting tubes are of relatively small diameter with thick walls and therefore much stronger.|$|R
50|$|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) {{had been}} founded in 1880 in {{response}} to the boiler explosions that had become common as the use of steam power expanded during the Industrial Revolution. Between 1880 and 1890 there were over 2000 boiler explosions in the United States. By 1890, some 100,000 boilers were in service, many of them unsafe. Inspections were rare, and operating guidelines almost nonexistent. <b>Steam</b> <b>pressures</b> were regularly cranked up to produce additional work.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that tension applied to fabric {{which is then}} {{permanently}} set by <b>steaming</b> under <b>pressure</b> {{for a short time}} has a significant effect on fabric dimensional properties.
