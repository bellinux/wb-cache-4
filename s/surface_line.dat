5|$|Only {{two more}} Windows RT devices, the Microsoft Surface 2 and Nokia Lumia 2520 in late-2013, were {{released}} {{outside of the}} five original launch devices, and no Windows RT counterpart of the Surface Pro 3 was released due to a re-positioning of the <b>Surface</b> <b>line</b> into a high-end market, and a switch to Intel architecture for the Surface 3. These developments left Microsoft's future support of the platform in doubt. As of February 2015, {{with the end of}} production for both Surface 2 and Lumia 2520, Microsoft and its subsidiaries no longer manufacture any Windows RT devices.|$|E
5|$|As part of Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, {{between the}} city and the BRT, a three-track {{elevated}} railway was built above the Culver Line from the Fifth Avenue Elevated southeast and south to Coney Island. At Ninth Avenue, the elevated replacements for the Culver Line and West End Line met, with access from both lines to the Fifth Avenue Elevated and Fourth Avenue Subway to the northwest. At 3:00a.m. on March 16, 1919, the first portion of the new elevated structure opened from Ninth Avenue southeast and south to Kings Highway. Except for the omission of a station at 15th Avenue, all of the station locations from the <b>surface</b> <b>line</b> were preserved as elevated stations. The Culver Line was operated as a branch of the Fifth Avenue Elevated, with a free transfer at Ninth Avenue to the West End Line into the Fourth Avenue Subway. An extension to Avenue X was opened at noon on May 10, 1919. The line, the last of the four to Coney Island, was completed on May 1, 1920, at which time the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was forced to cut the fare from ten to five cents. This construction tied into the existing lower level of the BMT Brighton Line east of West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium. Some Culver Line (5) trains began using the Fourth Avenue Subway to the Nassau Street Loop in Lower Manhattan when that line opened on May 30, 1931; the Fifth Avenue Elevated was closed on May 31, 1940, in conjunction with the unification of the transit system under city operations. Trolleys continued to use the surface tracks on McDonald Avenue until October 30, 1956.|$|E

25|$|The Glasgow Central Railway was {{authorised}} as {{an independent}} company to build a <b>surface</b> <b>line</b> from Rutherglen to Maryhill. It encountered fierce opposition, and the scheme {{was taken over by}} the Caledonian and converted into a route mainly in tunnel. It opened in 1896, further encouraging suburban passenger travel. It closed in 1959 but re-opened (as the Argyle Line) in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Connecting the new Philadelphia Branch to {{the rest}} of the B system was a {{considerable}} engineering challenge. A new <b>surface</b> <b>line</b> across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the outskirts of town would have required massive regrading and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on carfloats, but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.|$|E
25|$|Although {{two other}} London Underground lines operate fully underground, the Northern line {{is unusual in}} that it is a deep-level tube line that serves the outer suburbs of South London yet there is only one station above ground (Morden tube station) while the rest of this part of the line is deep below ground. The short section to Morden depot is also above ground. This is partly because its {{southern}} extension into the outer suburbs was not done by taking over an existing <b>surface</b> <b>line</b> as was generally the case with routes like the Central, Jubilee and Piccadilly lines. Apart from the core central underground tunnels, part of the section between Hendon and Colindale is also underground. As bicycles are not allowed in tunnel sections (even if no station is in that section) as they would hinder evacuation, they are limited to High Barnet – East Finchley, the Mill Hill East branch, Edgware – Colindale and Hendon Central – Golders Green. There are also time-based restrictions for the sections where bicycles are allowed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{possible}} {{heat release}} rates of fires resulting from burning combustibles in 900 karaoke music compartments of 19 local karaokes were studied. Combustibles of concern are furniture foam, partitions and <b>surface</b> <b>lining</b> materials. Equations {{appearing in the}} literature for calculating the heat release rates of these combustibles are used. Heat release rates of furniture foams were studied first, followed by igniting <b>surface</b> <b>lining</b> materials classified under the Swedish system. The likelihood of flashover in those 900 karaoke music compartments was then investigated. Further, the total heat release rate curves for burning foam, <b>surface</b> <b>lining</b> materials and carpets are studied using the results reported in the literature. Based on this study, it is recommended to select furniture foam with less heat release rates upon burning, and replace timber <b>surface</b> <b>lining</b> materials as soon as possible. As an urgent action, a good fire safety management scheme “tailor-made ” for individual karaokes is to be implemented...|$|R
25|$|The present New York City Subway {{system is}} {{composed}} of three formerly separate systems that merged in 1940: the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), and the Independent Subway System (IND). The privately held IRT, founded in 1902, constructed and operated the first underground railway line in New York City. The opening of the first line on October 27, 1904 is commonly cited as {{the opening of the}} modern New York City Subway, although some elevated lines of the IRT and BMT that were initially incorporated into the New York City Subway system but then demolished predate this. The oldest sections of elevated lines still in operation were built in 1885. The BMT, founded in 1923 and also privately held, was formed from the bankruptcy of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. The IND was created by the City of New York in 1921 to be a municipally owned competitor of the two private companies. Unification in June 1940 by the New York City Board of Transportation brought the three systems under one operator. The New York City Transit Authority, created in 1953 to be a public benefit corporation that acquired the rapid transit and <b>surface</b> <b>line</b> (buses and streetcars) infrastructure of the Board of Transportation, remains the operator of the New York City Subway today.|$|E
25|$|The West 5th Street Depot {{was located}} at the {{northwest}} corner of West 5th Street and Surf Avenue in Coney Island, Brooklyn, adjacent to the Brighton Beach neighborhood, and across from the current New York Aquarium, as well as near the former Luna Park amusement park. It was originally the site of a railroad and trolley terminal called the Culver Depot, built by the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad, operators of the Culver <b>surface</b> <b>line</b> along present-day McDonald Avenue in 1875. This depot was built on Surf Avenue between West 5th Street and West 8th Street, serving surface railroad and later Brighton and Culver elevated trains, as well as streetcars. The terminal also served the streetcar lines of the competing Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad, including its Smith Street Line. A second adjacent facility on West 5th Street, also known as the Smith Street Trolley Depot, was built by the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad in 1912 exclusively for streetcars. Both streetcar companies as well as the Culver and Brighton lines would become part of the BRT by middle of the decade. By 1920, all elevated trains were moved west to the BRT's West End Depot, and the original Culver terminal was razed in 1923, with all streetcar service going to the West 5th Street Depot. As a streetcar facility, it featured a concrete storage garage at its north end, and a two-floor passenger terminal building at its south end facing Surf Avenue, with seven track loops {{in the center of the}} complex for terminating streetcars. The passenger concourse featured a restaurant, and a carousel which would later be moved to Manhattan to become the Central Park Carousel. The depot would be absorbed into municipal operations during unification in 1940.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineering}} of the Morden {{extension of}} the C from Clapham Common to Morden was more demanding, running in tunnels to a point just north of Morden station, which was constructed in a cutting. The line then runs under the wide station forecourt and public road outside the station, to the depot. The extension was initially planned to continue to Sutton over part of the route for the unbuilt Wimbledon and Sutton Railway, in which the UERL held a stake, but agreements were made with the Southern Railway to end the extension at Morden. The Southern Railway later built the <b>surface</b> <b>line</b> from Wimbledon to Sutton, via South Merton and St. Helier. The tube extension opened in 1926, with seven new stations, all designed by Charles Holden in a modern style. Originally, Stanley Heaps was to design the stations, but after seeing these designs Frank Pick, Assistant Joint Manager of the UERL, decided Holden should take over the project. With the exception of Morden and Clapham South, where more land was available, the new stations were built on confined corner sites at main road junctions in areas that had been already developed. Holden made good use of this limited space and designed impressive buildings. The street-level structures are of white Portland stone with tall double-height ticket halls, with the famous London Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels in large glazed screens. The stone columns framing the glass screens are surmounted by a capital formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. The large expanses of glass above the entrances ensure that the ticket halls are bright and, lit from within at night, welcoming. The first and last new stations on the extension, Clapham South and Morden, include a parade of shops and were designed with structures capable of being built above (like many of the earlier central London stations). Clapham South was extended upwards soon after its construction with a block of apartments; Morden was extended upwards in the 1960s with a block of offices. All the stations on the extension, except Morden itself, are Grade II listed buildings.|$|E
