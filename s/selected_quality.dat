According to historian D. M. Siegel: [...] "He was not a practitioner of the more sophisticated techniques of nineteenth-century mathematical physics; {{he did not even}} make use of the functional notation in dealing with spectral distributions." [...] He made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper, though he did refer to conservation of vis viva. He proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated. He applied the Helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material. He concluded that his experiments showed that, in the interior of an enclosure in thermal equilibrium, the radiant heat, reflected and emitted combined, leaving any part of the surface, regardless of its substance, was the same as would have left that same portion of the surface if it had been composed of lamp-black. He did not mention the possibility of ideally perfectly reflective walls; in particular he noted that highly polished real physical metals absorb very slightly.|$|E

Swinford worked on his program for several generations, and came to receive significant recognition for his work in various books and journals., but unfortunately Dr. Swinford died in November 1971 before solidifying the future of his creation. For this reason, some people question the long term success of his program, but despite this questioning his work played a significant influential role in re-igniting the interest by some individuals and as a result there has been a resurrection of the Bandog name.|$|E

He did not state explicitly that the lamp-black-coated bodies that he used as reference must have had a unique common spectral emittance function that depended on temperature in a unique way.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the topic of fulfilment of <b>selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards for social services in care homes for the elderly. The theoretical part of the piece of work deals with defining the terms pertaining to the quality standards of social services in care homes for the elderly. These are the terms ?old age?, ?need?, ?care home for the elderly?, ?social services?, ?quality standards?, and ?client?. The aim of the dissertation was to map the fulfilment and realisation of <b>selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards in care homes for the elderly. Partial aims were {{to determine the extent of}} fulfilment of quality standards from the point of view of the client and to compare the individual levels of application of the quality standards for social services. Two care homes were chosen for the study, the Care Home for the Elderly Tep in Veselí nad Lužnicí and the Care Home for the Elderly in Horní Stropnice. Two hypotheses were established. Quantitative research was chosen to facilitate reaching the aims and verifying the hypotheses, utilising questioning methods, interviewing techniques and questionnaire enquiry. Furthermore, analysing the data was accomplished using secondary document analysis. The research file contained the clients and staff of both selected care homes for the elderly. Following the evaluation of the results I believe that the aims of the dissertation were fulfilled. <b>Selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards are realised well in both care homes for the elderly and the essential criteria of individual quality standards are fulfilled as well. In addition, the research study proved both hypotheses to be correct. <b>Selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards are fulfilled from the point of view of the clients and at the same time applied in accordance with their needs. The dissertation can provide the selected care homes for the elderly with feedback regarding the fulfilment and realisation of <b>selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards of social services.
