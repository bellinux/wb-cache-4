40|$|The rapidly {{solidified}} prealloyed {{alpha brass}} powder {{with a size}} range of 40 to 100 μm produced by water atomization process was consolidated using liquid phase sintering process. The relationships between sintering temperature, physic-mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics were investigated. Maximum densification was obtained at 930 °C, under 600 MPa compacting pressure, with 60 min holding time. The microstructure of the <b>sintered</b> <b>brass</b> was influenced by dezincification and structural coarsening during supersolidus liquid phase sintering. As a consequence of Kirkendall effect atomic motion between Cu and Zn atoms caused to dezincification at the grain boundaries and formation of ZnO particles on the pore surfaces. It was concluded that microstructural analysis is in a well agreement with obtained physical and mechanical properties. Also, the amount of liquid phase, which depends on sintering temperature, results in different load bearing cross section areas, and it affects the type of fracture morphologies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bulk {{metallic}} glass (BMG) composites combining a Cu 54 Ni 6 Zr 22 Ti 18 matrix with brass powders or Zr 62 Al 8 Ni 13 Cu 17 {{metallic glass}} powders were fabricated by spark plasma <b>sintering.</b> The <b>brass</b> powders and Zr-based metallic glass powders added for {{the enhancement of}} plasticity are well distributed homogeneously in the Cu-based metallic glass matrix after consolidation. The matrix of the BMG composite remains as a fully amorphous structure after spark plasma sintering. The BMG composites show macroscopic plasticity after yielding, and the plastic strain increased to around 2 % without a decrease in strength for the composite material containing 20 vol % Zr-based amorphous powders. The proper combination of strength and plasticity in the BMG composites was obtained by introducing a second phase in the metallic glass matrix...|$|R
40|$|Deformation {{processing}} of alloys with limited workability {{is one of}} the principal technological challenges for the metal manufacturing industry. Traditional processes (rolling, extrusion) are usually performed at high temperatures (0. 5 Tm) for increased plasticity and crack-free products, which makes them costly, energy intensive and raw material inefficient. In this thesis, extrusion machining (EM) a shear-type deformation process is applied to alloys with limited workability for sheet and foil production from bulk forms in a single step. EM is shown to have a narrowly confined deformation zone with much wider control of deformation than in conventional deformation processing (e. g., severe plastic deformation). Controllable deformation parameters include strain, strain rate, hydrostatic pressure, temperature and deformation path. These attributes are highlighted in deformation {{processing of}} two classes of limited workability alloys: 1) Alloys with intrinsic susceptibility to cracking (and segmentation) due to flow localization and shear band formation and 2) Alloys with extrinsic susceptibility to cracking due to macroscopic defects such as porosity, casting defects and weak second phases. Magnesium AZ 31 alloy is selected as a model material for the first class and <b>sintered</b> copper, cast <b>brass</b> alloy 360 and cast Mg AZ 31 are selected for the second class. Noteworthy features of the process are: suppression of segmentation by combinations of high hydrostatic pressures (p/ 2 k 3 ̆e 1. 2) and deformation temperatures (T 3 ̆e 0. 5 Tm) realized by in-situ plastic heating, realization of a range of strains and deformation rates, engineering of microstructures ranging from conventional to ultrafine grained, shear type deformation textures (non-basal in the case of Mg AZ 31) and creation of sheet from the bulk in a single step of deformation without pre-heating. The thermo-mechanical conditions and microstructural processes (e. g. continuous dynamic recrystallization for Mg AZ 31) that are responsible for continuous and sound sheet products are established. Guidelines for scalability and cost-effectiveness of EM for commercial production are analyzed and discussed. ...|$|R
