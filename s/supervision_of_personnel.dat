40|$|ABSTRACT Environmentally {{sustainable}} {{process technology}} {{is an international}} Master’s Programme, which has been offered by Chalmers since 1997. This programme {{has been established in}} order to meet the needs and demands of engineers having both the knowledge and the skills required to design, develop, and improve processes which are environmentally sustainable as well as economically sound. This means that the effluent from processes should be minimised, the processes themselves should be as energy-efficient as possible, and the products must be economically competitive. A part of this programme is concerned with a case study, giving the students the opportunity to apply their knowledge in practice. In this paper one of the case studies carried out in 1997 is presented. The study deals with waste-water treatment of the ethylenediamine plant at AKZO-NOBEL in Stenungsund, Sweden. This case study was performed by a group of students under <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> from Chalmers and industry. The progress of the project and the learning outcomes were controlled in different ways by the supervisors in co-operation with the group co-ordinator.

40|$|AbstractMethoxyflurane (MOF) a haloether, is an {{inhalation}} analgesic {{agent for}} emergency relief of pain by self administration in conscious patients with trauma and associated pain. It is administered under <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> trained in its use. As {{a consequence of}} supervised use, intermittent occupational exposure can occur. An occupational exposure limit has not been established for methoxyflurane. Human clinical and toxicity data have been reviewed and used to derive an occupational exposure limit (referred to as a maximum exposure level, MEL) according to modern principles. The data set for methoxyflurane is complex given its historical use as anaesthetic. Distinguishing clinical investigations of adverse health effects following high and prolonged exposure during anaesthesia to assess relatively low and intermittent exposure during occupational exposure requires an evidence based approach to the toxicity assessment and determination of a critical effect and point of departure. The principal target organs are the kidney and {{the central nervous system}} and there have been rare reports of hepatotoxicity, too. Methoxyflurane is not genotoxic based on in vitro bacterial mutation and in vivo micronucleus tests and it is not classifiable (IARC) as a carcinogenic hazard to humans. The critical effect chosen for development of a MEL is kidney toxicity. The point of departure (POD) was derived from the concentration response relationship for kidney toxicity using the benchmark dose method. A MEL of 15  ppm (expressed as an 8  h time weighted average (TWA)) was derived. The derived MEL is at least 50 times higher than the mean observed TWA (0. 23  ppm) for ambulance workers and medical staff involved in supervising use of Penthrox. In typical treatment environments (ambulances and treatment rooms) that meet ventilation requirements the derived MEL is at least 10 times higher than the modelled TWA (1. 5  ppm or less) and the estimated short term peak concentrations are within the MEL. The odour threshold for MOF of 0. 13 – 0. 19  ppm indicates that the odour is detectable well below the MEL. Given the above considerations the proposed MEL is health protective...|$|E

40|$|Many {{policy-makers}} {{and health}} economists {{are interested in}} designing and implementing user fee/quality improvement programs in public facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa on a national scale. This research addresses two design issues for a national program: (1) to what extent would user fees finance the costs of quality improvements, and (2) whether a uniform program could be implemented throughout the country or the user fees should differ between {{urban and rural areas}} or across health regions. A national survey was conducted to determine the population's willingness and ability to pay for seven quality improvements: (1) facility maintenance, (2) <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel,</b> and drugs to treat (3) diarrheal diseases, (4) acute respiratory infections (ARI), (5) malaria, (6) intestinal parasites, and (7) sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Willingness to pay for quality improvements was measured by contingent valuation techniques in which subjects were asked about expenditures for care at government facilities under a hypothetical user fee/quality improvement program. Ability to pay was measured by monthly expenditures for health care as a percentage of monthly household consumption. The majority of the population was willing to pay the cost of the quality improvements, which ranged from U. S. $ 0. 40 to U. S. $ 4. 00. Estimates of the percentage of the population that was willing to pay the cost of the quality improvements ranged from 81 % for facility maintenance (an improvement with the lowest cost) to 64 % for drugs to treat ARI (the improvement with the highest cost). The median willingness to pay ranged from U. S. $ 7. 98 for drugs to treat malaria to U. S. $ 16. 61 for drugs to treat diarrheal diseases. Willingness to pay was greater in rural areas than in urban areas. It was also greater in Health Region I than in Health Regions IV and V. The population was able to pay the estimated cost of all seven quality improvements. Median monthly health care expenditures per episode of illness was 2. 6 % of median monthly household consumption. In comparison, the estimated cost of the quality improvements ranged from 0. 2 to 2. 4 % median monthly household consumption. The national user fee/quality improvement program has good prospects for financing the quality improvements because {{the majority of the population}} is willing to pay the estimated costs of the quality improvements and more than half of the population is willing to pay substantially more than the costs. It also appears that the user fees should differ between urban and rural areas and across some health regions. user fees quality of care child survival contingent valuation health care finance...|$|E
40|$|A burning {{sense of}} {{optimism}} {{at the start of}} a new business venture can quickly turn to ashes of disappointment when things go wrong. The best policy is to limit the potential for disaster by careful initial planning, to make provision for the inevitable setbacks and to strive at all times to keep ahead of the competition. Nowhere is this more likely to be essential than in the crowded and competitive field of small-scale agro-processing. If successful, such enterprises can help to add value to local agricultural produce, stimulate off-farm business activity in rural areas and kick-start a thriving rural-based economy. In the Koumassi district of Douala, Cameroon, the price of a cooked cob of maize may vary by as much as 50 % within 300 yards. Intense competition drives down the price to a level at which it may no longer make economic sense to go on trying to sell it. If there is little investment in buildings, equipment or packaging the loss of profit may be bearable, and at least one can eat the merchandise, but for a small business struggling to meet loan repayments on capital investment, competition of this sort will be disastrous. In any new agro-processing venture, choice of product is of paramount importance but it is by no means the only consideration. Budding entrepreneurs will need to turn their thoughts to finance, personnel, training, sourcing raw materials, location, packaging, marketing, management and many other larger or smaller worries that beset any new enterprise and threaten its survival. The first consideration must be the consumer of the end product. It is important to know what is already available to consumers, whether there are indications of their preferences and whether demand is being met. Any competition within an established product range will have to be based on price or quality or both. Many businesses grow from very small-scale, even domestic, production of a popular food, with production expanded to meet growing demand locally, regionally or even nationally. A study supported by CTA and CIRAD (the French Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement) suggests that products that are successful in one region of a country may stand a good chance of being introduced successfully elsewhere. In Cameroon, for example, some types of pre-cooked food products can be found throughout the country, whereas others are limited to either the north or the south. Whilst the first person on the scene with a new product may have the advantage of facing no immediate competition, the challenge will be to overcome customers' established preferences. Preferences within regional rural areas tend to remain conservative, but the big new markets are in the rapidly expanding towns and cities where regional differences become diluted. Developments outside the control of individuals may open up market opportunities. For example, devaluation of the CFA franc pushed up the price of imported bottled drinks in francophone West Africa, giving local producers an unexpected advantage. It may be a good idea to start local manufacture of a popular imported foodstuff, but the technology or process may not be entirely straightforward. Popcorn, for example, can only be made from certain varieties of maize and these may not be available locally and would therefore have to be specially introduced and grown for the purpose. Money matters Business developments invariably cost money and obtaining credit for buying equipment, hiring labour, purchasing raw materials, packaging etc., is likely to be a major challenge. Banks do not lend money unless they are very confident that the business will be successful. Since a new business cannot provide previous years' accounts to demonstrate profitability, a business plan will be required and most people will need professional help in compiling such a plan. If it meets the bank's requirements, collateral will, of course, also be required to secure any loan. For this reason many people turn to relatives, friends or to informal loan arrangements such as, for example, tontines (a form of friendly society in francophone Africa) if they are unable to finance their business developments from their own personal resources. It may be necessary to consider whether a processing business should be located near to the supply of raw materials or near to the market. Location may also depend on where suitable premises can be found and, perhaps, on the reliability of the electricity supply. A high proportion of those interviewed for the CTA/CIRAD study stated that electricity cuts were their biggest problem. Perishability of goods, either raw or processed, will be another consideration. A processing unit may have to limit its production not for lack of customers, but because the goods are perishable and cannot reach more distant markets with sufficient shelf-life remaining. This is more likely to happen as businesses become larger, and those hoping to expand from a local to a national market often find their plans thwarted by an inadequate distribution system. Owners of successful businesses will be fully conscious of the pressure to employ relatives, and friends of relatives, but to remain successful the advantages and disadvantages of employing family members will have to be very carefully weighed. Training and <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> will be necessary to ensure that product quality is consistent. This relates not only to taste and appearance but also to size and weight of packs and availability. Repeat business is the easiest to gain but the easiest to lose if products fail to meet expectations. Satisfied customers make the best marketing team a business can have. Packaging requirements will depend upon the product and on the market being targeted but may be a decisive factor in a product's success or failure. Legislation will have to be complied with, not only to ensure product safety but also to provide consumers with information to which they may be entitled relating to ingredients and weight. Careful planning, and reliable information on which to base that planning, are essential for any business, but if an agro-processing venture is well planned there is no reason why it should not succeed. There will always be a market for food products that match consumers' needs for quality and convenience at an affordable price. A burning {{sense of optimism}} {{at the start of a}} new business venture can quickly turn to ashes of disappointment when things go wrong. The best policy is to limit the potential for disaster by careful initial planning, to make provision for the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: By industrialization, work-related {{accidents}} {{emerged as}} one of the most threatening factors of human life therefore analyzing the causes of accidents and providing control measures to prevent reoccurrence of similar accidents are of crucial importance.   Method and Materials: This is an analytical-descriptive study in which the collected data were analyzed using Ishikawa and SCAT methods and results related to the relationships between variables were examined. In this sense, first, accidents leading to amputations associated with operating with press machines (stuck between two objects) were analyzed by Ishikawa method and the obtained causes were classified into three groups: direct causes, interface causes, and root causes. Then, the obtained causes and the control measures were placed in SCAT table. The effect of causes of accidents and their ranking were determined using Chi-Square Test and Friedman's test, respectively. Accordingly, appropriate control measures were provided based on the accidents causes.   Results: The most significant interface causes is hurry at work the most significant root causes is inappropriate and ineffective supervision and the most important control measures is establishing effective HSE management system in the organization.   Conclusion: According to results, the main interfce causes of accidents leading to amputation due to operating with press machines is hurry at work because of increased production volume particularly by contractor companies.

Background.   Studies about how ‘patient participation’ appears in the context of special care units for persons with dementia are lacking. Design.   The study has an explorative design. Method.   Grounded theory was chosen. Data collection was carried out by means of open observations and additional conversations with residents and personnel. Simultaneously, data analysis was performed with open, axial and selective coding. Findings.   The findings showed that ‘patient participation’ concerned ‘A matter of presence’ as the core category. The other categories described as ‘presence of personnel’ and ‘presence of residents’, were strongly connected to the core category as well as to each other. Presence <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> comprised three levels; being there in body, which required physical presence; being there in mind, which required presence with all senses based on knowledge and competence; and being there in morality which was understood as being fully present, as it was based on humanistic values and included the two other levels. Presence of residents comprised ‘ability and wish’ and ‘adaptation’. The presence <b>of</b> the <b>personnel</b> had a huge impact on the ability and will to participate of the residents. Organizational conditions concerning leadership, amount <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> and routines as well as housing conditions concerning architecture and shared accommodation, could stimulate or hinder ‘patient participation’.
