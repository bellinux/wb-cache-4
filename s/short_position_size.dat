The snout may be <b>shorter.</b> The <b>position</b> and <b>size</b> of the tusks {{may also be}} altered. The ears, cheeks and eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced {{the issue of how}} to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the nature}} (capital or revenue) {{of the proceeds}} arising {{from the use of}} <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in South African hedge fund fundamental paired trades. Hedge funds, which typically avail themselves of an array of alternative investment strategies such as short selling in addition to the traditional asset classes, were recently brought into the South African investment regulatory net. This was achieved by classifying regulated hedge funds as a separate category of collective investment scheme in terms of the CISCA. This categorisation brought regulated hedge funds into the ambit of section 25 BA of the Income Tax Act which carries an important distinction between amounts of a capital nature and amounts of a revenue nature. Given that hedge funds may use <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> for both profit-seeking and risk-mitigation purposes, the resulting proceeds from short sales could be capital or revenue in nature from a tax perspective based on the surrounding facts of the trade. The onus of discharging the proof that the proceeds resulting from a short sale are capital in nature is significant. The South African case law emphasises the importance of applying the various principles to the specific facts of the case. The importance of the dominant intention of the trade is highlighted, given the potentially competing purposes of profit-seeking and risk-mitigation present. Factors that should be analysed in such a scenario include the overall portfolio <b>positioning,</b> the <b>size</b> of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> relative to each other, the degree of specificity of the risk that the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> purports to hedge against, the manner of re-investment of the short sale proceeds, the level of trading activity in the hedge fund, the level of <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in the hedge fund, the absolute sizes of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> {{in the context of the}} overall portfolio, the exposure of the hedge fund to the long position after the close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position,</b> the manner of close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> and the holding period of the <b>short</b> <b>position.</b> While the analysis reveals factors that may be indicative of capital treatment, the classification of short sale proceeds as capital or revenue in nature remains a challenging task to undertake due to the potentially wide variety of facts and circumstances and the potential for undesirable consequences should an incorrect classification be made. Consequently, improved clarity through the provision of de jure guidance as to the nature of short sale proceeds would be welcome...|$|R

Instead, the returns in the long positions are composed of the capital gains (the differences in prices), the coupon paid and the reinvestment of the coupon at the risk free rate. As our point of view is a fund manager who takes both positions with the fund’s endowment, neither long nor <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> need additional funding.|$|R

40|$|Recently many {{mutual funds}} have created hedge fund-like {{products}} for marketing to retail investors.

Based {{on the information}} ratio, market neutral and long/short equity funds have higher risk-adjusted returns than a passive index fund. However, hedge fund-like mutual funds in general add no value for investors, based on either unconditional or conditional four-factor alphas, even in a down market. While <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> taken by these funds do generate alpha, the gain from <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> is not sufficiently large to offset the loss from long positions.

40|$|The Chicago Board of Trade Treasury Bond Futures Contract {{allows the}} <b>short</b> <b>position</b> several {{delivery}} options {{as to when}} and with which bond the contract will be settled.
