40|$|Two novel {{regenerated}} {{solvent extraction}} processes are examined. The first process {{has the potential}} to reduce the energy costs inherent in the recovery of low-volatility carboxylic acids from dilute aqueous solutions. The second process has the potential for reducing the energy costs required for separate recovery of ammonia and acid gases (e. g. CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S) from industrial <b>sour</b> <b>waters.</b> The recovery of carboxylic acids from dilute aqueous solution can be achieved by extraction with tertiary amines. An approach for regeneration and product recovery from such extracts is to back-extract the carboxylic acid with a water-soluble, volatile tertiary amine, such as trimethylamine. The resulting trimethylammonium carboxylate solution can be concentrated and thermally decomposed, yielding the product acid and the volatile amine for recycle. Experimental work was performed with lactic acid, succinic acid, and fumaric acid. Equilibrium data show near-stoichiometric recovery of the carboxylic acids from an organic solution of Alamine 336 into aqueous solutions of trimethylamine. For fumaric and succinic acids, partial evaporation of the aqueous back extract decomposes the carboxylate and yields the acid product in crystalline form. The decomposition of aqueous solutions of trimethylammonium lactates was not carried out to completion, due to the high water solubility of lactic acid and the tendency of the acid to self-associate. The separate recovery of ammonia and acid gases from <b>sour</b> <b>waters</b> can be achieved by combining steam-stripping of the acid gases with simultaneous removal of ammonia by extraction with a liquid cation exchanger. The use of di- 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid as the liquid cation exchanger is explored in this work. Batch extraction experiments were carried out to measure the equilibrium distribution ratio of ammonia between an aqueous buffer solution and an organic solution of the phosphinic acid (0. 2 N) in Norpar 12. The concentration-based distribution ratios increase from 0. 11 to 0. 46 as the aqueous phase pH increases from 7. 18 to 8. 15.

The possible application of partial nitritation SHARON (Single reactor for High activity Ammonium Removal Over Nitrite) coupled with autotrophic ANAMMOX (ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation) or heterotrophic denitrification via nitrite processes would represent a technical- and cost-effective technology: partial nitritation has been studied and commonly applied at full scale to treat anaerobic digester supernatant and landfill leachates, while only few studies focusing on the treatment of industrial wastewater containing toxic substances {{have been carried out}} so far. In this study, a SHARON reactor was used to treat synthetic and real ammonium rich refinery wastewater (<b>sour</b> <b>water)</b> : since availability of inorganic carbon (IC) determines the amount of NH 4 +-N being converted into NO 2 [...] N by partial nitritation, different influent IC/N (as HCO 3 -/NH 4 +-N) molar ratios were tested and SHARON feasibility as the preliminary treatment in a double stage SHARON-ANAMMOX or SHARON-Denitrification via nitrite process was assessed. In order to retain only ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the system, the reactor was run at controlled temperature and operated as a chemostat (no biomass recirculation) at low hydraulic and solids retention time. A synthetic medium containing NH 4 +-N (2, 000 mg/L) was initially fed to promote biomass acclimation, then real <b>sour</b> <b>water</b> containing also organic substrate, cyanides, sulphides and phenols was supplied. In both synthetic and real wastewater, the IC/N molar ratio was progressively increased from 1 to 2.

The catalyst samples have been characterized using temperature programmed sulfurization (TPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and laser Raman and BET surface area measurements. The results have shown that adding TiO 2 to the catalyst makes the active components, e. g., Mo and Co, easier to be sulfurized with higher sulfur capacity in the catalyst itself. This may be the main reason why the TiO 2 modified CoMo catalyst to be active even at low H 2 S gas stream. The results from industrial operation showed that adding TiO 2 to the shift catalyst increases the catalyst activity and stability, presents the higher shift activity in {{a broader range of}} H 2 S content, depresses the aggregating of the molybdenum oxide, and reduces carbon deposition. In addition, the TiO 2 additive in the catalyst also helps to maintain the physical properties of the shift catalysts.

Currently, the global production of CA has reached 1.7 million tons per year, produced almost entirely through fermentation, with an annual growth rate of 5 % (Kana et al. 2012). The major method for manufacturing CA relies on the submerged fermentation of starch-based or sucrose-based feedstock by the fungus Aspergillus niger. Karaffa and Kubicek (2003) summarized the important role of glycolysis, the process of excretion and transport of CA, and the critical fermentation variables for CA accumulation. Finally, they proposed that the type and concentration of the carbon source is probably the most crucial parameter for successful citric acid production. A yield of 95  kg CA per 100  kg was even achieved of supplied sugar using best fermentation strains. However, high energy coupled with raw material costs has pushed CA production into an unprofitable market (Dhillon et al. 2011).|$|R
