40|$|An {{important}} evaporitic sedimentation {{occurred during}} the Paleogene (Eocene to lower Oligocene) in the Barberà sector of the southeastern margin of the Tertiary Ebro Basin. This sedimentation took place in shallow lacustrine environments and was controlled {{by a number of}} factors: 1) the tectonic structuration of the margin; 2) the high calcium sulphate content in the meteoric waters coming from the marginal reliefs; 3) the semiarid climate; and 4) the development of large alluvial fans along the basin margin, which also conditioned the location of the saline lakes. The evaporites are currently composed of secondary gypsum in surface and anhydrite at depth. There are, however, vestiges of the local presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphates.</b> The evaporite units, with individual thicknesses ranging between 50 and 100 m, are intercalated within various lithostratigraphic formations and exhibit a paleogeographical pattern. The units located closer to the basin margin are characterized by a massive gypsum lithofacies (originally, bioturbated gypsum) bearing chert, and also by meganodular gypsum locally (originally, meganodules of anhydrite) in association with red lutites and clastic intercalations (gypsarenites, sandstones and conglomerates). Chert, which is only linked to the thickest gypsum layers, seems to be an early diagenetic, lacustrine product. Cyclicity in these proximal units indicates the progressive development of lowsalinity, lacustrine bodies on red mud flats. At the top of some cycles, exposure episodes commonly resulted in dissolution, erosion, and the formation of edaphic features. In contrast, the units located in a more distal position with regard to the basin margin are formed by an alternation of banded-nodular gypsum and laminated gypsum layers in association with grey lutites and few clastic intercalations. These distal units formed in saline lakes with a higher ionic concentration. Exposure episodes in these lakes resulted in the formation of synsedimentary anhydrite and sabkha cycles. In some of these units, however, outer rims characterized by a lithofacies association {{similar to that of the}} proximal units occur (nodular gypsum, massive gypsum and chert nodules) ...|$|E

40|$|Starch is {{a mixture}} of two polysaccharides, amylose (AM) and amylopectin, which occurs {{naturally}} in the form of microscopic granules that are abundantly found in tubers, roots, cereal grains and fruits. In order to bring out their functional properties as thickeners and texture enhancers, starch granules are often disrupted by heating in excess water. This process, which is referred to as gelatinisation, causes the granules to swell and exude a fraction of the starch polysaccharides, resulting in a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the starch suspension. Surfactants are known to affect the different aspects of the gelatinisation process and, in particular, the swelling properties of starch. Surfactants are also known to form helical inclusion complexes with AM, the formation of which {{plays an important role in}} many of the instances in which starch and surfactants interact. This work was carried out in order to gain insight into how the surfactant structure (head group and chain length) influences the swelling properties of starch and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects. The investigations involved the study of the temperature-induced gelatinisation of starch in the presence of surfactants as well as studies on the association of surfactants to AM in solution and the solubility of the resulting AM-surfactant complexes. Information on the extent of granule swelling upon heating was indirectly obtained by means of viscometry while insight on the molecular events taking place during gelatinisation was sought by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Viscometric studies revealed that, with the exception of the cationic surfactants (alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromides), short-chain (C 10, C 12) surfactants induce an early swelling (swelling at lower temperatures than the control sample) in normal wheat starch granules, whereas their longer chain counterparts (C 14, C 16) have the opposite effect. Contrary to this finding, the effect of surfactants on the swelling of waxy wheat starch granules, an AM-free starch variety, is not influenced by the surfactant chain length but by the head group charge of the surfactant. The enhancing/restricting effect of surfactants on the swelling of normal wheat starch is not correlated to their effect on the early aspects of gelatinisation (onset of the gelatinisation transition) but is, in most cases, associated with the dissociation temperature of AM-surfactant complexes formed simultaneously as the granules gelatinise. CLSM studies revealed that, compared to a longer-chain surfactant (C 16), a short-chain (C 12) surfactant has the ability to penetrate further into the granule matrix during gelatinisation, which may favour its availability for interacting with different starch granule components during gelatinisation. Studies on the interactions between AM and surfactants with different chain length (C 12 vs. C 16) and head group (<b>sodium</b> <b>sulphates</b> vs. maltosides) revealed that the presence of a charged head group favours the water solubility of the resulting AM-surfactant complexes. However, this effect can be counteracted by the effect of the surfactant chain length: an increase in the chain length (C 12 vs. C 16) decreases the solubility of the complex. QC 2010091...|$|E

40|$|Salt {{crystallisation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} harmful decay problems in porous materials. Especially ancient building and archaeological sites can show very intense damage (e. g. detachment and pulverization of the materials) that produce a strong loss of matter and so cultural identity.

About 1  g of anhydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was {{placed at the}} top of each column to de-moisturize the sample extract. Each of the columns was pre-conditioned with 10  mL of n-hexane without the exposure of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> layer to air. The samples were then loaded on the column and elution with 2  ×  10  mL portion of dichloromethane. The eluate were collected, dried with anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and then concentrated to near dryness under stream nitrogen gas.|$|R
