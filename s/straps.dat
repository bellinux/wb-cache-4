5000|$|A guitar <b>strap</b> is a {{strip of}} {{material}} with an attachment mechanism on each end, made to hold a guitar via the shoulders at an adjustable length. Guitars have varying accommodations for attaching a <b>strap.</b> The most common are <b>strap</b> buttons, also called <b>strap</b> pins, which are flanged steel posts anchored to the guitar with screws. Two <b>strap</b> buttons come pre-attached to virtually all electric guitars, and many steel-string acoustic guitars. <b>Strap</b> buttons are sometimes replaced with [...] "strap locks", which connect the guitar to the <b>strap</b> more securely.|$|R
40|$|The <b>STRAP</b> V {{system was}} {{developed}} to provide higher accuracy and lower limit cycle fine pointing (+ or - 7 arcseconds) in all three axes at targets which cannot be tracked by startrackers or solar trackers. The system provides an increase in pointing performance over that obtainable with the <b>STRAP</b> IV (1) Attitude Control System (ACS). The <b>STRAP</b> IV concept of third axis updates is utilized to reduce pointing errors, using the flight-proven <b>STRAP</b> III (2) system as a first stage. Flight aspect photographs and telemetry records show that the <b>STRAP</b> V objectives have been met. The <b>STRAP</b> IV major error contributors have been significantly reduced and the tracking flexibility has been increased with only minor error contributions. Attention {{is given to the}} basic <b>STRAP</b> III control modes, major <b>STRAP</b> IV system error sources, tuned restrained inertial gyros (TRIGs), the programmable sequence timer, the <b>STRAP</b> V control box, third axis update, system gyro alignments, and <b>STRAP</b> V operational capabilities...|$|R
30|$|Frequencies of the {{questionnaire}} responses and the bra <b>strap</b> preference data for each bra <b>strap</b> condition were calculated. After confirming the data were normally distributed, {{means and standard deviations}} were calculated for, these data, as well as, bra <b>strap</b> pressure and VBD data for each <b>strap</b> condition. A two-way ANOVA design with two within factors (<b>strap</b> orientation and <b>strap</b> design) was then used to determine whether there were any significant main effects or interactions of <b>strap</b> orientation (vertical, cross-back) or <b>strap</b> design (standard width, wide, gel) on the outcome variables, with Tukey post hoc analyses used to determine where any significant difference lay. All statistical procedures were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (Version 15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).|$|R

50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{equipment}} available for strapping: hand tools and <b>strapping</b> machines. A dispenser is used with both types of equipment to dispense the <b>strap.</b> Some <b>strapping</b> machines have the dispenser built-in, others (typically those on large arch machines) have a separate powered dispenser, which can automatically load or thread new coils. Non-powered separated dispensers have a pulley which releases and activates a brake to stop the inertia of the coil to keep the <b>strap</b> from over-running onto the floor. Typically dispensers used on large arch <b>strapping</b> machines have multiple pulleys {{to act as a}} way to store <b>strap</b> in a way that can be quickly dispensed. Smaller arch machines such as table top machines will feed <b>strap</b> into a pool box/accumulator instead. In both cases this is required otherwise the <b>strapping</b> machine will draw the <b>strap</b> faster than the dispenser can pay off.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel <b>straps</b> connecting the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E
50|$|Furniture {{is often}} <b>strapped</b> using a method called double wrap where the <b>strap</b> is {{wrapped around the}} frame, the {{fastening}} rivet, and itself on each end.This makes {{it very difficult for}} the <b>strap</b> to pull away from the frame and normally requires the <b>strap</b> to be cut in order to remove it.|$|R

5|$|Laces, <b>straps,</b> or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E

5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs.

40|$|Back pain {{is common}} in {{adolescents}} which {{has been associated with}} carrying a bag. However, there is little research examining the effects of bag style in female adolescents. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of different bag conditions on muscle activity of the trapezius, erector spinae and latissimus dorsi muscles in female university students during walking. Twelve female university students walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 1. 1 m/s during five conditions; control, 1 <b>strapped</b> rucksack, 2 <b>strapped</b> rucksack, ipsilateral shoulder <b>strap</b> and contralateral shoulder <b>strap,</b> each containing 10 % bodyweight. Electromyography for the trapezius, erector spinae and latissimus dorsi was recorded for the last 30 s of each condition. Two-way ANOVA and paired t-tests were used to identify differences between right and left muscles and between bag conditions. Results showed that muscle activity of the left trapezius was significantly higher than the right trapezius during the 1 <b>strap</b> rucksack condition. For the left trapezius, the 2 <b>strapped</b> rucksack and the control condition had significantly lower muscle activity compared to the 1 <b>strapped</b> rucksack and the ipsilateral shoulder <b>strap.</b> For the left erector spinae muscle, there was significantly greater muscle activity when wearing the contralateral shoulder <b>strap</b> compared to the control. For the right erector spinae, significantly lower muscle activity was observed when wearing the 2 <b>strapped</b> rucksack compared to the ipsilateral shoulder <b>strap</b> and contralateral shoulder <b>strap.</b> There were no significant differences in muscle activity of the latissimus dorsi muscles between any of the bag conditions. These findings suggest that a two <b>strapped</b> rucksack shoul...|$|R

5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather <b>straps</b> and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E
5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby <b>straps</b> himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power.
