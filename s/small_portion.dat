5|$|Beer {{contains}} the phenolic acids 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid. Alkaline hydrolysis experiments {{show that most}} of the phenolic acids are present as bound forms and only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> can be detected as free compounds. Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E
5|$|Cook {{established}} the university's geology museum in 1872 with specimens {{collected during the}} New Jersey Geological Survey which he directed as New Jersey's state geologist. Since then, the museum has operated on the building's second floor, offering free tours to small groups, schools, and to the general public. The museum's collections, of which only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> is on display, feature exhibits on geology, natural history, paleontology, and anthropology, {{with an emphasis on}} the natural history of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> of the audience, but {{the full}} effect was achieved by only showing {{the back of the}} audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> of the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY28 was {{extended}} south from Colliersville to Kingston largely {{by way of}} its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike.

Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> of NY10A that did not become part of NY28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY10.|$|E

5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, and the island {{is famous for its}} early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields). Originally grown using vraic as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E
5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion.

It could also have shared a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> of its range with Hartmann's mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae).|$|E
