50|$|Because of the {{confirmed}} {{and potential}} {{adverse health effects}} associated with indoor bioaerosol, some concentration limits for total number of bioaerosol particles are recommended by different agencies and organizations as follow: 1000 CFUs/m3 (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)), 1000 CFUs/m3 (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)) with the culturable count for total bacteria not exceeding 500 CFUs/m3. Note that for most types of indoor bioaerosols, the establishment of <b>specific</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>limits</b> or acceptance levels presents multiple challenges (e.g., differences on sampling and analysis method, irrelevance of sampling units to human exposure measurement; multiplicity and variability of composition, etc.).|$|E
40|$|Although risk assessment, {{assessing}} the potential harm of each particular exposure of a substance, is desirable, {{it is not}} feasible in many situations. Risk assessment uses a process of hazard identification, hazard characterisation, and exposure assessment as its components. In the absence of risk assessment, the purpose of classification is to give broad guidance (through the label) on the suitability of a chemical {{in a range of}} use situations. Hazard classification in the EU is a process involving identification of the hazards of a substance, followed by comparison of those hazards (including degree of hazard) with defined criteria. Classification should therefore give guidance on degree of hazard as well as hazard identification. Potency is the most important indicator of degree of hazard and should therefore be included in classification. This is done for acute lethality and general toxicity by classifying on dose required to cause the effect. The classification in the EU for carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity does not discriminate across the wide range of potencies seen (6 orders of magnitude) for carcinogenicity and for developmental toxicity and fertility. Therefore potency {{should be included in the}} classification process. The methodology in the EU guidelines for classification for deriving <b>specific</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>limits</b> is a rigorous process for assigning substances which cause tumours or developmental toxicity and infertility in experimental animals to high, medium or low degree of hazard categories by incorporating potency. Methods are suggested on how the degree of hazard so derived could be used in the EU classification process to improve hazard communication and in downstream risk management...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} guidance {{for using the}} dose-descriptor T 25 from animal studies {{as a basis for}} quantitative risk characterisation of non-threshold carcinogens. T 25 is presently used within the European Union for setting <b>specific</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>limits</b> for carcinogens in relation to labelling of preparations (formulations). The T 25 is defined as the chronic dose rate which will give 25 % of the animals tumours at a specific tissue site, after correction for spontaneous incidence, within the standard life-time of that species. The T 25 is converted to the corresponding human dose descriptor, HT 25, by dividing it with the appropriate scaling factor for interspecies dose scaling based on comparative metabolic rates. Subsequently, the human dose (expressed in mg per kg body-weight per day) is calculated from the available exposure data. The corresponding human life-time cancer risk is then obtained by using linear extrapolation by dividing the exposure dose with the coefficient (HT 25 / 0. 25). The results with this new method, which can easily be calculated without computer programmes, are in excellent agreement with results from computer-based extrapolation methods such as the linearised multistage model and the benchmark method using LED 10, even though the present method only takes into consideration one single dose-response point. To overcome possible shortcomings of the present method, the estimated life-time risks are proposed to be accompanied by a commentary statement giving an overall evaluation of data that may have bearing on the carcinogenic risk and that may indicate whether the real human risk is likely to be higher or lower than the calculated life-time risk. By using the present guidance and a harmonized set of criteria and default values, the calculation of life-time cancer risk should be transparent and easy to comprehend...|$|E

40|$|The maximal <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> {{of solar}} {{radiation}} for photovoltaic applications {{is assumed to}} be constant, at Cmax≈ 46, 000 suns. This limit is easily found via a geometrical application of the 2 nd law of thermodynamics to a radiation transfer system [A. Rabl, Sol. Energy vol. 18, pp. 93 - 111, 1976]. However, previous analysis did not include the generation of entropy in photovoltaic conversion.

40|$|A {{versatile}} {{method is}} presented for {{the preparation of}} porous inorganic hollow fibers with small tunable radial dimensions, down to ∼ 250 μm outer diameter. The approach allows fabrication of thin hollow fibers of various materials, as is demonstrated for alumina, nickel, silicon carbide, stainless steel, and yttria stabilized zirconia. The preparation method is based on dry-wet spinning of a particle-loaded polymer solution followed by thermal treatment. Exceptionally small radial dimensions have been achieved by surface energy driven viscous flow of the green fiber, resulting in a reduction of macro-void volume. It is shown that the extent of viscous deformation {{is directly related to}} the rheology of the particle-loaded green fiber above the glass transition temperature of the polymer. A particle <b>specific</b> <b>limited</b> <b>concentration</b> range can be identified in which viscous deformation is possible. Above a critical particle volume fraction the viscosity of the particle–polymer material increases sharply and the time scale of viscous deformation becomes too long. Below a minimum concentration of particles it is not possible to sinter the particles together. For small particles of alumina, silicon carbide, and yttria stabilized zirconia the concentration range allowing viscous deformation is very narrow as compared to that of larger metal particles...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCarbonate clumped {{isotopes}} {{are applied}} to {{an increasing number of}} geological archives to address a wide range of Earth science questions. However, the effect of changes in salinity on the carbonate clumped isotope technique has not been investigated experimentally yet. In particular, evaporated sea water and diagenetic fluids differ substantially from solutions used to calibrate the clumped isotope thermometer as they exhibit high ionic concentrations of e. g., Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Cl−. High ionic concentrations are known {{to have an impact on}} δ 18 O values, and could potentially impact the successful application of clumped isotopes to the reconstruction of diagenetic processes, including precipitation temperatures and the origin of the diagenetic fluid. In order to address the potential influence of salt ions on the clumped isotope Δ 47 value we precipitated CaCO 3 minerals (calcite, aragonite and vaterite), hydromagnesite and mixtures of these minerals in the laboratory from solutions containing different salt ions (Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl−) at various concentrations and temperatures. The precipitation of some mineralogies was restricted to solutions with <b>specific</b> ionic <b>concentrations,</b> <b>limiting</b> direct comparability. NaCl-rich solutions mostly led to vaterite formation. In control experiments CaCO 3 minerals (calcite and aragonite) were precipitated from a CaCO 3 supersaturated solution without addition of any other ions. Our results show that calcium carbonates precipitated from high NaCl concentrations yield Δ 47 values identical to our NaCl-free control solution. Although addition of Mg led to the formation of hydromagnesite, it also follows the same Δ 47 -T calibration as calcite. In contrast, Δ 47 values increase together with increased CaCl 2 concentrations, and deviate by a few 0. 01 ‰ from expected equilibrium values. Overall, clumped isotope values of CaCO 3 minerals precipitated between 23 °C and 91 °C (with and without NaCl addition) follow a line with a slope close to results from statistical thermodynamics. We conclude for calcium carbonate and hydromagnesite that the combined effect of salt ion concentration, acid fractionation and polymorphism is negligible for Cl− and Na+ with respect to clumped isotope geochemistry, but that offsets are possible in brines containing high concentrations of CaCl 2...|$|R
