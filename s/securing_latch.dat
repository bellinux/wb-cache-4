2500|$|Norwegian (or meat chopper) {{couplings}} {{consist of}} a central buffer with a mechanical hook that drops into a slot in the central buffer. There {{may also be a}} U-shaped <b>securing</b> <b>latch</b> on the opposite buffer which is fastened {{over the top of the}} hook to secure it. The Norwegian is found only on narrow gauge railways of , [...] or less, such as the Isle of Man Railway, Western Australian Government Railways, the Ffestiniog Railway and the Welsh Highland Railway, Tanzania, where low speeds and reduced train loads allow a simpler system. The Norwegian coupler allows sharper curves than the buffer-and-chain, which is an advantage on those railways.|$|E
60|$|Wingate {{laid down}} the receiver, glanced {{for a moment at}} the clock, hurried to the door, pushed back and <b>secured</b> the <b>latch.</b> Then he came back into the room and stood listening.|$|R
50|$|Some {{birds have}} special requirements. Amazons and cockatiels prefer {{horizontal}} bars, {{as they like}} to climb. Messy eaters should have a seed skirt to catch food. Breeding birds may require a nest or breeding box and a larger size cage. Smart birds, like parrots and crows, need <b>secure</b> <b>latching</b> mechanisms {{to prevent them from}} figuring them out, and often require toys and/or play-stands to keep them entertained. Parrots in general tend to gnaw on cages, with larger macaws known to tear bars from flimsy cages. Zinc coated cages or chicken wire could cause toxicity to parrots over a number of years.|$|R
5000|$|The Hornet was {{designed}} {{with the possibility}} of naval service on carriers firmly in mind. To this end good low-speed handling was required, along with good all-round visibility for the pilot. The basic Hornet design excelled at meeting these requirements. Shortly after the first Hornet prototype flew, Specification N.5/44 was issued to de Havilland, covering the modification of the Hornet for naval service. The Heston Aircraft Company was contracted to carry out the conversion work on three early production F.1s. The work entailed altering the wings to incorporate folding mechanisms so that each outer wing panel, from the aileron/flap line outboard could be folded upwards and inwards at an angle. The hinges were part of the upper wing skin structure while the lower wing skins incorporated <b>securing</b> <b>latches,</b> and Lockheed hydraulic jacks were used to move the wing panels. Slotted flaps were introduced to improve low speed [...] "flaps down" [...] control.|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{of the common}} degu as a pet is their predisposition to chewing, due to their continually growing incisor and molar teeth. For this reason common degus cannot be housed in plastic-bottomed cages typically found in pet stores. A metal cage with multiple levels made for rats and <b>secured</b> double <b>latches</b> works best. It is important to line the levels with grass mats or a soft fabric so that the common degus do not get bumblefoot.|$|R
50|$|With {{only minor}} {{additions}} in 1999, the motorcycle remained unchanged {{until it was}} redesigned in 2002. Larger-capacity panniers (left capacity increased from 18 to 24 litres; right capacity increased from 16.7 to 19.5 litres) with more <b>secure</b> cover <b>latches</b> and hinges were fitted. The engine was overhauled with lighter pistons and other engine modifications to reduce vibration. A catalytic converter was fitted to ensure compliance with the stricter EU emissions laws. A combined braking system was fitted and the front brakes were upgraded to 3-piston calipers.|$|R
6000|$|On {{my way to}} the cottage, I thought I heard a {{sound like}} the {{shutting}} of a door. I was probably mistaken. In expectation of my return, the door was <b>secured</b> by the <b>latch</b> only; and the miller, looking out of his bedroom window, said: [...] "Don't forget to lock it, sir; the key's inside." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stock: A {{variety of}} M4 {{retractable}} buttstocks are {{used on a}} standard 4-position receiver extension, including the standard [...] "CAR" [...] stock. Most often seen is the SOPMOD stock, {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Crane stock", created by Dave Armstrong of NSWC-Crane. The angled stock offers better cheekweld as well as providing two storage compartments for spare batteries. The stock must be removed from the weapon to access the storage compartments. The initial run of stocks was made by NSWC-Crane from glass fiber polymer. Because of this, they were somewhat fragile and did not always properly lock into the receiver extension. A rubber band was used to <b>secure</b> the <b>latch</b> so it would not slide out of the desired position. The current L7LA2B SOPMOD stocks are made by Lewis Machine & Tools and have none of these problems.|$|R
60|$|The knight {{advanced}} to the entrance; but the ingenuity of the architect, {{for want of a}} better lock to the door, which itself was but of wattles curiously twisted, had contrived a mode of <b>securing</b> the <b>latch</b> on the inside with a pin, which prevented it from rising; and in this manner it was at present fastened. Conceiving that this was some precaution of Joliffe's old housekeeper, of whose deafness they were all aware, Sir Henry raised his voice to demand admittance, but in vain. Irritated at this delay, he pressed the door at once with foot and hand, in a way which the frail barrier was unable to resist; it gave way accordingly, and the knight thus forcibly entered the kitchen, or outward apartment, of his servant. In the midst of the floor, and with a posture which indicated embarrassment, stood a youthful stranger, in a riding-suit.|$|R
50|$|A {{springform}} pan {{is a type}} of bakeware that features sides that can be removed from the base. Springform refers to the construction style of this pan. The base and the sides are separate pieces that are held together when the base is aligned with a groove that rings the bottom of the walls. The pan is then <b>secured</b> by a <b>latch</b> on the exterior of the wall. This tightens the 'belt' that becomes the walls of the pan and secures the base into the groove {{at the base of the}} walls.|$|R
40|$|Root cellar {{located on}} Fessers Lane in Upper Island Cove once used by William Mercer (1927 - 1984) to store {{vegetables}} {{for the family}} during the winter. A hatch entrance cellar with shed built on top of cellar mound. Stone foundation evident {{at the base of}} the mound and cement foundation visible directly under shed suggests that cellar was originally constructed with stone and later renovated. The shed is a wooden construct, with clapboard siding and panel door opening outward and <b>secured</b> with a <b>latch.</b> Both window and door have been secured with chicken wire, indicating cellar is no longer in regular use. Approximate dimensions of the cellar are 2. 8 m x 3. 5 m...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} devices which grip cylindrical structures and more particularly to a device which has three arcuate gripping members having frictional surfaces for gripping and compressing a bi-stem. The bi-stem gripping apparatus is constructed having {{a pair of}} side gripping members, and an intermediate gripping member disposed between them. Sheets of a gum stock silicone rubber with frictional gripping surfaces are bonded to the inner region of the gripping members and provide frictional engagement between the bi-stem and the apparatus. A <b>latch</b> <b>secures</b> the gripping apparatus to a bi-stem, and removable handles are attached, allowing an astronaut to pull the bi-stem from its cassette. A tethering ring {{on the outside of}} the gripping apparatus provides a convenient point to which a lanyard may be attached...|$|R
5000|$|All hay and {{concentrated}} feeds {{must be kept}} dry and free of mold, rodent feces, {{and other types of}} contamination that may cause illness in horses. Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly. Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover. Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed. A <b>secure</b> door or <b>latched</b> gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical. Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis. (see Illnesses related to improper feeding below) ...|$|R

40|$|A clamp-mount {{device is}} {{disclosed}} for mounting equipment to an associated I-beam {{and the like}} structural member of the type having oppositely extending flanges wherein the device comprises a base {{and a pair of}} oppositely facing clamping members carried diagonally on the base clamping flanges therebetween and having flange receiving openings facing one another. Lock means are carried diagonally by the base opposite the clamping members locking the flanges in the clamping members. A resilient hub is carried centrally of the base engaging and biasing a back side of the flanges maintaining tightly clamped and facilitating use on vertical as well as horizontal members. The base turns about the hub to receive the flanges within the clamping members. Equipment may be secured to the base by any suitable means such as bolts in openings. Slidable gate <b>latches</b> <b>secure</b> the hinged locks in an upright locking position. The resilient hub includes a recess opening formed in the base and a rubber-like pad carried in this opening being depressably and rotatably carried therein...|$|R
50|$|The AVANTIX Mobile {{system was}} {{designed}} for the Sema Group plc by Printer Systems Limited this included the technique of printing and encoding the magnetic stripe at the same time, the Z-fold ticket pack and the electronic control system with interface to a Casio PDA. The AVANTIX Mobile housing was designed, developed and engineered by Hyphen Design Ltd, of London. Particular design and engineering challenges were a tamper-resistant PDA retention and ejection mechanism, and a <b>secure</b> loading door <b>latch,</b> to prevent the device spilling ticket stock or batteries if dropped onto concrete from a height of 1.5M. Hyphen Design also developed a cartridge design for holding Z-fold or fan-fold ticket stock. With the horizontally mounted cartridge, a stack of 3 or five {{or more of the}} fan-fold stock could easily be drawn into the print head and jam it. The solution was a pad of fine silicone rubber fingers, stuck to the top and bottom internal surfaces of the cartridge, to provide just enough grip on the uneven ticket stack, without putting too much load on the print head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{these are}} the facts. The last day we were in an Indian city I asked Putnam if I could get some Trichinopoli cigars, he {{directed}} me to a little place opposite his lodgings. I have since found he was quite right; but 'opposite' is a dangerous word when one decent house stands opposite five or six squalid ones; and I must have mistaken the door. It opened with difficulty, and then only on darkness; but as I turned back, {{the door behind me}} sank back and settled into its place with a noise as of innumerable bolts. There {{was nothing to do but}} to walk forward; which I did through passage after passage, pitch-dark. Then I came to a flight of steps, and then to a blind door, <b>secured</b> by a <b>latch</b> of elaborate Eastern ironwork, which I could only trace by touch, but which I loosened at last. I came out again upon gloom, which was half turned into a greenish twilight by a multitude of small but steady lamps below. They showed merely the feet or fringes of some huge and empty architecture. Just in front of me was something that looked like a mountain. I confess I nearly fell on the great stone platform on which I had emerged, to realize that it was an idol. And worst of all, an idol with its back to me.|$|R
60|$|The two men, sole {{occupants}} of the somewhat shabby cottage parlour, lingered over their port, not so much with the air of wine lovers, but rather as human beings and intimates, perfectly content with their surroundings and company. Outside, the wind was howling over the marshes, and occasional bursts of rain came streaming against the window panes. Inside at any rate was comfort, triumphing over varying conditions. The cloth upon the plain deal table was of fine linen, the decanter and glasses were beautifully cut; there were walnuts and, in a far Corner, cigars of a well-known brand and cigarettes from a famous tobacconist. Beyond that little oasis, however, were all the evidences of a hired abode. A hole in the closely drawn curtains was fastened together by a safety pin. The horsehair easy-chairs bore disfiguring antimacassars, the photographs which adorned the walls were grotesque but typical of village ideals, the carpet was threadbare, the closed door <b>secured</b> by a <b>latch</b> {{instead of the usual}} knob. One side of the room was littered with golf clubs, a huge game bag and several boxes of cartridges. Two shotguns lay upon the remains of a sofa. It scarcely needed the costume of Miles Furley, the host, to demonstrate {{the fact that this was}} the temporary abode of a visitor to the Blakeney marshes in search of sport.|$|R
