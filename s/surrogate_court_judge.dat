Hence, the Court, amid settlement, reduced the [...] $12million trust {{fund for the}} pet Trouble to $2 million. Of the $10 million originally bequeathed to Trouble, $4million was awarded to the Charitable Trust, and $6million was awarded to Craig and Meegan Panzirer, who had been disinherited by the will.
