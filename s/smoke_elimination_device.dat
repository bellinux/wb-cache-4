The data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Results: In this study, from 9 active hospitals in Qom Province, only 3 hospitals were equipped with waste treatment system. In hospital A, growth of Bacillus stearothermophilus spore were observed in 6. 25 % of the samples, while no microbial growth was recorded in hospital B. The initial investment to buy the machine in hospital A was about four times than that of hospital B. Conclusion: The findings of this study showed that treatment device of hospital B is more appropriate compared to the devices of hospital A due to complete destruction of spores, lower cost (for purchase), and maintenance. ...|$|R
40|$|Air {{entrainment}} {{in working}} fluids has great detrimental effects on function and lifetime of the fluid power components and systems. It {{is important to}} eliminate the air bubbles from the working oil to preserve oil quality, system performance, and to avoid possible damage of the components. In view point of environmental compatibility, energy saving, cost saving, and high efficiency, one trend in fluid power systems {{is for them to}} be designed in a more compact fashion, requiring less fluid in the reservoir and long lifetime of the working oil. A new device using swirl flow for bubble elimination capable of eliminating bubbles and of decreasing dissolved gases has been developed. In this paper we focus on the technical issue for the air bubbles and aging behavior of the hydraulic oil. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed bubble <b>elimination</b> <b>device,</b> changes of oil degradation were experimentally measured on our laboratory test bench under the pump operating conditions during 456 hours of continuous running.

40|$|Here, {{consumer}} products refer to products in which radionuclides have been intentionally incorporated and {{which can be}} supplied {{to members of the}} public without special surveillance. This group of products includes, for instance, ionisation smoke detectors and timepieces with radium-painted dials. These products can cause a radiation dose to members of the public in various stages of life. In 1996 the European Council laid down basic safety standards in Directive 96 / 29 /Euratom for protecting the health of the general public from the dangers arising from ionising radiation. The Directive contains activity concentrations and total activity per radionuclide, the so-called exemption levels, below which a practice using this radionuclide is exempted from the duty to report. Implementing the Directive in the framework of Dutch legislation, the proposed policy for {{consumer products}} is to show a distinction between products with activity concentrations and total activity above and below the exemption levels. Besides the exemption levels being used as activity criteria for the consumer products, two dose criteria - an individual dose of 10 microSv/a and a collective dose of 1 manSv/a - are also employed. In the study leading to this report, the most recent information on consumer products was first collected and the activity per product, and in some cases also the activity concentration, was tested against the exemption levels. Next, the expected individual and collective doses for members of the public were calculated in the storage and trade phase, as well as the user and disposal phase of the consumer products. In the storage and trade phase, the dose for shop personnel was also estimated. Finally, the doses ware tested against the dose criteria. Gas mantles, static <b>elimination</b> <b>devices,</b> gaseous tritium light sources (GTLS), ceramic tiles, welding rods and camera lenses and eyepieces (belongs to the consumer products for which {{at least one of the}} activity criteria is exceeded) are also expected to exceed at least one of the dose criteria. Consumer products which do not exceed the activity criteria, but which may exceed at least one of the dose criteria, are smoke detectors with Ra- 226, timepieces with Pm- 147, electronic components with Co- 60 and electrical discharge safety devices...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{assurance}} {{in modern}} mixed-signal designs provides opportunities {{not only for}} above-average products but mostly for substantial savings due to increased yields and improved reliability of the products. In the case of fully custom designs such as ASIC, the pre-layout validation plays especially important role due to costly redesign and limited automation. Such validation is performed on many levels starting with mathematical or behavioral models and ending on such effects as electro-migration (EM), electro static discharge (ESD), or hot carrier injection (HCI). As <b>elimination</b> of <b>device</b> stress {{became one of the}} highest priorities in design verification flow, special methods such as safe operating area (SOA) checks were introduced in many simulators on the market. However, {{due to the lack of}} a standard, which would be implemented across different EDA solutions, designers are left with incompatible implementations and often unsupported options. The presented schematic debugging framework tries to address these problems by providing technology device-driven solution with a support for multiple simulators and analysis types. The tool has been integrated into Cadence Analog Design Environment (ADE) and binds design, simulation, SOA checks and waveform analysis into a single environment. It combines minimal setup overhead with flexibility of sophisticated checks. During the session the implementation of tool infrastructure, encountered problems and successful approaches will be discussed. In addition, advantages of the tool recognized by designers as well as proposed future extensions will be covered...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAd hoc user task {{composition}} involves automatic matching {{and selection}} of services across various devices in the pervasive environment. Existing service composition approaches mostly {{do not consider}} network heterogeneity or devices' capabilities simultaneously. This limits the composition mechanism, as not all the devices {{will be able to}} use the same set of network protocols. The user preferences are also not considered when selecting a particular service or device. In this paper, we propose a solution for ad hoc user task composition based on a graph-theoretic approach. We model both the user task and the underlying network services, along with their requirements and capabilities, as graphs. The heterogeneity of communication protocols is also considered in the graph. After an early <b>elimination</b> of unnecessary <b>devices,</b> and hence services, from the network services graph, based on user preferences and task requirements, a matching is performed between the user task graph and the simplified network services graph to achieve the composed user applicatio...|$|R
40|$|A simple, {{portable}} device for the preparation {{and delivery of}} gas mixtures has been designed and constructed. The basic feature of the device {{is the use of}} gas flow controllers to maintain stable flow rates over a wide range of downstream pressures, instead of the capillary tubes and water-filled barostats commonly used in gas-mixing <b>devices.</b> <b>Elimination</b> of the barostat avoids problems such as water leakage, the loss of gases through the barostat, and changes in gas pressure due to evaporative loss of water from the barostat. The absence of a barostat also provides a closed system, allowing the use of the device for mixing and delivering of toxic gases. The prototype of the device has been used to prepare mixtures of different gases for more than 1 year and has been found to operate consistently and reproducibly. The actual concentrations of O 2, CO 2, and N 2 in gas mixtures (determined by gas chromatography) immediately after mixing were between 2. 2 and 6. 6 % of the desired values in four performance tests. Fluctuations in concentration of gases in mixtures after 9 days of continuous gas delivery was less than 2 % in four performance tests...|$|R
