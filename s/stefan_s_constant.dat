In the chaotic region we compare our results with the predictions of models that describe chaos-assisted tunneling. Finally, we examine the practicality of performing these experiments in the laboratory with Bose-Einstein condensates...|$|R

We use this data in two ways. Firstly we {{constrain the}} matter density of the Universe, Omega(m) (assuming General Relativity), and use this to construct a diagnostic to detect the presence of an evolving Newton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant.</b> Secondly we directly measure the evolution of Newton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant,</b> G(eff), that appears in Modified Gravity theories, without assuming General Relativity to be true. The novelty of these approaches are that, contrary to other methods, they do not require knowledge of the expansion history of the Universe, H (z), making them model independent tests. Our constraints for the second derivative of Newton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant</b> at the present day, assuming it is slowly evolving as suggested by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints, using the WiggleZ data is (eff) (t(0)) = - 1. 19 +/- 0. 95. 10 (- 20) h(2) yr(- 2), where h is defined via H- 0 = 100 h kms(- 1) Mpc(- 1), while using both the WiggleZ and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (SDSS LRG) data is (eff) (t(0)) = - 3. 6 +/- 6. 8. 10 (- 21) h(2) yr(- 2), both being consistent with General Relativity. Finally, our constraint for the rms mass fluctuation sigma(8) using the WiggleZ data is sigma(8) = 0. 75 +/- 0. 08, while using both the WiggleZ and the SDSS LRG data sigma(8) = 0. 77 +/- 0. 07, both in good agreement with the latest measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation...|$|R
