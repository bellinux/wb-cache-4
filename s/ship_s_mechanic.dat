Many variations on the design can be spotted throughout Floraville, including an iconic Italian Villa known as The Gothic (207 Cincinnati Ave.) that also borrows many Gothic elements responsible for its name. Some of the earlier Italianate homes, like Burl Manor (230 <b>S</b> <b>Mechanic</b> St.), are similar in shape and size to the Greek Revival estates, while those built closer to {{the turn of the}} century are more modest frame residences with pedimented lintels, dog-ear window surrounds, bracketed friezes, and porches with cut-out designs in the posts.|$|R

40|$|Hospitality education, as a vocationally {{oriented}} {{field of}} study, must provide the student {{not only with}} theoretical concepts, but also {{with a series of}} skills that the student will use in the work place. These skills include problem analysis and decision making, team building, and the relationship of the hotel business variables (Occupancy, Profits and Guest Satisfaction). Simulation gaming techniques are thought to be very effective methods to develop these skills. In simulations participants imitate actions required on the job and are actively involved in the processes of learning and skills acquisition. The Hotel Management Simulation/Game is a simulation technique that has been successfully used in hospitality education and training. However its instructions and procedures (mechanics) have been perceived as unfriendly by participants. It was believed that the degree of understanding of the game mechanics would affect the learning process and the achievement of the game 2 ̆ 7 s instructional goals. To solve this problem, several changes of the game 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mechanics</b> have been introduced by the game administrators at Rochester Institute of Technology. The objective of the present study is to answer the following question: Does the Hotel Management Game 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mechanics</b> affect its learning outcomes (such as problem solving and decision making, team building, and understanding of the relationship among occupancy, profits and guest satisfaction), and the general pleasantness of the experience? A true experimental research was conducted to give an answer to these questions. Two groups of hotel management students were exposed to two different versions (Treatment 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2) of the Hotel Management/Simulation Game. Both treatments differed only in the game 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Instruments were applied to measure in each groups: 1) The understanding of the game mechanics (independent variable), 2) Participants 2 ̆ 7 Perception of Skills Acquisition, 3) General pleasantness (fun) of the experience, 4) Teamwork, and 5) Willingness to give and receive feedback. Results of the T-tests show that there was not any significant difference at a: 0. 05, in Participants 2 ̆ 7 Perception of Skills Acquisition, Fun, Teamwork and Feedback, between the two treatment groups. However, statistically significant differences were found only in individual questions. They favored students 2 ̆ 7 perception of a less structured version (the original version or treatment 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2). Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s Correlation Analysis show that there is no relationship between the perceived acquisition of the skills and the game mechanics, but it did find a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0. 5004 between degree of understanding of the game 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mechanics</b> and the general pleasantness (fun) of the experience (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Strong correlation coefficients were found also between Participant 2 ̆ 7 s Perception of Skills Acquisition and their Willingness to Give and Receive Feedback (0. 3593, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and between Teamwork abilities and Feedback (0. 4380, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Results also suggest that the Hotel Management Simulation/Game is an effective technique to provide the learner with relevant skills for the hotel business...|$|R

The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill retroactive.

50|$|According to {{a letter}} written by John C Skinner, dated October 31, 1889 and {{published}} in The Western Star, up until at least 1824 {{there was only one}} dwelling, the Maple-Rackett House (229 <b>S</b> <b>Mechanic</b> St.), within the boundaries now considered Floraville. That quickly changed as Lebanon established itself as the most important city in Warren County and a golden age of architecture came to the town. By 1839 there were 10 carpenter and joiner shops with 38 hands, a testament to the building activity in the area. The now wealthy professionals and businessmen looked outside city limits to establish their grand estates. Many set their eyes to the rolling hillside of the old Indian sugar camp, just south of the urban center.|$|R
