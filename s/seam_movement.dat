Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|Toshack {{returned}} as the Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, {{and he had}} his first outing with the bat on English soil, coming in last and scoring eight to help wicket-keeper Don Tallon add 33 for the final wicket before Australia were bowled out for 632. Toshack bowled without success in the first innings and took one wicket in the second innings, that of Arthur McIntyre, to end with match figures of 1/54 as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Toshack then took 2/32 in the first innings against Cambridge University, and did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414. He then took 0/9 from eight overs in the second innings, as Australia completed another innings victory. He then played in the match against Essex where Australia made 721runs on the first day to set a new world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket. However, Toshack only contributed four runs batting at No. 11. In the first innings, Toshack took the last five wickets to fall, including the top-scorer Ray Smith for 25, ending with 5/31 from 10.5 overs as the hosts capitulated for 83, unable to cope with his swing. Australia enforced the follow on and Toshack took a further 2/50 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings and 451 runs, the largest margin of the tour. He then faced Oxford University, scoring two runs in Australia's 431. Toshack then took three lower order wickets in the first innings to end with 3/34 from 22 overs, sending down more overs than any other Australian. He took 3/37 in the second innings as Australia completed another innings victory after enforcing the follow on. The Oxford batsmen had trouble with the <b>seam</b> <b>movement</b> of Toshack.|$|E

25|$|Two weeks later, India toured South Africa for a three–match Test series.

25|$|A {{major element}} of {{strategy}} in these sports is {{the condition of}} the ball. Since bowling in cricket has more variations (such as bounce, swing, <b>seam</b> <b>movement,</b> off-spin, leg-spin and so on), {{the condition of the}} ball also affects play to a great degree. In Test cricket, the same ball must be used for at least 80 overs unless it is lost, damaged or illegally modified at which point it must be replaced with a used ball in a similar condition. After the 80 overs, obtaining a new ball is at the discretion of the fielding captain – who will often ask for a new ball immediately, since a new ball is harder, smoother, bounces higher and has an intact seam, which produces greater conventional swing. But when a captain feels that a spin bowling attack {{is more likely to be}} successful, he will persist with the old ball, which is rougher and better grips the surface as well the bowler's fingers. In baseball the ball is replaced numerous times during a game to ensure it is in optimum condition.|$|E
25|$|Pitches in New Zealand, {{like the}} ones at Eden Park, Auckland and Basin Reserve, Wellington can have a green tinge similar to their {{counterparts}} in England. These cricket grounds are amongst the most picturesque in the world. The ball swings a lot due to the proximity of most grounds to the sea, relative humidity and moisture under the surface. New Zealand pitches are often bouncy and quick in nature due to the usual grass cover left on them. The grass cover offers <b>seam</b> <b>movement</b> early on, but also maintains {{the integrity of the}} pitch which can often dampen the effect of spin bowling but allows pitches to flatten out {{over the course of a}} match. Batting can be trying early on and batsman often take time to adjust to the conditions. As they are often in open stadiums bowlers can frequently be assisted by winds that increase the speed the batsmen faces the ball at one end. At the other end, the wind acts as a wall and decreases the pace on the ball and as result adjusting to this is often the most trying part for a visiting team.|$|E
50|$|A major {{geological}} {{feature of}} the Upper Carboniferous rocks in south Wales is the south Wales coalfield. The rocks comprising this important area were laid down during the later Carboniferous. This sedimentary succession includes a sequence with a thickness of more than 1800 m in the west. The coal measures were laid down on a low-lying waterlogged plain with peat mires immediately south of an ancient and persistent geological feature known as the Wales-London-Brabant High. Burial converted the peat deposits to thinner coal <b>seams.</b> Later earth <b>movements</b> distorted the coal-bearing strata, {{and the difficulty of}} mining led to premature closure of many mines on economic grounds, especially in Pembrokeshire where seams were squeezed completely out of shape.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 18 {{months after the}} date of publication. In order to get bounce and <b>movement</b> <b>seam</b> bowlers need to bowl the ball “into” the pitch. Standard {{deliveries}} by elite players are typically projected at around 7 ° below horizontal. In contrast, young players currently often need to release the ball almost horizontally {{in an effort to}} get the ball to bounce close enough to the batter. We anticipated that shortening the pitch could be a simple way to help young bowlers to release the ball at a better angle and with more consistency. Twenty county or best in club age group under 10 and under 11 seam bowlers were analysed bowling indoors on two different pitch lengths. They were found to project the ball on average 3. 4 ° further below horizontal on a 16 yard pitch compared with a 19 yard pitch, while ball speed and position at release changed negligibly. Pitch length did not affect the consistency of the release parameters. The shorter pitch led to a ball release angle closer to that of elite bowlers without changing release speed, and this should enable players to achieve greater success and develop more variety in their bowling...|$|R
25|$|Finally after Australia {{ended their}} innings on 323, the Indian openers Chopra and Virender Sehwag faced the uphill task of facing 35 overs of {{high-quality}} swing and seam bowling, which was {{aided by a}} track which had enough grass on it {{to suggest that it}} would assist <b>seam</b> <b>movement.</b> Further, the overcast and gloomy skies did not bode too well for the Indian openers. Taking advantage of these conditions and the fact that Chopra was playing in only his third test, Jason Gillespie produced an incisive spell of bowling. His very first ball indicated {{that there would be a}} touch of outswing for him. He stuck the right length time and again, and he beat Chopra's edge frequently, making him play and miss. However, if he was beaten, Chopra did not betray any sign of that fact and played out the two frontline bowlers with assurance. Sehwag was beaten time and again by Nathan bracken, who, despite playing only his first test, generated a lot of bounce with his natural high-arm action and dominated Sehwag throughout. Sehwag, though treated his sluggish start without the slightest care and played on with nonchalance. Both of the openers made five each and India had reached 11/0 from 6.1 overs when play was concluded at that stage.|$|E
500|$|Mike Selvey {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 1991 that Ambrose had [...] "the sort of easy, repetitive, no-sweat action {{which is the}} key to unyielding accuracy. There is no respite and all his other qualities are byproducts." [...] At his peak, Ambrose did not rely on {{pronounced}} swing or <b>seam</b> <b>movement</b> of the ball. Instead, he repeatedly bowled into the same areas of the pitch and the height from which he delivered the ball made him extremely difficult to face. The ball bounced sharply after pitching, sometimes deviating slightly from a straight line after pitching on the seam, and frequently took the edge of the batsman's bat to be caught behind the wicket. His 1992 citation as Wisden Cricketer of the Year states that he had [...] "outright pace and he generates a disconcerting, steepling bounce from fuller-length deliveries... His height and a slender, sinewy wrist contribute greatly to the final velocity , the wrist snapping forward at the instant of release to impart extra thrust". Writing in 2001 following Ambrose's retirement, Michael Atherton, whom Ambrose dismissed more often than any other batsman, said: [...] "At his best, {{there is no doubt that}} [...] moved beyond the fine line that separates the great from the very good. Quality bowlers essentially need two of three things: pace, movement and accuracy. Ambrose had all three." ...|$|E
500|$|A fast bowler who {{operated}} from a {{very short}} run-up, Mold bowled extremely quickly, releasing the ball with his arm very high in his early years, although later in his career, his arm was lower in delivery. Unusually for a bowler of his pace, he could make the ball deviate from straight, either through <b>seam</b> <b>movement</b> or cutting his fingers over it before release, but most of his wickets were taken through sheer speed. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that {{he was among the}} fastest bowlers of all time and his bowling action was [...] "beautiful" [...] and possessed [...] "fine grace". If the pitch was uneven or otherwise difficult for batting, he was extremely difficult to bat against: in 1892, Wisden noted: [...] "On anything like a rough or bumpy wicket [...] he is, beyond all question, the most difficult and dangerous bowler of the day, the ball getting up from the pitch so high and so fast as to intimidate all but the very pluckiest of batsmen." [...] The Times later noted that he was very successful for Lancashire and a difficult bowler to face. In combination with Briggs, he bowled a very high proportion of Lancashire's overs. At times, he struggled with a knee injury but continued to bowl with little opportunity to rest.|$|E
40|$|The {{counterculture}} {{that arose}} during the 1960 s and 1970 s left lasting {{social and political}} reverberations in developed nations. This {{was a time of}} increasing affluence and liberalisation which opened up remarkable political opportunities for social change. Within this context, an array of new social movements were a vital ingredient of the ferment that saw existing norms challenged and the establishment of new rights for many oppressed groups. An expanding arena of concerns included the environmental damage caused by 200 years of industrial capitalism. This article examines one aspect of a current environment movement in Australia, the anti-Coal <b>Seam</b> Gas (CSG) <b>movement,</b> and the part played by participants. In particular, the focus is upon one action that emerged during the recent Bentley Blockade, which was a regional mobilisation against proposed unconventional gas mining (UGM) near Lismore, NSW. Over the course of the blockade, the conventional ritual of waving at passers-by was transformed into a mechanism for garnering broad community support. Arguably, this was a crucial factor in the eventual outcome. In this case, we contend that the wave, rather than a countercultural artefact being appropriated by the mainstream, represents an everyday behaviour that builds social solidarity, which is subverted to become an effective part of the repertoire of the movement. At a more general level, this article examines how counterculture and mainstream interact via the subversion of “ordinary” citizens and the role of certain cultural understandings for that purpose...|$|R
40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{computer program}} named DMC_BLAST (Distinct Motion Code) {{has been under}} development since 1987 for modeling rock blasting (Preece & Taylor, 1989). This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in two dimensions. DMC_BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual bench blasts (Preece et al, 1993). Coal seam chilling refers to the shattering of {{a significant portion of}} the coal leaving unusable fines. It is also refereed to as coal damage. Chilling is caused during a blast by a combination of explosive shock energy and movement of the adjacent rock. Chilling can be minimized by leaving a buffer zone between the bottom of the blastholes and the coal seam or by changing the blast design to decrease the powder factor or by a combination of both. Blast design in coal mine cast blasting is usually a compromise between coal damage and rock fragmentation and movement (heave). In this paper the damage to coal <b>seams</b> from rock <b>movement</b> is examined using the discrete element computer code DMC_BLAST. A rock material strength option has been incorporated into DMC_BLAST by placing bonds/links between the spherical particles used to model the rock. These bonds tie the particles together but can be broken when the tensile, compressive or shear stress in the bond exceeds the defined strength. This capability has been applied to predict coal seam damage, particularly at the toe of a cast blast where drag forces exerted by movement of the overlying rock can adversely effect the top of the coal at the bench face. A simulation of coal mine cast blasting has been performed with special attention being paid to the strength of the coal and its behavior at t he bench face during movement of the overlying material...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis is an explorative study into the basic concepts {{and the effects of}} dance movement psychotherapy (DMP) intervention on the attunement behaviours of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). From a retrospective analysis of positively evaluated single cases of DMP with ASD participants, movement markers of interpersonal relating behaviours have been formulated in terms of Social Engagement and Attunement <b>Movement</b> (<b>SEAM)</b> behaviours. These were organised into an observation scale, and used subsequently to generate nominal observation data on the behaviours of a small sample of children with ASD. Evaluation with the SEAM observation scale yielded a significant increase of SEAM behaviours {{in the course of the}} dance therapy. Retrospective analysis of the actions of the therapist throughout four single cases of DMP with ASD participants yielded a specific approach that was described as Shared Movement Approach (SMA). SMA has been specified as an improvisation based method of DMP that takes the child's interpersonal attunement and engagement behaviours as cues for the therapist to accommodate her interventions, so that the child's interpersonal relating behaviours are facilitated and supported. Through her kinaesthetically informed interventions the DMP therapist contributes to an increase of interpersonal engagement and attunement by the ASD participant from within the shared <b>movement</b> actions. The <b>SEAM</b> observation scale was explored on conceptual clarity and consistency in a group of independent movement analysts, and interrater agreement was used as an indication of its contents validity. An interval rating procedure with the SEAM scale yielded the best results on interrater agreement as expressed in Cohen's kappa. The Shared Movement Approach and the SEAM observation scale were then tested for replication of outcome on SEAM behaviours within four repeated single subject cases in a pilot study in a Dutch outpatient clinical setting. The outcome monitoring yielded the replication of increase of interpersonal relating behaviours as measured with the SEAM observation scale. Within subject therapy outcomes, although diverse in their individual profiles, were found to be significant when analysed with non-parametric tests. Group averages showed a significant increase of SEAM behaviours. The effects beyond therapy were evaluated with the somatic and social sub-scales of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), showing individual differences and a significant problem reduction on average. The outcomes as experienced by the juvenile participants were evaluated with the somatic and social sub-scales of the Youth Self Report (YSR), which on average showed a significant decrease of experienced social and somatic problems. The results obtained are discussed in view of current theories on experiential approaches and concepts for psychotherapy with an ASD populatio...|$|R
