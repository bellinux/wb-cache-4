40|$|Abstract. The first {{measurements}} of stratospheric bromine nitrate (BrONO 2) are reported. Bromine nitrate has been clearly identified in atmospheric infrared emission spectra recorded with the Michelson Interferometer for Passive At-mospheric Sounding (MIPAS) aboard the European Envisat satellite, and <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles have been determined for different conditions (day and night, differ-ent latitudes). The BrONO 2 concentrations show strong day/night variations, with much lower concentrations during the day. Maximum volume mixing ratios observed during night are 20 to 25 pptv. The observed concentration profiles {{are in agreement}} with estimations from photochemical mod-els and show that the current understanding of stratospheric bromine chemistry is generally correct. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} lines of the nu- 3 band of {{hydrogen}} cyanide have been detected in solar absorption spectra recorded near sunrise and sunset at Kitt Peak National Observatory (elevation 2095 m) with a 0. 01 /cm resolution Fourier transform spectrometer. Analysis {{of two of the}} strongest and best isolated lines has led to a value of 2. 73 x 10 to the 15 th molecules/sq cm for the vertical column abundance of HCN above Kitt Peak. The accuracy of this value is estimated as + or - 25 %. This result, combined with the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> of HCN derived by Coffey, Mankin, and Cicerone (1981), yields 166 parts per trillion by volume for the average mixing ratio of HCN between 2 and 12 km. This is the first determination of the HCN concentration in the nonurban troposphere...|$|E

Upper tropospheric BCA increases to 0. 3 percent. Low <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> is commensurate with present commercial air traffic fuel consumption, given the following assumptions: the BCA emissions are 0. 1 grams per kilogram of fuel consumed, 10 percent of route mileage is above the tropopause, and average BCA stratospheric residence time is about one year. Taking BCA into account, the stratospheric single scatter albedo is about 0. 99. Using parameters for planned supersonic commercial aircraft, whose emissions will be predominantly in the stratosphere, it is shown that such traffic will double stratospheric BCA concentration. This would reduce the aerosol single scattering albedo by one percent, and double the BCA surface area that is available for heterogeneous chemistry...|$|E

40|$|One {{geoengineering}} mitigation {{strategy for}} global temperature rises {{resulting from the}} increased concentrations of greenhouse gases is to inject particles into the stratosphere to scatter solar radiation back to space, with TiO 2 particles emerging as a possible candidate. Uptake coefficients of HO 2, γ (HO 2), onto sub-micrometre TiO 2 particles were measured at room temperature and different relative humidities (RHs) using an atmospheric pressure aerosol flow tube coupled to a sensitive HO 2 detector. Values of γ (HO 2) increased from 0. 021  ±  0. 001 to 0. 036  ±  0. 007 as the RH was increased from 11  to 66  %, {{and the increase in}} γ (HO 2) correlated with the number of monolayers of water surrounding the TiO 2 particles. The impact of the uptake of HO 2 onto TiO 2 particles on <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentrations</b> of HO 2 and O 3 was simulated using the TOMCAT three-dimensional chemical transport model.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} subsonic and supersonic aircraft exhaust on the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> of NO(y), we employ a trajectory model initialized with air parcels based on the standard release scenarios. The supersonic exhaust simulations are in good agreement with 2 D and 3 D model results and show a perturbation of about 1 - 2 ppbv of NO(y) in the stratosphere. The subsonic simulations show that subsonic emissions are almost entirely trapped below the 380 K potential temperature surface. Our subsonic results contradict results from most other models, which show exhaust products penetrating above 380 K, as summarized. The disagreement can likely be attributed to an excessive vertical diffusion in most models of the strong vertical gradient in NO(y) that forms at {{the boundary between the}} emission zone and the stratosphere above 380 K. Our results suggest that previous assessments of the impact of subsonic exhaust emission on the stratospheric region above 380 K should be considered to be an upper bound...|$|E

Analysis of whole air samples, collected in pressurized bottles, provides information on stratospheric inventories and distributions for CCl 3 F, CCl 2 F 2, CCl 4, N 2 O and SF 6 in the Northern Hemisphere. Based on a linear regression {{analysis of the data}} the estimated mean Northern Hemisphere <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> of each gas increased as follows: CCl 3 F changed from 54 to 142 p 1 / 1 (4 / 74 - 11 / 83); CCl 2 F 2 changed from 133 to 268 p 1 / 1 (4 / 76 - 11 / 83); SF 6 changed from 160 to 480 f 1 / 1 (4 / 74 - 11 / 83); CC 1, changed from 58 to 91 p 1 / 1 (4 / 75 - 11 / 83); N 2 O changed from 246 to 261 n 1 / 1 (4 / 76 - 11 / 83). The calculated mean Northern Hemisphere stratospheric concentrations of N 2 O, CCl 3 F, CCl 2 F 2, and CCl 4 after 1980 show larger than expected fluctuations with time.

The results of this analysis show that the local concentration of ozone in different regions of stratosphere is determined by balances between different mechanisms. In the upper stratosphere, the ozone concentration is dominated by photochemical processes, whereas in the mid-lower stratosphere, the bulk of ozone appears to be controlled by an interaction between the transport and the photochemical processes.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{estimating}} {{the concentrations of}} inorganic chlorine/bromine species Cl(y) /Br(y) in the stratosphere due to decomposition of tropospheric source gases assume that the Cl(y) /Br(y) concentration in the stratosphere is determined mainly by the balance between production from in situ oxidation of the source gases in the stratosphere and removal by transport of Cl(y) /Br(y) out of the stratosphere. The rationale being that for source gases whose lifetimes are {{of the order of}} several months or longer the concentration of Cl(y) /Br(y) in the troposphere is small because they are produced at a relatively slow rate and also removed efficiently by washout processes. As a result of the small concentration, the rate at which Cl(y) /Br(y) is transported to the stratosphere is expected to be small compared to the in situ stratospheric production. Thus the transport of Cl(y) /Br(y) from the troposphere contributes little to the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentration.</b> In contrast, the origin of stratospheric Cl(y) /Br(y) from reactive source gases with tropospheric lifetimes comparable to the washout lifetime of Cl(y) /Br(y) (of the order of 10 - 30 days) in the troposphere is distinctly different. The in situ source in the stratosphere is expected to be significantly smaller because {{only a small portion of}} the source gas is expected to survive the troposphere to be transported into this region. At the same time these short-lived source gases produce appreciable amounts of Cl(y) /Br(y) in the troposphere such that transport to the stratosphere offers a larger source for stratospheric Cl(y) /Br(y) than in situ production. Thus, for reactive source species, simple methods of estimating the concentration of stratospheric Cl(y) /Br(y) that ignore the tropospheric contribution will seriously underestimate the loading. Therefore estimation of the stratospheric Cl(y) /Br(y) loading requires not only measurements of tropospheric source gases but also measurements of Cl(y) /Br(y) at the tropopause. This paper illustrates the mechanism by using results from a two-dimensional chemistry-transport model. However, in view of the importance of tropospheric transport on stratospheric loading the detailed values should be further evaluated using a three-dimensional model with appropriate treatment of convective transport...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the tropospheric and stratospheric cycles of {{phosgene}} is carried out to determine its fate and ultimate role in controlling the ozone depletion potentials of its parent compounds. Tropospheric phosgene is produced from the OH-initiated oxidation of C 2 Cl 4, CH 3 CCl 3, CHCl 3, and C 2 HCl 3. Simulations using a two-dimensional model indicate that these processes produce about 90 pptv/yr of tropospheric phosgene with an average concentration of about 18 pptv, in reasonable agreement with observations. We estimate a residence time of about 70 days for tropospheric phosgene, with the vast majority being removed by hydrolysis in cloudwater. Only about 0. 4 % of the phosgene produced in the troposphere avoids wet removal and is transported to the stratosphere, where its chlorine can be released {{to participate in the}} catalytic destruction of ozone. Stratospheric phosgene is produced from the photochemical degradation of CCl 4, C 2 Cl 4, CHCl 3, and CH 3 CCl 3 and is removed by photolysis and downward transport to the troposphere. Model calculations, in good agreement with observations, indicate that these processes produce a peak <b>stratospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> of about 25 - 30 pptv at an altitude of about 25 km. In contrast to tropospheric phosgene, stratospheric phosgene is found to have a lifetime against photochemical removal of the order of years. As a result, {{a significant portion of the}} phosgene that is produced in the stratosphere is ultimately returned to the troposphere, where it is rapidly removed by clouds. This phenomenon effectively decreases the amount of reactive chlorine injected into the stratosphere and available for ozone depletion from phosgene's parent compounds. A similar phenomenon due to the downward transport of stratospheric COFCl produced from CFC- 11 is estimated to cause a 7 % decrease in the amount of reactive chlorine injected into the stratosphere from this compound. Our results are potentially sensitive to a variety of parameters, most notably the rate of reaction of phosgene with sulfate aerosols. However, on the basis of the observed vertical distribution of COCl 2, we estimate that the reaction of COCl 2 with sulfate aerosol most likely has a gamma less than 5 x 10 (exp - 5) and, as a result, has a negligible impact on the stratospheric chlorine loadings of the phosgene parent compounds...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} the total concentration [ClX] versus altitude of Cl‐containing molecules, principally HCl, Cl and ClO.

Ground‐level sources of HCl and Cl 2 are large but tropospheric processes preclude significant impact on the stratosphere.

Compared with the result on June 3, 1983,the <b>stratospheric</b> aerosol <b>concentration</b> on July 21, 1985 decreased by a factor of three. This indicates that the higher aerosol concentration on June 3, 1983 reflects both the effect of El Chichon eruption and winter increase of aerosol concentration. On the other hand, the high aerosol concentration on July 21, 1985 reveals a regular seasonal variation having a remarkable winter maximum. The difference in the <b>stratospheric</b> aerosol <b>concentration</b> between the two winter measurements can be attributed to the aftereffect of El Chichon eruption. An extensive aerosol layer was also observed in the measurement on October 8, 1985.

The high aerosol concentration cannot be attributed to the aftereffect of El Chichon eruption.

Since future economic development pathways and resultant emissions of GHGs are uncertain, anthropogenic climate change could be {{a significant source of}} uncertainty for future projections of stratospheric ozone. In this pilot study, using an "ensemble of opportunity" of chemistry-climate model (CCM) simulations, the contribution of scenario uncertainty from different plausible emissions pathways for ODSs and GHGs to future ozone projections is quantified relative to the contribution from model uncertainty and internal variability of the chemistry-climate system. For both the global, annual mean ozone concentration and for ozone in specific geographical regions, differences between CCMs are the dominant source of uncertainty for the first two-thirds of the 21 st century, up-to and after the time when ozone concentrations return to 1980 values. In the last third of the 21 st century, dependent upon the set of greenhouse gas scenarios used, scenario uncertainty can be the dominant contributor.
