30|$|Learning <b>SLAM</b> {{is a new}} {{topic that}} gained {{attention}} recently due {{to the development of}} deep learning. We think it is different from geometric metric <b>SLAM</b> and topological <b>SLAM</b> by a single category. Learning <b>SLAM</b> can obtain camera pose and 3 D map but needs a prior dataset to train the network. The performance of learning <b>SLAM</b> depends on the used dataset greatly and it has low generalization ability. Therefore, learning <b>SLAM</b> is not as flexible as geometric metric <b>SLAM</b> and the geometric map obtained outside the used dataset is not as accurate as geometric metric <b>SLAM</b> most of the time. However, simultaneously, learning <b>SLAM</b> has a 3 D map other than 2 D graph representations.|$|R

5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were <b>slamming</b> the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E

40|$|Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (<b>SLAM)</b> is {{the process}} of {{simultaneously}} building a map and localizing in it, and can be used for autonomous navigation. <b>SLAM</b> deals with estimation of vehicle states and landmarks. Most <b>SLAM</b> algorithms are based on extended Kalman filters (EKFs). However, the use of EKF for <b>SLAM</b> is not the best choice, as it works only for `mild' nonlinear environments owing to the assumption of first order Taylor series approximations of process and observation models. A few researchers has also proposed the use of other estimation techniques like particle filters, unscented Kalman filters (UKFs), etc for <b>SLAM.</b> In this paper, we propose the use of a cubature Kalman filter (CKF) for the estimation of the <b>SLAM</b> augmented state vector. The proposed <b>SLAM</b> is derivative less <b>SLAM.</b> A comparison of CKF <b>SLAM</b> and UKF <b>SLAM</b> is given through numerical simulations...|$|R
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} AMW, who were {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim, against The Naturals in the sixth bout on the card.
