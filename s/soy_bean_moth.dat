40|$|<b>Soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder {{mixed with}} {{water is a}} good food for animals. However, there are two {{problems}} with this brew. One is that <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder is sunk down to fast. Parts of <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder are too big and too heavy. Animals do not eat <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder because {{after a few minutes}} (around 3 min) is sunk down and <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> are on the bottom case. Another negative point is a quick growth of mold, especially during summer when the temperature is highest. Mold is making food unhealthy and causes unpleasant smell. After mold appears it is difficult to clean the case. One of the solutions to eliminate these problems is to use pulse power plasma discharge and the second solution is ultra sound treatment. It was observed that pulse power discharge can decrease the size of <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder a few times. Another advantage of such experiments was that the pulse power discharge killed bacteria and viruses. After our experiments we did not observe mold growing.

In this study we have analysed isomeric composition of isoflavones in <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> and investigated distribution of this substances between different product under <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> processing. Using mass-spectroscopy and NMR analysis we have detected two main isomers in <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> daidzin and genistin.

Having analysed products of protein isolate processing we detected that isoflavones were extracted to alkaline solution during protein extraction. Only about 17 % of isoflavones have been remaining in protein isolate. Main of them were in whey water after protein precipitation. And it is possible to elicit them according to standart procedure using extraction by ethylacetate and precipitation by chloroform.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{excretion}} of fecal sterols and bile acids {{was measured}} in five infants from the 1 st week of life to 2 or 3 months of age as the composition of their diet was changed from cow milk to <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> milk. Bile acid excretion, adjusted for body weight, was initially lower during the 1 st than during the 3 rd week, when it reached adult values. The average excretion of bile acids was 6. 8 mg/kg per day with <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> milk and 3. 6 mg/kg per day with cow milk. Net sterol excretion (total sterol output minus cholesterol intake) was also twice as high with <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> milk and probably reflected enhancement of cholesterol re-excretion {{as well as of}} synthesis since the cholesterol content of <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> is nil. However, net sterol excretion remained higher with <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> than with cow milk even when egg yolk cholesterol was added to the <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> milk. It is concluded that the substitution of <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> milk for cow milk, which lowered the plasma cholesterol in all infants (even in the presence of dietary cholesterol) leads to an increase in bile acids and probably also in cholesterol excretion in young infants.

Purpose: To prove that <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> extract can decrease Balb/c male mice spermatogenesis. Method: This study was an experimental study, using post test only control group design which use 36 Balb/c male mice as a subject, then, they were divided into 4 groups randomly, so every group contains of 9 mice. The first group (K) only get standard food, another group were given standard food and also <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> extract with the dose for second group (A) 260 mg/day/mice, for third group (B) group 520 mg/day/mice, for fourth group (C) 780 mg/day/mice.

After that, Balb/c male mice were terminated on the 22 nd day, then were made testical image to be examine and given a score to the spermatogenesis according to Johnsons criteria. Results: Mean score for spermatogenesis in K group is the highest, and decreasing in A group. B and C group have the lowest score of spermatogenesis.
