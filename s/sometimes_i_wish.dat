25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> God had just taken me.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{returned}} Bland; [...] "it's {{more than}} pretty. There's {{something in it}} that rests one. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could live {{in such a place}} as this altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a whimper. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> he would. No, he just waits--but I'm afraid he'll get lonesome {{some day}} and break loose {{and go back}} to the game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've got confrères, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I hadn't! But {{does your}} sister never come near you any more," [...] she asked, [...] "or is it only {{the fear of}} meeting me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] he asked, [...] "why? <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> with {{my whole}} soul I could give it up. I've {{always said that}} you had more sense than most women, but even you could not understand." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kenley was intersex, {{according}} to Griffin and Barbara Eden. Eden recalled him confiding in her {{that his parents}} had concluded [...] "it would be {{easier for him to}} go through life as a male rather than as a female," [...] and that he spent the theater season in Ohio and the off season living in Palm Springs as a woman named Joan. [...] In his unpublished memoirs, Kenley writes, [...] "People have often wondered if <b>I</b> am gay. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> was. Life would have been simpler. Androgyny is overrated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've {{got them}} on our hands, {{and we got}} to {{remember}} what they are, and make allowances. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> we could hear of a country that's out of kings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are coming}} here for me," [...] she explained. [...] "There {{is really no}} hurry at all. We are not {{changing}} anything. It is {{to be quite a}} simple evening. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that you cared about things of that sort, Eugène." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, it hasn't {{been very}} {{exciting}}," [...] said Rilla. [...] "The only exciting {{thing that has}} happened in the Glen for a year was old Miss Mead fainting in Church. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> something dramatic would happen once in a while." ...|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. Perhaps. [His tone sinks {{suddenly}} to weariness.] I ask pardon for what I said. It was certainly {{in excess of}} the young gentleman's deserts. [Sighs.] <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> rather <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could forget myself.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>Sometimes</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>I</b> Was Famous: A Swedish Tribute to Depeche Mode is {{a tribute}} album to Depeche Mode, {{released}} in May 1991 by Swedish label Energy Rekords, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Depeche Mode's debut single, [...] "Dreaming of Me" [...] (1981). It was the first tribute album to Depeche Mode.|$|R
6000|$|... "That were ruin," [...] said Foster, {{his brow}} darkening with apprehensions; [...] "and {{all this for}} a woman! Had it been for his soul's sake, it were something; and <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> myself could fling away the world that cleaves to me, and be {{as one of the}} poorest of our church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that Louis had not a {{shilling}} in the world; {{that he had}} to trudge {{about with}} an apron round his waist as I did. But it's too late now to think of that. If he would only marry, doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] said Freddie dreamily, [...] "I wish I {{were engaged}} to be married. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I had some sweet girl {{to watch over}} me and.... No, I don't, by Jove. It would give me the utter pip! Is Sir Derek up yet, Barker?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Only last year?' exclaimed Violet. 'O dear! {{and there}} have I been telling him all about--about this spring. I {{would not have done}} it, if I had known. I thought he looked melancholy <b>sometimes.</b> Oh! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had not.' ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reason for}} the rather disjointed title is that {{although}} I like the original title of my proposed publishing model (the Deconstructed Journal) it does sometimes distract from the actual form of the model. It is a distributed model, and <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had called it the Distributed Journal, but {{it might not have}} been such a memorable title...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like nothing. I didn't know it {{for days}} afterwards. It was when I had the pewmonia. Mrs. Wiley wouldn't have the doctor--said she wasn't going to no such expense {{for a home}} girl. Old Aunt Christina MacAllister nursed me with poultices. She brung me round. But <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I'd just died the other half and done with it. I'd been better off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{remember}} right enough," [...] she said. [...] "It wasn't that. But there, {{wait until}} I've {{told you about}} it. It's an odd story, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I'd never {{had anything to do}} with it. I get a cold shiver every time I think of that old man who took me to dine at Luigi's. Outside in three-quarters of an hour, then!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet his {{stiffness}} of attitude disappeared when Gertie {{had read the}} letter from Joralemon and mused, chin on hand, dreamily melancholy: [...] "I can just see them out sleighing. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I was out there. Honest, Carl, for all {{the sea and the}} hills here, don't you wish sometimes it were August, and you were out home camping on a wooded bluff over a lake?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Delpy courted {{controversy}} in 2016 after the Oscar nominations showed no black honorees on the ballot. “Two years ago, I {{said something about}} the Academy being very white male, which is the reality, and I was slashed to pieces by the media...It’s funny — women can’t talk. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> were African American because people don’t bash them afterward.” ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, my dear boy, it's woman's lot {{to suffer}} in this world. But it's a great comfort {{to think that}} one is {{submitting}} to the decrees of Providence {{and at the same}} time adding to one's personal attractiveness. But <b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> needn't blow my nose so carefully. Smile, Charlie. I don't think you're a very ardent lover, you know.|$|R
60|$|Meantime {{the wind}} dropped, and Mr. Burns {{began to make}} disagreeable remarks about my usual bad luck. I believe it was his devotion for me which made him {{critically}} outspoken on every occasion. All the same, I would not have put up with his humours {{if it had not}} been my lot at one time to nurse him through a desperate illness at sea. After snatching him out of the jaws of death, so to speak, it would have been absurd to throw away such an efficient officer. But <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> he would dismiss himself.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Have I?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, yes. I suppose so. Yes. I {{have got}} back my {{confidence}} in myself--a good name--yet <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> [...] . No! I shall hold what I've got. Can't expect anything more." [...] He flung his arm out towards the sea. [...] "Not out there anyhow." [...] He stamped his foot upon the sand. [...] "This is my limit, because nothing less will do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But that's {{just what}} I can't do. I've lost all my spirits and courage, {{and got into}} a dismal state of mind. You {{seem to be very}} cheerful, and yet you must have a good deal to try you <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> you'd tell me how you do it;" [...] and Christie looked wistfully into that other face, so plain, yet so placid, {{wondering}} to see how little poverty, hard work, and many cares had soured or saddened it.|$|E
6000|$|... "An' {{next week}} {{we got to}} do it all over again," [...] he said sadly. [...] "An' what's the good of it all, hey? <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I was a hobo. They don't work, an' they get their livin'. Gee! I wish I had a glass of beer; but I can't get up the gumption to go down to the village an' get it. You'll stay over, an' send your books dawn by express, or else you're a damn fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have come," [...] she murmured. [...] "I do {{not know}} why. It is not right for me to come. Yet {{there are times when}} I am weary, times when Paul seems fierce and when <b>I</b> am terrified. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> even <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> were back--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{the eyes}} of her spirit an interminable {{procession}} of her own [...] "Lord's" [...] frocks was passing, paid for with the money of her father, to save a recurrent crisis. [...] "It's been very amusing, after all. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> even <b>wish</b> Monty was back. What {{do you think of}} people nowadays, Soames?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, Andy," [...] says Mack, {{with a kind}} of sigh, [...] "I {{never had}} the least amount of {{intersection}} with their predispositions. Maybe I might have had a proneness in respect to their vicinity, but I never took the time. I made my own living since I was fourteen; and I never seemed to get my ratiocinations equipped with the sentiments usually depicted toward the sect. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had," [...] says old Mack.|$|R
