The {{mathematical}} {{models of}} compacting process in green sand molding were built up {{based on the}} experiment results of molding sand property testing, in which the nonlinearity problems involved in the molding sand material, the pattern geometry and the contact between sand and flask were considered. These models were then used to numerically simulate the compacting process of green sand and predict the hardness distribution of green sand mold. The effect of <b>sand</b> <b>filling</b> on the initial sand density distribution was taken into account, which was obtained through the two phase flow simulation of <b>sand</b> <b>filling.</b> The predicted results were compared with the measured ones and good agreement was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{downhole}} complexities, shale-gas {{horizontal well}} fracturing in the Sichuan Basin suffered from casing deformation {{and failure to}} apply the technique of cable-conveyed perforation bridge plug. In view of these problems, a new technique of staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by <b>sand</b> <b>filling</b> is employed. Based on theoretical analyses and field tests, a design of optimized parameters of coiled tubing-conveyed multi-cluster sand-blasting perforation and temporary plugging by <b>sand</b> <b>filling</b> was proposed. It was applied in the horizontal Well ZJ- 1 in which casing deformation occurred. The following results are achieved in field operations. First, this technique enables selective staged fracturing in horizontal sections. Second, this technique can realize massive staged fracturing credibly without mechanical plugging, with the operating efficiency equivalent to the conventional bridge plug staged fracturing. Third, full-hole is preserved after fracturing, thus {{it is possible to}} directly conduct an open flow test without time consumption of a wiper trip. The staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by <b>sand</b> <b>filling</b> facilitated the 14 -stage fracturing in Well ZJ- 1, with similar SRV to that achieved by conventional bridge plug staged fracturing and higher gas yield than neighboring wells on the same well pad. Thus, a new and effective technique is presented in multi-cluster staged volume fracturing of shale gas horizontal wells...|$|R

5000|$|Clean dredge {{material}} and <b>sand</b> <b>fill</b> are generally {{used to construct}} a rolling slope to weaken wave energy and provide an area to plant vegetation. Regrading, filling and replanting native vegetation can occur on sites {{that do not have}} a bulkhead or on sites where bulkheads have been removed. If removing the bulkhead is not feasible, another option is to fill sand in front of the structure and regrade and replant vegetation on the shoreline and embankment.|$|E

The proposed $1.3 billion, 3,300 m runway will take approximately eight years to construct and is being built on swamp land 2 km west of the current terminal area and parallel to the existing main runway. The long construction period is due to the settling period of the 13 million cubic metres of <b>sand</b> <b>fill</b> that is to be dredged from Moreton Bay. In early December 2014 the delivery of 11 million cubic metres of sand to the site was completed.|$|E
50|$|Living shorelines are a {{relatively}} new approach for addressing shoreline erosion and protecting marsh areas. Unlike traditional structures such as bulkheads or seawalls that worsen erosion, living shorelines incorporate as many natural elements as possible which create more effective buffers in absorbing wave energy and protecting against shoreline erosion. The process of creating a living shoreline {{is referred to as}} soft engineering, which utilizes techniques that incorporate ecological principles in shoreline stabilization. The natural materials used in the construction of living shorelines create and maintain valuable habitats. Structural and organic materials commonly used in the construction of living shorelines include sand, wetland plants, <b>sand</b> <b>fill,</b> oyster reefs, submerged aquatic vegetation, stones and coir fiber logs.|$|E

50|$|Concrete seawalls, {{bulkheads}} and revetments {{are examples}} of hardened structures traditionally used to stabilize shorelines that ironically increase erosion rates, reduce the shoreline’s capacity to undergo natural processes and minimize estuarine habitats. NCCF feels that the best approach to battle erosion issues is to plan for erosion to occur and build as distant from the water’s edge as possible. However, when this isn’t possible NCCF supports utilizing stabilization techniques that induce {{the least amount of}} damage to natural ecosystems and uphold the natural structure of the marsh areas. One such approach NCCF takes is advocating for the construction of “living shorelines” when necessary. Living shorelines are new alternatives to stabilize shorelines that utilize organic materials such as oyster reefs, coir fiber logs, wetland plants, stones, <b>sand</b> <b>fill,</b> and submerged aquatic vegetation. Living shorelines protect surrounding intertidal and riparian environments, improve water quality by filtration of runoff, decrease erosion rates and create terrestrial and aquatic habitats.|$|E
50|$|Waco (Wawasee Amusement Company) was an {{entertainment}} hall constructed about 1910 and originally planned as a floating pavilion but this idea was abandoned {{and it was}} built on land and located in the Lakeview-South Park area just west of Black Stump Point. Being low-lying land, <b>sand</b> <b>fill</b> was pumped in from the lake bottom. There were no sleeping quarters for the entertainment and orchestras, and help residing in the area used tents during the summer. In 1923 Waco was enlarged and the current road, South Park, was moved further south. Managed by Ross Franklin, Waco was nationally known and pulled in talent such as Hoagy Carmichael, Glenn Miller, Guy Lombardo, Tony Bennett, Ted Weems, Duke Ellington, Spike Jones, Wayne King and Jan Garber. After Ross Franklin no longer associated with Waco, it deteriorated and became a roller skating rink and in the 1960s became a lakeside restaurant with dock and had occasional entertainment. Waco was torn down in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Siegfrid Caspar {{settled in}} 1860 {{at the mouth}} of a stream on the coast of Mendocino County. The stream and the {{community}} which developed at the mouth are named for him. A sawmill was built {{at the mouth of}} Caspar Creek in 1861. In 1864 this sawmill was purchased by Jacob Jackson, who had been born in Vermont in 1817. About 1870, Jackson purchased the schooner Cora to transport lumber from his sawmill to San Francisco. A second schooner [...] "Elvenia" [...] was built in 1872. When all timber close to the sawmill had been cut, Jackson build a 1.5-mile (2.5 km) railroad north to Jug Handle Creek in 1874. This [...] "railroad" [...] had ties spaced at 6-foot (2-meter) intervals, and the [...] "rails" [...] were 6-inch (15 cm) by 8-inch (20 cm) wooden beams. Logs were transported to the sawmill from Jug Handle Creek on small cars towed by a horse and 5 mules. The wooden rails were shortly capped with iron straps to improve durability. The animal power was replaced in 1875 by a geared locomotive formerly used to transport <b>sand</b> <b>fill</b> behind the Embarcadero (San Francisco) seawall. The strap rail proved troublesome for the locomotive, and was replaced by French iron rail salvaged from a shipwreck. Two more schooners [...] "Abbie" [...] and [...] "Maxim" [...] were purchased in 1876.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possible}} use of {{shear wave velocity}} to evaluate the in-situ state of hydraulic <b>sand</b> <b>fills.</b> Both laboratory and field determined shear wave velocity results were investigated and correlationships between shear wave velocity, void ratio, and confining stress of the marine sands were developed. Extensive measurements of shear wave velocity in triaxial specimens were conducted on six marine sands obtained from various reclamation sites {{by the use of}} bender elements technique. In-situ shear wave velocity profiles were also determined by SASW and SCPT technique in a number of land reclamation sites in Hong Kong. Cone tip resistances at different confining stress levels were also measured in large size Calibration Chamber Test for the verification of shear wave velocity results. Several set of non-linear correlation between shear wave velocity, void ratio and confining stress were developed for six marine sands. The presence of water, the specimen preparation method and particularly the stress anisotropy were found to have significant effect on the shear wave velocity. Empirical correlation between normalized cone tip resistance and void ratio was also established. The two sets of correlation were compared and found to be very consistent with each other. Extensive large strain triaxial tests were conducted to establish the steady state line of the six marine sands. With the establishment of modified steady-state line in a e-log(p'/pa) alpha space, the state parameter ([Greek capital letter psi]) could be used to mark the contractive and dilative boundary of the marine sands at large strain. Combined the relationships between shear wave velocity and steady state concept, a non-linear correlation was developed to evaluate the in-situ state of hydraulic <b>sand</b> <b>fills.</b> The reliability and applicability of the proposed correlation for the evaluation of the in-situ state of hydraulic <b>sand</b> <b>fills</b> was discussed.

40|$|Loose {{granular}} soils placed {{during a}} land reclamation process require densification {{to enhance their}} engineering properties. In a mega-land reclamation project in the Republic of Singapore, techniques such as Müller resonance compaction (MRC), vibroflotation, and dynamic compaction were employed to densify the land reclamation <b>sand</b> <b>fills.</b> The efficacy of densification was subsequently verified by cone penetration tests (CPT). The MRC technique results in the sand mass being rearranged due to the application of high vibrating energies. The vibroflotation technique results in a densified column of soil forming at and surrounding the probe point. The dynamic compaction technique results in the centroid point being the most compacted point, provided the selected spacing is efficient. The aging effect in the vibroflotation technique {{was found to be}} significant, in contrast to the MRC and dynamic compaction techniques.
