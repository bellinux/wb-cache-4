5|$|After {{the alarm}} had been raised, a major {{investigation}} commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI). The {{house and the}} surrounding area were subject to a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí performed house to house inquiries, took more than 1000 statements, and interviewed over 250 suspects. A postmortem examination of the bodies was made by the State Pathologist, Professor John Harbison; his first report was delivered on 13 March 1997. No material was found either by the forensic examination of the <b>scene</b> <b>or</b> by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E
50|$|In addition, it was {{traditional}} for the benshi {{to introduce}} the film, even giving a brief lecture {{about the history of}} the setting.

5|$|The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists {{more than}} 500 {{recording}} bands {{established in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club <b>scene,</b> <b>or</b> recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing {{by the end of}} the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime <b>scene</b> <b>or</b> been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E

25|$|Fingerprints {{collected}} at a crime <b>scene,</b> <b>or</b> on items of evidence from a crime, {{have been used}} in forensic science to identify suspects, victims and other persons who touched a surface. Fingerprint identification emerged as an important system within police agencies in the late 19th century, when it replaced anthropometric measurements as a more reliable method for identifying persons having a prior record, often under a false name, in a criminal record repository. In modern times, researchers can find traces of addictive drugs on just a fingerprint.|$|E
25|$|The basic plot, characters, {{and much}} of the {{dialogue}} of the film is drawn from Petievich's novel, but Friedkin added the opening terrorist sequence, the car chase, and clearer, earlier focus on the showdown between Chance and Masters.

25|$|One of the {{original}} goals of tone mapping was {{to be able to}} reproduce a given <b>scene</b> <b>or</b> image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem.|$|E
