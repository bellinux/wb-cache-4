40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability characteristics of nonlinear surface waves propagating along a left-handed substrate (LHM) and a non-linear dielectric cover. These characteristics have been simulated numerically by using the perturbation method. The growth rate of perturbation is computed by solving the dispersion equation of perturbation.

The model system of interest includes a cavity field interacting {{with a pair of}} atoms. The cavity field is heavily damped and it is pumped in order to maintain a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>field</b> population. Thus, we can eliminate the cavity field adiabatically and obtain the master equation describing only the qubits evolution in time. At first, this system is analyzed in the steady state, without making any measurement on the photons leaking through the cavity walls. In this way, the ideal physical parameter set for maximum entanglement in this model is investigated. In the second step, we assume a direct measurement on the leaking cavity photons, and observe the evolution of entanglement in a quantum trajectories approach. We simulate quantum trajectories approach by applying Monte Carlo method. The amount of entanglement is obtained as a function of time and number of photon detections...|$|E

A fiber-based, MO, low-voltage optical switch capable of 200 ns switching is presented, along with the special circuit characteristics for magnetic field generation for high-speed switching. The switch consists of the optical system, the MO material (bismuth substituted iron garnet [(Bi 1. 1 Tb 1. 9) (Fe 4. 25 Ga 0. 75) O 12]), and a high-speed magnetic field driving circuit. A Faraday rotator is placed within the interferometric loop of a fiber-optic Sagnac interferometer, and interference at the output ports {{is controlled by the}} applied field. The fast switching speed is accomplished via the special design of {{the magnetic}} pulse generation circuitry. The applied magnetic field overshoots the field necessary to achieve the desired Faraday rotation and then settles to a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>field.</b> If the duration of the overshoot is less than the time it takes the material to saturate, a fast optical switching time can be achieved without saturating the material.

40|$|We have {{recently}} developed a position-dependent quantization scheme for describing {{the ladder and}} effective photon-number operators associated with the electric field to analyze quantum optical energy transfer in lossy and dispersive dielectrics [Phys. Rev. A, 89, 033831 (2014) ]. While having a simple connection to the thermal balance of the system, these operators only described the electric field and its coupling to lossy dielectric bodies. Here we extend this field quantization scheme to include the magnetic field and thus to enable description of the total electromagnetic field and discuss conceptual measurement schemes to verify the predictions. In addition to conveniently describing the formation of thermal balance, the generalized approach allows modeling of the electromagnetic pressure and Casimir forces. We apply the formalism to study the local <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>field</b> temperature distributions and electromagnetic force density in cavities with cavity walls at different temperatures. The calculated local electric and magnetic field temperatures exhibit oscillations that depend on the position {{as well as the}} photon energy. However, the effective photon number and field temperature associated with the total electromagnetic field is always position-independent in lossless media. Furthermore, we show that the direction of the electromagnetic force varies as a function of frequency, position, and material thickness...|$|E

40|$|The LCLS {{injector}} must {{operate at}} 120 Hz repetition frequency but {{to date the}} maximum operating frequency of an S-band rf gun has been 50 Hz. The high fields desired for the LCLS gun operation limit the repetition frequency due to thermal expansion causing rf detuning and field redistribution. One method of addressing the thermal loading problem is too reduce the power lost on the cavity walls by properly shaping the rf pulse incident on the gun. The idea is to reach the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>field</b> value in the gun faster than the time constant of the gun would allow when using a flat incident rf pulse. By increasing the incident power by about a factor of three and then decreasing the incident power when the field reaches the desired value in the gun, the field build up time can be decreased {{by more than a}} factor of three. Using this technique the heat load is also decreased by more than a factor of three. In addition the rf coupling coefficient can be increased from the typical critically coupled designs to an overcoupled design which also helps reduce the field build up time.

40|$|Ice shelf {{fractures}} frequently terminate {{where they}} encounter suture zones, regions of material heterogeneity that form between meteoric inflows in ice shelves. This heterogeneity can consist of marine ice, meteoric ice with modified rheological properties, or {{the presence of}} fractu res. Here, we use radar observations on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica, to investigate (i) the termination of a 25 km long rift in the Churchill Peninsula suture zone, which was found to contain ~ 60 m of accreted marine ice, and (ii) the along-flow evolution of a suture zone originating at Cole Peninsula. We determine a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>field</b> of basal melting/freezing rates {{and apply it to}} a flowline model to delineate the along-flow evolution of layers within the ice shelf. The thickening surface wedge of locally accumulated meteoric ice, which likely has limited lateral variation in its mechanical properties, accounts for ~ 60 % of the total ice thickness near the calving front. Thus, we infer that the lower ~ 40 % of the ice column and the material heterogeneities present there are responsible for resisting fracture propagation and thereby delaying tabular calving events, as demonstrated in the > 40 year time series leading up to the 2004 / 2005 calving event for Larsen C.

Qualitative comparisons between the shapes of calculated magnetic field lines and the forms visible in the solar corona at several recent eclipses are displayed.

Dielectric, ferroelectric and leakage current characteristics were evaluated and depth profile Auger electron spectroscopy was used to obtain direct evidence for reactivity and compositional changes at the film/electrode interface and determine their effect on the ferroelectric and dielectric properties of films. Films deposited on Pt electrode showed a relatively higher dielectric constant of approximately 1300, while the films on RuO 2 exhibited lower dielectric constant of only 470. J-t characteristics with leak-age current of approximately 10 (- 8) A/cm(2) under low biasing field (10 kV/cm) was observed for the films under study.

40|$|Contaminant {{transport}} in hydrogeologic systems requires {{knowledge of}} transmissivity, storage coefficient, and dispersivity. Techniques for evaluating transmissivity and storage coefficient {{under field conditions}} are well known. However, the evaluation of dispersivity under field conditions is a costly and time consuming job. The process of transporting a specific conservative ion species in an aquifer {{is analogous to the}} transport of heat in the system. Because of this analogy, the original objective of this research project was to evaluate the use of low-grade thermal water to measure aquifer dispersivity. However, available thermal models of groundwater aquifers proved difficult to use for evaluating the thermal properties (and dispersivity) of an aquifer. Therefore, additional objectives were developed to (1) derive analytical solutions describing the steady and unsteady temperature distribution around a well with a finite caprock thickness and (2) establish a technique for determining the thermal properties (including thermal dispersivity) of an aquifer using field measurements of temperature distribution within the aquifer. Analytical models of hot water injection into groundwater aquifers were developed in this study. Available analytical models of this problem assume that the caprock overlying the aquifer is of infinite thickness. However, many groundwater aquifers have caprock thicknesses of only a few meters. This paper shows two mathematical models which were developed to examine the influence of a caprock with finite thickness on the thermal response of an aquifer. In both models, the horizontal heat conduction and heat convection in the aquifer plus the vertical heat conduction in the caprock are considered. The first model (Model I) assumed that the vertical temperature gradient in the caprock is linear, which can be approached in a caprock with a relatively small thickness. The second model (Model II) removed this restriction and allowed the vertical temperature gradient in the caprock to be nonlinear. For Model I, a steady state and an unsteady state solution for the water temperature distribution surrounding an injection well were obtained. For Model II, a steady state and two unsteady state solutions for the water temperature distribution surrounding an injection well were obtained. One of the two unsteady state solutions is for a short-time period and the other one is for a long-time period. A graphical technique was developed for determining four pertinent aquifer thermal properties: (1) the horizontal thermal conductivity of the aquifer (thermal dispersivity), (2) the thermal capacity of the aquifer, (3) the vertical thermal conductivity of the caprock, and (4) the thermal capacity of the caprock. Dimensionless type curves are constructed from the steady state solution and the unsteady state solution for short time periods in Model II, respectively. Using field data, one curve is constructed using long-term temperature observations (approaching steady state) from several observation wells, and a second curve is constructed using short-time temperature observations from any one of the observation wells. These curves are then matched with the dimensionless type curves, respectively, and values of the four aquifer thermal properties evaluated. Since the steady state condition is difficult to attain in the field, an approximate graphical technique for evaluating the thermal parameters is developed without using the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>field</b> date. In this approximate method, the vertical thermal conductivity of the caprock is assumed equal to the horizontal thermal conductivity of the aquifer, and the thermal capacity of the caprock is assumed equal to the thermal capacity of the aquifer...|$|E
40|$|Transducer {{response}} in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) requires fundamental {{knowledge of the}} field interaction with the material under test. Specifically, in eddy current NDE the transducer is an inductive coil {{or some combination of}} coils with an electromagnetic induction field surrounding the coil. The coil is used predominantly for surface or near-surface inspection of electrical conductors (metals). The change of impedance of the coil at its terminals is used as the criterion for defect detection. The impedance change due to a defect depends upon the relative disruption of the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>field</b> configuration in a given testing situation. A spatially smaller defect relative to the coil dimensions usually causes a smaller impedance change, therefore, it is more difficult to detect. The eddy currents induced in the metal by the exciting coil decay with distance into the metal due to energy loss in the form of Ohmic heating. Consequently, a defect easily detected at the surface with a given coil becomes undetectable at some distance beneath the metal surface. The distance at which a given defect becomes 2 ̆ 2 invisible 2 ̆ 2 {{is directly related to the}} rate of decay of the induced currents and their spatial distribution. The classical skin depth, δδ= √ 2 /ωμσ, is the usual measure of the decay rate of currents in metals, but it is derived assuming a source field of infinite spatial extent and no inhomogeneity. In contrast, coils are often very small relative to the metal object under test and their useful fields are confined to a finite region surrounding the coil; therefore, assuming the classical skin depth in place of the actual skin depth may lead to erroneous conclusions about a coil 2 ̆ 7 s ability to detect and size the defect. This thesis compares the actual decay of induced time-harmonic, steady-state current densities in conductors to the classical skin depth for an air-core coil over a conductor of both infinite (half-space) and finite thickness and for a pair of differential coils inside a conducting tube of infinite and finite thickness. In each case the finite element method (FEM) in its axisymmetric form is used to solve for the magnetic vector potential, A, from which all relevant quantities such as coil impedance and eddy current density are computed. For the coil over a half-space, the FEM is compared to an exact integral solution to confirm the validity of the FEM, while the FEM alone is used to compute quantities for coils in a tube. Actual current densities are computed and their rate of decay versus depth in the conductor, distance from exciting coil, and variations in coil and material parameters are investigated. The normalized coil impedance is computed versus coil proximity to the conductor (liftoff) and changing dimensionless parameter RS /δS (RS = coil mean radius). For the coil over a half-space, experimental measurements of coil impedance were performed and compared with the computed analytical solution and the FEM. In general, the experimental measurements show the range of validity of the analytical and FEM solutions. The experiments and computer simulations show the actual eddy current density distribution and decay is significantly different from the classical exponential decay in regions of operation where the coil is most useful for NDE but does approach the classical solution in the extreme region RS / δS 3 ̆e 3 ̆e 1. Caution should therefore be used when applying the classical skin depth approximation when RS /δS 1. This study also shows the validity and usefulness of the axisymmetric FEM for modelling field/material interaction in spite of inherent simplifying assumptions. The analytical solution, while elegant and important in its own right, cannot model complex defects or material inhomogeneities in general, yet the FEM handles these situations with relative ease...|$|E
