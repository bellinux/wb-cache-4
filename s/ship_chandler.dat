25|$|Jack Buckland {{was born}} in 1864 in Sydney, the eldest child of William Wilberforce Buckland and Harriet Emmeline Hopkins. His mother {{was born in}} Sydney in 1842, the {{daughter}} of John Hopkins, a <b>ship</b> <b>chandler</b> who {{died when she was}} young. Her father's business partner, John Carr, and his wife Eliza later adopted Harriet in addition to the <b>ship</b> <b>chandler</b> business. Buckland's father was from Wraysbury in England, the son of an auctioneer, William Thomas Buckland. Buckland's father worked as a merchant and shipbroker in Australia and in 1863 married the 21-year-old Harriet Hopkins in Sydney. Buckland was their first child, born in 1864. When he was 9, Buckland's family returned to England, leaving him with the now elderly John and Eliza Carr who adopted him as their son. John Carr was therefore Buckland's stepfather as well as step-grandfather.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 {{the ship}} was {{purchased}} by its last owner, Fern Shipping, and renamed Captain Kurbatskiy. After spending {{a brief period of}} time under Cambodian flag {{the ship was}} again registered to Russia and classified by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping. On 21 June 2011, after having been anchored off Muara Asam Asam in Kalimantan, Indonesia, for almost two months due to a commercial dispute on a quality of loaded nickel ore, seven crew members managed to purchase three litres of pure spirits from a <b>ship</b> <b>chandler</b> to have a party. Unbeknownst to them, the captain of the ship had asked the <b>ship</b> <b>chandler</b> to deliver ethanol for the ship's medical kit, but had rejected the suspicious-looking bottles because they had no prints proving that the content was suitable for medical use. Instead of 90–95% ethanol spirit the liquid in the bottles contained 36% of methanol, and four of the seven crew members involved in the party {{died as a result of}} methanol poisoning.|$|E

Hucks was married, and his wife was an attendant in the employ of Hugh Carter, a wealthy <b>ship</b> <b>chandler</b> of Edmunton, the port from which my fathers ship sailed. Thomas had some difficulty in enjoying his wife's society when on shore, because old Carter did not want him hanging around the house; so Captain Wegg good-naturedly offered to intercede for him.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Martha Trapbois had dwelt {{too long}} in Alsatia, to be either {{surprised}} or terrified at the altercation she had witnessed. Indeed, she only wondered that the debate did not end {{in some of those}} acts of violence by which they were usually terminated in the Sanctuary. As the disputants separated from each other, she, who had no idea that the cause of the quarrel was more deeply rooted than in the daily scenes of the same nature which she had heard of or witnessed, did not hesitate to stop Master Christie in his return to his shop, and present to him the letter which Lord Glenvarloch had given to her. Had she been better acquainted with life and its business, she would certainly have waited for a more temperate moment; and she had reason to repent of her precipitation, when, without saying a single word, or taking the trouble to gather more of the information contained in the letter than was expressed in the subscription, the incensed <b>ship</b> <b>chandler</b> threw it down on the ground, trampled it in high disdain, and, without addressing a single word to the bearer, except, indeed, something much more like a hearty curse than was perfectly consistent with his own grave appearance, he retired into his shop, and shut the hatch-door.|$|E
