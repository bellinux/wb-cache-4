5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its <b>short-term</b> effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the <b>short-term</b> relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the <b>short-term</b> treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

40|$|Volatility {{represents}} {{a big challenge}} for logistics in the automotive industry as it becomes harder for the transport planning to bring the demands efficiently to the automobile manufacturer. The reason for volatility results from casual incoming orders on one side, and the middle- and long-term changes, which appear from volatilities in production or demand, on the other side. The concept of an adaptive <b>short-termed</b> transport planning focuses on an optimization of transports on the actual situation despite of volatility. Through this {{it will be possible}} to counteract an insufficient workload in a combination with sluggishness of the transport planning...|$|R

PBDO and IDH with SH caused more significant rises in portal serum amylase, cathepsin B and malate dehydrogenase levels, and pancreatic water content {{as well as more}} significant redistribution of cathepsin B activity from the lysosomal fraction to the zymogen fraction in the subcellular fractionations than only PBDO, or PBDO with IDH, or PBDO with SH group. In addition, more accelerated lysosomal and mitochondrial fragility were observed in the PBDO and IDH with SH group. Moreover, PBDO and IDH with SH caused an activation of larger amount of trypsinogen in the pancreas compared with other groups (PBDO with IDH and PBDO with SH group). These results indicate that present model of <b>short-termed</b> PBDO and exocrine stimulation with systemic hypotension seems to be a pertinent model for gallstone pancreatitis in humans, and that redistribution of lysosomal enzymes and subcellular organellar fragility seem {{to play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of pancreatic injuries by PBDO, particularly with exocrine stimulation and pancreatic ischaemia, probably via activation of trypsinogen to trypsin by lysosomal enzyme such as cathepsin B. ラットにおいて 2 週間の総膵胆管閉塞下, セルレイン投与(0. 2 μg/kg. hr) による外分泌刺激および脱血による低血圧(平均動脈圧を 30 % 低下) の膵外分泌におよぼす影響を検討した. このモデルにおいては, 門脈血清アミラーゼ, カテプシン B および林檎酸脱水素酵素レベルが単に総膵胆管閉塞や閉塞＋外分泌刺激や閉塞十低血圧群に比べ有意に上昇するのみならず, ライソゾーム酵素のチモーゲン分画への再分布, ライソゾームとミトコンドリア脆弱性の亢進が観察された. これらの結果は, 今回のこのモデルがヒトにおける胆石性膵炎の実験モデルとして有用であるのみならず, 胆石性膵炎の病態生理におけるライソゾーム酵素の再分布と細胞内小器官の脆弱性の亢進の重要な役割が示唆された...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{presented}} analysis can build {{the basis for the}} transformation towards sustainability in the regarded company. Altogether, the proposed Sustainability Maturity Cube as a blueprint, as well as the adapted decision model of Kamprath and Röglinger (2011) created utility for the subject matter experts as they provided them with recommendations and means for further analysis (e.g., careful estimations, <b>short-termed</b> vs long-termed effects, effects of different absolute sizes of input parameters). They also helped to systematize the decision processes. The presented approach thus allows aligning ecological, social, and economic objectives and drawing economically reasonable conclusions in this context by determining the optimal increase of the sustainability maturity level.|$|R
