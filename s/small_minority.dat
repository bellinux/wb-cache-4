5|$|The year 1916 marked {{four centuries}} since Palestine had {{become part of}} the Ottoman Empire, also known as the Turkish Empire. For most of this period, the Jewish {{population}} represented a <b>small</b> <b>minority,</b> approximately 3% of the total, with Muslims representing the largest segment of the population, and Christians the second.|$|E
5|$|With the new synagogue, {{an organ}} was {{introduced}} into religious service. The <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of Orthodox Jews found this change to be intolerable, {{and they began}} to hold their services separately, in rented rooms.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} {{a portion of their}} time feeding on the ground, and a very <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.|$|E

5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the {{population}} practise ancient Pagan religions. Neopaganism in the United Kingdom is primarily represented by Wicca and Witchcraft religions, Druidry, and Heathenry. According to the 2011 UK Census, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England, and 3,448 in Wales, including 11,026 Wiccans in England and 740 in Wales.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in large towns and cities in Belgium, such as Antwerp and Brussels. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|The Germans invaded Hungary on Sunday, 19 March 1944, meeting no resistance. Following Hungary's {{annexation}} in 1941 {{of parts}} of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, there were 725,000 Jews in the country, as well as over 60,000 Jewish converts to Christianity and others the Nazis counted as Jews, according to Yehuda Bauer. Most were liberal Jews and fully assimilated, nearly 30 percent were Orthodox, and a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> were Zionists.|$|E

5|$|The Sogdian {{religious}} texts {{found in}} China and {{dating to the}} Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang are mostly Buddhist (translated from Chinese sources), Manichaean and Nestorian Christian, with only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of Zoroastrian texts. But tombs of Sogdian merchants in China dated to {{the last third of}} the 6th century show predominantly Zoroastrian motifs or Zoroastrian-Manichaean syncretism, while archaeological remains from Sogdiana appear fairly Iranian and conservatively Zoroastrian.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Muslims {{in the country}} are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam (Sufism). Its most common expression is the Tijaniyah, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. A <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi movements.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) {{on behalf of his}} resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E

5|$|Belarus {{was once}} a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the {{population}} being Jewish. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the Holocaust, deportation, and emigration, so that today {{it is a very}} <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of less than one percent. The Lipka Tatars, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly Muslims. According to Article 16 of the Constitution, Belarus has no official religion. While the freedom of worship is granted in the same article, religious organizations deemed harmful to the government or social order can be prohibited.|$|E
5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the country's urban elite, {{and it is not}} spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> {{experiment}} with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes {{the use of}} infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, and a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses {{where they can}} cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{patron saint}} of England is Saint George; his {{symbolic}} cross {{is included in the}} flag of England, {{as well as in the}} Union Flag as part of a combination. There are many other English and associated saints; some of the best-known are: Cuthbert, Edmund, Alban, Wilfrid, Aidan, Edward the Confessor, John Fisher, Thomas More, Petroc, Piran, Margaret Clitherow and Thomas Becket. There are non-Christian religions practised. Jews have a history of a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> on the island since 1070. They were expelled from England in 1290 following the Edict of Expulsion, only to be allowed back in 1656.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{developed}} rapidly {{after the}} coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.|$|E
