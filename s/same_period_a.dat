5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the <b>same</b> <b>period,</b> <b>a</b> new wave of pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in {{what remained of the}} Empire.|$|E
5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been possible. In about the <b>same</b> <b>period,</b> <b>a</b> technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|In Russia and {{the other}} nations of the former Soviet Union, golden jackals are {{considered}} furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the dressing process. Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this <b>same</b> <b>period,</b> <b>a</b> total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool's first Football League {{match at}} Anfield was played on 9 September 1893, against Lincoln City. Liverpool won 4–0 {{in front of}} 5,000spectators. A new stand capable of holding 3,000spectators was {{constructed}} in 1895 {{on the site of}} the present Main Stand. Designed by architect Archibald Leitch, the stand had a distinctive red and white gable, and was similar to the main stand at Newcastle United's ground St James' Park. Another stand was constructed at the Anfield Road end in 1903, built from timber and corrugated iron. After Liverpool had won their second League championship in 1906, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, named it the Spion Kop; it was named after a famous hill in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War in 1900. More than 300men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. Around the <b>same</b> <b>period</b> <b>a</b> stand was also built along Kemlyn Road.|$|E

In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by Markiian Shashkevych, published The Nymph of the Dniester, a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book.|$|E

Blackmore is usually careful to describe his music as ‘renaissance rock’, which is more accurate as {{a description of the}} source of his inspiration, but also distinguishes it from other forms of medieval based music.
