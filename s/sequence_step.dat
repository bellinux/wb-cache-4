50|$|A <b>sequence</b> <b>step</b> {{algorithm}} (SQS-AL) is an algorithm {{implemented in}} a discrete event simulation system to maximize resource utilization. This {{is achieved by}} running through two main nested loops: A <b>sequence</b> <b>step</b> loop and a replication loop. For each <b>sequence</b> <b>step,</b> each replication loop is a simulation run that collects crew idle time for activities in that <b>sequence</b> <b>step.</b> The collected crew idle times are then used to determine resource arrival dates for user-specified confidence levels. The process of collecting the crew idle times and determining crew arrival times for activities on a considered <b>sequence</b> <b>step</b> is repeated from the first to the last <b>sequence</b> <b>step.</b>|$|E

50|$|A primer dimer {{is formed}} and amplified in three steps. In the first step, two primers anneal at their {{respective}} 3' ends (step I in the figure). If this construct is stable enough, the DNA polymerase will bind {{and extend the}} primers according to the complementary <b>sequence</b> (<b>step</b> II in the figure). An important factor contributing to {{the stability of the}} construct in step I is a high GC-content at the 3' ends and length of the overlap. The third step occurs in the next cycle, when a single strand of the product of step II is used as a template to which fresh primers anneal leading to synthesis of more PD product.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry and academia have realized the {{critical path method}} and other time-based methods were not suitable for repetitive projects, which were resource-driven in nature. Both communities have been attempting to develop a better technique to schedule repetitive projects. Many approaches have been proposed; however, {{they are capable of}} solving the problems only to a certain degree of complication. Most of these approaches were limited to deterministic problems. A few probabilistic scheduling methods using simulation techniques were proposed with improvement in capturing the stochastic nature of construction activities; however, none of them guaranteed continuous resource utilization. The <b>Sequence</b> <b>Step</b> Algorithm (SQS-AL) is a general scheduling algorithm for minimizing the duration of repetitive projects with probabilistic activity durations while achieving continuous resource utilization. SQS-AL consists of two main nested loops: the <b>sequence</b> <b>step</b> loop and the replication loop. For each <b>sequence</b> <b>step,</b> each replication loop is a simulation run that collects crew idle time for activities in that <b>sequence</b> <b>step.</b> The collected crew idle times are, then, used to determine resource arrival dates for user-specified confidence levels, i. e., probabilities of having zero idle time in corresponding activities. The process of collecting the crew idle times and determining crew arrival times for activities on a considered <b>sequence</b> <b>step</b> is repeated from the first to the last <b>sequence</b> <b>step.</b> The effect of scheduling activities on the crew idle times for following activities is revealed step by step prior to scheduling the following activities. As a result, SQS-AL can guarantee continuous resource utilization for the user-specified confidence levels. 	This thesis also presents the application of work breaks, the determination of the controlling sequence, and the scheduling of resource-sharing activities in repetitive projects with probabilistic activity durations. An application, called “ChaStrobe,” was developed on top of the Stroboscope Graphical User Interface to facilitate schedulers in creating simulation model for repetitive projects and scheduling the projects using all concepts presented in the thesis. In addition, ChaStrobe consists of two search methods, the exhaustive search and the genetic algorithm...|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} {{way to reduce the}} duration and cost of projects with repetitive activities is through the relaxation of resource continuity and the introduction of work breaks at strategic points between repetitive project units. This paper describes the problem and introduces the basic concepts for determining the optimal location and duration of work breaks for both deterministic and probabilistic activity durations. The procedure is described in detail and is applied to an example project with 9 activities with probabilistic durations that repeat over 10 similar work units. The solution employs concepts from the Repetitive Scheduling Method (RSM), the <b>Sequence</b> <b>Step</b> Algorithm (SQS-AL), and is modeled in STROBOSCOPE, an activity-based simulation system.

40|$|ABSTRACT: After {{several years}} of {{operating}} an AS/SVE system at a former industrial site (Site) and achieving a reduction of over 85 % of the VOCs in groundwater, the remedial approach was converted to an anaerobic system, conducive to the reductive dechlorination of the residual contaminants. The acceleration of in-situ bioremediation via anaerobic reductive dechlorination (ARD) by the injection of an electron donor/carbon source (substrate) into the subsurface, {{is intended to be}} the final technology <b>sequence</b> <b>step</b> for the in-situ treatment of chlorinated solvents (PCE, TCE) in groundwater at the Site. Following a successful ARD pilot test onsite, the full-scale application was accomplished utilizing the existing air sparge and soil vapor extraction system in conjunction with direct-push injection points to facilitate the distribution of the electron donor substrate into the subsurface. After eighteen months of operation, the mobilization of contaminants, the creation of biodegradation end products (ethene and ethane) along with the increased reduction of the constituents of concern, has demonstrated that a former AS/SVE remedial approach can be modified to promote the anaerobic reduction of the residual chlorinated VOCs in the subsurface...|$|E

The complete step sequence of a walk was subjected to analysis aimed at demonstrating the walking pattern, step <b>sequence,</b> <b>step</b> cycle, limb coordination, and limb interaction to complement the foot fault scoring system. Rats (males, n= 10) underwent unilateral photothrombotic lesion of the motor cortex of the forelimb and hind limb areas. Locomotion was video recorded before the insult and at postischemic days 7 and 28. Analysis of walking was performed frame-by-frame. Walking along the rung ladder revealed different results that were dependent on ladder inclination. Horizontal walking was found to discriminate lesion-related motor deficits in forelimb, whereas downward walking demonstrates hind limb use most sensitively. A more frequent use of the impaired forelimb that possibly supported poststroke motor learning in rats was shown.

40|$|Clinical medical data, {{especially}} {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU), consist of multivariate time series of observations. For each patient visit (or episode), sensor data and lab test results are recorded in the patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR). While potentially containing a wealth of insights, the data is difficult to mine effectively, owing to varying length, irregular sampling and missing data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly those using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden units, are powerful and increasingly popular models for learning from sequence data. They effectively model varying length sequences and capture long range dependencies. We present the first study to empirically evaluate the ability of LSTMs to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements. Specifically, we consider multilabel classification of diagnoses, training a model to classify 128 diagnoses given 13 frequently but irregularly sampled clinical measurements. First, we establish the effectiveness of a simple LSTM network for modeling clinical data. Then we demonstrate a straightforward and effective training strategy in which we replicate targets at each <b>sequence</b> <b>step.</b> Trained only on raw time series, our models outperform several strong baselines, including a multilayer perceptron trained on hand-engineered features...|$|E

The complex is in fast to intermediate exchange on the NMR chemical shift time scale and suffers substantial linebroadening {{for the majority of}} interfacial resonances. This essentially precludes determination of a high-resolution structure for the interface based on NMR data alone. However, by introducing a small number of additional constraints based on chemical shift and linewidth footprinting combined with analogies to known structures, an ensemble of model structures was generated using a computational strategy equivalent to that for a conventional NMR structure determination. We find that the base pair adjacent to the dA 2 bulge is not formed and that the protein recognizes this feature in forming the complex; intermolecular NOE enhancements are observed from the sidechain of Thr 33 to all four nucleotides of the DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>step</b> adjacent to the bulge.

40|$|Runtime-verification [34, 32, 4, 3, 21] is an {{effective}} technique to ensure at execution time that a system meets a desirable behavior. It {{can be used in}} numerous application domains, and more particularly when integrating together untrusted software components. A possible approach for runtime verification consists in analyzing a run of the system under scrutiny in an incremental way using a decision procedure called a monitor. This monitor may be generated from a user-provided high level specification (consisting in e. g., a property expressed by temporal logic formula or an automaton). The primary goal of this monitor is to detect violation or satisfaction with respect to the given specification. It {{can be viewed as a}} state machine (with an output function) processing an execution <b>sequence</b> (<b>step</b> by step) of the monitored program, and producing a sequence of verdicts (truth values taken from a truth-domain) indicating specification satisfaction or violation.

Moreover, it has been shown by Viswanathan and Kim [37] that some computability constraints apply to runtime monitors. Considering the monitoring of safety properties, the violation detection mechanism used in the runtime device needs to be effective.
