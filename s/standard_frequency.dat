500|$|At {{the end of}} 1922, WWV's purpose {{shifted to}} {{broadcasting}} <b>standard</b> <b>frequency</b> signals. These signals were desperately needed by other broadcasters, because equipment limitations at the time meant that the broadcasters could not stay on their assigned frequencies. Testing began on January 29, 1923, and frequencies from 200 to 545kHz were broadcast. Frequency broadcasts officially began on March 6, 1923. The frequencies were accurate to [...] "better than three-tenths of one percent." [...] At first, the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next, using a wavemeter. The first quartz resonators (that stabilized the frequency generating oscillators) were invented in the mid-1920s, and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV's frequency broadcasts.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the nature of}} long-term absolute pitch memory—an ability traditionally assumed to belong only to absolute pitch (AP) possessors—by testing for evidence of this memory for “standard” frequencies in musicians without AP. <b>Standard</b> <b>frequencies,</b> those based on the equally tempered system with A = 440 Hz, are common in the sonic environment of the Western college musical education, and thus could {{have the opportunity to}} penetrate listeners’ long-term memories. Through four experimental tasks, this thesis examines musicians’ ability to recognize and produce frequencies from the set of equally tempered frequencies based on A = 440 Hz, without regard to those musicians’ pitch-labeling abilities. The experimental tasks also compare freshmen with seniors to test if exposure to <b>standard</b> <b>frequencies</b> during a college musical education engrains <b>standard</b> <b>frequencies</b> in long-term memory. The results suggest that musicians without AP cannot distinguish between <b>standard</b> and nonstandard <b>frequencies</b> during listening tasks, but {{they may be able to}} recall them without prompting when singing familiar folk songs. However, musical training during the college years does not seem to improve these abilities. Further experimentation is needed to corroborate the results, including modifications to the current tasks and methodology, as well as a larger subject size...|$|R
