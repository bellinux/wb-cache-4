40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of a permitted <b>yellow</b> food colour, <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> –FCF on root tips of Allium sativum was investigated {{with a view to}} ascertaining its mitodepressive effect. Root tips of Allium sativum were treated with five concentrations of <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> like 100 ppm, 250 ppm, 500 ppm, 750 ppm and 1000 ppm and with distilled water as control. The time of action of the respective concentration of solutions were 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs. Exposure to different concentrations of <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> showed an inhibitory effect on cell division of Allium sativum root tips. It caused a general decline in mitotic index value. <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> diminishes the mitotic index in correlation with the increased concentration and duration of treatment. The results implicated <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> – <b>FCF</b> as a mitotic depressor...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the removal}} of <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> dye from aqueous {{solutions}} using low-cost materials as adsorbents such as modified Rice husk (MRH) and sugarcane bagasse (SB) by a batch system were investigated. Experiments were carried out {{as a function of}} contact time, initial concentration, pH and adsorbent dosages. The equilibrium adsorption of <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> dye on adsorbents was analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin models. The results indicate that the Freundlich model provides the best correlation for sunset yellow-MRH system and the Langmuir model provide the best correlation for sunset yellow-SB system and also pseudo-second-order model was best applicable to the sorption data. The results revealed that the <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> is considerably adsorbed on modified rice husk and sugarcane bagasse and it could be an economical method for {{the removal of}} <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> from aqueous systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the biochemical influence of broccoli and beet extracts on selected individual additives NaNO 2 or <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> treated rats, {{in addition to the}} gene expression of some antioxidant enzymes. Forty-two male rats were assigned to seven groups of six rats in each group. The control group was fed a diet without an additive for four weeks. Group (2) received NaNO 2, groups (3) received NaNO 2 co-administered with broccoli extract (4) NaNO 2 co-administered with beet extracts, Group (5) received <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow,</b> Group (6) received <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> co-administered with broccoli extract, and Group (7) received <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> co-administered with beet extract, for four weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood, liver, kidney, and brain samples were taken for biochemical and/or molecular analysis. The mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes was determined by reversing transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The obtained results revealed that rats co-administered with beet or broccoli extracts had a significant decrease in serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, urea, total lipids, and triglycerides, as well as a significant increase in reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activities, compared to the normal control group. Oral administration of NaNO 2 or <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> caused a significant increase in serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, urea, total lipids, and triglycerides, as well as a significant decrease in GSH, GSH-px, and SOD compared to the positive group. In conclusion, this study showed that broccoli and beet extracts have a protective effect against NaNO 2 or <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> in rat treated groups...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{evaluate}} the protective role of selenium and vitamin A, C and E (Selenium ACE) concerning {{the reduction of the}} genotoxic effects induced by <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> in mice using different mutagenic end points and their effects on DNA. The study included: its effect on the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE’s) in bone-marrow cells, chromosomal aberration analysis in somatic (bone-marrow) and germ cells (spermatocytes) after single and repeated oral treatment, the induction of morphological sperm abnormalities in male mice and its effect on. The results showed genotoxic effects of <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> as indicated increasing the frequency of SCE’s and chromosomal aberrations in both somatic and germ cells and increased morphological sperm abnormalities and DNA fragmentation.

50|$|Irn-Bru {{is known}} for its bright orange colour. As of 1999 it {{contained}} 0.002% of ammonium ferric citrate, sugar, 32 flavouring agents including caffeine and quinine (but not in Australia), and two controversial colourings (<b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>FCF</b> and Ponceau 4R). On 27 January 2010, A.G. Barr agreed to a Food Standards Agency voluntary ban on these two colourings although no date was set for their replacement. However, after lobbying by First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, a proposed restriction of Sunset Yellow to 10 mg was eased to 20 mg in 2011 — the same amount present in Irn Bru. As of May 2017, Irn-Bru still contains these colourings.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 1970s and the well-publicized {{advocacy}} of Benjamin Feingold, {{there has been}} public concern that food colorings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children. [...] These concerns have led the U.S. FDA and other food safety authorities to regularly review the scientific literature, and led the UK FSA to commission a study by researchers at Southampton University {{of the effect of}} a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, <b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>FCF</b> and Carmoisine (dubbed the [...] "Southampton 6")) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007. [...] The study found [...] "a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity" [...] in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended".|$|E
50|$|Ingredients in {{squashes}} and cordials {{have evolved}} over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh {{for quite a long}} time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and <b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>FCF</b> are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{competitive}} adsorption of four food dyes (<b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow,</b> Allura Red, tartrazine, and Brilliant Black) by heated pine wood is studied using multivariate calibration. Partial {{least squares}} PLS 1 and principal component regression PCR are effectively applied for simultaneous determination of food dyes with high accuracy (96. 2 – 103. 6 %) and low relative prediction error (2. 3 – 6. 9 %). Using multivariate calibration, the dyes are detected down to 0. 11, 0. 15, 0. 24, and 0. 29 mg L− 1. The removal of dyes increased at acidic solution and H-bonding {{is the main}} controlling mechanism. The maximum removal capacities (according to Langmuir model) are 3. 4, 2. 5, 4. 8, and 7. 1 mg g− 1 for tartrazine, Brilliant Black, Allura Red, and <b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow,</b> respectively, at pH 2. 0 and 25 °C. The competition factors (CFs) are estimated from the isotherms to assess the degree of competition between dyes toward the surface. The CFs are 0. 64, 0. 66, 0. 77, and 0. 77 for Brilliant Black, Allura Red, <b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow,</b> and tartrazine, respectively. Accordingly, Brilliant Black is the most affected dye while <b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow</b> and tartrazine are the least affected in multi-solute adsorption.

40|$|The azo dye, <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow,</b> is a prototypical, chromonic {{liquid crystal}} in which {{assembly}} {{in aqueous solution}} at high volume fraction leads to lyotropic mesophases with a “package of properties distinct in almost every aspect” (Lydon, J. Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004, 8, 480). In particular, the isotropic to nematic transition in such phases, the consequence of stacking of dye molecules in chains, is difficult to bring into correspondence with athermal theories for rigid rods as well as modifications that consider chain interactions with one another. Chromonic mesogens, small molecules that stack to form lyotropic liquid crystals, prompt structural questions {{that have yet to}} be answered; a full understanding of structure should inform colligative properties. Herein, the single crystal structure of a guanidinium salt of the <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> dianion, a known chromonic mesogen, is reported. The compound crystallizes as a dihydrate, tetrahydrofuran solvate in the orthorhombic space group Pnna, with a = 6. 8426 (5) Å, b = 20. 048 (1) Å, c = 21. 466 (2) Å. The <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> molecules, point group approximately Cs, are disordered about a crystallographic diad axis. The structure is informative because pairwise interactions in the disordered crystal structure show a remarkable correspondence with the stereochemistry of <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> molecules in solution and in the liquid crystal phase. The solution structure is here simulated by the combination of molecular dynamics,metadynamics, and quantum chemical computations. The comparable disorder in the fluid and solid states suggests the possibility that stacked aggregates adhere to growing crystals intact. Computations were used to evaluate proposals that stacking faults and branching points lower the X-ray correlation lengths while preserving extended structures. Evidence is found forstacking faults but not branches. The solution stereochemistry and stereodynamics has implications for the geometry of long rods, for which understanding is a prerequisite for reckoning properties of vexing chromonic mesophases...|$|R
