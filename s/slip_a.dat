5|$|Arsenal {{succumbed to}} a 4–1 defeat in their opening match against Spartak Moscow, {{which was the}} biggest loss inflicted on the club in 18 years. The team let <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> two-goal lead against Bayern Munich at Highbury on 5 December 2000, before winning 1–0 at Olympique Lyonnais to keep their {{aspirations}} of qualifying for the quarter-finals attainable. In the reverse fixture, an equaliser scored by Edmílson in the last minute of normal time prompted Wenger to rue fatigue {{and the absence of}} captain Adams. Arsenal defeated Spartak Moscow by a solitary goal and in spite of losing to Bayern Munich on 14 March 2001, Lyon's draw with Spartak Moscow meant Arsenal qualified for the quarter-finals by the head-to-head rule.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E

25|$|On 2 February 2008, Darchinyan fought Z Gorres to a {{controversial}} split draw at the Waterfront Hotel in Cebu City, Philippines in an IBF Super Flyweight Eliminator where the winner would challenge the champion Dimitri Kirilov. The bout {{began with a}} knockdown for Darchinyan in the first round, which {{appeared to be a}} slip by Gorres when replayed. The crowd was upset with the referee calling the <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> knockdown and began to pelt the ring with bottles of water, coins and other objects. Gorres came back in the second round to floor Darchinyan with a left hand, but Darchinyan beat the count, which again prompted some arena fans to pelt the ring with objects. Gorres was knocked down in the fifth round, but the referee ruled it a <b>slip.</b> <b>A</b> clash of heads in the sixth round opened up a bad gash on Gorres. In the ninth round, Darchinyan connected with a right hand, sending Gorres down {{for the second time in}} the fight. Gorres would fall to the canvas on at least three other occasions in the final three rounds, with the referee ruling all of them slips. The final scores were 113-112 for Gorres, 114-112 for Darchinyan, and 113-113 for the draw.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Strauss {{failed to}} proved himself {{again with a}} second ball lbw, falling for {{successive}} double-digit scores {{for the first time}} in 35 Test matches, leaving No. 3 Vaughan to effectively open once more. With the total on 28, and both batsmen with two fours to their name, Denesh Ramdin threw up the ball after an appeal off Cook, who scurried for a single in the confusion. Cook was awarded a run, though as the ball hadn't hit bat and he wasn't caught behind, it was eventually a bye. Then, Ramdin let <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> sitter through his legs which went on to hit his helmet, boosting the English with a mandatory five penalty runs before the second day's play ended.|$|E

At the 2011 Aegon Championships in London, Tsonga received a first-round bye, then beat Michael Berrer and world no. 1 Rafael Nadal, while moving through to the semifinals {{for the first time in}} a grass tournament. In the semifinals, he defeated British wildcard James Ward, but he let <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> healthy lead into a disappointing loss against Andy Murray in the final.

Using this condition, it is proved that (i) there exists <b>a</b> largest <b>slip</b> AFL and (ii) if ℒ is <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> family, then the smallest AFL containing the commutative closure of ℒ is <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> AFL. <b>A</b> new operation called “homomorphic replication” is then introduced. It is shown that the smallest AFL containing a homomorphic replication of <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> AFL is also <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> AFL. Furthermore, the resulting AFL is principal if the original AFL is principal. It is then proved that the smallest AFL containing all homomorphic replications of the regular sets is not principal. Finally, abstract families of acceptors are presented which, respectively, define the smallest AFL containing a particular homomorphic replication of the regular sets and all homomorphic replications of the regular sets...|$|R

25|$|All {{segments}} {{shared the}} common elements of thrust faulting with {{a component of}} left-lateral <b>slip,</b> <b>a</b> general east-west strike and a northward dip, {{but they were not}} unified with regard to their connection to the associated underlying bedrock. The initial surveyors of the extensive faulting in the valley, foothills, and mountains reported only tectonic faulting, while excluding fissures and other features that arose from the effects of compaction and landsliding. In the vicinity of the Sylmar Fault segment, there was a low possibility of landslides {{due to a lack of}} elevation change, but in the foothills and mountainous area a large amount of landsliding occurred and more work was necessary to eliminate the possibility of misidentifying a feature. Along the hill fronts of the Tujunga segment some ambiguous formations were present because some scarps may have had influence from downhill motion, but for the most part they were tectonic in nature.|$|E
25|$|The British {{made several}} {{attempts}} to sink Königsberg including one to <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> shallow-draught torpedo boat (with escorts) within range, an operation easily repulsed {{by the force}} in the delta. A blockship, the Newbridge, was sunk by the British across one of the delta mouths to prevent her escape; however, it was soon realized that Königsberg could still escape {{through one of the}} delta's other channels. Dummy mines were laid in some of these alternatives, but they were considered a doubtful deterrent. A civilian pilot named Cutler was hired to bring his Curtiss seaplane for reconnaissance; his plane was shot down, although the presence of the elusive cruiser was verified. A pair of Royal Naval Air Service Sopwith seaplanes were brought up with the intention of scouting and even bombing the ship, but they soon fell apart in the tropical conditions. A trio of Short seaplanes fared a little better, managing to take photographs of the ship before they were grounded by the glue-melting tropical heat and German fire.|$|E

500|$|The 1979 Coyote Lake {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} [...] on August 6 with a moment magnitude of 5.7 {{and a maximum}} Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock occurred on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County, California and resulted {{in a number of}} injuries, including some that required hospitalization. Most of the $500,000 in damage that was caused was non-structural, but several businesses were closed for repairs. Data from numerous strong motion instruments was used to determine the type, depth, and extent of <b>slip.</b> <b>A</b> mild aftershock sequence lasted throughout the remainder of the month that was of interest to seismologists, especially with regard to fault creep, and following the event, local governments evaluated their response to the incident.|$|E
500|$|While {{the focal}} {{mechanism}} of the mainshock was right-lateral fault slip on the northwest trending Imperial fault, a marked change {{in the distribution of}} aftershocks occurred with the onset of the Brawley aftershock, which exhibited left-lateral <b>slip.</b> <b>A</b> distinct zone of aftershocks formed a belt from west of Brawley to near Wiest Lake, where sinistral motion on a northeast trending conjugate fault responded to an increase in tension at the northwest end of the Imperial fault.

500|$|Playwright David Garrick {{dedicated}} the enormously successful The Farmer's Return to the satirical artist William Hogarth. [...] The story {{concerns a}} farmer who regales his family with {{an account of}} his talk with Miss Fanny, the comedy being derived from the reversal of traditional roles: the sceptical farmer poking fun at the credulous city-folk. [...] Hogarth made his own observations of the Cock Lane ghost, with obvious references in Credulity, Superstition and Fanaticism (1762).

The 1957–58 season saw the club equal their previous best FA Cup run, reaching the last 16 by defeating Chelsea, Football League champions only three years earlier, in the Fourth Round. After letting <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> three-goal lead at Stamford Bridge, Darlington won the replay 4–1 after extra time, described as [...] "a most meritorious win, earned {{by a combination of}} sound tactics and an enthusiasm that Chelsea never equalled" [...] by The Times correspondent, who felt it [...] "surprising that extra time was necessary, for Darlington always seemed to have the match well in hand". In the League, Darlington's fourth place in 1948–49 was their only top-half finish in the first twelve seasons after the war, and when the regional sections of the Third Division were merged, they were allocated to the new Fourth Division.|$|E
500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E
500|$|Garnet {{may have}} been {{questioned}} on as many as 23occasions.

[...] His interrogators resorted to the forgery of correspondence between Garnet and other Catholics, but to no avail. [...] His jailers then allowed him to talk with another priest in a neighbouring cell, with eavesdroppers listening to every word. [...] Eventually Garnet let <b>slip</b> <b>a</b> crucial piece of information, that there was only one man who could testify that he had any knowledge of the plot. Under torture Garnet admitted that he had heard of the plot from fellow Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, who had learnt of it in confession from Catesby. [...] Garnet was charged with high treason and tried in the Guildhall on 28March, in a trial lasting from 8am until 7pm. According to Coke, Garnet instigated the plot: [...] " [...] hath many gifts and endowments of nature, by art learned, a good linguist and, by profession, a Jesuit and a Superior as indeed he is Superior to all his predecessors in devilish treason, a Doctor of Dissimulation, Deposing of Princes, Disposing of Kingdoms, Daunting and deterring of subjects, and Destruction." [...] Garnet refuted all the charges against him, and explained the Catholic position on such matters, but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death.|$|E
