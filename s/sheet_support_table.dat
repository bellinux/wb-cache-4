40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept for a low-mass 50 m 2 deployable P-Band dual polarisation antenna that can measure terrestrial biomass levels from a spacecraft in a low-Earth orbit. A monolithic array of feed and radiating patches is bonded to a transversally curved structure {{consisting of two}} Kevlar sheets. The first <b>sheet</b> <b>supports</b> the array and the other <b>sheet</b> <b>supports</b> a ground plane. The two sheets are connected by a compliant Kevlar core that allows the whole structure to be folded elastically and to spring back to its original, undamaged shape on release. This structural concept has been given the acronym of FLATS (Folding Large Antenna Tape Spring). Test-pieces {{have been made to}} demonstrate both the RF and mechanical aspects of the design, particularly the RF performance before and after folding the structure. It is concluded that the proposed concept is the design with the highest potential for large low frequency antennas for low-cost missions. I...|$|R

40|$|A novel process {{involving}} a paper-based ultrafiltration (UF) membrane was developed via paper coating technology. The membrane employed a paper <b>sheet</b> as <b>support</b> layer and a coated thin film layer of adhesive. The proper selection of paper <b>sheet</b> <b>support</b> layer {{was crucial to}} the performance of the ultrafiltration membrane. A paper sheet with beating degree of 85 oSR and basis weight of 50 g/m 2 was chosen as the support. PVA was chosen as the adhesive. The paper-based ultrafiltration membrane achieved high retention performance while using a simple production process and keeping the production cost low. Disadvantages of the membrane included low porosity and low pure water flux. So further investigation is still needed to produce a fully satisfactory paper-based ultrafiltration membrane...|$|R
