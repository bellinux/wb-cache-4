25|$|After winning {{his only}} {{race as a}} two-year-old in 2014, Golden Horn showed {{improved}} form in the Spring of the following year to win the Feilden Stakes and then established himself as favourite for the 2015 Epsom Derby with a victory over a strong field in the Dante Stakes. After his owner paid a £75,000 <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee, Golden Horn won the Derby on 6 June, beating his stablemate Jack Hobbs into second place. On his next appearance he defeated the top-rated three-year-old colt of 2014, The Grey Gatsby by {{three and a half}} lengths in the Eclipse Stakes. Golden Horn was subsequently withdrawn from an intended run in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes due to unsuitable going, before losing his unbeaten record when defeated by the filly Arabian Queen in York's Juddmonte International. He went on to win a controversial race for the Irish Champion Stakes in September before ending his European career with a victory in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Golden Horn ended his racing career by finishing runner-up to Found in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May Golden Horn {{was moved}} up in class {{to contest the}} Group Two Dante Stakes at York Racecourse, a major trial for the 2015 Epsom Derby which {{attracted}} a strong field. Ridden by Buick colt started 4/1 third favourite behind Jack Hobbs (also trained by Gosden), and Elm Park with the other contenders including the Aidan O'Brien-trained pair John F Kennedy and Ol' Man River (winner of the Beresford Stakes). Golden Horn was restrained by Buick {{in the early stages}} as the outsider Lord Ben Stack led, before moving into contention three furlongs from the finish. He moved past Elm Park to take the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and three quarter lengths from Jack Hobbs, with Elm Park three and a quarter lengths back in third. Golden Horn had not been entered for the Epsom Derby and Oppenheimer was initially unwilling to pay the £75,000 <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee as he believed that the colt's pedigree meant that he was unlikely to stay the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Prix du Jockey Club was named as a probable target. After discussions with Gosden however, Oppenheimer agreed to supplement the horse and Golden Horn was elevated to the position of ante-post favourite for the Derby.|$|E
2500|$|Carry Back's first {{important}} victory came on his seventeenth {{run of the}} season. In the Cowdin Stakes on October 3, ridden by Bill Hartack, {{he turned}} into the straight in third before producing a strong late run to win going away by {{one and a half}} lengths from Globemaster. He disappointed in the Champagne Stakes after being left at the gate, leading to concerns that he was developing the same problems which ended his mother's career. After being given extra schooling, he was sent to Garden State Park for the $287,000 Garden State Futurity, at that time the most valuable race in America. Price paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of $10,000 to run Carry Back in the race, which he described as [...] "a lot of dough to me." [...] Ridden by John Sellers, Carry Back was fourteenth of the fifteen runners in the early stages but moved into contention on the outside approaching the straight. He took the lead at the sixteenth pole and drew clear to win by three and a half lengths from Ambiopoise. On his final appearance of the season, Carry Back won the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack on November 8, coming from well back in the field to catch Vapor Whirl in the closing stages and win by half a length.|$|E

50|$|Racing as {{a two-year-old}} in 1950, Supreme Court won the Horris Hill Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse at odds of 5/2. The colt was not {{entered in the}} 1951 British Classic Races and with no <b>supplementary</b> <b>entries</b> allowed at the time, {{he was unable to}} contest the Triple Crown. In spring 1951, Supreme Court won the White Lodge Stakes at Hurst Park and then took the Chester Vase, a race which usually serves as an {{important}} trial race for the Epsom Derby. In June, Supreme Court was sent to Royal Ascot for the King Edward VII Stakes. He started the 6/4 favourite and won from Sybil's Nephew, a colt who had finished runner-up in the Derby.|$|R
2500|$|On 4 October 2015 Golden Horn {{was one of}} {{seventeen}} horses to contest the 94th running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. As {{he had not been}} among the original entries for the race, Oppenheimer had to pay a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of €120,000. The draw for starting stalls saw Golden Horn allotted the fourteenth stall, on the wide outside of the field: Dettori commented [...] "I’d have loved a single-figure number but we’ll have to deal with what we’ve got. We will make a plan." [...] Gosden initially said [...] "We are used to a wide draw in the Arc as Taghrooda had one last year and spent most of her time on that bicycle track they have around the outside of the course at Longchamp. We expected a high draw and we got one." [...] He later explained that he was not suggesting any unfairness saying [...] "I was merely having a joke... I'm sorry if other people don't have a sense of humour". Golden Horn started the 9/2 third favourite behind Treve who was attempting to win the race for the third time and New Bay, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club. Found and Free Eagle were again in opposition and the other runners included Flintshire, Erupt (Grand Prix de Paris) and Dolniya (Sheema Classic).|$|E

50|$|Final confirmations for {{the race}} took place on Monday 1 June leaving a {{potential}} field of fifteen runners. Gleneagles, Great Glen and Prince Gagarin were withdrawn by Aidan O'Brien and Golden Horn was supplemented as expected {{at a cost of}} £75,000. Success Days, winner of the Ballysax Stakes and Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial, was also supplemented {{for the race}}. The filly Found and Sumbal had been considered by their connections for <b>supplementary</b> <b>entries</b> but were not entered. Golden Horn was the favourite in the betting market at this point at odds of 7-4, followed by Zawraq at 5-1, Jack Hobbs at 7-1 and Elm Park at 9-1. The other eleven runners were all listed at 10-1 or greater. On the Tuesday before the race Zawraq returned from a gallop with a minor leg injury and his participation in the Derby was put in doubt. Zawraq's odds moved out to 7-1 while Giovanni Canaletto's price moved in to 8-1 after Ryan Moore was announced the horse's jockey for the race.

50|$|Encke {{began his}} racing {{career at the}} 2011 St Leger meeting at Doncaster where he {{finished}} second by half a length to Perennial in a one mile maiden race. On 1 October Encke started 8/13 favourite for a similar race at Newmarket. Ridden by Richard Hughes, he took the lead a furlong from the finish and pulled clear to win easily by {{four and a half}} lengths. The colt's owners then paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee to run Encke in the Racing Post Trophy, but he was forced to miss the race through injury.|$|E
50|$|After {{capturing}} the Grade I Santa Margarita Handicap in 1992, she ran second {{in that race}} {{in each of the}} next three years. In 1992, she was a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> in the Breeders' Cup Distaff at a cost of $200,000. Sent off by bettors as the second choice to Saratoga Dew, Paseana started from the difficult post position #14 at the far outside but won the most important race of her career by four lengths. Her 1992 performances earned her the Eclipse Award for American Champion Older Female Horse.|$|E
50|$|Found {{was entered}} in the Epsom Oaks and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> in the Epsom Derby was also considered, but she missed the Epsom meeting to {{reappear}} in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot She started favourite ahead of a field which included Lucida and the French-trained Ervedya {{the winner of the}} Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. She took the lead approaching the final furlong but was caught in the final strides and was beaten a neck by Ervedya. After three consecutive second places, the filly was given a two-month break before being stepped up in distance for the Royal Whip Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 23 August. Ridden by Heffernan, she took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win easily by four lengths from the four-year-old colt Answered.|$|E
5000|$|Virginia Waters' {{subsequent}} {{form was}} disappointing. Three weeks after her win at Newmarket she started 11/10 favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas but finished unplaced behind Saoire on soft ground. When {{it became clear}} that the ground at Epsom was likely to be firm, the filly's owners paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> of £20,000 to run her in the Oaks. She was made joint-favourite for the race but after moving into third place in the straight she weakened in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Eswarah. Later that month she finished unplaced behind Maids Causeway in the Coronation Stakes at [...] "Royal Ascot" [...] (run that year at York) when Fallon rejected her in favour of Magnier's other runner, Damson. In July she was unplaced in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood behind Alexander Goldrun.|$|E
5000|$|Four weeks later, Darsi {{was sent}} to Ireland and started 5/1 second {{favourite}} for the Irish Derby over {{one and a half}} miles at the Curragh after his owner paid a €100,000 <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee. Before the race, Alain de Royer-Dupre said that the horse had been working well, but expressed some concern about sending him abroad, as Darsi had never previously traveled on a plane. Darsi's chances were not helped hen he unseated Soumillon {{on the way to the}} start. He raced in mid-division before making steady progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished fifth of the thirteen runners behind Dylan Thomas. He sustained a broken sesamoid bone in the race and did not run again. Announcing his retirement in October 2006, the Aga Khan's racing manager Georges Rimaud described him as [...] "a brave and courageous horse who had both speed and stamina".|$|E
50|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1997 season Revoque was a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> for the Epsom Derby (he had not {{originally}} been entered the race) but he was first aimed at the 2000 Guineas. He made his debut in a recognised Guineas trial race, the Greenham Stakes at Newbury. He started favourite, but in a closely contested finish he was beaten a head by Yalaietanee, losing his unbeaten record. Despite his defeat, his connections were happy with his performance, and Revoque was sent off 100/30 favourite in the 2000 Guineas three weeks later. He broke slowly and was towards the back of the field in the early running. As the race entered the closing stages, Revoque was trapped behind horses and Reid had to switch him to the outside to find a clear run. He then made rapid progress in the last two furlongs of the race to finish second, beaten three quarters of a length by Entrepreneur Some observers considered him a rather unlucky loser.|$|E
50|$|After winning {{his only}} {{race as a}} two-year-old in 2014, Golden Horn showed {{improved}} form in the Spring of the following year to win the Feilden Stakes and then established himself as favourite for the 2015 Epsom Derby with a victory over a strong field in the Dante Stakes. After his owner paid a £75,000 <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee, Golden Horn won the Derby on 6 June, beating his stablemate Jack Hobbs into second place. On his next appearance he defeated the top-rated three-year-old colt of 2014, The Grey Gatsby by {{three and a half}} lengths in the Eclipse Stakes. Golden Horn was subsequently withdrawn from an intended run in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes due to unsuitable going, before losing his unbeaten record when defeated by the filly Arabian Queen in York's Juddmonte International.

Golden Horn ended his racing career by finishing runner-up to Found in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland.|$|E
5000|$|Thirteen {{days after}} his win at Longchamp, Bachir {{was sent to the}} Curragh for the Irish 2000 Guineas over one mile. He had not been among the {{original}} entries for the race, meaning that his owner had to pay a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of IR£25,000. The top two places in the betting were taken by Giant's Causeway and Barathea Guest who had finished second and third to King's Best in the 2000 Guineas on 6 May. Bachir, ridden by Dettori, was made the 4/1 third choice with the other five runners starting at odds of 16/1 or more. Bachir led from the start and stayed on well under strong pressure to hold off the challenge of Giant's Causeway and win by a neck with Cape Town close behind in third. After the race Dettori said [...] "I had no particular plan but having ridden earlier and realised the ground was perfect and there was no obvious pace in the race, I decided to have my mount prominent from the start. I nicked a length on the favourite two furlongs out and this was a help as he just ran out of ground".|$|E
50|$|Following another lengthy absence, Annie Power {{returned}} to the track in a minor event at Punchestown on 17 February 2016. She was made the 1/20 favourite against two opponents and led from the start to win by {{six and a half}} lengths from Legacy Gold. The mare had been originally entered in the World Hurdle and the OLBG Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival but after the injury to her stablemates Faugheen and Arctic Fire she was redirected to contest the Champion Hurdle after her owners paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of £20,000. On 11 March started the 5/2 favourite for the Champion Hurdle ahead of eleven opponents headed by The New One, Nichols Canyon, Identity Thief and My Tent or Yours. Ridden by Ruby Walsh, she took the lead from the start and was never headed. She drew away from the field approaching the second last and stayed on strongly on the run-in to win by four and a half lengths and a head from My Tent or Yours and Nichols Canyon with Walsh punching the air in celebration at the finish. She was the fourth mare to win the race after African Sister (1939), Dawn Run (1984) and Flakey Dove (1994).|$|E
50|$|After a {{break of}} more than three months, Saonois {{returned}} to the racecourse for the Prix Niel (a trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) at Longchamp on 16 September. He started the joint-third-favourite in the betting alongside Kesampour, behind Last Train (narrowly beaten by Imperial Monarch in the Grand Prix de Paris) and the Secretariat Stakes winner Bayrir. The colt was restrained by Hamelin {{in the early stages}} and was still last of the six runners 400 metres from the finish. He struggled to obtain a clear run until the last 100 metres when he accelerated between horses to take the lead and won by one and a quarter lengths and a short head from Bayrir and Last Train. In October, Saonois started at odds of 9/1 for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe after his owner paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of €100,000. Racing on heavy ground, he never looked likely to win and finished fifteenth of the eighteen runners behind Solemia. On his final appearance of the season, Saonois was sent to Hong Kong to contest the Hong Kong Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse but made no impression, finishing tenth of the eleven runners behind California Memory.|$|E
50|$|On 30 August, Madam Gay {{represented}} Britain in {{the inaugural}} {{running of the}} Arlington Million, then the world's most valuable horse race, after her owners paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of $35,000. She was partnered by Piggott who was unable to ride at less than 117 pounds, meaning that Madam Gay had to carry four pounds more than weight-for-age. She was settled behind the leaders along the rail before moving up into third place approaching the final turn. The filly could make no further progress, but stayed on to finish third of the fourteen runners beaten a nose and two lengths by John Henry and The Bart. During her stay in the United States it was made known that the filly was available for sale at a price of $2,000,000, {{but there were no}} takers. She then returned to Europe for the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp Racecourse on 13 September. She was made the 7/4 favourite, but after being given a great deal of ground to make up in the straight she finished third to April Run and Leandra. Madam Gay was then bought for an undisclosed sum (later reported as $1.4 million) to Daniel Wildenstein in a private deal. On her final racecourse appearance, Madam Gay produced one of her few poor efforts as she finished tenth behind Vayrann in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 17 October.|$|E

50|$|The race {{attracted}} {{a field of}} seven runners, four from England, two from Ireland and one from France. In the build-up to the race it seemed certain that the 2015 winner Postponed would start a strong favourite but the horse was withdrawn {{three days before the}} contest when he was found to be suffering from a respiratory infection. At the <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> stage two days earlier, Queen Elizabeth II had entered her four-year-old Dartmouth at a cost of £75,000 but the owners of the Eclipse Stakes winner Hawkbill opted to bypass the race. Dartmouth was regarded as a strong contender, having won the John Porter Stakes, Ormonde Stakes and Hardwicke Stakes. The Irish Coolmore Stud organisation was represented by two runners from the Aidan O'Brien stable: Highland Reel was a proven international campaigner, having won the Secretariat Stakes and the Hong Kong Vase, whilst Sir Isaac Newton had won the International Stakes at the Curragh on his last start. France's representative Erupt had won the Grand Prix de Paris in 2015 and finished second in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud on his most recent appearance. The only three-year-old in the race was Wings of Desire who had won the Dante Stakes before finishing fourth in the 2016 Epsom Derby. The other two runners were Western Hymn (Sandown Classic Trial, Prix Eugene Adam, Gordon Richards Stakes, Brigadier Gerard Stakes) and the gelding Second Step (Jockey Club Stakes, Grosser Preis von Berlin).|$|E
5000|$|Four weeks later, Holding Court was matched {{against the}} Epsom Derby winner Sinndar in the Irish Derby after his owners paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of IR£85,000. Before the race Robinson {{said that he}} would be [...] "supremely confident" [...] of beating the Derby winner on soft ground but only [...] "hopeful" [...] on good going. In the event, the race was run on a surface {{described}} as [...] "yielding" [...] - [...] between good and soft. He started 9/4 second favourite behind his principal opponent, with the 2000 Guineas winner King's Best being the only other horse in the eleven runner field to start at odds of less than 16/1. He tracked the leaders and reached third place in the straight but made no further progress and eventually finished sixth, more than twelve lengths behind Sinndar. Two months later Holding Court was sent to Germany and matched against older horses {{for the first time in}} the Grosser Preis von Baden. He took the lead after 400 metres but faded in the straight and finished fifth behind the Deutsches Derby winner Samum. On his final start of the season, Holding Court was dropped in class for the Group Two Prix du Conseil de Paris at Longchamp in October. He began to struggle before half way and finished tailed-off last of the five runners behind Crimson Quest. Jarvis was reportedly [...] "mystified" [...] by the performance and requested a dope test.|$|E
5000|$|The Irish Derby, {{run at the}} Curragh on 27 June, was {{the second}} most {{valuable}} race run in Europe in 1987, behind the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, and ahead of the Epsom Derby. The prize money was boosted by sponsorship from Budweiser, an increase in initial entry fees and a new <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> stage in December 1986. Despite the prize on offer the race attracted only eight runners and the field was not considered a strong one. Sir Harry Lewis started 6/1 fourth favourite behind the French colt Sadjiyd who had won the Prix Noailles and the Prix Hocquart before running poorly at Epsom. Most Welcome was second choice in the betting ahead of Entitled who had {{finished second in the}} Irish 2000 Guineas and fifth in the Derby, whilst Naheez (runner up in the Prix du Jockey Club) started at 10/1. The start of the race was delayed by fifty minutes after a hoax bomb warning led to the partial evacuation of the grandstand. Partnered again by Reid, Sir Harry Lewis took the lead {{a quarter of a mile}} from the finish and held off a persistent challenge from Naheez to win by three quarters of a length, with a gap of four lengths back to Entitled in third place. Commenting on the pre-race drama, Reid said [...] "He relaxed just fine. He was not worried by the long wait".|$|E
5000|$|Keltos {{was then}} sent to England for the Group One Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury Racecourse on 18 May {{in which he was}} again ridden by Peslier. As he had not been among the {{original}} entries his owners had to pay a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of £12,000. Noverre started favourite ahead of Olden Times (Prix Jean Prat) with Keltos the 9/1 joint third favourite alongside No Excuse Needed (Celebration Mile) and Swallow Flight (Sandown Mile). The other five runners were Summoner (Queen Elizabeth II Stakes), Warningford (Leicestershire Stakes), Cape Town (European Free Handicap), Atavus (Hungerford Stakes) and Umitstim (Craven Stakes). Peslier settled the colt towards the rear of the field as Summoner set the pace before Noverre went to the front {{a quarter of a mile}} from the finish. After being hampered as he attempted to obtain a clear run, Keltos moved up alongside Noverre a furlong out and then drew away to win [...] "comfortably" [...] by three and a half lengths. After the race Peslier said [...] "I thought I would come late. I moved inside and he was blocked a little bit. But my horse travelled very well and I just waited a little bit because my horse has got a good turn of foot". The colt's owner Gary Tanaka mentioned the Queen Anne Stakes, Sussex Stakes and Breeders' Cup Mile as future targets before commenting [...] "It is much more fun winning in Europe than the States,".|$|E
5000|$|Sixteen {{days after}} his win at Tipperary, Casamento was moved up sharply in class for the Group One National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh with Declan McDonogh taking over the ride. After taking an early lead he was {{overtaken}} by Pathfork two furlongs out but rallied strongly and was gaining on the leader in the closing stages before finishing second by a head. The Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Zoffany was five lengths back in third place. Pat Smullen took over from McDonogh when the colt started 4/6 favourite for the Group Two Beresford Stakes over one mile at the Curragh on 26 September. His connections paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of €10,000 as {{he had not been}} among the original entries for the race. The best-fancied of his six opponents were Mawaakef and Factum who had finished first and second in a maiden race at Killarney. After racing in second behind Robin Hood, Casamento took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish, quickly went clear of the field and won by four lengths from Mawaakef. After the race Halford said [...] "he's still a big baby, but he's an exciting horse to have", whilst Smullen commented [...] "he was very aggressive from the gate but I managed to get him some cover and he settled, which will serve him well for the future... he has the makings of a good one".|$|E
5000|$|Nathaniel {{did not run}} in the Epsom Derby as Gosden {{felt that}} the ground at Epsom would be too fast for the colt. He {{appeared}} instead at Royal Ascot where he won the King Edward VII Stakes [...] "comfortably" [...] by five lengths. Immediately after the race, Gosden indicated that the colt would be aimed at the St Leger Stakes. A month later however, Nathaniel returned to Ascot to contest the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over the same distance, after his owners paid a <b>supplementary</b> <b>entry</b> fee of £75,000. He was the only three-year-old in a field which included St Nicholas Abbey, Workforce and Rewilding. Ridden by William Buick, Nathaniel pulled hard {{in the early stages}} and was forced to lead before settling behind the pacemaker Debussy. In the straight, Nathaniel accelerated into the lead down the centre of the track and won by two and three quarter lengths from Workforce who had hung badly across to the stands side. St Nicholas Abbey finished third, while Rewilding was fatally injured when falling two furlongs from the finish. Nathaniel was the first three-year-old to win the race for eight years. His trainer John Gosden helped tend to the injured Rewilding, giving the colt a [...] "final munch of grass" [...] before he was euthanised. Gosden said that Nathaniel was still improving and indicated that his next target would probably be the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.|$|E
