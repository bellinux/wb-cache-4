60|$|Reginald {{stood by}} with a sly smile, as he pulled a branch off a {{neighbouring}} filbert-tree. The next moment Maurice gave a sudden yell, 'The wasps! the wasps!' and jumping up, and tripping at his first <b>step,</b> <b>rolled</b> down the bank, and landed safely at Lord Rotherwood's feet. The shouts of laughter were loud, but he regarded them not, {{and as soon as}} he recovered his feet, rushed past his sisters, and never stopped till he reached the house. Redgie stood alone, in the midst of a cloud of wasps, beating them off with a bough, roaring with laughter, and calling Wat to bring the straw to burn them.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll brain {{the first}} man who touches mine," [...] {{threatened}} Thurston, turning savagely upon those who approached him with remonstrances, {{and there was a}} simultaneous murmur from all the assembly when the two adventurous men dropped upon the timber. The logs rolled, groaned, and heaved beneath them and Thurston, trusting to the creeper spikes upon his heels, sprang from one great tree trunk to another behind his companion, who had a longer experience of the perilous work of log-driving. Here a gap, filled with spouting foam, opened up before him; there a trunk upon which he was about to <b>step</b> <b>rolled</b> over and sank. But he worked his way forward towards the center of the fir which keyed the growing mass. This log was many feet in girth. Pressed down level with the water, it was already bending like a slackly-strung bow.|$|R

25|$|Marching: {{instead of}} a {{traditional}} high step, drum corps tend to march with a fluid glide step, {{also known as a}} <b>roll</b> <b>step,</b> to keep musicians' torsos completely still.|$|R
2500|$|The glide step, also {{commonly}} known as the <b>roll</b> <b>step,</b> involves bringing the heel gently to the ground with the toe pointed up, and then rolling forward onto the toes before lifting the foot to continue forward. [...] While marching to the rear, the weight is placed continually on the ball of the foot with the heel elevated. This style is used by both marching bands as well as drum and bugle corps. [...] The style, in comparison to high step, gives drill formations a more fluid appearance, allowing for better control of more difficult formations and various styles of music. With this control also comes the ability to perform a much broader range of tempos. Proper execution of a <b>roll</b> <b>step</b> gives a player marching at 40 beats per minute the same smooth tone as a player marching at 180. The <b>roll</b> <b>step</b> allows for much better control of the upper body, and thus better control of the air support needed for playing.|$|R

40|$|DNA bending {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many biological processes, but its molecular and energetic details as a function of base sequence remain to be fully understood. Using a recently developed restraint, we have studied the controlled bending of four different B-DNA oligomers using molecular dynamics simulations. Umbrella sampling with the AMBER program and the recent parmbsc 0 force field yield free energy curves for bending. Bending 15 -base pair oligomers by 90 ° requires roughly 5 [*]kcal[*]mol− 1, while reaching 150 ° requires of the order of 12 [*]kcal[*]mol− 1. Moderate bending occurs mainly through coupled base pair <b>step</b> <b>rolls.</b> Strong bending generally leads to local kinks. The kinks we observe all involve two consecutive base pair steps, with disruption of the central base pair (termed Type II kinks in earlier work). A detailed analysis of each oligomer shows that the free energy of bending only varies quadratically with the bending angle for moderate bending. Beyond this point, in agreement with recent experiments, the variation becomes linear. An harmonic analysis of each base step yields force constants that not only vary with sequence, but also with the degree of bending. Both these observations suggest that DNA is mechanically more complex than simple elastic rod models would imply...|$|R
25|$|When a band is not moving, {{the members}} may mark time, or march in place. The step used usually resembles the step {{that is used}} for marching forward, though mixing a high step mark time with a <b>roll</b> <b>step</b> march (or vice versa) {{produces}} an interesting visual effect.|$|R
40|$|Superstructure-formation of DNA {{plays an}} {{important}} role in transcription regulation as well as in chromatin formation. To understand the stereochemical basis of DNA bending by proteins we analysed the structural characteristics of dinucleotide steps which occur at the site where DNA is bent upon binding a transcription factor. When DNA is considerably bent in a crystal structure the bending is not spread smoothly over a length, but the DNA is kinked at a pair of crucial steps which are highly rolled and untwisted. These <b>rolled</b> <b>steps</b> are spaced 6 - 10 bp apart and are predominantly occupied by pyrimidine-purine sequences. In association with another dinucleotide step at the centre, which combines 6 bp-spaced <b>rolled</b> <b>steps</b> towards the same side of the DNA, these produce two essentially different types of DNA bending...|$|R

25|$|Some bands, and {{a select}} few drum and bugle corps, use a bent-knee variant of <b>roll</b> <b>step,</b> usually known simply as bent knee, in which the members roll from heel to toe but lead the next step with the knee instead of the foot, then {{planting}} the heel of the next foot by straightening the leg.|$|R

6000|$|... [p.116]-"Sunday best," [...] {{listening}} to singers and musicians, smoking, chatting, {{and looking at}} jugglers, buffoons, snake-charmers, Darwayshes, ape-leaders, and dancing boys habited in women's attire. Eating-stalls and lollipop-shops, booths full of playthings, and sheds for lemonade and syrups, lined the roads, and disputed with swings and merry-go-rounds the regards of the little Moslems and Moslemahs. The chief item of the crowd, fair Cairenes, carried in their hands huge palm branches, intending to ornament therewith the tombs of parents and friends. Yet, even on this solemn occasion, there is, they say, not a little flirtation and love-making; parties of policemen are posted, with orders to interrupt all such irregularities, with a long cane; but their vigilance is notoriously unequal to the task. I could not help observing that frequent pairs, doubtless cousins or other relations, wandered to unusual distances among the sand-hills, and that sometimes the confusion of a distant bastinado struck the ear. These trifles did not, however, by any means interfere with the general joy. Every one wore something new; most people were in the fresh suits of finery intended to last through the year; and so strong is personal vanity in the breasts of Orientals, men and women, young and old, that from Cairo to Calcutta {{it would be difficult}} to find a sad heart under a handsome coat. The men swaggered, the women minced their <b>steps,</b> <b>rolled</b> their eyes, and were eternally arranging, and coquetting with their head-veils. The little boys strutting about foully abused any one of their number who might have a richer suit than his neighbours. And the little girls ogled every one in the ecstacy of conceit, and glanced contemptuously at other little girls their rivals.|$|R
50|$|Missile 9B, {{the first}} Atlas with {{upgraded}} turbopumps, was launched on November 18. Roll control was extremely poor {{for the first}} 44 seconds of launch, resulting in excessive movements of the booster engines and verniers to maintain missile stability. Excessive fuel consumption led to premature sustainer shutdown and so the missile did not achieve its planned range of 3150 miles, instead managing only 2300 miles. BECO occurred at T+131 seconds and SECO at T+227 seconds, while nose cone separation was not accomplished. The malfunction {{was due to the}} turbopumps, which were also C-series models, not being properly matched to the engines in the Atlas. Due to the need to test them out, there had not been any time to perform this <b>step.</b> The <b>roll</b> control problem resulted in yet more autopilot modifications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} enhance the {{mechanical}} properties of magnesium alloy (AZ 31) sheet, an integrated sheet-making process including billet casting, extrusion and rolling was attempted. Microstructural analysis was carried out and the mechanical properties at each processing step were also investigated by tensile tests. By an extrusion process of ingot-processed billet, average grain size of billet was reduced from 91. 2 to 28. 2, and a further reduction in grain size to 16. 9 was obtained by subsequent rolling of extruded 5 mm thin slab. In the final <b>step,</b> a <b>rolled</b> sheet of 1 mm showed a remarkable refinement in grain size down to 8. 8. Regarding mechanical properties, tensile strength and elongation for as-cast billet, as-extruded thin slab and as-rolled sheet increased from 189, 258 to 234 MPa, and from 13, 16. 5 to 23 %, respectively...|$|R
