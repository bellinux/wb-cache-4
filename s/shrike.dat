5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked <b>shrike</b> has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat <b>shrike</b> has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked <b>shrike</b> has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat <b>shrike</b> has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} {{electronic}} countermeasures (ECM) equipment to protect themselves. They directed flak suppression strikes and carried AGM-45 <b>Shrike</b> anti-radiation missiles (another Navy development), which homed {{in on the}} radar systems of the SAMs. The SA-2 had greater range than the <b>Shrike,</b> but if the <b>Shrike</b> was launched and the radar operator stayed on the air, the American missile would home in on the signal and destroy the radar source. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} masked <b>shrike</b> to be between 105,000–300,000 individuals, suggesting a global total of 142,000–600,000 birds. Although the population appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and extensive breeding range of about , mean that this <b>shrike</b> is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The masked <b>shrike</b> feeds {{mainly on}} large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked <b>shrike</b> has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E
5|$|The masked <b>shrike</b> {{gives the}} harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a <b>shrike,</b> with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E

5|$|Many {{other species}} and {{subspecies}} {{have been removed}} over the years: Cetti's warbler (in 1976); long-tailed skua (in 1979); common crane and ring-billed gull (in 1987); surf scoter, little egret, European bee-eater, Pallas's warbler and woodchat <b>shrike</b> (in 1990); green-winged teal (in 1992); ring-necked duck, greater short-toed lark and little bunting (in 1993); white-tailed eagle and Kumlien's gull (in 1998); American wigeon, black-crowned night heron and rose-coloured starling (in 2001); and black brant (in 2005).|$|E
5|$|The great grey <b>shrike</b> is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead <b>shrike.</b> The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and <b>Shrike</b> anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind. The common species may {{be accompanied by a}} wryneck, red-backed <b>shrike</b> or greenish warbler in August, with goldcrests, thrushes and finches later in the season, and perhaps red-breasted flycatchers and yellow-browed warblers. Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|E
40|$|Red-backed <b>shrikes</b> (Lanius collurio) behave quite {{differently}} towards two common nest predators. While the European jay (Garrulus glandarius) is commonly attacked, {{in the presence}} of the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica), <b>shrikes</b> stay fully passive. We tested the hypotheses that this passive response to the magpie is an alternative defense strategy. Nesting <b>shrikes</b> were exposed to the commonly attacked European kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in a situation in which i) a harmless domestic pigeon, ii) a commonly attacked European jay, and iii) a non-attacked black-billed magpie are (separately) presented nearby. The kestrel dummy presented together with the magpie dummy was attacked with a significantly lower intensity than when it was presented with the other intruders (pigeon, jay) or alone. This means that the presence of the magpie inhibited the <b>shrike's</b> defense response towards the other intruder. These results support our previous hypotheses that <b>shrikes</b> use an alternative defense strategy in the magpie's presence. We hypothesize that the magpie is able to associate the active defense of the <b>shrikes</b> with the close proximity of a nest and that <b>shrikes</b> try not to draw the magpie's attention to the nest. The reason why this strategy is not used against the jay remains unanswered as jays as well as magpies show very similar cognitive and foraging skills enabling them to individuate the nest presence according to active parental defense...|$|R
5|$|Bushshrikes {{are similar}} in habits to <b>shrikes,</b> hunting insects and other small prey from a perch on a bush. Although similar in build to the <b>shrikes,</b> these tend to be either {{colourful}} species or largely black; some species are quite secretive.|$|R
5|$|<b>Shrikes</b> are {{passerine}} birds {{known for}} their habit of catching other birds and small animals and impaling the uneaten portions of their bodies on thorns. A <b>shrike's</b> beak is hooked, {{like that of a}} typical bird of prey. Two species have been recorded in Maryland.|$|R
5|$|The masked <b>shrike</b> breeds in the Balkans, {{northeast}} Greece {{and some}} of the Greek islands, Turkey, Cyprus and from Syria south to Israel. It also nests in eastern Iraq and western Iran. The range in the east is uncertain, and may include Afghanistan and northern Saudi Arabia. It is migratory, wintering south of the Sahara, mainly in Chad, Sudan and Ethiopia. Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria, and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia. Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September, and return north in February and March.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} EF-105F Wild Weasel III (the EF designation was popularly used but unofficial) supplemented its {{sensors and}} electronic jamming equipment with AGM-45 <b>Shrike</b> anti-radiation missiles and conventional bombs, giving it an offensive capability {{lacking in the}} F-100F. The first of these aircraft flew on 15 January 1966 and they began arriving in Southeast Asia in May, flying their first mission on 6 June 1966, with five assigned to the 13th TFS at Korat RTAFB and six more to the 354th TFS at Takhli RTAFB.|$|E
5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} <b>shrike</b> stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E

5|$|Numbers have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in Europe, although Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs. Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90,000 pairs. The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel {{is thought to be}} due to pesticides. In Somalia this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, where this species is considered to be unlucky. There are indications that this <b>shrike</b> is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands, which could help populations in the longer term.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the anti-radiation missile such as AGM-45 <b>Shrike</b> and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with intermittent use of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value Wild Weasel fighters. In 1982 Operation Mole Cricket 19 various means including UAVs and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.|$|E
5|$|The masked shrike's {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup {{built in a}} tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked <b>shrike</b> eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing {{in parts of the}} European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
40|$|A major {{thrust of}} organismal biology {{involves}} understanding how an organism’s phenotype relates to its environment, via its performance capabilities. I investigated this linkage in Loggerhead <b>Shrikes</b> − small North American predatory songbirds that feed on arthropods and vertebrates, whose physical and behavioral attributes differ substantially. My dissertation {{is composed of}} three components, aimed at uncovering how <b>shrikes</b> accommodate the disparate demands of their prey. I examined geographic variation in bill morphology of museum specimens to investigate the relationship between environmental factors and upper bill form, particularly of the hooked tip and tomial teeth, which are thought to {{play a key role}} for processing vertebrate prey. My geometric morphometric analysis revealed significant intra- and interspecific variation, mostly along an axis of increasing hook curvature and length. Whereas as dietary differences mostly explained bill shape variation among species, variance in temperature and longitude explained variation within Loggerhead <b>Shrikes.</b> My field component was aimed at understanding the functional and ecological consequences of morphological variation. I captured <b>shrikes</b> throughout California to measure bill morphology and bite performance. I collected feather and prey samples for stable isotopes analysis, to infer dietary variation. Increased bill and hook lengths and curvatures were associated with lower bite forces, whereas bill shape was unrelated to bite pressure (force/area). Thus, <b>shrikes</b> with different bill shapes may achieve functional equivalence by modulating bite force. Bite force, rather than bill shape, was associated with isotopic variation, and with greater consumption of vertebrates. This suggested the importance of bite performance for handling less tractable prey, and possibly for responding to spatiotemporal variation in resources. Finally, I studied how prey-processing varied with prey type and ontogeny in captive <b>shrikes.</b> I performed high-speed video kinematics of adult and juvenile <b>shrikes</b> attacking crickets and mice. My results suggested that the head-shaking behavior that <b>shrikes</b> use when handling vertebrates may enhance killing efficiency. Although there were few differences between age classes in procuring crickets, juveniles had greater difficulty handling mice, consistent with their reduced bill hook and tomial tooth lengths. Collectively, these results demonstrate how functional performance mediates the relationship between morphology and feeding ecology in <b>shrikes...</b>|$|R
