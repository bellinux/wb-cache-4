Although more than 100 {{years have passed}} since chromosomes were first observed, it remains unclear how a long string of genomic DNA is packaged into compact mitotic chromosomes. Although the classical view is that human chromosomes consist of radial 30 nm chromatin loops that are somehow tethered centrally by scaffold proteins, called condensins, cryo-electron microscopy observation of frozen hydrated native chromosomes reveals a homogeneous, grainy texture and neither higher-order nor periodic structures including 30 nm chromatin fibres were observed. As a compromise to fill this huge gap, we propose a model in which the radial chromatin loop structures in the classic view are folded irregularly toward the chromosome centre with the increase in intracellular cations during mitosis. Consequently, compact native chromosomes are made up primarily of irregular chromatin networks cross-linked by self-assembled condensins forming the chromosome <b>scaffol...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{coarse-grained}} {{computational model}} {{is used to}} investigate how the bending rigidity of a polymer under tension affects {{the formation of a}} trefoil knot. Thermodynamic integration techniques are applied to demonstrate that the free-energy cost of forming a knot has a minimum at nonzero bending rigidity. The position of the minimum exhibits a power-law dependence on the applied tension. For knotted polymers with nonuniform bending rigidity, the knots preferentially localize in the region with a bending rigidity that minimizes the free energy. Type II topoisomerases are enzymes that may knot orunknot DNA by introducing a transient break in both strands of one DNA duplex and passing a second duplex through it. One of their key biological functions is to regulate the level of knotting in the genome. 1 Type II topoisomerases tend to act preferentially on certain sequences in DNA. 2 There is evidence that sites that are more frequently cleaved tend to be located in or next to parts of the genome called <b>scaffol...</b>|$|R

Inverse opal scaffolds based on poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) were formed with uniform 200 µm pores. Due to uniform pore sizes and well-con-trolled interconnectivity of inverse opal scaffold, hADSCs were allowed to distribute homogeneously throughout the scaffolds. As a result, high cell density culture with scaffold was possible. Since the hADSCs cultured in inverse opal scaffolds were subjected to limited supplies of oxygen and nutrients, these cells were naturally preconditioned to a hypoxic environment that stimulated the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α). As a result, apoptotic activity of hADSCs until 3 weeks after initial cell seeding was significantly reduced and chondrogenic differentiation related molecular signal cascades were up regulated (transforming growth factor-beta, phosphorylated AKT, and phos-phorylated p 38 expression). In contrast, hADSCs cultured with small and non-uniform porous scaffolds showed signif-icantly increased apoptotic activity with decreased chondrogenic differentiation.

Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) showed that relatively uniform nanofibers could be obtained when 12 % SF was blended with 6 % HBC at the weight ratio of 50 : 50. Meanwhile, the average nanofibrous diameter increased when the content of HBC in SF/HBC blends was raised from 20 % to 100 %. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed SF and HBC molecules existed in hydrogen bonding interactions but HBC did not induce conformation of SF transforming from random coil form to β-sheet structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the different structure of SF/HBC blended nanofibers from both SF and HBC.

Porous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold prepared by fused de-position modeling is an attractive biomaterial {{that has been used}} in clinic. However, PCL scaffolds lack biological function and osteoinductivity. In this study, we functionalized the PCL scaffolds by embedding them with a ma-trix of hyaluronic acid/b-tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP). Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured on scaffolds with and without coating to investigate proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. The DNA amount was significantly higher in the HA/TCP-coated scaffold on day 21. At the gene expression level, HA/ TCP coating significantly increased the expression of ALP and COLI on day 4. These data correlated with the ALP activity peaking on day 7 in the HA/TCP-coated scaffold. Scanning electron microscope and histological analysis revealed that the cell matrix and calcium deposition were distributed more uniformly in the coated scaf-folds compared to scaffolds without coating. In conclusion, the HA/TCP coating improved cellular proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and uniform distribution of the cellular matrix in vitro. The HA/TCP-PCL scaffold holds great promise to accommodate human bone marrow-derived MSCs for bone reconstruction purposes, which warrants future in vivo studies.

40|$|Abstract—Tissue-engineered {{heart valves}} have been {{proposed}} by physicians and scientists alike {{to be the ultimate}} solution for treating valvular heart disease. Rather than replacing a diseased or defective native valve with a mechanical or animal tissue–derived artificial valve, a tissue-engineered valve would be a living organ, able to respond to growth and physiological forces {{in the same way that}} the native aortic valve does. Two main approaches have been attempted over the past 10 to 15 years: regeneration and repopulation. Regeneration involves the implantation of a resorbable matrix that is expected to remodel in vivo and yield a functional valve composed of the cells and connective tissue proteins of the patient. Repopulation involves implanting a whole porcine aortic valve that has been previously cleaned of all pig cells, leaving an intact, mechanically sound connective tissue matrix. The cells of the patients are expected to repopulate and revitalize the acellular matrix, creating living tissue that already has the complex microstructure necessary for proper function and durability. Regrettably, neither of the 2 approaches has fared well in animal experiments, and the only clinical experience with tissue-engineered valves resulted in a number of early failures and patient death. This article reviews the technological details of the 2 main approaches, their rationale, their strengths and weaknesses, and the likely mechanisms for their failure. Alternative approaches to valvular tissue engineering, as well as the role of industry in shaping this field in the future, are also reviewed. (Circ Res. 2005; 97 : 743 - 755.)

The current treatment involves removal of the bony bar and replacing it with a filler substance, such as a free fat graft. Unfortunately, reformation of the bony bar frequently occurs, preventing the native growth plate from regenerating. The goal of this pilot study was to determine whether biodegradable scaffolds can enhance native growth plate regeneration following a simulated injury that resulted in bony bar formation in the proximal tibial growth plate of New Zealand white rabbits. After removing the bony bar, animals received one of the fol-lowing treatments: porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold; PLGA scaffold loaded with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I); PLGA scaffold loaded with IGF-I and seeded with autogenous bone marrow cells (BMCs) harvested at the time of implantation; or fat graft (as used clinically). The PLGA scaffold group showed an increased chondrocyte population and a reduced loss of the remaining native growth plate compared to the fat graft group (the control group). An additional increase in chondrocyte density was seen in scaffolds loaded with IGF-I, and even more so when BMCs were seeded on the scaffold. While there was no significant reduction in the angular deformation of the limbs, the PLGA scaffolds increased the amount of cartilage and reduced the amount of bony bar reformation.

To comprehensively assess Sam 68 -SH 3 -interactions, we applied a phage-display screening of a library containing all approx. 300 human SH 3 domains.

Interaction of the high-affinity Sam 68 -binders was confirmed in independent assays in vitro (phage-ELISA, GST-pull-down) and in vivo (FACS-based FRET-analysis with CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins).

Therefore, we explored the local delivery of a reduced dosage of FOLFIRINOX, a four-drug regimen comprising oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil, for pancreatic cancer using a biocompatible drug-eluting scaffold as a novel chemotherapy strategy after palliative surgery. In vitro assays showed that FOLFIRINOX in the scaffold caused massive apoptosis and thereby {{a decrease in the}} viability of pancreatic cancer cells, confirming the chemotherapeutic capability of the drug-eluting scaffold.

Partially converted shell samples have mechanical strength, which is close to that of compact human bone. After implantation of converted shell and spine samples in rat femoral defects for 6 weeks, there was newly formed bone growth up to and around the implants. Some new bone was found to migrate through the pores of converted spine samples and grow inward.

Calcium phosphate powders were prepared through different synthesis methods. Micro- size HAP rods were synthesized by hydrothermal method through a nucleation-growth mechanism. On the other hand, HAP particles, which have good crystallinity, were prepared by wet precipitation with further hydrothermal treatment.

Silk-based materials have recently become an important biomaterial for tissue engineering applications due to silk’s biocompatibility and impressive mechanical and degradative properties. In the present study, a silk fibroin peptide (SF 16) was designed and used {{as a component of}} the hydrogel scaffold for the repair of peripheral nerve injury. Methods: The SF 16 peptide’s structure was characterized using spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy, and the SF 16 hydrogel was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The effects of the SF 16 hydrogel on the viability and growth of live cells was first assessed in vitro, on PC 12 cells. The in vivo test model involved the repair of a nerve gap with tubular nerve guides, through which it was possible to identify if the SF 16 hydrogel would have the potential to enhance nerve regeneration. In this model physiological saline was set as the negative control, and collagen as the positive control. Walking track analysis and electrophysiological methods were used to evaluate the functional recovery of the nerve at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Results: Analysis of the SF 16 peptide’s characteristics indicated that it consisted of a well-defined secondary structure and exhibited self-assembly. Results of scanning electron microscopy showed that the peptide based hydrogel may represent a porous scaffold that is viable for repair of peripheral nerve injury. Analysis of cell culture also supported that the hydrogel was an effective matrix to maintain the viability, morphology and proliferation of PC 12 cells. Electrophysiology demonstrated that the use of the hydrogel scaffold (SF 16 or collagen) resulted in a significant improvement in amplitude recovery in the in vivo model compared to physiological saline. Moreover, nerve cells in the SF 16 hydrogel group displayed greater axon density, larger average axon diameter and thicker myelin compared to those of the group that received physiological saline. Conclusion: The SF 16 hydrogel scaffold may promote excellent axonal regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury, and the SF 16 peptide may be a candidate for nerve tissue engineering applications.

40|$|Advances in {{stem cell}} biology have {{challenged}} {{the notion that}} infarcted myocardium is irreparable. The pluripotent ability of stem cells to differentiate into specialized cell lines began to garner intense interest within cardiology when it was shown in animal models that intramyocardial injection of bone marrow stem cells (MSCs), or the mobilization of bone marrow stem cells with spontaneous homing to myocardium, could improve cardiac function and survival after induced myocardial infarction (MI) [1, 2]. Furthermore, the existence of stem cells in myocardium has been identified in animal heart [3, 4], and intense research {{is under way in}} an attempt to clarify their potential clinical application for patients with myocardial infarction. To date, in order to identify the best one, different kinds of stem cells have been studied; these have been derived from embryo or adult tissues (i. e. bone marrow, heart, peripheral blood etc.). Currently, three different biologic therapies for cardiovascular diseases are under investigation: cell therapy, gene therapy and the more recent “tissue-engineering” therapy. During my Ph. D. course, first I focalised my study on the isolation and characterization of Cardiac Stem Cells (CSCs) in wild-type and transgenic mice and for this purpose I attended, for more than one year, the Cardiovascular Research Institute of the New York Medical College, in Valhalla (NY, USA) under the direction of Doctor Piero Anversa. During this period I learnt different Immunohistochemical and Biomolecular techniques, useful for investigating the regenerative potential of stem cells. Then, during the next two years, I studied the new approach of cardiac regenerative medicine based on “tissue-engineering” in order to investigate a new strategy to regenerate the infracted myocardium. Tissue-engineering is a promising approach that makes possible the creation of new functional tissue to replace lost or failing tissue. This new discipline combines isolated functioning cells and biodegradable 3 -dimensional (3 D) polymeric scaffolds. The scaffold temporarily provides the biomechanical support for the cells until they produce their own extracellular matrix. Because tissue-engineering constructs contain living cells, they may have the potential for growth and cellular self-repair and remodeling. In the present study, I examined whether the tissue-engineering strategy within hyaluron-based scaffolds would result in the formation of alternative cardiac tissue that could replace the scar and improve cardiac function after MI in syngeneic heterotopic rat hearts. Rat hearts were explanted, subjected to left coronary descending artery occlusion, and then grafted into the abdomen (aorta-aorta anastomosis) of receiving syngeneic rat. After 2 weeks, a pouch of 3 mm 2 was made in the thickness of the ventricular wall {{at the level of the}} post-infarction scar. The hyaluronic scaffold, previously engineered for 3 weeks with rat MSCs, was introduced into the pouch and the myocardial edges sutured with few stitches. Two weeks later we evaluated the cardiac function by M-Mode echocardiography and the myocardial morphology by microscope analysis. We chose bone marrow-derived mensenchymal stem cells (MSCs) because they have shown great signaling and regenerative properties when delivered to heart tissue following a myocardial infarction (MI). However, while the object of cell transplantation is to improve ventricular function, cardiac cell transplantation has had limited success because of poor graft viability and low cell retention, that’s why we decided to combine MSCs with a biopolimeric scaffold. At the end of the experiments we observed that the hyaluronan fibres had not been substantially degraded 2 weeks after heart-transplantation. Most MSCs had migrated to the surrounding infarcted area where they were especially found close to small-sized vessels. Scar tissue was moderated in the engrafted region and the thickness of the corresponding ventricular wall was comparable to that of the non-infarcted remote area. Also, the left ventricular shortening fraction, evaluated by M-Mode echocardiography, was found a little bit increased when compared to that measured just before construct transplantation. Therefore, this study suggests that post-infarction myocardial remodelling can be favourably affected by the grafting of MSCs delivered through a hyaluron-based <b>scaffol...</b>|$|R
