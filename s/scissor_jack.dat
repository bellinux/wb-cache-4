50|$|Laboratory <b>scissor</b> <b>jacks</b> are lifting stages for beakers, flasks, water baths, stirrer, {{or other}} lab tools used to elevate {{equipment}} height to the user's needs, usually around 5 to 20 cm.

50|$|The manual {{laboratory}} <b>scissor</b> <b>jack</b> works mechanically {{by having}} a central screw connected to the central piece of metal between two layers of crossing metal pieces. The screw performs the same task as screws in hydraulic car lift, supporting the metal pieces in withstanding the oppressing weight. Turning the screw increases and decreases the angle between the metal pieces, resulting in extension and contraction of the platform height.|$|E

40|$|This {{report shows}} that safe {{extension}} of the service life of existing bridge structures is possible through bridge health monitoring and structural response modification. To understand bridge health monitoring and structural response modification and control, {{it is necessary to}} examine: 1) common bridge vulnerabilities, 2) bridge loading models, 3) response modification devices, and 4) bridge monitoring systems. The efficacy of response modification techniques on a realistic bridge system were demonstrated using the Cedar Avenue Bridge in Minnesota as a specific example. The Cedar Avenue Bridge is a steel tied arch bridge which means that it is fracture critical. Due to the non-redundant nature of a fracture critical bridge, fatigue failure could be catastrophic and is of concern. Previous research has shown that stress concentrations exist at the joints where the hangers and floor beams are attached to the box girder [7]. Using a simulation of response modification on the Cedar Avenue Bridge model, stress ranges have been reduced on these specific details that are of concern. Modeling using a <b>scissor</b> <b>jack</b> and simple damping device has shown that stress ranges can be reduced by approximately 39 % which can lead to life extension of as much as 346 %.

40|$|A <b>Scissor</b> <b>Jack</b> is a {{mechanical}} device used {{to lift a}} heavy vehicle from the ground for changing the wheel and for maintenance purpose. The most important fact of a jack is that it gives the user {{a mechanical}} advantage by changing the rotational motion into linear motion and allowing user to lift a heavy car to the require height. In this work we have designed different components of scissors jack using CAE tools i. e. CATIA andCalculate stresses induced in its different part which are responsible for failure and To Reduce its cost so that everyone can afford this. We have taken reference of Mahindra Bolero Scissors Jack. The Dimensions of scissors jack was measured by Vernier caliper. By measuring all the dimensions of components of scissors jack we have designed it in CATIA after that we assemble all the components of Jack to shape a model of scissors jack and calculated different parameters Max. shear stress Max. principal Tensile Stress Total torque required to lift the vehicle etc which is used in all components of scissors jack to avoid failure. To {{reduce the cost of}} jack we have taken two different sections of three different materials i. e. Mild Steel AISI 1045 grade Steel GS- 52. 3 Cast Steel and comparing which will be suited for above mentioned purpose. By using these materials we have calculate and compare the Strength to weight ratio and find which material is best suited for high load carrying capacity with minimum failure or deformation...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{problems}} with obesity that the United States is facing today, malnutrition, caused in part by severely low dietary fat consumption, remains a problem among many people living in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Health Organization, one third of people in developing countries are malnourished as well as vitamin or mineral deficient. While villagers {{do not have access}} to commercially produced vegetable oil (a common source of dietary fat), nor are industrial scale oil extraction methods appropriate for small scale production. As a result, they turn to traditional methods, such as a mortar and pestle, to extract oil from peanuts, sunflower seeds, and other oil bearing seeds and nuts. This process is both time and labor intensive, and still does not yield sufficient amounts of oil to satisfy the need for it. The need for a small scale press is clear. This thesis introduces a simple design which achieves a yield of 46. 9 mL per cup (U. S.) which matches the yield produced using industrial technologies. This corresponds to 153 % increase in yield and 38. 5 % increase in rate over using traditional methods such as a mortar and pestle. The design consists of two fixed plates connected by four rods, with a third plate which slides along the four guide rods. (cont.) A standard <b>scissor</b> <b>jack</b> is the mechanism by which the necessary pressure of 800 - 1000 psi is generated to extract the oil. A peanut container with a removable bottom holds the peanuts as they are pressed, and holes drilled into its cylindrical face allow the oil to spill out into a collection dish underneath the container. The entire design is compact, with a footprint of one square foot and a height of 22 inches. This is 12 times smaller than the Beilenberg ram press, the standard for small scale presses currently used in developing countries. Experimental results of the loading profile as function of time show that the jack does not need to be turned continuously once the oil begins to appear. This requires significantly less strength than current methods of oil extraction. Although future work is recommended to further develop and improve the press, it shows promise of alleviating the need for such a device in many impoverished parts of the world. by Neera Jain and Somin Lee.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2013. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Steven J. Wojtkiewicz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 158 pages. Many of the bridges in the United States {{are being used}} beyond their initial design intentions, classified as structurally deficient, and {{are in need of}} rehabilitation or replacement. A portion of these bridges suffer from specific bridge vulnerabilities that have been categorized as fracture prone. The safe operating life of fracture prone details is governed by the stress range experienced by the detail. Providing alternate load paths through a supplemental apparatus attached to the bridge structure can relieve high stress ranges, and the limited safe bridge service life due to these vulnerabilities may be safely extended. As part of the apparatus, the utility of a mechanical amplifier, the <b>scissor</b> <b>jack,</b> is carefully investigated; the amplifier allows for a very localized application and much smaller stiffness and damping device demands. The mathematical relationships for the apparatus, in particular the magnification factor for displacement and force, are formulated analytically and verified through numerical modeling. The effects of the mechanical amplifier are investigated on a simple beam numerical model as well as through more comprehensive parameter studies on numerical bridge models of an in-service fracture critical bridge. The parameter studies reveal that longer apparatuses and larger cross-sectional member area improve performance. A relatively small passive stiffness and damping device provides adequate safe life extension when employing the mechanical amplifier and vastly outperforms an apparatus without the amplifier. The apparatus parameters are optimized through a series of simulations, and small amounts of device damping with no stiffness perform the best. Much larger damping and stiffness coefficients are necessary to achieve similar performance without the mechanical amplifier. Safe life extension of over 100 percent can be achieved with apparatus member cross-sectional area of 25 percent of the bridge girder area. For implementation on a general bridge, a long and slender mechanically amplified RM apparatus is recommended for safe life extension. For a passive system, a RM device with a small damping coefficient and no stiffness should be employed. The cross-sectional area of the RM apparatus members will need to be sufficiently large to provide adequate safe life extension and will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. A simple bridge model should be used to gauge initial member size. Frequency response analyses of the modified bridge structures show response amplification at some loading frequencies. Analyses also found different optimal device characteristics for decreasing the magnitude of the maximum or minimum moment range experienced at the vulnerability. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that semi-active control strategies allowing for changes in device characteristics may ultimately be more beneficial and should be further investigated...|$|E
