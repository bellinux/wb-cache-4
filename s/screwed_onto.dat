25|$|The Kestrel {{came about}} {{as a result of}} the {{excellent}} Curtiss D-12, one of the first truly successful cast-block engines. Earlier designs had used individually machined steel cylinders that were <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> a crankcase, whereas the cast-block design used a single block of aluminium that was machined to form cylinders. The result was both simpler to build as well as lighter and much stronger, requiring only an investment in new machining equipment.|$|E
500|$|The cap is then {{packed with}} a smokable substance, and <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> the bottle {{once it is}} {{immersed}} to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is about {{to come out of}} the water or when the substance discontinues burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back down into the water. The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a [...] "smoother" [...] manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself. This will give the smoker a sudden dose with hardly any smoke lost, rather than the amount of smoke lost with joints and blunts.|$|E

5000|$|Another type {{of shell}} {{fastening}} {{is simply a}} large-diameter fine thread. The shell then <b>screws</b> <b>onto</b> the arbor just as old-style lathe chuck backplates <b>screw</b> <b>onto</b> the lathe's spindle nose. This method is commonly used on the 2" [...] or 3" [...] boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only M03, never M04, or in pre-CNC terminology, [...] "only forward, never reverse". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).|$|R
2500|$|The typical {{drag brake}} {{has long been}} a drum brake. [...] The largest {{manufacturer}} of this type of brake is Arai, whose brakes are <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> hubs with conventional freewheel threading {{on the left side of}} the rear hub and operated via Bowden cables. As of 2011, the Arai drum brake has been out of production for several years, with remaining stocks nearing depletion and used units commanding premium prices on internet auction sites.|$|E
2500|$|On a wood router (a {{hand-held}} or table-mounted {{power tool}} used in woodworking), the collet is what holds the bit in place. In the U.S. {{it is generally}} for [...] bits, while in Europe bits are most commonly [...] The collet is hexagonal on the outside {{so it can be}} tightened or loosened with a standard wrench, and has threads on the inside so it can be <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> the motor arbor.|$|E
2500|$|The statue was stolen, in 1817, by the {{fugitive}} Antoine Licas. The perpetrator was heavily punished; he was condemned to forced labour for life, and was first tied {{for an hour}} to stocks on the Grand Place. The original statue was broken into 11 pieces during this abduction and was restored by a specialised welder, {{under the supervision of}} sculptor Gilles-Lambert Godecharle. The pieces were matched and used to make a mold in which the bronze statue was poured. The statue was then <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> a new base marked [...] "1620 - REST 1817".|$|E

5000|$|Copy stands can be {{used for}} {{reprography}} (that is, to copy documents). To do so, the camera is mounted, usually with a standard 1/4" [...] tripod-mount <b>screw,</b> <b>onto</b> the stand, pointing the lens down at the base, where the document to be copied would be placed.|$|R
50|$|The main {{surveying}} instruments in use {{around the world}} are the theodolite, measuring tape, total station, 3D scanners, GPS/GNSS, level and rod. Most instruments <b>screw</b> <b>onto</b> a tripod when in use. Tape measures are often used for measurement of smaller distances. 3D scanners and various forms of aerial imagery are also used.|$|R
2500|$|The pole, {{of brown}} wood, is 240cm high and 3.5cm in diameter. A brass {{cylinder}} {{is at the}} base, 4cm long and closed on the bottom. The rod {{is attached to the}} pole by a brass ring, gilt on its lower part, and a 6cm high cylindrical protective tube of the same material and gilt on its upper part. The ring (3.2cm high) is inscribed with the name of the unit. Another brass cylinder is placed on the tip of the pole, 6cm long and of brass. The eagle, of gilt copper, sheet, 15cm high and 11.5cm wide, is placed over this. Looking rightward, the eagle's wings are pointed downward and it holds the thunderbolts of Jupiter in its talons. It is placed on a parallelepipedic support of the same metal (10×3.5×2cm), which has a 3.4cm high ornament on its lower part. The support is <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> the brass cylinder and has inscribed into the front the motto [...] "Onoare şi Patrie" [...] ("Honor and Fatherland"). The name of the respective unit is engraved into the reverse.|$|E
2500|$|The 76/40 Model 1916 was {{a fairly}} {{complicated}} design with an A tube, a shrunk on jacket that extended to the breech, and a B tube which extended to the muzzle. Over the jacket and B tube a C hoop was shrunk on, which <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> the jacket and secured the B tube. [...] There was a shortened version of the gun called the 76/30 Model 1915, which was used on a few classes of destroyers, submarines, tugs and minesweepers. [...] The 76/30 Model 1915 were also used as truck mounted artillery during both world wars. [...] The mounts for the Italian guns were different than their British counterparts and there were five different varieties. [...] The quick fire breech was identical {{to that of the}} Royal Navy gun, except for the cartridge extractor and the firing mechanism. Traverse and elevation were manual and a crew of seven were needed to man the gun. [...] The guns fired fixed quick fire ammunition and a crew could sustain a rate of fire ranging from 12-15 rounds per minute.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tail section}} of the {{aircraft}} was redesigned as well. The rudder was slightly reduced in area and the symmetrical fin section changed to an airfoil shape, producing a sideways lift force that swung the tail slightly to the left. This helped increase {{the effectiveness of the}} rudder, and reduced the need for application of right rudder on takeoff to counteract torque effects from the engine and propeller. The conspicuous bracing struts were removed from the horizontal tailplanes which were relocated to slightly below and forward of their original positions. A semi-retractable tailwheel was fitted and the main undercarriage legs were raked forward by six degrees to improve the ground handling. An unexpected structural flaw of the wing and tail section was revealed when the first F-1s were rushed into service; some aircraft crashed or nearly crashed, with either the wing surface wrinkling or fracturing, or by the tail structure failing. In one such accident, the commander of JG 2 [...] "Richthofen", Wilhelm Balthasar, lost his life when he was attacked by a Spitfire during a test flight. While making an evasive manoeuvre, the wings broke away and Balthasar was killed when his aircraft hit the ground. Slightly thicker wing skins and reinforced spars dealt with the wing problems. Tests were also carried out to find out why the tails had failed, and it was found that at certain engine settings a high-frequency oscillation in the tailplane spar was overlapped by harmonic vibrations from the engine; the combined effect being enough to cause structural failure at the rear fuselage/fin attachment point. Initially, two external stiffening plates were <b>screwed</b> <b>onto</b> the outer fuselage on each side, and later the entire structure was reinforced.|$|E
50|$|A {{terminating}} resistor for a television coaxial cable is {{often in the}} form of a cap, threaded to <b>screw</b> <b>onto</b> an F connector. Antenna cables are sometimes used for internet connections; however RG-6 should not be used for 10BASE2 (which should use RG-58) as the impedance mismatch can cause phasing problems with the baseband signal.|$|R
30|$|In both cases, {{sufficient}} new-bone formation {{was observed}} {{in terms of volume}} and strength. In the CAD-CAM custom-made type T-mesh case, especially, it was much easier to fix <b>screws</b> <b>onto</b> the adjacent mandible, and after the removal of the mesh, the appearance of both patients improved, and the neo-mandibular body showed adequate bony volume for implant or prosthetic restoration.|$|R
50|$|There {{also is a}} soda/beer can {{launcher}}. Unlike {{the golf}} ball launcher that <b>screws</b> <b>onto</b> {{the end of the}} barrel, where the AR-15/m16 family of rifles' flash hider attaches, the can launcher tube is fitted directly to the AR-15 upper receiver and is the entire barrel assembly. Both the golf ball launcher and can launcher require use of blank ammunition.|$|R

50|$|The Fizz Keeper is {{a device}} that is sold {{as a means for}} {{preserving}} the carbonation in soft drinks. It comprises a small hand pump that <b>screws</b> <b>onto</b> the top of a plastic soft drink bottle, which is used to pump air into the bottle. Pressurizing the bottle in this way, it is claimed by most of those who sell the device, prevents the drink from going flat.|$|R
50|$|Screw caps' {{use as an}} {{alternative}} to cork for sealing wine bottles is gaining increasing support. A screw cap is a metal cap that <b>screws</b> <b>onto</b> threads on the neck of a bottle, generally with a metal skirt down the neck to resemble the traditional wine capsule ("foil"). A layer of plastic (often PVDC), cork, rubber, or other soft material is used as wad to make a seal with the mouth of the bottle.|$|R
50|$|Lensbaby sells wide angle, {{telephoto}} and macro adapters that <b>screw</b> <b>onto</b> the 37mm threads. In March 2011, Lensbaby introduced seven optics that a {{user can}} swap {{into and out}} of any of the in-production Lensbaby lensesAmong the new products was a plastic optic capable of producing the distortion and chromatic aberration familiar to Holga and LOMO users, a fisheye lens, a pinhole for infinite depth of field, zoneplate optic for very soft-focus effects, and an uncoated glass singlet.|$|R
