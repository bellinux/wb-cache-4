40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the large-scale implementation of distributed <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaics</b> in Wisconsin with regard to its interaction with the utility grid, economics of varying levels of high penetration, and displaced emissions. These assessment factors are quantified using simulations with measured hourly solar radiation and weather data from the National Solar Radiation Database as primary inputs. Hourly utility load data for each electric utility in Wisconsin for a complete year were used in combination with the simulated PV output to quantify the impacts of high penetration of distributed PV on the aggregate Wisconsin electric utility load. As the penetration rate of distributed PV systems increases, both economic and environmental benefits experience diminishing returns. At penetration rates exceeding 15 - 20 % of the aggregate utility load peak, less of the PV-energy is utilized and the contribution of the aggregate electricity generated from PV approaches a practical limit. The limit is not affected by costs, but rather by the time-distribution of available solar radiation and mismatch with the coincidence of aggregate utility electrical loads. The unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity from PV is more than four times greater than the current market price for electricity, based on time-of-use rates, in Wisconsin. At the present time, the investment in solar PV as a cost-effective means to reduce emissions from traditional electricity generation sources is not justified. <b>Solar</b> <b>Photovoltaics</b> <b>Electricity...</b>|$|R

40|$|The recent {{policy of}} the Malaysian {{government}} to promote use of renewable, especially photovoltaic, energy has warranted a feasibility study on supplementing diesel generation in off-grid sites by <b>solar</b> (<b>photovoltaic)</b> <b>electricity</b> {{to be done in}} the Malaysian context. This paper addresses the technical viability and economy of using a photovoltaic (PV) system to supplement an existing diesel generator-based supply in a typical secondary school located at an interior, off-grid and rural site of Sarawak state in East Malaysia. The findings of the present study, would therefore, help the Government with a realistic picture of the techno-economic aspects in implementing its vision regarding renewable energy. Presently, a 150 kW diesel generator supplies electricity to the considered school. The study required simulation of the load sharing pattern of the PV-diesel hybrid system taking into account varied weather and insolation conditions of the chosen site. Also, the purchase price as well as the size of the supplementing PV system that would give the lowest life cycle cost have been determined. The PV system was considered in both forms, i. e. with and without battery back-up. It has been found that if the market price for purchasing a PV system would drop to RM 11. 02 /WP (Ringgit Malaysia; US$ 1. 00 =RM 3. 80) i. e. US$ 2. 90 /WP, a 35 >kWP PV system without battery back-up in conjunction with the diesel generator would be able to supply the selected school's demand at a marginally lower energy cost than the existing diesel-only system. With continuous research and developments, PV price would keep falling in the near future so that a PV-diesel hybrid system with a higher sized PV is expected to be economically more viable.
