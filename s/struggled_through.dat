5|$|In 2005, Syracuse {{finished}} 27-7 {{and captured}} the Big East post-season tournament title {{with a win}} over West Virginia University. McNamara averaged 15.8 points and {{was named to the}} First Team All-Big East. The fourth-seeded Orange suffered a shocking overtime upset {{in the first round of}} the NCAA Tournament to the University of Vermont. McNamara <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> one of the worst games of his college career, scoring just 11 points and missing 14 of his 18 shots.|$|E
5|$|When Simone {{was given}} the task {{to write a book}} about Madonna, she was {{enthusiastic}} about the opportunity, since she had admired the singer's musical output and her ambitious nature which has led to a successful career in show-business. Simone recalled how Madonna had <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> her early days in New York city, and through her tough business mind and musical intuition had succeeded in crafting her own niche.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{only two}} players left from the {{championship}} team, McNamara and Syracuse <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> the 2005–2006 regular season. Two highlights were the 38 points McNamara scored against Davidson College, the second-most points ever scored by a Syracuse player at the team's home arena, the Carrier Dome, and a 30-point performance against the visiting Louisville Cardinals. Syracuse finished with a losing record in the Big East; the team was in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament unless it secured the conference's automatic bid by winning the Big East's postseason tournament.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day of}} 12 September, Kawaguchi's troops <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> {{the jungle}} toward their {{assembly}} points for that night's attacks. Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14:00, {{but they did not}} reach their assembly areas until after 22:00. Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses. Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11–12 September, causing a few casualties, including two killed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|Law {{originally}} {{found a job}} as {{a traveling}} carpet salesman. He continued until he discovered that his employer was misrepresenting domestic rugs as being imported and was also charging premium prices. His next employer, an outfitter of steamships and hotels, went out of business in the 1860s, when the American Civil War affected the business. Law <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> unemployment, and even while working, pay was low. At one point, Law was employed at a store and was making eight dollars a week.|$|E

5|$|On 23 October, Maruyama's forces <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> {{the jungle}} {{to reach the}} American lines. Kawaguchi, on his own initiative, began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American {{defenses}} were weaker in that area. Maruyama—through one of his staff officers—ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel Toshinari Shoji, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that {{the left and right}} wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama's forces.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{began the}} 1977 season {{on a high}} note with a nine-inning, seven-strikeout {{performance}} on April 8 against the Braves. He pitched seven complete game victories {{in the first half}} of the season. By the All-Star break, Richard had nine wins and six losses in over 160innings of work, accompanied by 119strikeouts and a 2.69ERA. Although Richard <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> July and early August, he did manage to pitch three complete games (including two shutouts) in five starts from August 27 to September 17. He had 11 and 10strikeouts respectively in the final two starts of that roughly 20-day span.|$|E

In a game against the San Jose Sharks, Parise sustained a hit from Logan Couture that further aggravated the injury, taking him out for the rest of the season and the Wild's short playoff run. Even with the injuries, Parise led the team in goals and was second in points. He also led the NHL with a total of three hat tricks on the season.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, while {{preparations}} were underway for the 1947 season, Grove was {{the subject}} of trade discussions. Most notably, White Sox manager Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president Bill Veeck discussed trading him for Indians pitcher Steve Gromek, but the deal was nixed when they could not come to an agreement. As the season began, Grove remained part of the rotation, which was led by Lopat and included Joe Haynes and Frank Papish. While Grove started off the season well, he <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> the middle of the year, going from May 18 to August 2 without winning a game. As a result, he was benched, and finished the season with 19 starts in 25 pitching appearances. For the first time, Grove finished a full season with an ERA above 4.00. He ended the season with six wins, eight losses, a 4.44 ERA, and six complete games. Grove spent the off-season working in the men's furnishings department of Henry C. Lytton's department store in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|From Verbrandesmis a road runs north-west, {{parallel}} with the lower Steenbeek through Merckem to Luyghem, slightly above {{the level of the}} surrounding marshes. Machine-guns nests in the villages, commanded the causeway from Drei Grachten; the ground everywhere in the peninsula was soaked and dotted with large numbers of blockhouses and pillboxes. The French artillery destroyed Verbrandesmis and it was quickly captured but the German garrisons at Jesiutengoed Farm and Kloostermolen held out for some time, before being driven out and forced back to Kippe and Aschhoop. German artillery bombarded the banks of the Steenbeek in front of Merckem and French troops rushed across on pontoon bridges, <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> the mud to the objectives and then attacked towards Kippe and Luyghem. Kippe and Aschhoop were captured quickly but the German garrisons at Luyghem and the causeway from Drei Grachten, resisted until afternoon before being overwhelmed.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Zito Switched his Uniform Number to 75 (which {{he would}} wear {{throughout}} the rest of his career) finished third in the American League (AL) in strikeouts per nine innings (8.61), fourth in strikeouts (205), sixth in wins (17), eighth in ERA (3.49), and tenth in winning percentage (.680). Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 or younger since 1902 to strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, Zito <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> {{the early part of the}} 2001 season, posting a 6–7 record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball.|$|E

5|$|Gilchrist {{played in}} every match of Australia's {{successful}} World Cup campaign, but struggled at first, {{with scores of}} 6, 14 and 0 {{in the first three}} matches against Scotland, New Zealand and Pakistan. Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. Gilchrist's quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, which was secured with a win over the West Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, the last in the final over, to scrape into the semifinals. Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were going for the winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald; the match was tied, and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist's 54 in the final helped secure Australia's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan. It was a happy ending for Gilchrist, who had <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54.|$|E
5|$|As the 1995–96 season concluded, John McNamara {{sold the}} club to Premier Computers, headed by Alan McGrath. McGrath {{unveiled}} a {{plan to build a}} state-of-the-art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght, and employed Pat Byrne as commercial manager. However, after a couple of weeks and a loss in {{the first game of the}} season, O’Neill was dismissed, while Eviston resigned in solidarity. Byrne was appointed manager of the side playing in Tolka Park once again, and they <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> the season with the League's joint top scorer, Tony Cousins playing a leading role in avoiding relegation. In May 1997, Alan McGrath resigned as club chairman and was replaced by Brian Kearney, also of Premier Computers, who succeeded in acquiring planning permission for the new stadium in January 1998. However, the permission was delayed by objections until November 1998, by which time Joe Colwell had replaced Kearney as chairman and ended Premier Computers' involvement with the club. On the pitch, Mick Byrne guided Rovers to an Intertoto Cup spot in 1997–98 and an eighth-place finish, the next season. He was replaced by Damien Richardson, who managed the club during their stay at Morton Stadium before his dismissal in April 2002, after a disagreement with Colwell. By that time, a half-built shell of a stadium stood at the Tallaght site; Mulden International Ltd, recruited by Colwell to complete the project, had pulled out of building the stadium. They leased it to a separate company, transferring the responsibility, and focused on four acres that they had retained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Group C's 9th Tabor had also, {{like the}} M-24s of Group B, <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> the marshes {{during the first}} phase of the operation, and were late in {{arriving}} at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units' SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete.|$|E

5|$|York made a {{good start}} to 1993–94, before a series of poor results saw them slip to 17th place in late November 1993. They only lost five of their last 30 {{fixtures}} to finish the season fifth in the Second Division table—their highest league placing since 1976. They lost to Stockport County in the play-off semi-final, being beaten 1–0 in the second leg at Edgeley Park after drawing 0–0 {{at home in the}} first leg. York were in lower midtable {{for the first half of}} 1994–95, but improving form saw them move up the table, before finishing in ninth place. They <b>struggled</b> <b>through</b> most of 1995–96, and only avoided relegation by winning their last match away to Brighton & Hove Albion; they finished in 20th place. This season saw York record a 4–3 aggregate victory over Manchester United in the League Cup second round. York defeated a strong United team including some younger players 3–0 at Old Trafford in the first leg; in the second leg, United fielded some more experienced players, and despite losing 3–1, York progressed on aggregate. United went on to win the Premier League and FA Cup double. York finished 20th in 1996–97, only securing safety in the penultimate match with an away win over Rotherham United. For the second consecutive season, they eliminated Premier League opponents from the League Cup in the second round, with a 4–3 aggregate win over Everton. After drawing the first leg 1–1 at Goodison Park, York progressed after winning the second leg 3–2 at home. In mid December 1997, York were fourth in the table, but declining form after New Year saw them finish 1997–98 in 16th place.|$|E
