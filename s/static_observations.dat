40|$|The {{growth and}} {{development}} of colonial hydroids is dependent upon a flow of gastrovascular fluid through a common vasculature.

In the athecate hydroid Hydr•actinia symbiolongicarpus we found that polyp contractions, stolonal contractions and gastrovascular flow were only weakly correlated on a local scale. Stolons isolated from vascular continuity to polyps were found to display contraction frequencies indistinguishable from those observed in intact colonies. Transmission electron micrographs reveal a unique organelle, with characteristics of a contractile vacuole, in the apical stolonal endoderm. The activity of this organelle, inferred from <b>static</b> <b>observations,</b> correlates with the observed pattern of stolonal contractions.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel model compensation (MC) method for {{the features of}} mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with signal-to-noise-ratio- (SNR-) dependent nonuniform spectral compression (SNSC). Though these new MFCCs derived from a SNSC scheme {{have been shown to}} be robust features under matched case, they suffer from serious mismatch when the reference models are trained at different SNRs and in different environments. To solve this drawback, a compressed mismatch function is defined for the <b>static</b> <b>observations</b> with nonuniform spectral compression. The means and variances of the static features with spectral compression are derived according to this mismatch function. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to provide recognition accuracy better than conventional MC methods when using uncompressed features especially at very low SNR under different noises.

In the present work, the interaction between oxide particles and dislocations in 9 CrODS ferritic steel was investigated by both <b>static</b> TEM <b>observation</b> and in-situ TEM observation under dynamic straining conditions. The primary concerns of those observations were the obstacle strength of oxide particles {{and the type of}} interactions: attractive or repulsive. In the <b>static</b> <b>observation,</b> the majority (∼ 90 %) of all interaction geometries was characterized as repulsive type. In the in-situ straining experiments, the obstacle strength α of oxide particles was estimated to be no greater than 0. 80. The experimentally-determined obstacle strength is smaller than that of Orowan type impenetrable obstacle, whereas those oxide particles are, in theory, ideally strong obstacles.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{framework}} for contour based object detection and recognition, which we formulate as a joint contour fragment grouping and labeling problem. For a given set of contours of model shapes, we simultaneously perform selection of relevant contour fragments in edge images, grouping {{of the selected}} contour fragments, and their matching to the model contours. The inference in all these steps is performed using particle filters (PF) but with <b>static</b> <b>observations.</b> Our approach needs one example shape per class as training data. The PF framework combined with decomposition of model contour fragments to part bundles allows us to implement an intuitive search strategy for the target contour in a clutter of edge fragments. First a rough sketch of the model shape is identified, followed by fine tuning of shape details. We show that this framework yields not only accurate object detections but also localizations in real cluttered images. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an efficient approach to construct shape models composed of contour parts with partially-supervised learning. The proposed approach can easily transfer parts structure to different object classes {{as long as}} they have similar shape. The spatial layout between parts is described by a non-parametric density, which is more flexible and easier to learn than commonly used Gaussian or other parametric distributions. We express object detection as state estimation inference executed using a novel Particle Filters (PF) framework with <b>static</b> <b>observations,</b> which is quite different from previous PF methods. Although the underlying graph structure of our model is given by a fully connected graph, the proposed PF algorithm efficiently linearizes it by exploring the conditional dependencies of the nodes representing contour parts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only yield very good detection results but also accurately locates contours of target objects in cluttered images. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the state observation in bioprocesses when there is uncertainty on the process parameters and/or the process inputs. An interval observer is designed {{on the basis of}} the cooperativity properties of the model for a standard stirred tank bioreactor model with a single microbial growth and a kinetic model depending on the substrate concentration. Further assumptions are the (lower and upper) boundedness of the specific growth rate and the inlet substrate concentration. Mathematical analysis of the stability and convergence of the interval observer is performed both in absence and in presence of uncertainty on the measurements. It is shown in particular that when the process inputs are known, the <b>static</b> <b>observation</b> error on the unknown state is inversely proportional to one of the observer gains. The performance of the interval observer are also illustrated through numerical simulation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the issues that}} arise from {{an examination of the}} continuum between two social learning paradigms that are widely used in robotics research: (i) following or matched-dependent behaviour and (ii) static observational learning. We use physical robots with minimal sensory capabilities and exploit controllers using neural network based methods for agent-centred perception of model angle and distance. The robot is first trained to perceive the dynamic movement of a robot model carrying a light source, then the robot learns by observing the model demonstrate a behaviour and finally it attempts to re-enact the learnt behaviour. Our results indicate that a dynamic observation using rotation performs significantly better than <b>static</b> <b>observation.</b> However given the embodiment of the robot a dynamic strategy using both rotational and translational movement becomes more problematic. We give reasons for this, discuss lessons learned for combining these types of social learning and make suggestions for requirements for imitator robots using dynamic observation. ...|$|R

We investigated regenerationpatterns and trajectories after a disturbance by applying a chronosequence approach.

Environmental factors such as light availability and coverage of woody debrisand litter changed abruptly after thinning {{and then returned to}} the pre-disturbance state. Although species richnesswas gained at shrub and ground layer in a limited way in both forests, cover of various functional types revealed diversityin their responses. Notably, Alnus firma stands exhibited a larger increment of cover in woody plants. Ordination analysisrevealed different regeneration trajectories between natural and planted stands. Based on ordination analysis, rehabilitatedstands showed movement to alternative states compared with natural ones, reflecting lower resilience to perturbation(i. e., lower stability).

40|$|Research into robotic social learning, {{especially}} that concerned with imitation, often focuses at differing {{ends of a}} spectrum from observational learning at one end to following or matched-dependent behaviour at the other.

Physical Khepera robots with minimal sensory capabilities are used, and after training, experiments are carried out where an imitating robot perceives the dynamic movement behaviours of another model robot carrying a light source.

A resultant method is based on the empirical Bayes approach and the kernel non-parametric estimation [5]. The equation of the nonlinear optimal smoothing estimate is derived in a form independent of the unknown distributions of an unobservable process.
