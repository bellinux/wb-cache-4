5|$|While <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> {{narcissi}} {{are specific}} {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage. The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.|$|E
5|$|At least <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place {{a marine}} sponge on their rostrum, presumably {{to protect it}} when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E

Additionally, the fruit bodies have about 30mg of ergosterol peroxide per 100g of dried mushroom. Ergosterol peroxide is a steroid derivative {{with a wide}} spectrum of biological activity, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, and cytotoxicity to various tumor cell lines grown in laboratory culture.|$|E

Unfortunately they include <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> parsnips, which give Candace an allergic reaction: to hide her hives and deep, scratchy voice she dons a sweatsuit and a paper bag before going to the mall to tell Linda about the boys' plans, and then sings E.V.I.L. B.O.Y.S. where Linda, Vivian Garcia-Shapiro, and Jeremy's mom are.|$|E
5|$|In benign infections {{found in}} <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> and captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules {{on the head}} and trunk in juveniles, which appear for a few weeks and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant. In the second case, it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs {{deeper into the}} ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start {{to grow in the}} following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E
5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. Silver birch is dominant, with a few crack willow, goat willow, <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> {{cherry and}} {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern.|$|E
5|$|Other than feral {{dogs and}} {{domestic}} cattle, {{the most frequently}} encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed grey langur prevalent in the Gangetic plain. <b>Some</b> <b>wild</b> boars and wolves may still be spotted in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears {{are not to be}} seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|E

5|$|Konkani {{pop music}} became popular after Indian Independence in 1947. Henry D'Souza and Helen D'Cruz {{are known for}} the Konkani love duet Kathrina in 1971 and the love Ballad Garacho Divo (Lamp of the House) in the 1970s, while Wilfy Rebimbus' sonnet Mog Tuzo Kithlo Axelom (How I Have Loved Thee) from 1977 is popular. Konkani plays, {{especially}} religious ones, were written and staged in Mangalore in the 20th century by prominent playwrights such as Pedru John D'Souza, Pascal Sequeira and Bonaventure Tauro. The Ghumat was a popular musical instrument played especially during weddings. The instrument has {{the form of an}} earthen pot but is open at both sides. One end is covered with the skin of <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> animal, and the other is left open. The traditional theatre form is called Gumat, and is performed {{on the eve of the}} marriage or in connection with the marriage celebrations in the decorated pandal (stage). The play is conducted by males belonging to both the brides' and bridegrooms' parties, and usually takes place for two or three nights. The plays performed are usually those of Biblical stories, and their morals are presented with the purpose of educating the bride and bridegroom. This tradition has almost completely died out among the present generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} has interbred {{extensively}} with the eastern wolf producing a hybrid population termed Great Lakes boreal wolves. Unlike {{the red and}} eastern wolf, the gray wolf does not readily interbreed with coyotes. Nevertheless, coyote genetic markers {{have been found in}} <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> isolated gray wolf populations in the southern United States. Gray wolf Y-chromosomes have also been found in Texan coyote haplotypes. In tests performed on a Texan canid of ambiguous species, mtDNA analysis showed that it was a coyote, though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote–gray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican gray wolf. In 2013, a captive breeding experiment in Utah between gray wolves and western coyotes produced six hybrids through artificial insemination, making this the very first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves. At six months of age, the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behavioral characteristics from both species. Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably gray wolf-like phenotypes, {{to the point of being}} mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{to other}} rodents, brown rats may carry {{a number of}} pathogens, which can result in disease, {{including}} Weil's disease, rat bite fever, cryptosporidiosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, Q fever and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the United Kingdom, brown rats are an important reservoir for Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium that causes Q fever, with seroprevalence for the bacteria found to {{be as high as}} 53% in <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> populations.|$|E

25|$|Myophily {{includes}} flies {{that feed}} on nectar and pollen as adults - particularly bee flies (Bombyliidae), hoverflies (Syrphidae), and others - and these regularly visit flowers. In contrast, male fruit flies (Tephritidae) are enticed by specific floral attractants emitted by <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> orchids {{which do not}} produce nectar. Chemicals emitted by the orchid act as the fly's sex pheromone precursor or booster. Myophilous plants tend not to emit a strong scent, are typically purple, violet, blue, and white, and have open dishes or tubes.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{are very}} popular within the exotic pet trade, {{and have been}} both {{captured}} in the wild and bred in captivity. Today, most captive boa constrictors are captive-bred, but between 1977 and 1983, 113,000 live boa constrictors were imported into the United States. These huge numbers of wild-caught snakes have put considerable pressure on <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> populations. Boa constrictors have also been harvested for their meat and skins, and are a common sight at markets within their geographic range. After the reticulated python, boa constrictors are the snake most commonly killed for snakeskin products, such as shoes, bags, and other items of clothing. In some areas, they {{have an important role}} in regulating the opossum populations, preventing the potential transmission of leishmaniasis to humans. In other areas, they are often let loose within the communities to control the rodent populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on a wide}} range of food plants {{including}} hedge mustard (Sisybrium officinale), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), cuckooflower (Cardamine pratense), water-cress (Rorippa nastutium-aquaticum), charlock (Sinapis arvensis), large bitter-cress (Cardamine amara), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), and so it is rarely a pest in gardens or field crops. The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow. There is extensive overlap with other leaf-feeding larvae of large and small whites in <b>some</b> <b>wild</b> populations (e.g. in Morocco). It is often found feeding on the same plant as the orange tip but rarely competes for food because it usually feeds on the leaves whereas the orange tip caterpillar feeds on the flowers and developing seed pods. Like other Pieris species it overwinters as a pupa. This is green in colour, and the raised parts are yellowish and brown. This is the most frequent form, but it varies through yellowish to buff or greyish, and is sometimes without markings.|$|E

50|$|Piecemeal refurbishments in the 1980s, {{when the}} estate needed repairs and upgrades, {{included}} painting, retiling and a secure entry system with ironwork that plays variations on Lubetkin’s trellis grille. Central heating {{was extended to}} all rooms, and some residents tore out the canted-frame fireplaces and steel sinks with Garchey disposal units. After the Grade II* listing of Spa Green in 1998, Homes for Islington with English Heritage initiated a restoration of the entire exterior plus the kitchens and bathrooms of the flats still in council ownership. Deteriorated concrete was recast, windows replaced with double-glazed steel Critall units resembling the originals (though with thicker frames), and Lubetkin’s colours reconstructed - with <b>some</b> <b>wilder</b> primary colours at the entry level.|$|R
