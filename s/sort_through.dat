5|$|Her Story is an {{interactive}} movie video game {{written and directed}} by Sam Barlow. It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS, and the following year for Android. In the game, players search and <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and use the clips to solve the case of a missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully {{address the question of}} how children <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E

25|$|Statistics New Zealand {{develops}} statistical classifications and standards, {{and works}} with the corresponding national statistical offices with such nations as Australia, the United States, and Canada. It conducts ongoing research regarding the viability of these standards. Since the early 2000s, it has begun using the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupation to describe {{a wide variety of}} jobs; for example, the code 111111 describes a chief executive or managing director, while the code 531111 describes a general clerk. By using standardized codes, high speed computers can sift and <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> large databases to produce summary reports.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} URLs crawled being generated by server-side software has also {{made it difficult for}} web crawlers to avoid retrieving duplicate content. Endless combinations of HTTP GET (URL-based) parameters exist, of which only a small selection will actually return unique content. For example, a simple online photo gallery may offer three options to users, as specified through HTTP GET parameters in the URL. If there exist four ways to sort images, three choices of thumbnail size, two file formats, and an option to disable user-provided content, then the same set of content can be accessed with 48 different URLs, all of which may be linked on the site. This mathematical combination creates a problem for crawlers, as they must <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> endless combinations of relatively minor scripted changes in order to retrieve unique content.|$|E

25|$|According to the report, an {{instrument}} {{in the cockpit}} displayed false information, causing the aircraft to deviate from the prescribed flight path specified by the instrument landing system, flying above its glide path. As the aircraft broke free of the cloud cover and switched from instrument controlled flight to visual control, the captain presumably estimated the altitude incorrectly due to darkness and poor visibility, causing the aircraft to come in too far, which made the final approach too late. The captain decided to abort because the little remaining runway {{would not have been}} sufficient to allow for braking the aircraft. At this point, he maneuvered the Convair into an extreme flight attitude, leading to a stall and the aircraft striking the ground with its left wing first. The aircraft burned completely except for the tail section and the right wing. When the rescue team arrived they could only <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> the wreckage.|$|E

Mason's family throws him a graduation party and toasts his success. Mason Sr. gives him advice about his breakup. Planning to sell the house and downsize, Olivia meets Samantha and Mason for lunch and asks them to <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> their possessions. Later that year, as Mason prepares to leave his mother's new apartment for college, Olivia breaks down, disillusioned by how quickly life has passed. At Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Mason moves into his dorm room and meets his new roommate Dalton, Dalton's girlfriend Barb, and Barb's roommate Nicole. Mason eats a cannabis edible or mushroom chocolate given to him by Barb and the group goes hiking at Big Bend Ranch State Park. Nicole shares with Mason her belief that, rather than people seizing moments, moments seize people, to which Mason agrees.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{matching}} hedge funds to investors {{has traditionally been}} fairly opaque, with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers. Many funds disclose their holdings, strategy, and historic performance relative to market indices, giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated, although individual holdings are often not disclosed. Investors are often drawn to hedge funds {{by the possibility of}} realizing significant returns, or hedging against volatility in the market. The complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – Calpers, the largest pension fund in the US, announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in 2014. Some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors: HedgeZ is designed to allow investors to easily search and <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> funds; iMatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investor's goals and behavioral profile, in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V.

Though he graded the episode with an A-, Murray did however critique its climatic scene for being [...] "clumsily paced and staged". Murray mainly found positive aspects with the episode, explaining, [...] "For a show that started out being a fairly dour procedural with wacky mad-scientist elements, Fringe has really worked its way into that fantasy/sci-fi sweet-spot, where its own forward momentum makes the ridiculous look likely and arcane mythology seem well-worth the time to <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> and analyze." [...] Other highlights Murray found was Noble's performance, which he considered his [...] "finest moment in the series to date," [...] and Olivia's visions of the other universe.|$|E

500|$|In {{the film}} Madsen tried to {{challenge}} the idea of war as [...] "black and white" [...] {{and the idea that}} the resistance was [...] "a cohesive whole". He says of war that it [...] "has many more nuances, it is grayer, less defined. When an enemy may stop being one at any time and a friend can become an enemy overnight, things become less clear". Ella Taylor of The Village Voice commented, [...] "Flame & Citron is less about the battle between good and evil than about losing one's way in the fog of war, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> the rules of engagement, and complicates the heroic honor codes of movies about the 'good war.'" [...] Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post asserted that the violence in the film is double-edged: [...] " [...] takes its toll on the perpetrator as well as the victim." [...] Similarly, The Irish Timess Derek Scally stated the film analyses [...] "the dehumanising effect of assassinations on assassin".|$|E
500|$|From a Basement on the Hill, {{almost four}} years in production, was {{released}} on October 19, 2004, by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith's family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith's ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> the recordings and mix the album. Although Smith had voiced his desire {{for it to be}} a double album or a regular album with a bonus disc, it was not clear whether it would have been possible for him to release it that way had he completed it. As completed by Schnapf and Bolme, it was released as a 15-track single album. Many songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as [...] "True Love", [...] "Everything's OK", [...] "Stickman", and [...] "Suicide Machine" [...] (a reworking of the Figure 8-era unreleased instrumental [...] "Tiny Time Machine"). There has been unconfirmed speculation that Smith's family made the decision not to include some songs on the record due to their lyrical content, although songs such as [...] "King's Crossing" [...] that deal with darker subjects did make the album.|$|E

Sue allows Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Kurt to plan Jean's funeral and help her <b>sort</b> <b>through</b> Jean's {{personal}} belongings, and agrees to have the glee club to perform at the funeral, as she believes no one will attend otherwise. While going through Jean's belongings, Finn and Kurt discover that her favorite movie was Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and arrange a funeral inspired by the film. At the funeral, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her eulogy after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. The glee club then sings [...] "Pure Imagination", the theme song of the film. Touched by Will's support, Sue later tells him that he is a good friend and he has what Jean had and she does not: a pure heart. She says that she will no longer attempt to destroy the glee club, and announces that she is planning to run for the United States House of Representatives. For the first time, she wishes him good luck. Sue also apologizes to Becky, reinstates her {{as a member of the}} Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad in the fall.
