Sara Kestelman voiced {{the character}}, with Kreia's casting being considered the most important of all the characters. Her name references Princess Leia of the original Star Wars trilogy, while her character design draws both on Palpatine's hood and Obi-Wan Kenobi's robes.|$|E

These false dependences arise because the questions <b>asked</b> <b>are</b> conservative approximations {{to the questions}} we really <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking.</b> Unfortunately, the questions we really <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> go beyond integer programming and require decision procedures for a subclass of Presburger formulas. In this paper, we describe how to extend the Omega test {{so that it can}} answer these queries and allow us to eliminate these false data dependences. We have implemented the techniques described here and believe they are suitable for use in production compilers. (An earlier version of this paper appeared at the 	ACM SIGPLAN PLDI' 92 conference).

25|$|Over {{the centuries}} {{a number of}} {{prominent}} ulema, including the Maliki jurist Abu al-Walid al-Baji (d. 474 AH) and Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328), held that apostasy is not a hadd crime and thus is liable only to a discretionary punishment (ta'zir). Some early authorities, such as Ibrahim al-Nakhai and Sufyan al-Thawri, {{as well as the}} Hanafi jurist Sarakhsi (d. 1090), believed that an apostate <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to repent indefinitely and never condemned to death. According to Sarakhsi, apostasy from Islam is a great offense, but its punishment is postponed until the Day of Judgement. The view that the Quran speaks only of otherworldly punishment for apostasy was also held by the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar (1958-1963) Mahmud Shaltut, who held that the prescription of death penalty for apostasy found in hadith was aimed at prevention of aggression against Muslims and sedition against the state. Contemporary scholar Mirza Tahir Ahmad quotes a number of companions of Muhammad or early Islamic scholars (Ibn al-Humam, al-Marghinani, Ibn Abbas, Sarakhsi, Ibrahim al-Nakh'i) to argue that there was not a ijma (consensus among scholars or community) in favor of execution of murtadd in early Islam.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the First World War {{and until}} 1920 Harvey, in the Quaker tradition, engaged {{personally}} in relief {{work in the}} war zone in France, {{on behalf of the}} War Victims’ Relief Committee of the Society of Friends. But Harvey's dilemma over support for the government, as distinct from his religious beliefs, surfaced when he and another Liberal Quaker MP, Arnold Stephenson Rowntree, helped to draft the section of the Military Service Act 1916 that provided for the possibility of conscientious objectors being required to perform work of national importance as a condition of exemption from service in the army. There was disagreement among Quakers about the sort of service, if any, which conscientious objectors <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to do, and Harvey and Rowntree were accused of arrogating to themselves the right to specify what objectors might do and of misrepresenting to the authorities {{the extent to which they}} could speak for Quaker opinion. He also served as a member of the Pelham Committee (formally, the Committee on Work of National Importance), the body charged in March 1916 with trying to find suitable civilian occupations for conscientious objectors prepared to undertake the work of national importance he had helped to be written into the Military Service Act.|$|E
25|$|The counterattack failed, as two battalions in {{the centre}} found the German {{shelling}} {{too heavy for}} them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for “funk”, after hearing the view {{of one of the}} actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and “in complete ignorance of the situation”. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to explain and that IV Corps, formerly “the most efficient in the army” “had much decreased in military value” and Wilson “had failed as a commander in the field”. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were “downhearted” and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been “pulling Charteris’ leg” as he talked of “sweeping victories” within two months. Wilson was almost “degummed” (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many “unsuccessful” corps commanders, largely {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time, and that Haig’s animosity for Wilson was a factor.|$|E
