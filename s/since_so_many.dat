5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> new sets {{had to be}} created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since {{he was afraid}} that he might die before {{completing}} the final revision of the Institutes, he forced himself to work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs, and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but <b>since</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people came to see it, the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location of the grave is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E

Despite greatly outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, Pompey {{had no intention of}} fighting. Caesar pursued Pompey to Brindisium, hoping to capture Pompey before the trapped Senate and their legions could escape. Pompey managed to elude him, sailing out of the harbour before Caesar could break the barricades.|$|E

All Cicaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months.

25|$|Before the war the {{government}} had ignored labor issues, but now it had to intervene to mobilize war production. With the main working-class Socialist party reluctant to support the war effort, strikes were frequent and cooperation was minimal, especially in the Socialist strongholds of Piedmont and Lombardy. The government imposed high wage scales, as well as collective bargaining and insurance schemes. Many large firms expanded dramatically. For example, the workforce at the Ansaldo munitions company grew from 6,000 to 110,000 workers as it manufactured 10,900 artillery pieces, 3,800 warplanes, 95 warships and 10 million artillery shells. At Fiat the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000. Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas <b>since</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.|$|E

Gough {{described the}} meeting of 28 June 1917 by Haig, Gough and Plumer, as evidence of Haig's understanding and acceptance of the Fifth Army plan. Gough noted that General Headquarters had caused a road to be built and kept clear for the use of cavalry and that Haig had rejected Rawlinson's and Plumer's plans as too limited. Gough stressed that his plan was not limited by specific objectives, which had hampered attacks at Loos and Gallipoli in 1915 and the Somme in 1916. Wynne had referred to the Davidson memo of 26 June but Gough pointed out that reserves were available close by, to exploit advantages that emerged, rather than the first attacking troops were to advance indefinitely.|$|E

500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky <b>since</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{high cost}} of saffron {{is due to the}} {{difficulty}} of manually extracting large numbers of minute stigmas, which are {{the only part of the}} crocus with the desired aroma and flavour.

2500|$|Miscellanies were an {{influential}} literary form at the time. From {{the beginning of}} the 18th century, verse miscellanies were gathering together a selection of poetic works by different authors, past and present, and so played a part {{in the development of the}} concept of the English canon. These literary miscellanies might be sold as unique collections, arising from the combinations of writers in a small literary circle; or their function could attempt to be more national and historical, by representing the finest works of British poets to date. The multiple editions of the Dryden-Tonson Miscellany Poems (1684-1708) and the Swift-Pope Miscellanies (1727–32), as well as The Muses Library (1737) and The British Muse (1738), were from early on attempting to construct a notion of a national literary heritage. The revival of interest in English balladry is also largely due to miscellanies, most famously Thomas Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765). [...] Miscellanies also played a part in the development of other literary forms, particularly the novel. <b>Since</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> collections included prose extracts alongside poetry, often from eighteenth-century novels such as Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy (1759), it is arguable they aided the popularisation of novels.
