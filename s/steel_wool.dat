5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid <b>steel</b> <b>wool</b> inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the <b>steel</b> <b>wool</b> to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning <b>steel</b> <b>wool</b> {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

500|$|The {{visual and}} special effects {{departments}} often overlap, {{such as in}} Mary Winchester's death scene in the pilot episode. Because the character is pinned to the ceiling and burned to death, actress Samantha Smith was required to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a papier-mâché body was ignited on a fake ceiling. When the burning of the titular creature in the episode [...] "Wendigo" [...] was not sufficient using special effects, a wire-frame mannequin wrapped in <b>steel</b> <b>wool</b> was then burned, with the scene being composited into the original footage to draw out the wendigo's death. To make it appear that the Hook Man is invisible as he scrapes his hook along the wall {{for one of the}} scenes in [...] "Hook Man", a wire was placed inside plaster walls and then pulled out; the wire later was digitally removed in post-production. In the episode [...] "Bugs", the cast had to be sealed in a small area with hundreds of bees, and were stung despite wearing special costumes with cuffs sewn into their sleeves and pants. However, the bees did not show up well on camera, so most of them that appear in the final version were added with CGI.|$|E
5000|$|Hall {{was on a}} {{business}} trip in Pittsburgh in 1897 and saw mineral wool being made from steel slag. Some of the drawbacks he noted were that it soon disintegrated into powder and was unstable when moist. He thought that perhaps Alexandria's abundance of limestone to make a rock wool product similar to the <b>steel</b> mineral <b>wool</b> might be something to work on. Hall, using his chemical engineering background, experimented with the bedrock material. He discovered that it had a melting point near that of glass. He played with this molten stone in steel cupola furnaces and drew fibers out of them with blasts of air. The result of this experiment was a wool-like substance {{similar to that of the}} <b>steel</b> slag mineral <b>wool.</b> His product however did not have sulfur in it, which he considered caused the problems with <b>steel</b> mineral <b>wool.</b> He eventually determined that his material was an excellent insulator. He organized some investors and with $600 started a plant in 1897 to produce this insulating material in Alexandria.Hall negotiated the purchase on several hundred acres of land that contained limestone that could be used in the future for making rock wool. At the time he was manufacturing this insulating material, the chief users of insulation were breweries, distilleries, and cold storage facilities. For their insulation they used cork that was imported from Spain and Portugal. These firms were skeptical of Hall's new insulating material, so he made board-like sheets under the brand name [...] "Rock Cork" [...] to make it more appealing to the market. Hall in 1902 created the Chemical Crystal Company to produce this product as the first factory in the United States to do so. A few years later the natural gas supply of the area had been used up. All the local industries moved out, including the original investors of Chemical Crystal Company and the company ceased to exist.|$|R

500|$|Post-production {{lasted for}} {{fourteen}} months. Because {{the film was}} made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used, all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and lay-out artists were given black and white printouts of the live action scenes (known as [...] "photo stats"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters {{in relationship to the}} live action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not [...] "slipping and slipping all over the place." [...] After rough animation was complete, it would run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background. The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians would animate three lighting layers (shadows, highlights and tone mattes) separately, {{in order to make the}} cartoon characters look three-dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the night club scene, because it had flashing sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with <b>steel</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|E
500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with <b>steel</b> <b>wool</b> and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you {{what the hell is going}} on in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E
2500|$|The Waseda University (Japan) and NTT Docomo's {{manufacturers}} {{have succeeded in}} creating a shape-shifting robot WD-2. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided {{the positions of the}} necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three degrees of freedom. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of <b>steel</b> <b>wool</b> mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To [...] "copy" [...] a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.|$|E

During the 20th century, the Army Corps of Engineers conducted two projects on the river, completed in 1912 and 1943.

50|$|Very early wool presses {{were made}} from wood boards and had a wire winch {{mechanism}} to compress the wool and also hollow logs where the wool was tramped into a pack. During the late 19th century various forms of wooden wool press became the standard. Most popular models were the Koerstz and the Ferrier. The Koerstz was a smaller press than the Ferrier. The Ferrier press was manufactured under license by Humble & Nicholson (later Humble & Sons), Geelong, Victoria, and they had sold 2,000 presses between about 1871 and 1918. These presses were distributed throughout Australia, but were also sent overseas to New Zealand, South America, and North Africa. The <b>steel</b> Ajax <b>wool</b> presses were also used. Woolpressing with a manual woolpress was hard, tiring work that required tramping the wool into a box and then pressing it further with a manually operated lever activated cable.

To be sure, the system had its limitations, including the absence of meaningful price and cost information and the difficulty of extending planning to all the special commodities and enterprises in a modern economy. More serious difficulties stemmed from the attitudes and priorities built into the Stalinist planning system.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} construction of a low temperature differential (LTD) Stirling engine for electric power generation. The target energy sources were geothermal, industrial waste heat or solar heated water. These sources would supply a source temperature of around 90 °C. Assuming that the sink is kept at around 20 °C, the engine was designed based on a temperature difference of approximately 70 °C. The initial design and basic structure of the engine was completed in a previous project utilising first order design methods. The goal {{was to develop a}} low cost prototype engine capable of producing up to 500 W electrical output power. A novel gamma type engine was proposed utilising a rotary reciprocating displacer and industrial steam piping to form a low cost pressurised chamber. This project concentrated on advancing the design and construction towards completion with particular emphasis on the electrical control, measurement/instrumentation components, and gas flow through the regenerator. At the completion of this project the displacer piston actuation system has been redesigned. In order to achieve the displacer’s specified 2 ㎐ actuation, both the displacer’s structure and the actuation system were altered. The displacer’s aluminium shell and foam centre were removed and replaced with a pine superstructure coated in depron foam, reducing the moment of inertia from 0. 4488 ㎏ ∙ ㎡ to 0. 0984 ㎏ ∙ ㎡. A secondary motor was added to the actuation system to increase the actuation power. The gearing ratio was also altered from 10 : 1 to 2 : 1 to increase the peak displacer speed. The regenerator was designed and built to suit the unusual wedge shape requirements of the original design. A ribbed structure was conceived to allow fluid flow to be manipulated within separate sections, producing an even pressure drop over varying regenerator lengths. Simulations were run to optimise both the number of sections and the mass of wire wool to be placed in each segment. The final regenerator design has axial ribs placed at radii of 93, 134, 192, 276 and 392 mm, creating four sections. These sections are filled with 0. 68, 0. 97, 1. 40 and 1. 90 kg of # 0 mild <b>steel</b> wire <b>wool.</b> As Stirling engines are not self-starting the generator was required to be run as a motor when starting the Stirling engine. To achieve bidirectional flow of current within the starter motor/generator control system, a field oriented control (FOC) inverter from Texas Instruments was purchased and set up to run the 1 kW, 3 phase, permanent magnet generator in both motor and generation modes. This will allow the Stirling engine to be brought up to speed with the generator operating as a motor and then switch to generation mode when the motoring current falls below a set limit. Both pressure and temperature measurement systems were developed, constructed and tested in order to collect information about the performance of the engine under operation. Three pressure transducer circuits were designed and constructed with measurement ranges of 10 ㎪, ± 0. 99 ㎪ and ± 6. 66 ㎪. These circuits were integrated with a PiocLog 1012 analog to digital converter and PicoLog recording software. Eight K-type thermocouples were used for temperature recording. These were sampled with a Pico Technology TC- 08 temperature thermocouple data logger which in turn was connected, via USB, to a computer running PicoLog Recorder software. Thus far all component testing has been carried out with test rigs that model the relevant parts of the engine. The displacer actuation system and phase angle control of the displacer and power piston has been tested. Temperature and pressure measurement systems have been independently tested. Motor/generator speed control and switching has been simulated and tested. Unfortunately completion of the engine assembly was not achieved within the scope of this project and therefore fully integrated testing of all components was not carried out. Once mechanical assembly is completed fully integrated testing of displacer actuation, piston position, generator speed control and measurement systems can be achieved...|$|R
