40|$|As many of {{the dairy}} powders {{manufactured}} have to travel long distances to reach their customers, both domestically and internationally, there is considerable interest among dairy powder manufacturers to maintain {{the quality of their}} products for relatively long storage periods. Dairy powders can have a long shelf life if packaged and stored properly. Vacuum packaging can be an attractive packaging strategy to maintain the quality of dairy powders and provide added value by improving the efficiency of using the storage space; because of the inherent compactness of these products. Vacuum packaged dry dairy ingredients may also have added ease of handling for end users. However, {{little is known about the}} impact of vacuum packaging on the physical properties of dry dairy ingredients. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of vacuum packaging over 12 months storage on particle size, particle density, bulk density, tapped density, flowability, compressibility, color, moisture content, surface morphology, and solubility of six types of dairy powders. In addition, the effect of dairy ingredients type was also assessed. Commercial samples of nonfat dry milk powder, whole milk powder, buttermilk powder, milk protein Isolate, whey protein concentrate# 80, and sweet whey powder were repackaged in duplicate using multi-wall foil <b>side</b> <b>gusseted</b> <b>bags</b> under varying degrees of vacuum (1, 0. 7, 0. 4 bar) and a control with no vacuum, then stored for 3, 6, and 12 months at 25 Â°C and 60...|$|R

50|$|Some manufacturers, such as OMS and Dive Rite make {{both and}} let the {{purchaser}} choose which style they prefer.The style which uses elastic only on the <b>side</b> <b>gussets</b> is more streamlined and smoother than the full wrap bungee style.|$|R
50|$|A less casual, earlier type of slip-on is {{made with}} <b>side</b> <b>gussets</b> (sometimes called a dress loafer). Made in the same shape as lace-up Oxfords, but lacking the laces, these shoes have elasticated inserts on the side which allow the shoe to be easily removed but remain snug when worn. This cut has its {{greatest}} popularity in Britain.|$|R
50|$|The next {{development}} {{retained the}} semicircular top flange, but the <b>side</b> <b>gussets</b> were now abandoned altogether {{as it was}} considered that {{the depth of the}} flange, even if not supported by another plate, would be stiff enough. This also allowed better access to the inside, for painting. Intermittent cross diaphrams were placed across the flange, to maintain its position relative to the main web and avoid distortion by rocking sideways.|$|R
40|$|Tension {{members are}} used {{in a variety of}} {{structures}} such as trusses, transmission towers etc. The most widely used structural shapes are the angle sections and the channel sections. Angle may use as single angle or double angles and the connection may be bolted or welded. Most of the design provisions for hot- rolled tension members are available and only few studies were reported in literature regarding behavior of cold formed steel bolted angle tension members. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the behavior of cold steel single and double angle subjected to tension. Experimental, theoretical investigations were carried out for single angle, double angle connected to opposite <b>sides</b> of <b>gusset</b> plates and double angle connected to same <b>side</b> of <b>gusset</b> plates...|$|R
50|$|Improvements {{in plate}} rolling allowed {{a change in}} the shape of the girder. Rather than merely a slightly-curved top plate with {{triangular}} gussets, it was now possible to roll a semi-circular plate. This allowed the fully developed 'balloon' shape to be used, as in the second cross-section illustrated. The top web of the girder was semi-circular and riveted to the centre plate by an L-strip. The <b>side</b> <b>gussets,</b> also curved, were riveted parallel to the edges of this top plate, rather than through another L-strip, as used originally. Brunel (probably correctly) considered the smooth balloon profile to be a more efficient design, influenced by his geometric approaches to design rather than Eaton's mathematical analysis. More practically, the parallel lap joint halved the amount of riveting needed, compared to the L-strip.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{predictable}} handling of a race car, local mounts connecting suspension components to the chassis should be sufficiently rigid to minimize unwanted local deflection which may adversely affect suspension geometry. In this work, the effects of local chassis flexibility of the spring perch on roll stiffness, tire camber change, and steer angle change are determined from a finite element model (FEM) of a Winston Cup race car. Details such as <b>side</b> <b>gussets,</b> supporting brackets, and local curvature of the frame rail spring pocket are included in a shell model of the spring perch. The local shell model of the spring perch is integrated with the global finite element stiffness model of the chassis and suspension consisting of an assembly of beam and shell elements. A parametric study {{on the effects of}} thickness changes for seven different areas of the spring perch has been performed. Tire camber change, steer angle change, and chassis roll stiffness are plotted as a function [...] ...|$|R

By {{becoming}} the sides {{and bottom of the}} <b>bag,</b> the <b>gusset</b> opens the <b>bag</b> up beyond what simply attaching the front to the back would do. With reference to the dimension of the gusset, the measurements of a flat bottom bag may be quoted as LxWxG.|$|R

40|$|Background: The main {{objective}} is to investigate the behaviour of cold-formed steel single and double angles subjectedto tension. Methods: Sixteen single plain and lipped angle specimens and thirty two numbers of double angle specimensconnected to the same side and opposite <b>side</b> of the <b>gusset</b> plate were tested in a Universal Testing Machine using ordinaryblack bolts of 10 mm diameter. The experimental loads are compared with ultimate load calculated using BS 5950 (Part V) - 1998, and AS/NZS 4600 : 2005. Results: Most of the single and double angles failed by net section fracture failure and the outstanding leg are subjected to local bend due to shear lag effect. Application: Angles are used {{in a variety of}} structuressuch as trusses, transmission towers etc. as tension members. Angles may be used as single angles or double angles andthe connection may be bolted or welded...|$|R
