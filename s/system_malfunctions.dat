25|$|The Wenshan Line was {{initially}} operated with VAL 256 trains cars, where two VAL 256 {{cars in the}} same set would share the same road number. As {{a result of this}} numbering scheme, the 102 cars of the VAL fleet have car numbers from 1 to 51. On June 2003, Bombardier was awarded a contract to supply the Neihu Line with 202 Innovia 256 train cars , to install the communications-based CITYFLO 650 moving-block ATC system to replace the fixed-block ATC system and also to retrofit the existing 102 VAL 256 cars with the CITYFLO 650 ATC system. Integration of Bombardier's trains with the existing Brown Line proved to be difficult in the beginning, with multiple <b>system</b> <b>malfunctions</b> and failures during {{the first three months of}} operation. Retrofitting older trains also took longer than expected, as the older trains must undergo several hours of reliability tests during non-service hours. The VAL 256 trains resumed operations in December 2010.|$|E

50|$|A dropout is a {{momentary}} {{loss of signal}} in a communications system, usually caused by noise, propagation anomalies, or <b>system</b> <b>malfunctions.</b> For analog signals, a dropout is frequently gradual and partial, depending on the cause. For digital signals, dropouts are more pronounced, usually being sudden and complete, due to the cliff effect. In mobile telephony, a dropout {{of more than a}} few seconds will result in a dropped call.|$|E

50|$|Just {{weeks after}} launch, on 29 July 2005 {{the first of}} a series of cooling <b>system</b> <b>malfunctions</b> occurred. These {{ultimately}} caused the entire reservoir of liquid helium to boil off into space by 8 August 2005. This effectively shut down the X-ray Spectrometer (XRS), which was the spacecraft's primary instrument. The two other instruments, the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD), were unaffected by the malfunction. As a result, another XRS was integrated into the Hitomi X-ray satellite, launched in 2016.|$|E

Automated aids have played an increasing role in cockpits, taking a growing {{role in the}} control of such flight tasks as determining the most fuel-efficient routes, navigating, and detecting and diagnosing <b>system</b> <b>malfunctions.</b> The use of these aids, however, can lead to less attentive and less vigilant information seeking and processing {{on the part of}} human beings.

50|$|The ubiquitin-proteasome {{system is}} {{critical}} to appropriate protein degradation within cells. Dysfunctions of this system can disrupt cellular homeostasis and lead {{to a host of}} disorders. In normally functioning cells, the covalent linkage of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like protein to a target protein changes the target protein’s surface. These ubiquitinylated proteins are subject to degradation by proteolytic and non-proteolytic pathways. If this <b>system</b> <b>malfunctions,</b> numerous inherited and acquired diseases may result, such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, inflammatory arthritis and lupus.|$|E

50|$|During {{the course}} of the investigation, and later in its final report, the NTSB issued 24 safety recommendations, {{covering}} maintenance, regulatory oversight, and aircraft design issues.

[...] Throughout the problems, Cooper remained cool, calm and collected.|$|E

Soon afterwards, Donald (South Africa) freezes to death when his life support <b>system</b> <b>malfunctions.</b> Shortly after this, Gwen's (Australia) bunker is penetrated and she is pulled upwards by an unknown party, leaving only Ben and Katya to continue pressing their switches. Having heard nothing more from General Eiger, Katya believes the situation to be hopeless and wants to stop responding to the alarm, allowing activation of the weapon.

5000|$|Automation {{complacency}} {{has been}} defined as [...] "poorer detection of <b>system</b> <b>malfunctions</b> under automation compared with under manual control." [...] NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) defines complacency as [...] "self-satisfaction that may result in non-vigilance based on an unjustified assumption of satisfactory system state." [...] Several studies have indicated that it occurs most often when operators are engaged in both manual and automated tasks at the same time. This complacency can be sharply reduced when automation reliability varies over time instead of remaining constant, but is not reduced by experience and practice. Both expert and inexpert participants can exhibit automation bias as well as automation complacency. Neither of these problems can be easily overcome by training.|$|E
