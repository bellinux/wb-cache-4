40|$|This {{presentation}} {{deals with}} a camera based <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> system for laser materials processing. The digital high speed camera records interaction point and illuminated work piece surface. The camera system is coaxially integrated into the laser beam path. The aim is to observe interaction point and joint gap in one image for a closed loop control of the welding process. Especially for the joint gap observation a new image processing method is used. Basic idea is to detect {{a difference between the}} textures of the surface of the two work pieces to be welded together instead of looking for a nearly invisible narrow line imaged by the joint gap. The texture based analysis of the work piece surface is more robust and less affected by varying illumination conditions than conventional grey scale image processing. This technique of image processing gives in some cases the opportunity for real zero gap <b>seam</b> <b>tracking.</b> In a condensed view economic benefits are simultaneous laser and <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> for self-calibrating laser welding applications without special seam pre preparation for <b>seam</b> <b>tracking...</b>|$|E

40|$|High {{flexibility}} and consistent high quality are key benefits of laser welding in production. However, high precision of welding trajectory and velocity are required; e. g. in butt welding {{the focal point}} of the laser beam with respect to the joint must be maintained with accuracy better than 50 - 100 microns, depending on the focused beam radius. To meet these requirements, <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> devices can be used. A sensor measures the joint position, usually 50 to 200 mm ahead of the welding position (TCP - Tool Center Point), and computes a correction vector to compensate the gap trajectory offset. However, the robot still needs to meet accuracy restrictions since the <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> control has to receive accurate on-line information about the TCP position from the robot. Furthermore, the time based <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> concept contains systematic error sources, which need to be hindered by pre-production sensor calibration. A new approach for <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> is introduced by an enhanced sensor concept, where both the ahead joint position and the relative velocity between the welding head and the workpiece - and therefore the relative TCP position - are measured by one camera based sensor. By carrying out the laser beam correction with a robot independent scanner system, <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> can be performed completely independent to the handling. This reduces cost in robot systems due to lower accuracy and output requirements, simplifies interfacing and installation and disengages from sensor calibration necessity...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} a simple and {{inexpensive}} yet flexible real time <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> system for automated fusion arc welding processes is ever increasing. To date, few techniques have been implemented in industry on a commercial basis, employing mostly thermovision devices, e. g. infrared vision cameras, infrared scanning radiometers, etc. or laser illuminated <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> systems.

One {{of the most}} common applications in robotics is welding, which is often limited to objects with fine tolerances. To be able to manage objects with relatively large tolerances, such as ship-hulls, sensor guided control systems have to be incorporated that are able to handle large deviations from the drawings. To be able to handle the complexity at the development of such intelligent autonomous systems, a new development environment for robot systems was designed in this work, called FUSE, that integrates software prototyping with virtual prototyping. By the application of FUSE and the methodology developed in this thesis, a <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> system for robotic arc welding based on arc sensing was developed and physically validated on-site at a shipyard in the European ROWER- 2 project.

40|$|The use of robotic {{laser welding}} is {{increasing}} among industrial applications, {{because of its}} ability to weld objects in three dimensions.

40|$|Laser {{beam welding}} {{applications}} {{are widely used}} in the industry. However, laser beam welding applications have a very small position tolerance to an offset. In this project, the offset {{is defined as the}} distance between the point, which the laser tool welds, and the point which laser tool should weld the weld joint. In other words, the offset is the position error in a welding application. To perform successful welding, the laser beam must hit the exact coordinate of the weld joints to weld the parts together. For dealing with these inaccuracy issues, tool manipulation systems can be used. In this project, an external axis is used for the precise manipulation of the laser beam welding tool as a complement to robotic nominal movement. Input data to the external axis system is obtained from an image from a vision system of the work pieces which need to be welded. Tool manipulation systems are used to manipulate tools to ensure certain position accuracy during any application. The tool manipulation system in this project has two main parts; a <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> system (outside this project) and an external axis system. The <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> system gives an on-line measurement of the offset, {{and that there is a}} feedback loop with a controller, which gives the system information about how much to manipulate the external axis module to the external axis system. The <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> system consists of two main parts; a camera and the <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> image processing program. In the <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> system, a camera takes images of the work pieces which shall be welded. Then the <b>seam</b> <b>tracking</b> program calculates the offset by image processing. This estimated offset is the input for the external axis system. The external axis system has three main parts; the external axis program, input-output module and the external axis module. The external axis program is the system which controls the input-output module for manipulating the external axis module in this project. The external axis module manipulates the laser beam welding tool by changing the orientation of the tool in order to reduce the offset. This project is about the external axis system. There is a relationship between the offset input and the required manipulation angle of the external axis. In this project, the required manipulation angle is the external axis angle. By using this relationship, the laser beam welding tool can be manipulated to weld in the desired position. The same system can be used in applications which require high position accuracy. The evaluation of the external axis system emphasizes that the accuracy demand of the laser beam welding applications can be satisfied by an external axis system. However, the investigated external axis system behaves in a way that when the offset is larger than it supposed to be, the speed of the TCP movement slows down...|$|E

The tracking sensor includes a camera and a structured laser. Rigid body motion and solid geometry are the base of tracking theory. For tracker alignment, eye-in-hand method based on relative movement of end-effector connected to a robot is proposed. It determines first the rotation then the translation. In addition, a simply method of calibrating the structured laser plan is given out. In Cartesian space, the position values of each feature point on the weld seam can be obtained though combining the parameters of camera and laser plane. Except the tracking algorithm, some image processing methods, such as mean-value, thinning and Hough transform, are used to improve the image quality and tracking accuracy.
