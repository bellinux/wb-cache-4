Dietary intake was evaluated using data from the 2006 – 7 cross-sectional INCA 2 national dietary survey (étude Individuelle Nationale sur les Consommations Alimentaires), based on a 7 d food record. Dietary intake (percentage of subjects consuming the food group and amount eaten) was assessed for thirty-nine food categories. We observed variations in food consumption by age, sex, North–South regional gradient, seasonal period and educational level of the responding parent. Trends in dietary intake between 1999 and 2007 were determined by comparing the INCA 1 (n 1126) and the INCA 2 surveys. Both surveys had been carried out using the same methodology.

The derivation of the word “sugar ” is thought to have been from Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature from India, written between 1500 - 500 B. C., provides the first documentation of the cultivation of sugar cane and manufacture of sugar in the Bengal region of India. The Sanskrit name for a crudely made sugar substance was guda, meaning “to make into a ball or to conglomerate. ” There was little mention made of the manufacturing process of sugar in early India, but 500 B. C., Indian writings referred to sugar cane being used as a vegetable, with the stalks being boiled into a pulpy mass. In an 800 B. C. Chinese writing, it was noted that sugar originally come from India. It was not until 325 B. C. that references to sugar were found with more frequency. From most indications, the Egyptians were the first to use modern methods to convert cane juice into sugar. Lime (calcium oxide) and albumen (egg white) removed the impurities from the pressed cane juice. The resulting liquid was then boiled, evaporating most of the water, and as the liquid was agitated, crystals of sugar formed. Lastly the residual molasses was washed from the crystals using water.

40|$|We {{show that}} <b>sweetening</b> of food <b>products</b> by natural {{fermentation}} {{can be achieved}} by a combined metabolic engineering and transcriptome analysis approach. A Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris strain was constructed in which glucose metabolism was completely disrupted by deletion of the genes coding for glucokinase (glk), EIIman/glc (ptnABCD), and the newly discovered glucose-PTS EIIcel (ptcBAC). After introducing the lactose metabolic genes, the deletion strain could solely ferment the galactose moiety of lactose, while the glucose moiety accumulated extracellularly. Additionally, less lactose remained in the medium after fermentation. The resulting strain can be used for in situ production of glucose, circumventing the need to add sweeteners as additional ingredients to dairy products. Moreover, the enhanced removal of lactose achieved by this strain could be very useful in the manufacture of products for lactose intolerant individuals. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} consumption of fruit juice as consumers have {{become aware of the}} nutritional and health benefits of fruit juices. This increased consumption goes together with the growth of varieties of fruit juices and beverages offered for sale. Among these products is roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) juice, or drink, which is a good source of anthocyanins, vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, ascorbic acid) and minerals (Ca, P, Fe). In addition, roselle is also used as flavouring for sauces, jellies, marmalades, soft drinks and as colorant for foods. Roselle extract has low sugar content, and is acidic, so addition of <b>sweetening</b> <b>products</b> like sugar or blending with tropical fruit juices can help to reduce the sourness and improve the sweetness of the juice. The use of roselle extract mixed with tropical fruit juices is also a way of reducing post-harvest losses of fruits which occurs due to lack of good knowledge in processing, preservation, packaging and proper transport systems in most developing countries like Tanzania. Blending of roselle extract with different proportion of tropical fruit juices (mango, papaya and guava) produces roselle-fruit juice blends with improved levels of anthocyanins, vitamin C, total phenolics/phenols, minerals (Ca, Mg, P, Fe and Zn). The amount of vitamin C and Fe were enough to provide recommended daily requirements for adults according to WHO/FAO recommendation while amount of anthocyanins provide enough to meet recommendation of 82 mg and 12. 5 mg per day per person in Finland and United States. The roselle-fruit juices found to be high in glucose and fructose. However, as the concentration of roselle extract in the blends increased, the amount of sugars also decreased. Organic acids (malic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid) increased also with increased concentration of roselle extract in the blends, while the amount of citric acidic increased with increased concentration of tropical fruit juices. The sensory evaluation of the roselle fruit juice blends resulted in the highest acceptance of the roselle-fruit juices with 20 % roselle followed by blends with 40 % roselle. This was probably due to the reduced acidic taste by adding these low concentrations of roselle to the tropical fruit juices. Colour play a very important role in the acceptability of foods as {{it is one of the}} principal characteristics perceived by the senses. The strong colour is due to the presence of anthocyanins in the roselle extract, which imparted the red colour in the blends. The colour of the roselle-fruit juice blends with 80 % roselle scored highest among all the sensory parameter evaluated. Storage temperature of the roselle-fruit juice blends showed to have high effect on the anthocyanin content, total phenolic content, vitamin C with significantly losses at higher temperatures. Lower temperature is therefore recommended for long-term storage. Packaging material did not have significant influence on the physicochemical properties of the roselle-mango juice blends. Losses in total monomeric anthocyanins, total phenols and vitamin C were higher in blends stored in plastic bottles compared to glass bottles in higher temperatures. Storage in glass bottles at lower temperatures is therefore recommended for storage of roselle-fruit juice blends...|$|R

The ideal sucrose concentration {{was determined to be}} 10. 1 % by an acceptance sensory test using just-about-right scales with 40 consumers. The required concentrations of selected sweeteners to achieve sweetness equivalent to the 10. 1 % sucrose, which was determined by magnitude estimation scales using 12 trained panelists, were 0. 0876 % for rebaudioside A, 0. 130 % for monk fruit extract, 15. 5 % for erythritol, 26. 7 % for lactitol, and 9. 53 % for xylitol. In addition to individual sweeteners, combinations were developed at a sweetness ratio of 50 / 50 using one sugar alcohol and one natural high-intensity sweetener. Thirteen attributes (initial sweetness, sweet aftertaste, long-lasting sweetness, initial sourness, sour aftertaste, long-lasting sourness, initial bitterness, bitter aftertaste, long-lasting bitterness, metallic taste, anise taste, viscosity, dryness) were utilized to describe sensory profiles of protein beverages sweetened with individual sweeteners or combinations of sweeteners. Compared to sucrose, x rebaudioside A and monk fruit extract had "off-flavors" (bitterness, metallic taste and anise taste), and showed differences in sweetness intensity and temporal profile. However, sugar alcohols (erythritol, lactitol, xylitol) covered the "off-flavors" in the beverages when used in combination with the natural high-potency sweeteners. Combining the high-potency sweeteners with sugar alcohols also improved the sweetness temporal profile, but the sweetness profile was stil...|$|R
2500|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed {{that it had a}} sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and {{can be used as a}} tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages, and chewing gum. [...] When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. [...] This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. [...] Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. [...] Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to <b>sweeten</b> a food <b>product,</b> and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.|$|R
