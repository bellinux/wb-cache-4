40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{reliable}} and harmonized information on methods for GMO (genetically modified organism) analysis we have published a database called “GMOMETHODS” that supplies information on PCR assays validated according to the principles and requirements of ISO 5725 and/or the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry protocol. In addition, the database contains methods that have been verified by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed {{in the context of}} compliance with an European Union legislative act. The web application provides search capabilities to retrieve primers and probes sequence information on the available methods. It further supplies core data required by analytical labs to carry out GM tests and comprises information on the applied reference material and plasmid standards. The GMOMETHODS database currently contains 118 different PCR methods allowing identification of 51 <b>single</b> <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> and 18 taxon-specific genes in a sample. It also provides screening assays for detection of eight different genetic elements commonly used for the development of GMOs. The application is referred to by the Biosafety Clearing House, a global mechanism set up by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to facilitate the exchange of information on Living Modified Organisms. The publication of the GMOMETHODS database can be considered an important step toward worldwide standardization and harmonization in GMO analysis. JRC. I. 3 -Molecular Biology and Genomic...|$|R

Generally, the molecular characteristics of <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> are incomprehensively revealed by current approaches and biased towards detecting transformation vector derived sequences. <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> are classified based on available knowledge of the sequences of vectors and inserts (insert knowledge).

The results were to be reported in GM mass/mass %. Eighty-one participants from 39 countries participated to this CT round, including 49 NRLs, of which 32 are designated in line with Regulation (EC) No 882 / 2004 (NRL/ 882) and 17 are nominated in Regulation (EU) No 120 / 2014 to support the EURL GMFF on method validation (NRL/ 120). The qualitative results, i. e. the correct identification of the <b>GM</b> <b>events,</b> were evaluated and scored correct or incorrect.

40|$|European Union (EU) {{legislation}} foresees {{that food}} and feed are labelled for their genetically modified organism (GMO) content when the ingredients contain authorised GMOs in a proportion higher than 0. 9 %. Non-authorised GMOs are not allowed on the EU market. Exception is made for feed materials containing traces of <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> lawfully placed {{on the market in}} non-EU countries and for which an authorisation is pending in the EU or expired: in these cases, a minimum required performance limit (MRPL) of 0. 1 % is applied. Considering that the number of GMOs placed on the EU market is constantly growing, laboratories need to expand their capacity accordingly to be able to identify and, if necessary, quantify any GM material. To this purpose, our laboratory had previously developed a multi-target ready-to-use system, also known as a pre-spotted plate (PSP), which allows the qualitative detection of up to 44 <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> in one <b>single</b> real-time (RTi) PCR experiment. Should any event be detected, the laboratory would proceed with its quantification. This study evaluates the possibility to use the data generated by the PSP system in a semi-quantitative manner, allowing a categorisation of the GM quantity in the sample. ΔCq values were calculated and modelled via linear regression to estimate limits indicating whether the GM content is (1) above, (2) below or (3) near a defined quantity and thus requires further quantification. Identifying the <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> present in a sample and simultaneously discriminating whether it needs or not further quantification would offer to testing laboratories a valuable gain in time and resources.

40|$|Since 2011, a new Commission Regulation (EU/ 619 / 2011) defines that {{laboratories}} {{testing for}} {{genetically modified organisms}} (GMO) {{need to be able}} to detect also genetically modified (<b>GM)</b> <b>events</b> pending for authorisation. This, in addition to the fact that the number of <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> authorised in the European Union (EU) that need to be identified multiplies rapidly and that the detection of unauthorised GMO becomes more important, led to the development of a time and cost-effective screening approach. Moreover, the GM elements that are utilised in the transgenic inserts also become increasingly diverse. Consequently, the screening approaches have to be updated to enable full coverage and better discrimination of all these events. To respond to this need, two new qualitative SYBR®Green real-time PCR (qPCR) methods were developed and in-house validated: one method is element-specific and targets the Cry 3 Bb trait, and the other one is a construct-specific method detecting the gat-tpinII junction. Method acceptance parameters such as the sensitivity, specificity and repeatability were assessed as well as the robustness of the methods. Additionally, the reproducibility was evaluated by transferring the methods to a second laboratory. Both methods allow a specific, sensitive and repeatable detection of the respective targets in food and feed samples and can be easily applied in a routine laboratory. Moreover, they can be used together with previously validated SYBR®Green qPCR methods to expand the panel of screening methods.

40|$|Background: The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) is {{the current state of}} the art technique for DNA-based detection of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). A typical control strategy starts by analyzing a sample for the presence of target sequences (GM-elements) known to be present in many GMOs. Positive findings from this “screening” are then confirmed with <b>GM</b> (<b>event)</b> specific test methods. A reliable knowledge of which GMOs are detected by combination of GM-detection methods is thus crucial to minimize the verification efforts. Description: In this article, we describe a novel platform that links the information of two unique databases built and maintained by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed (EU-RL GMFF) at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, one containing the sequence information of known GM-events and the other validated PCR-based detection and identification methods. The new platform compiles in silico determinations of the detection of a wide range of GMOs by the available detection methods using existing scripts that simulate PCR amplification and, when present, probe binding. The correctness of the information has been verified by comparing the in silico conclusions to experimental results for a subset of forty-nine <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> and six methods. Conclusions: The JRC GMO-Matrix is unique for its reliance on DNA sequence data and its flexibility in integrating novel GMOs and new detection methods.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} covers three {{topics of}} importance for international trade policy. It consists of three independent essays {{in the area of}} trade in biotechnology and regionalization of a disease outbreak. Essay one, through utilization of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), contributes to the literature by providing a global measurement on the effect that the expanding genetically modified (GM) pipeline has on international trade given the constraint of asynchronous regulations for a new <b>GM</b> <b>event</b> among countries. The model measures the effect of the GM global pipeline on international trade flows between countries, and the effect on trade flows between countries given the unintended presence of <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> in the export of non-GM crops. These measurements are achieved through the development of five simulations for the following agriculture goods: maize, soybeans, canola, wheat and rice. The simulation results indicate that asynchronicity does affect trade flows on a global level. However, society is better off overall with additional <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> on the market, even when asynchronicity is present and large, as the increase in trade flow is greater from the new <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> than the reduction in trade flow caused by asynchronicity. Essay two, through the application of a real options model, evaluates the investment risk for a biotechnology firm that aspires to enter a highly regulated European Union (EU) market for genetically modified products. The regulatory (political) risk is captured as uncertainty that can influence the optimal decision of the investment firm. The findings in this thesis indicate that the presence of political factors in the EU decision process for approving new GM varieties influences the exporter’s decision who wants to export a safe GM product into the EU market. As result exporter postpones their decision to enter the EU market into the future and reduces the level of sunk cost they are willing to invest to enter the market. However, continually postponing the investment into the future can lead to the investment never occurring. The final outcome is that the presence of political factors in the decision approval process slows the growth of the biotechnology industry and constrains the accessibility of this technology for developing countries. Essay three, through an application of a partial equilibrium model, analyses the regionalization concept accounting for the incentive for commercial and casual smuggling. The essay evaluates the model with the risk of being caught and the risk of not being caught. If there is no risk of being caught the incentive to smuggle will exist as long as the price minus the smuggling costs in the non-infected area exceeds that of the infected area. If we consider the risk of being caught and fined by the governing authorities, then the incentive to smuggle will depend on the probability of being caught. The higher the probability of being caught the lower the incentive for smuggling will be, given the losses in revenue in the non-infected market and the additional cost of being fined. Casual smuggling depends on the distance the consumer has to travel to the low priced region, the cost of transportation and the easiness of avoiding the authorities. Two policies were discussed in this essay: price support, and enforcement and punishment that were applied to commercial smuggling with and without risk, and to casual smuggling. Price support was evaluated as a more appropriate policy as it is difficult to estimate the appropriate level of enforcement and punishment under that type of policy that would bring smuggling to zero...|$|R
40|$|A rapid on-, or near-site, {{quantitative}} {{method for}} use as a pre-harvest predictive decision tool for adventitious genetically modified (GM) presence (AGMP) has been developed. Based on a laboratory-based protocol for real-time (RT) quantification of the MON 810 <b>GM</b> <b>event</b> in maize kernels, the duplex RT polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was constructed around the portable Cepheid SmartCyclerII platform, requiring only modest support infrastructure for field application. Pre-validation through an international ring trial showed good compliance with minimum assay performance requirements as defined by the European Network of GMO Laboratories (RSDr = 18. 5 %; RSDR = 32. 8; Bias = 26. 7 %).

50|$|Zora joined General Motors in 1953 {{after seeing}} the Motorama Corvette on display in New York City. Perhaps it was just fate that Zora {{happened}} {{to be among the}} thousands of people who attended the <b>GM</b> <b>event.</b> Zora found the car to be visually superb, but was disappointed with what was underneath. He wrote Chevrolet chief engineer Ed Cole that it would be his complement to work on such a beautiful car; he also included a technical paper which proposed an analytical method of determining a car's top speed. Chevrolet was so impressed that engineer Maurice Olley invited him to come to Detroit. On May 1, 1953, Zora Arkus-Duntov started at Chevrolet as an assistant staff engineer.|$|R
40|$|Genes expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins {{have been}} {{incorporated}} into genetically modified (GM) plants to render these resistant to certain insect pests. Of particular interest have been the genes encoding Cry (Crystal) proteins, but also the gene encoding the vegetative insecticidal protein Vip 3 Aa has {{been incorporated into}} crop plants. Over the last decennium, <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> have been crossed through traditional breeding, resulting in stacked <b>GM</b> <b>events</b> expressing several Bt insect resistance genes. Experiments demonstrate that interactions between two or more toxins can either enhance or decrease their activity. It is thus possible that interactions between Bt proteins produced by GM plants occur and thereby influence their effect on non-target invertebrates compared to GM plants expressing just a single Bt gene. This report has been drafted {{as a response to}} a call of the Netherlands Commission of Genetic Modification (COGEM) to address two main questions: (1) can interactions between Bt proteins be predicted and (2) to what extent are studies on interactions relevant for risk/safety assessment of GM crops. The questions were tackled from an eco-toxicological angle, in particular taking into account those types of information that are relevant for risk/safety assessment of GM crops. Answering the questions was done by reviewing and considering the current knowledge on the specificity of Bt proteins, on known interactions between Bt proteins and the methods to assess these interactions, and available guidance for risk/safety assessment of GM crops combining multiple Bt proteins. Also the information reviewed in a parallel project addressing the same questions, but from a biochemical and toxicological perspective (Eco¿tat, 2014), was taken into account when formulating conclusions...|$|R
