40|$|Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia  L.) is an {{increasingly}} popular tree species {{for the production}} of woody biomass for bioenergy generation with <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppices.</b> Due to its potential to produce large amounts of biomass yields even under unfavourable growth conditions, this tree species is especially suitable for marginal sites, such as {{can be found in the}} post mining area of NE-Germany. Current research aims to reliably predict the yield potential of black locust <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppices,</b> but suffers from a lack of sufficient exact allometric functions until recently. This is especially true for the early growth years, which are of special importance for <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppices.</b> The objective of this study was to develop allometric equations based on tree height and shoot basal diameter (SBD) for estimating yields of young black locust plantations. Therefore, dendrometric data were collected in a two, three, four and fourteen years old black locust <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> forest located in the reclamation area of an opencast-lignite mining area in the Lower Lusatian region (Germany) and used for equation developing. Until measurement, none of the plantations had been harvested. Closed correlations between SBD and tree height were observed, as well as between these parameters and single tree mass. The scattering of single tree masses could be explained slightly better by the SBD than by the tree height. In the year before a harvest an even better prediction probability of woody biomass was obtainable when both parameters were simultaneously interrelated with the single tree mass. The results illustrate that the woody above ground biomass of young black locust plantations can be estimated sufficiently precisely based on the easy determinable parameters tree height and particularly SBD. </span...|$|R

The methodology was developed for a study area surrounding Nethercleuch, Lockerbie in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. This is the largest biomass conversion plant in the UK and it is set to open near Lockerbie later in the year, this study investigates the potential for sourcing dedicated energy crops locally. This research presents a GIS-based methodology to locate the suitable areas for growing <b>Short</b> <b>Rotation</b> <b>Coppice</b> willow crops in Scotland by using cell-based multi-criteria evaluation.

40|$|A 7. 1 ha {{agroforestry}} {{field experiment}} located in south-western Germany demonstrates, how to combine <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppicing</b> for fuel wood production with poultry {{keeping with the}} production of eggs. This combined system offers additional ecosystem services and gives multifarious benefits. The agroforestry system has been established since 2009 by an organic farmer (certified) in close cooperation with the University of Applied Forest Sciences Rottenburg. While changing from indoor to outdoor housing required {{by the standards of}} organic farming the owner of the farmland wanted to meet not only with the standards, but additionally he wanted to fulfill objectives like: * Raising and keeping hens in a close-to–nature environment, * Finding a way, that hens exploit all the terrain available and not only those areas close to the chicken-coop, * Improving the conditions of the vegetation, soil and hygiene of the hens. The agroforestry system has been implemented based on two components: The first component consists of the construction of mobile chicken-coops (patent of the farmer). The mobile coops can be moved in their position over the experimental plots several times per year without much effort. The second component consists of strips of willows and poplars, which are managed by <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppicing.</b> Trees are harvested every 4 to 7 years and will be marketed as woodchips for energy production. The rootstocks will sprout again after harvesting. The trees offer several additional services in the agroforestry system: * Protection of the hens against hawks, sun and wind (animal health and survival) * Production of renewable resources (renewable energy) * Absorption of nitrogen from the excrements (nutrient cycling in the ecosystem) * Field integration into the country side (aesthetics and landscape planning) The whole experimental field was subdivided into 18 tracts of 0. 4 ha. Strips of willow and poplar trees have been established along the tracts. Between the tree strips there is enough space for moving the mobile chicken-coops. Every chicken-coop offers space for 1000 – 1200 hens. In total six coops are installed on the experimental field. The establishment of the trees and the selection of appropriate tree species and provenances have been difficult due to challenging site conditions and standards of organic farming: shallow soil depths, a high clay content and the prohibition of herbicides. Different techniques of non-herbicide-establishment of the <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppicing</b> system have been tested during the last years. For instance the use of mulch foil has emerged as the essential factor for a successful establishment and reduced mortality of trees under such difficult soil conditions. Willows and poplars helped quickly to create a structured field already after two years setting up the agroforestry experiment. In addition the hens indeed use the whole area for grazing and pawing. However the main aim of the adding trees to poultry keeping for egg production is not raising the financial yield with the fuel wood production, but the keeping of the hens in a close-to-nature environment...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} characterization {{was carried}} out on various biomass samples representative of the diversity in France, including forestry samples (softwood and hardwood woodchips, eucalyptus and poplar <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppices),</b> very <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppices</b> (VSRC) samples and agricultural samples (wheat straw, triticale, fescue, miscanthus and switchgrass). The following properties were measured to evaluate suitability with thermochemical process: elemental analysis (C, H, O, N, S, and Cl), chemical composition (extractives, lignin, mono/polysaccharides, acetate groups), ash content and inorganic composition. Carbon and hydrogen contents are quite similar between biomasses. Agricultural biomasses are usually less oxygenated than forestry biomasses. Nitrogen content is generally higher for agricultural biomasses (up to 1. 4 %) than for forestry biomasses, but important amount {{is also found in}} VSRC (0. 8 % for poplar). Chlorine and sulfur are species-dependent. Fescue and eucalyptus show high values of Cl, while wheat straw has the highest sulfur content. Ash content is very low for forestry and perennial biomasses (miscanthus and switchgrass). For non-perennial crops, values up to 8. 5 % (wheat straw) were measured. Agricultural biomasses contains more silicon (2 % for triticale), magnesium (0. 16 % for fescue), potassium (1. 9 % for fescue) and phosphorus (0. 18 % for fescue), while forestry biomasses are richer in calcium (up to 0. 97 % for poplar VSRC). Other inorganic elements, especially heavy metals are present in very low concentrations {{and most of the time}} below detection limits. Regarding chemical composition, extractive content is very high (20 – 25 %) for non-perennial crops (fescue, wheat straw and triticale) and eucalyptus VSRC. Lignin content seems to be higher for forestry biomasses (21 – 29 %) than for agricultural biomasses (16 – 23 %). The same trend was observed for cellulose, while the opposite was observed for hemicelluloses. These differences in organic and inorganic composition are expected to significantly impact the behavior of these biomasses in thermochemical processes such as gasification for biofuels production.

40|$|Dioecious {{plants can}} be used as model systems for {{studying}} how variation in host plants affects plant-insect interactions. This thesis describes investigations into the impact of plant sex on plant-herbivore-predator interactions for the host plant Salix cinerea. Both herbivores and predators were found to prefer female plants, all other things being equal. As a result, top-down control had a more significant impact on the herbivore population on female plants than was the case for males. Despite this, Phratora beetles were more abundant on, and preferred, female plants. This may be due to bottom-up control, since female plants have longer leaves. Both herbivores and biocontrol agents were more abundant on female plants in the field. Because of predation by omnivores, survival rates for herbivore eggs on female plants were lower than those for male plants, and omnivore predation was the primary cause of death among herbivore eggs.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the sequestration and emissions of forests and algae related to CO 2 while providing a comparison to other biomass sources (arable crops, <b>short</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>coppices).</b> The {{goal of the}} paper is to analyze {{the impact of the}} current CO 2 balance of forests and the future prospects for algae. Our calculations are based on data, not only from the literature but, in the case of algae, from our own previous experimental work. It was concluded that the CO 2 sequestration and natural gas saving of forests is typically 3. 78 times higher than the emissions resulting from the production technology and from the burning process. The economic and environmental protection-related efficiency operate in opposite directions. The CO 2 sequestration ability of algae can primarily be utilized when connected to power plants.

This paper introduces a way to model spatio-temporal dynamics of biomass production at a regional scale in order to derive land use strategies that enhance biomass provision and avoid trade-offs for other ecosystem services. The software platform GISCAME was employed {{to bridge the gap between}} local land management decisions and regional planning by linking growth and yield models with an integrative mesoscale modeling and assessment approach. The model region is located in Saxony, Germany. Five scenarios were simulated, which aimed at testing different alternatives for adapted land use in the context of climate change and increasing biomass demand.
