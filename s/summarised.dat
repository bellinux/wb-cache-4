40|$|This paper reviews {{research}} on automatic <b>summarising</b> {{in the last}} decade. This work has grown, stimulated by technology and by evaluation programmes. The paper uses several frameworks to organise the review, for <b>summarising</b> itself, for the factors affecting <b>summarising,</b> for systems, and for evaluation. The review examines the evaluation strategies applied to <b>summarising,</b> the issues they raise, and the major programmes. It considers the input, purpose and output factors investigated in recent <b>summarising</b> research, and discusses the classes of strategy, extractive and non-extractive, that have been explored, illustrating the range of systems built. The conclusions drawn are that automatic summarisation has made valuable progress, with useful applications, better evaluation, and more task understanding. But <b>summarising</b> systems are still poorly motivated {{in relation to the}} factors affecting them, and evaluation needs taking much further to engage with the purposes summaries are intended to serve and the contexts in which they are used. 1 Automatic summarising: the state of the art...|$|R

40|$|This {{position}} paper suggests that progress with automatic <b>summarising</b> demands a better research methodology and a carefully focussed research strategy. In {{order to develop}} effective procedures {{it is necessary to}} identify and respond to the context factors, i. e. input, purpose, and output factors, that bear on <b>summarising</b> and its evaluation. The paper analyses and illustrates these factors and their implications for evaluation. It then argues that this analysis, together with {{the state of the art}} and the intrinsic difficulty of <b>summarising,</b> imply a nearer-term strategy concentrating on shallow, but not surface, text analysis and on indicative <b>summarising.</b> This is illustrated with current work, from which a potentially productive research programme can be developed...|$|R

5|$|The {{story of}} Troilus' romance {{developed}} {{within the context}} of the male-centred conventions of courtly love and thus the focus of sympathy was to be Troilus and not his beloved. As different authors recreated the romance, they would interpret it in ways affected both by the perspectives of their own times and their individual preoccupations. The story as it would later develop through the works of Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare is <b>summarised</b> below.|$|E
5|$|Canon William Lummis, MC, was a {{military}} historian who built up an archive on the service records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders.

However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in his work and encouraged David Harvey to continue it. The result was Harvey's seminal book Monuments to Courage. In 2007 the Royal Mail used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross recipients.|$|E

Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E
