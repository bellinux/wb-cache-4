25|$|While Dietl's {{units were}} halted by heavy Soviet resistance, the supply {{situation}} for Mountain Corps Norway deteriorated rapidly. Soviet and British naval forces harassed German supply shipments along the Norwegian coast, weakening the Germans further. Any attempt {{to renew the}} offensive failed, instead the Soviets were able to clear the German bridgehead east of the Litsa River and on 21 September the operation came to a halt. Mountain Corps Norway was now ordered to defend the front line and secure the Petsamo area and its nickel-mines, as a renewed offensive was ruled out. Both sides now dug in at their current positions. For {{the remainder of the}} war, the northern front was to remain relatively stable until the Soviet offensive of 1944, with only small scale <b>ski</b> <b>patrol</b> skirmishes occurring.|$|E

500|$|In November 1939, {{during the}} Soviet Union's {{invasion}} of Finland, Russian efforts were frustrated following {{the destruction of}} two armored divisions by Finnish soldiers on skis. The conflict caught global attention as the outnumbered and outgunned Finnish soldiers {{were able to use}} the difficult local terrain to their advantage, severely hampering the Soviet attacks and embarrassing their military. Upon seeing the effectiveness of these troops, Charles Minot Dole, the president of the National <b>Ski</b> <b>Patrol,</b> began to lobby the War Department of the need for a similar unit of troops in the United States Army, trained for fighting in winter and mountain warfare. In September 1940, Dole was able to present his case to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, who agreed with Dole's assessment, deciding to create a [...] "Mountain" [...] unit for fighting in harsh terrain. The U.S. Army authorized the formation of the platoon sized Army <b>Ski</b> <b>Patrol</b> in November 1940. The first Patrol was formed at Camp Murray as part of the 41st Infantry Division under Lt. Ralph S. Phelps (later to become commanding General of the 41st). The army, prompted by fears that its standing force would not perform well {{in the event of a}} winter attack on the Northeastern coast, as well as knowledge that the German Army already had three mountain warfare divisions, approved the concept for a division. This required an overhaul of U.S. military doctrine, as the concept of winter warfare had not been tested in the army since 1914. At first, planners envisioned ten mountain divisions, but personnel shortages revised the goal to three. Eventually, the 10th Mountain Division would be the only one brought to active duty. Military leaders continued to express concern of the feasibility of a division-sized mountain warfare unit until the fall of 1941, when they received reports that Greek mountain troops had held back superior numbers of unprepared Italian troops in the Albanian mountains during the Greco-Italian War. The Italian military had lost a disastrous 25,000 men in the campaign because of their lack of preparedness to fight in the mountains. On 22 October 1941, General Marshall decided to form the first battalion of mountain warfare troops for a new mountain division. The <b>Ski</b> <b>Patrol</b> would assist in its training.|$|E
500|$|On 8 December 1941, the {{day after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the army {{activated}} its first mountain unit, the 87th Mountain Infantry Battalion (which was later expanded to the 87th Infantry Regiment) at Fort Lewis, Washington, south of Tacoma. It was the first mountain warfare unit in U.S. military history. The National <b>Ski</b> <b>Patrol</b> took on the unique role of recruiting for the 87th Infantry Regiment and later the division, becoming the only civilian recruiting agency in military history. Army planners favored recruiting experienced skiers for the unit instead of trying to train standing troops in mountain warfare, so Dole recruited from schools, universities and ski clubs for the unit. The 87th trained in harsh conditions, including Mount Rainier's [...] peak, throughout 1942 as more recruits were brought in to form the division. Initial training was conducted by Olympian Rolf Monsen. A new garrison was built for the division in central Colorado at Camp Hale, at an elevation of [...] above sea level. The U.S. Army Mountain Warfare School was eventually established at nearby Camp Carson in late 1942, and began to oversee mountain warfare training.|$|E
2500|$|Williams is a small, {{four-year}} {{liberal arts}} college accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. There are three academic curricular divisions (humanities, sciences, and social sciences), 24 departments, 35 majors, and two small master's degree programs in art history and development economics. Students may also concentrate in 12 additional academic areas that are not offered as majors (e.g., environmental studies). The academic year follows a 4–1–4 schedule of two four-course semesters plus a one-course [...] "winter study" [...] term in January. During the winter study term, students study one of various courses outside of typical curriculum for 3 weeks. Students typically take this course on a pass/fail basis.

Organized rescue involves <b>ski</b> <b>patrols</b> and mountain rescue teams who are often equipped with other technologies to search for buried victims. Rescue equipment can make a difference, and in 2010 the French National Association for the Study of Snow and Avalanches (ANENA) recommended that all off-piste skiers should carry beacons, probes, shovels, and Recco reflectors.|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{the devastating}} damage, Tarmo had not {{developed}} any leaks following the bombing. Furthermore, her boilers and stern engine were intact, and by 8 February her bow engine was running again as well. The damaged steel structures were cut at tweendeck {{level and the}} 120mm deck guns were removed. On 9 February Tarmo left for Helsinki for further repairs under her own power. However, as the wheelhouse had been destroyed, the helmsman was stationed in the aft engine room and the commands were shouted through the skylight. Due to the ever-present danger of Soviet airstrikes, Tarmo moved only at night and spent the days camouflaged. Since the navigational aids could not be lit up during the war, a <b>ski</b> <b>patrol</b> moved {{in front of the}} icebreaker and used flashlights and tree branches to guide the ship through the archipelago. Tarmo arrived at Hietalahti shipyard on 10 February.

2500|$|Some {{emergency}} medical technicians, known as Wilderness Emergency Medical Technicians (WEMTs), are trained with protocols adapted for the non-urban, backcountry environments (remote, austere, or resource-deficient areas). Not formally {{referred to as}} such, wilderness EMS-like systems (WEMS) {{have been developed to}} deliver standardization and professionalism to medical responses and education in the wilderness arena. Examples include the international safety organization, the National <b>Ski</b> <b>Patrol</b> or the regional-responding Appalachian Search and Rescue Conference (USA based). Like traditional EMS providers, all wilderness {{emergency medical}} (WEM) providers must still operate under on-line or off-line medical oversight. To assist physicians in the skills necessary to provide this oversight, the Wilderness Medical Society and the National Association of EMS Physicians jointly supported the development in 2011 of a unique [...] "Wilderness EMS Medical Director" [...] certification course, which was cited by the Journal of EMS as one of the Top 10 EMS Innovations of 2011. Skills taught in WEMT courses exceeding the EMT-Basic scope of practice include catheterization, antibiotic administration, use of intermediate Blind Insertion Airway Devices (i.e. [...] King Laryngeal Tube), [...] Nasogastric Intubation, and simple suturing; [...] however, the scope of practice for the WEMT still falls under BLS level care.
