5|$|The Fisher Grade classifies the {{appearance}} of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> on CT scan.|$|E
5|$|Dissecting aneurysms of the {{vertebral}} artery constitute 4% of all cerebral aneurysms, and are hence a relatively rare but important cause of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electrocardiographic {{changes are}} {{relatively}} common in <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> occurring in 40–70 percent of cases. They may include QT prolongation, Q waves, cardiac dysrhythmias, and ST elevation that mimics a heart attack.|$|E
50|$|Levetiracetam is {{sometimes}} used off-label to treat status epilepticus or to prevent seizures associated with <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Brain contusions and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> are {{commonly}} associated with IVH. [...] The bleeding can involve the anterior communicating artery or the posterior communicating artery.|$|R
50|$|Epidural, subdural, and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> are extra-axial bleeds, {{occurring}} {{outside of}} the brain tissue, while intra-axial hemorrhages, including intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhages, occur within it.|$|R
5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. <b>Subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage).</b> This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 {{percent of people who}} have had a <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{absence of}} {{internal}} carotid artery is a relatively rare disorder. It may be an isolated entity or combined with other organ or system anomalies. Investigations of a 19 -year-old male patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypothyroidism suffering from intracere-bral and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> showed absence of the left {{internal carotid artery}}. The association of endocrinologic disorders and congenital absence of internal carotid artery is discussed with the pertinent literature. In conclusion, association {{of the absence of}} internal carotid artery and hypogonadism is extremely rare. Patients with absence of internal carotid artery may also have intracerebral and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> and should be followed up closely...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} medical {{interest}} in the prediction of the flow and forces inside cerebral aneurysms [24, 52], with {{the ultimate goal of}} supporting medical procedures and decisions by presenting viable scenarios for intervention. The clinical background of intracranial aneurysms and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> is well introduced in the literature such a...|$|R
30|$|During a 1 -year period, 30 {{patients}} required EVD {{because of}} intraventricular hemorrhage {{with a variety}} of causes: <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> by aneurysm rupture (n = 20), parenchymal hematoma (n = 6), operated tumors (n = 3), and severe brain trauma (n = 1). Patients' mean age was 46 (range, 44 - 52) years, and they presented with a mean SAPSII of 42 (range, 34 - 49) at admission. Four patients died during the study of causes related to the severity of their intracranial vascular pathology. During the same period of time, we also tested CSF samples obtained by lumbar puncture from patients with suspected infection a mean of 8 (range, 7 - 12) days after trauma or surgery (n = 2 <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> by aneurysm rupture, n = 1 parenchyma hematoma, n = 5 operated tumors, and n = 6 severe brain trauma).|$|R
5|$|Screening for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; {{because they are}} relatively rare, {{it would not be}} cost-effective. If someone has two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> screening may be worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|While thunderclap {{headache}} is {{the characteristic}} symptom of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> less than 10% {{of those with}} concerning symptoms have SAH on investigations. A number of other causes {{may need to be}} considered.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the symptoms, for example the combination of headache, signs of raised intracranial pressure and focal neurological abnormalities, or when alternative causes of headache and neurological abnormalities, such as a <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> have been excluded.|$|E
50|$|As first {{postulated}} by Harvey Cushing, raised {{intracranial pressure}} {{is the primary}} cause of the Cushing reflex. Furthermore, continued moderate increases in cranial pressure allows for the Cushing reflex to occur. In contrast, rapid and dramatic pressure rises do not allow for the mechanism of the reflex to sufficiently take place. Elevated intracranial pressure can result from numerous pathways of brain impairment, including: <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages,</b> ischemia, trauma, including concussions, hypoxia, tumors, and stroke. In one study, it was confirmed that raised ICP due to <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhaging</b> causes mechanical distortion of the brainstem, specifically the medulla. Due to the mechanism of the Cushing reflex, brainstem distortion is then swiftly followed by sympathetic nervous system over activity. In addition, during typical neurosurgical procedures on patients, especially those involving neuroendoscopic techniques, frequent washing of the ventricles have been known to cause high intracranial pressure. The Cushing reflex can also result from low CPP, specifically below 15 mmHg. CPP normally falls between 70-90 mmHg in an adult human, and 60-90 mmHg in children.|$|R
40|$|A case of {{cerebral}} {{venous thrombosis}} with intraparenchymal and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> was initially treated unsuccessfully with mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis using intrathrombus {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (tPA) and angioplasty, and later successfully treated with an intravascular ultrasound tPA infusion catheter. This new microcatheter allowed direct infusion of tPA while using local therapeutic intravascular ultrasound to increase the thrombolytic effect. Flow was quickly restored. Our patient recovered from coma to discharge home without worsening of existing hemorrhages...|$|R
30|$|Also, (Sgubin et al. 2007) showed up-regulation of {{expression}} {{a variety of}} stem/progenitor cell markers, including Sox 2 and Musashi 2, in brain tissue from 4 human patients with <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> from ruptured aneurysms, and, using immunostains, demonstrated a correlation between Musashi 2 -immunopositive cells and Ki 67 -immunopositive cells. Their findings also suggest that neural stem cells and progenitor cells respond to brain injuries by migration to as well as proliferation in the site(s) of injury.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{steps for}} {{evaluating}} {{a person with}} a suspected <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination. The diagnosis cannot, however, be made on clinical grounds alone and in general medical imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture is required to confirm or exclude bleeding.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a review}} of 51 studies from 21 countries, the average {{incidence}} of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is 9.1 per 100,000 annually. Studies from Japan and Finland show higher rates in those countries (22.7 and 19.7, respectively), {{for reasons that are}} not entirely understood. South and Central America, in contrast, have a rate of 4.2 per 100,000 on average.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissection}} of {{the artery}} {{extends to the}} part of the artery that lies inside the skull, <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture of the artery and accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space. It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{research}} suggesting Klinefelter syndrome substantially decreases {{life expectancy}} among affected individuals, though {{the evidence is}} not definitive. [...] A 1985 publication identified a greater mortality mainly due to diseases of the aortic valve, development of tumors and possible <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages,</b> reducing life expectancy by about 5 years. [...] Later studies have reduced this estimated reduction {{to an average of}} 2.1 years. [...] These results are still questioned data, are not absolute, and will need further testing.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRothia dentocariosa {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} endocarditis. It occurs most {{frequently}} in patients with prior heart conditions. Although the clinical course is typically subacute, it has {{a high rate of}} complications. In particular, the reported incidence of mycotic aneurysms is as high as 25 %. Penicillin is the treatment of choice, but additional complications may necessitate prompt surgical intervention. As far as we know, this paper reports the first case of repeated <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> due to R. dentocariosa endocarditis...|$|R
40|$|The {{associations}} of dietary folate, vitamin B 6, vitamin B 12, and methionine intakes with risk of stroke subtypes were examined among 26, 556 male Finnish smokers, aged 50 – 69 years, {{enrolled in the}} Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline by using a validated food frequency questionnaire. During a mean follow-up of 13. 6 years, from 1985 through 2004, 2, 702 cerebral infarctions, 383 intracerebral <b>hemorrhages,</b> and 196 <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> were identified from national registers. In analy-ses adjusting for age and cardiovascular risk factors, a high folate intake {{was associated with a}} statistically significant lower risk of cerebral infarction but not intracerebral or <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> The multivariate relative risk of cerebral infarction was 0. 80 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 70, 0. 91; ptrend 0. 001) for men in the highest versus lowest quintile of folate intake. Vitamin B 6, vitamin B 12, and methionine intakes were not significantly associated with any subtype of stroke. These findings in men suggest that a high dietary folate intake may reduce the risk of cerebral infarction. cerebral infarction; diet; folic acid; methionine; stroke; vitamin B 6; vitamin B 12 Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HDL, high density lipoprotein; ICD, International Classification of Diseases.

5|$|<b>Subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (SAH) is {{bleeding}} {{into the}} subarachnoid space — {{the area between}} the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In {{about a quarter of}} people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> {{may also}} occur {{in people who}} have had a head injury. Symptoms may include headache, {{decreased}} level of consciousness and hemiparesis (weakness of one side of the body). SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury, and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is confirmed, {{its origin}} {{needs to be}} determined. If the {{bleeding}} {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E
50|$|If {{administered}} {{within a}} specific timeframe in experiments with erythropoietin in central nervous system, Epo has a favorable response in brain and spinal cord injuries like mechanical trauma or <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> Research also demonstrates a therapeutic role in modulating neuronal excitability and acting as a trophic factor both in vivo and in vitro. This administration of erythropoietin functions by inhibiting the apoptosis of sensor and motor neurons via stimulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic metabolic paths. The action of erythropoietin on Schwann cells and inflammatory response after neurological trauma also points to initial stimulation of nerve regeneration after peripheral nerve injury.|$|R
40|$|Intracranial {{vertebral}} artery dissection (VAD) represents the underlying etiology {{in a significant}} percentage of posterior circulation ischemic strokes and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> These lesions are particularly challenging in their diag-nosis, management, and in the prediction of long-term outcome. Advances in the understanding of underlying processes leading to dissection, as well as the evolution of modern imaging tech-niques are discussed. The data pertaining to med-ical management of intracranial VADs, with em-phasis on anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, is reviewed. Surgical intervention is discussed, in-cluding, the selection of operative candidates, open and endovascular procedures, and potential complications. The evolution of endovascular technology and techniques is highlighted...|$|R

Stroke care is provided via a team-based approach with teams composed of vascular neurologists, neurointerventionalists, neurosurgeons, intensivists, neuroradiologists, physiatrists, and other specialists as determined by patient requirements. GW hospital houses an acute rehabilitation unit, thus allowing stroke victims to receive all of their care in one location. GW Hospital is one of only two hospitals in Washington DC to carry the distinction of a Certified Comprehensive Stroke Center.|$|R
5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (<b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage),</b> there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
40|$|Because {{a history}} of shaking is often lacking in the {{so-called}} “shaken baby syndrome,” diagnosis is usually based on a constellation of clinical and radiographic findings. Forty-eight cases of infants and young children with this diagnosis seen between 1978 and 1985 at the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital of Philadelphia were reviewed. All patients had a presenting history thought to be suspicious for child abuse, and either retinal hemorrhages with subdural or <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> or a computerized tomography scan showing subdural or <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> with interhemispheric blood. The physical examination and presence of associated trauma were analyzed; autopsy findings for the 13 fatalities were reviewed. All fatal cases had signs of blunt impact to the head, although {{in more than half}} of them these findings were noted only at autopsy. All deaths were associated with uncontrollably increased intracranial pressure. Models of 1 -month-old infants with various neck and skull parameters were instrumented with accelerometers and shaken and impacted against padded or unpadded surfaces. Angular accelerations for shakes were smaller than those for impacts by a factor of 50. All shakes fell below injury thresholds established for subhuman primates scaled for the same brain mass, while impacts spanned concussion, subdural hematoma, and diffuse axonal injury ranges. It was concluded that severe head injuries commonly diagnosed as shaking injuries require impact to occur and that shaking alone in an otherwise normal baby is unlikely to cause the shaken baby syndrome...|$|R

Neurologic problems occurred in 48 %; the majority involved seizures, mental status changes, or coma. Patients who only had seizures generally had negative CT scans, except for two patients with minimal <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> Three-quarters of the comatose patients, however, had significant intracerebral hemorrhages defined by CT.
