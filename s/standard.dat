40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{the plan for}} establishing the SISO <b>Standards</b> Landscape. The <b>Standards</b> Landscape {{is to establish a}} framework that articulates the M&S <b>standards</b> that currently exist, relationships among the <b>standards,</b> user guidance on which <b>standards</b> best apply to different situations, where users can obtain the <b>standards,</b> and identifies areas where <b>standards</b> are needed but do not exist. The challenge is to develop an inter-view of <b>standards</b> that illustrates integrated <b>standards</b> within a meaningful framework of the <b>Standards</b> Landscape. The <b>Standards</b> Landscape portrays how <b>standards</b> work together to contribute to the interoperability and reuse to that enables organizations to achieve their return on investment (ROI) by increasing quality and productivity while reducing schedule and cost. This paper {{presents the}} plan to do just that. Further this paper describes how to apply quality attributes of the <b>Standards</b> Landscape to help communicate, through example, the need for a compelling and integrated view of <b>standards.</b> 1...|$|R
