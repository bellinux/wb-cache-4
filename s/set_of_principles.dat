5|$|Following the {{structure}} of the Botanical Code the Cultivated Plant Code is set out {{in the form of an}} initial <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principles</b> followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the Cultivated Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for cultivated plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants. Each new Cultivated Plant Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{produced}} art {{to serve}} functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were {{developed during the}} Old Kingdom, following a strict <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.|$|E

These <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> contain {{general principles}} which {{are intended to}} serve as model rules. The three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> have been published, {{but they have not}} been adopted. The UNIDROIT Principles and the PECL are not meant to be adopted either. There are different opinions as to whether the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> can be considered {{to be a source of}} legal status at all. The <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> have been referred to in Swedish law. Swedish case law – in which the principle collections are mentioned – serves as guidance to when these sets can be expected to be part of Swedish law since the UNIDROIT Principles, the PECL and the DCFR not are regulations. Four cases from the 21 st century have been found in which the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> have been mentioned. A principle from the DCFR was applied by the Swedish Supreme Court in the case NJA 2009 s. 672 – which was one of the four cases that were found. An analysis was made in order to identify similarities and differences as to when the UNIDROIT Principles, the PECL and the DCFR previously have been mentioned in Swedish case law. It has been difficult to find similarities in the four cases that were found. Neither the form of contract, the contract-type, nor the presence of any international dimension in the proceedings were common denominators. One common denominator was however the Justice Council named Torgny Håstad. Håstad being one of the judges in each of the four cases – he was also one of the judges in the case NJA 2009 s. 672. It is particularly noteworthy since Håstad has been involved in the European project which resulted in the DCFR. The absence of a clear pattern on when the principle collections are mentioned in Swedish case law shows that the legal certainty might be at risk. The legal certainty is endangered since it in present time seems to be necessary to see to which judges and referees are ruling in the case and their respective personal attitude towards the UNIDROIT Principles, the PECL and/or the DCFR...|$|R

Secondly, it requires that ODA be promulgated {{in a manner consistent with}} Canadian values and foreign policy, sustainable development, and the promotion of democracy and human rights. The Bill also requires that Canadian foreign aid spending be more transparent and accountable to Parliament and must be reported in a timely manner.|$|E
25|$|Provisions toward Muslim-Christian {{relations}} {{have traditionally been}} assessed by taking in view later policies. According to one prominent interpretation, this {{would mean that the}} Principalities were regarded by the Ottomans as belonging to the Dâr al ahd' ("Abode of the Covenant"), a status granted to them in exchange for material gains. Therefore, the Ottoman Empire did not maintain troops or garrisons or build military facilities. Instead, as it happened in several instances, Ottoman Sultans allowed their Tatar subjects to raid Moldavia or Wallachia as a means to punish the dissent of local Princes. Literary historian Ioana Feodorov notes that the relations between the two smaller states and the Ottoman suzerain were based on a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> and rules to which the Ottoman Empire adhered, and indicates that, early in the 17th century, this system drew admiration from the Arabic-speaking Christian traveler Paul of Aleppo.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the social complexity of Organizational Learning. We built on and seek to extend recent conceptualizations of Organizational Learning that emphasize the emergent and fluid nature of learning in organizations, by drawing on some <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> Complexity Science. We selectively introduce two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> complexity that provide further richness {{to our understanding of}} Organizational Learning as a social complex process. The two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> are ‘schemas–diversity’ and ‘interaction–interdependence’. We discuss the main characteristics <b>of</b> these <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> Complexity Science and show they can help us understand aspects of the social complexity of Organizational Learning. Our analysis shows that one of the main contributions of the Complexity Science perspective to understanding Organizational Learning is that it reveals more clearly the tensions that underpin learning in social contexts. We provide a re-conceptualization of tensions as revealing elasticity and not only conflict. We argue that Organizational Learning as a source of tensions keeps the organization in tension, which allows us to better capture the dynamics of learning and organizing. We conclude by outlining some issues that future OL research would address if OL is conceptualized as a dynamic complex process. Key Words: social complexity; organizational learning; dynamics; organizing; tensio...|$|R

25|$|By law, {{children}} born as Hungarian citizens may bear {{no more than}} two surnames (most people have only one; those who have two may hyphenate them). They can also have only one or two given names (religious names not included since they are not official, see above). Given names can be chosen by the parents from an official list of several thousand names (technically, one list for each gender). If the intended name is not on the list, the parents need to apply for approval. Applications are considered by the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences following a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles.</b> Thus, names are approved if they are not derogatory or overly diminutive, can be written and pronounced easily, can be recognised as either male or female, etc. Approved names expand the official list, the newest edition of which is regularly published. A lot of recent additions are foreign names, which, however, must be spelled following Hungarian phonetics, e.g. Jennifer becomes Dzsenifer or Joe becomes Dzsó.|$|E
25|$|The divers Cubist {{considerations}} manifested {{prior to}} World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now {{been replaced by}} a formal reference frame which constituted the second phase of Cubism, based upon an elementary <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> that formed a cohesive Cubist aesthetic. This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists exhibiting at Léonce Rosenberg's gallery—including Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Jacques Lipchitz, Henry Laurens, Auguste Herbin, Joseph Csaky, Gino Severini and Pablo Picasso—leading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by Maurice Raynal, an early promoter of Cubism and continuous supporter during the war and post-war phase that followed. Raynal had been associated with Cubists since 1910 via the milieu of Le Bateau-Lavoir. Raynal, who would become one of the Cubists most authoritative and articulate proponents, endorsed a wide range of Cubist activity and for those who produced it, but his highest esteem was directed toward two artists: Jean Metzinger, whose artistry Raynal equated with Renoir and who was 'perhaps the man who, in our epoch, knows best how to paint'. The other was Juan Gris, who was 'certainly the fiercest of the purists in the group'.|$|E
