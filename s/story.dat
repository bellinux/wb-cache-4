5|$|Following the {{successful}} realisation of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey on screen in The Deadly Assassin, producer Graham Williams wanted another Gallifrey <b>story.</b> Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir {{with whom he}} had worked before. Weir's script, a six-part <b>story,</b> was planned as the final <b>story</b> of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat-people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. Read and director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that the <b>story</b> would be impossible to shoot on Doctor Whos budget and the <b>story</b> was abandoned mid-August 1977. With only two weeks to spare before filming, Read and Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's <b>story</b> at a fan convention years later, Williams could not recall its title and made up the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the <b>story</b> became widely known in fan circles.|$|E
