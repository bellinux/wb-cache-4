5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that <b>study</b> <b>participants</b> would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} identify dyadic differences in mother–adolescent conflict. In 2 studies (N = 131 and N = 147), adolescents (M = 13. 88 and 14. 65 years old) described the number of disagreements with mothers during the previous (1 or 3) days, their affective intensity, and perceptions of negativity in the relationship. Cluster analyses yielded 3 unique groups that replicated across studies: (a) placid dyads (50 % of <b>Study</b> 1 <b>participants</b> and 36 % of <b>Study</b> 2 <b>participants),</b> notable for low disagreement affective intensity and low relationship negativity; (b) explosive dyads (25 % of <b>Study</b> 1 <b>participants</b> and 31 % of <b>Study</b> 2 <b>participants),</b> notable for high affective intensity; and (c) squabbling dyads (25 % of <b>Study</b> 1 <b>participants</b> and 33 % of <b>Study</b> 2 <b>participants),</b> notable for frequent conflict. Longitudinal analyses revealed that cluster group membership was stable from 1 year to the next.

In <b>Study</b> 3, <b>participants</b> perceived behaviors described in a scenario as better charac-terizing prayer when central, as opposed to peripheral, features were used in the description.

25|$|In a {{study by}} {{psychologist}} Melissa Williams et al., published in 2010, <b>study</b> <b>participants</b> were given pairs {{of male and female}} first names, and asked to estimate their salaries. Men and to a lesser degree women estimated significantly higher salaries for men than women, replicating previous findings. In a subsequent <b>study,</b> <b>participants</b> were placed in the role of employer and were asked to judge what newly hired men and women deserve to earn. The researchers found that men {{and to a lesser extent}} women assign higher salaries to men than women based on automatic stereotypic associations. The researchers argue that observations of men as higher earners than women has led to a stereotype that associates men (more than women) with wealth, and that this stereotype itself may serve to perpetuate the wage gap at both conscious and nonconscious levels. For example, a male-wealth stereotype may influence an employer's initial salary offer to a male job candidate, or a female college graduate's intuitive sense about what salary she can appropriately ask for at her first job.|$|E

25|$|Many {{research}} {{studies have been}} conducted concerning the effect of schemata on individuals' perceptions of others. It has been found that preschoolers are aware of gender schemata and are capable of pointing out behaviours which are inconsistent with them. In a Canadian <b>study,</b> <b>participants</b> were asked to rate various diverse groups based on how well a given characteristic applied to them. The results confirmed that participants were quicker to assign a rating if the given characteristics fit the schema for that group.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} have documented similar findings. In one study, when {{participants were given}} cognitively demanding concurrent tasks, the results showed a paradoxical higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found that subjects concentrating on a positive task experienced neither paradoxical effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with cognitive load. Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their <b>study</b> <b>participants</b> was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{reality has}} been shown to improve the social skills of young adults with autism. In one <b>study,</b> <b>participants</b> {{controlled}} a virtual avatar in different virtual environments and maneuvered through various social tasks such as interviewing, meeting new people, and dealing with arguments. Researchers found that participants improved in the areas of emotional recognition in voices and faces and in considering the thoughts of other people. Participants were also surveyed months after the study for how effective they thought the treatments were, and the responses were overwhelmingly positive. Many other studies have also explored this occupational therapy option.|$|E

25|$|A 2003 review {{reported}} between 7 and 3,000 {{cases of}} CFS for every 100,000 adults. Ranjith reviewed the epidemiological literature on CFS {{and suggested that}} the wide variance of the prevalence estimates {{may be due to}} the different definitions of CFS in use, the settings in which patients were selected, and the methodology used to exclude <b>study</b> <b>participants</b> with possible alternative diagnoses. The Centers for Disease Control states a 2015 report estimates 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans have CFS but most remain undiagnosed. Approximately 250,000 people in the UK are affected with the illness according to the UK Department of Health archives.|$|E
25|$|The other {{portion of}} the {{parallel}} studies featured women who were post hysterectomy so who consequently {{did not need to}} take a progestin when using estrogen. They were given either placebo or conjugated equine estrogen alone. This group did not show the risks demonstrated in the combination hormone study, and the estrogen-only study was not halted in 2002. However, in February 2004 it, too, was halted. While there was a 23% decreased incidence of breast cancer in the estrogen-only <b>study</b> <b>participants,</b> risks of stroke and pulmonary embolism were increased slightly, predominantly in patients who began HRT over the age of 60.|$|E
