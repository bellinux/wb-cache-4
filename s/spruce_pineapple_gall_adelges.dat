25|$|The {{pineapple}} gall adelgid is {{endemic to}} Europe, {{belonging to the}} 'woolly adelgid' group; it is also widely distributed in the north-eastern United States. Spruce gall aphid, eastern <b>spruce</b> <b>pineapple</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelges</b> and {{eastern spruce gall aphid}} are alternative names. This insect belongs to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and family Adelgidae. It is the primary pest of Norway Spruce. Another similar species, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid, is indigenous to North America. This adelgid usually affects Colorado Blue, Sitka, Englemann, and Oriental spruces.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Pineapple</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> abietis) {{is a type}} of conifer-feeding insect {{that forms}} pineapple-shaped plant galls on its host species, {{commonly}} Norway and Sitka spruce. The adelgids (genus Adelges) are pear-shaped, soft-bodied green insects with long antennae, closely related to the aphid. [...] "Adelges" [...] lays up to one hundred eggs at a time, one on each needle. Adelges abietis (Linnaeus, 1758) {{is one of the most}} common species; synonyms are A. gallarum-abietis, Chermes abietis and Sacciphantes abietis.|$|R

5000|$|The spruce <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> lariciatus Patch) {{occurs in}} {{alternate}} years on spruce and larch from Alberta to the Maritimes and in adjacent {{parts of the}} United States. The pale spruce <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> strobilobius Kaltenbach) has a similar range but prefers black spruce or red spruce to white spruce.|$|R

5000|$|Balsam twig aphids (Mindarus abietnus) {{are another}} type of tree pest which affects fir and spruce trees in the spring. The aphids can cause stunted growth in trees with heavy infestations {{rendering}} badly damaged trees unsellable. Other species of adelgids also infest fir trees, those include the pine bark adelgid, the Cooley spruce <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> cooleyi), and the eastern spruce <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> abietis). Another serious pest are bagworms. These pests can defoliate a tree completely if present in large enough numbers. Additionally, {{the damage caused by}} the silk of bagworms can last years.|$|R

25|$|The eastern spruce <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> abietis Linnaeus) is an {{introduced}} species that feeds only on spruce. At least in 1985, the species {{was found in}} Canada from Ontario eastward and in adjacent parts of the United States.|$|R
2500|$|Only {{females of}} the <b>pineapple</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid are known. In spring, the newly hatched nymphs formed from over-wintered eggs feed at {{the bases of}} the growing needles; the induced swellings {{eventually}} coalesce to form the pseudocone structure, each cell of which contains about twelve nymphs. The nymphs overwinter under wax threads {{at the base of}} buds. They die shortly afterwards, leaving the eggs, which resemble white, cottony twigs, protected beneath their bodies.|$|R
25|$|The <b>pineapple</b> or pseudocone <b>gall</b> {{is a type}} of insect-formed gall, or {{abnormal}} {{outgrowth of}} plant tissue, that develops as a chemically induced distortion of needles, observed mostly on Norway spruce and Sitka spruce.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue spruce}} is {{attacked}} by {{two species of}} Adelges, an aphid-like insect that causes galls to form. Nymphs of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid form galls {{at the base of}} twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the Cooley's spruce gall adelgid cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches. The larva of the spruce budworm eat the buds and growing shoots while the spruce needle miner hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white scale insect, the pine needle scale feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles. Another insect pest is the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) which bores under the bark. It often first attacks trees which have blown over by the wind and when the larvae mature two years afterwards, a major outbreak occurs and vast numbers of beetles attack nearby standing trees.|$|R
25|$|Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland {{ecoregion}} are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), {{daddy longlegs}} (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), spruce <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> cooleyi), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), damselfly (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca).|$|R
40|$|Cooley {{spruce gall adelgid}} {{damage was}} found on a White spruce (Picea glauca) at the University of Idaho Plant Science farm just outside Moscow, Idaho. The {{diagnosis}} was made from the observation of galls {{at or near the}} terminal ends of the branches (see Figure 1). Only new growth from the current year was affected. Galls were first observed early in the summer on terminal new growth as soft swollen tissue surrounding the needles. Some of these galls were green; others were beginning to turn a brownish purple. Figure 1 shows the appearance of the gall in late summer and fall. The plant itself was growing well, but damage from previous infestations was visible in slightly distorted growth caused by the loss of the terminal branch ends which induced lateral bud formation and branching and thereby formation of “shrubby ” branches and asymmetrical growth habit. Spruce galls are caused by the Cooley spruce <b>gall</b> adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> cooleyi). A small aphid-like insect, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid alternates its life cycle between Picea species and Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Galls, however, are only formed on spruce. While most commonly found on Colorado blue spruce, adelgids will also infes...|$|R
