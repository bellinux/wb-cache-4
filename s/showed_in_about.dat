50|$|As {{chemistry}} developed, it {{was applied}} to the investigation of soil fertility. The French chemist Antoine Lavoisier <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>about</b> 1778 that plants and animals must combust oxygen internally to live and was able to deduce that most of the 165-pound weight of van Helmont's willow tree derived from air. It was the French agriculturalist Jean-Baptiste Boussingault who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil. Justus von Liebig in his book Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced. Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by Alexander von Humboldt. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Optimum {{diagnosis}} of glomerulopathies requires light microscopy, immunofluorescence and electron microcopy. In fact electron microscopy has a confirmatory role in glomerular diseases. It provides more information for patient management and can rule out other diseases. The {{goal of the}} present study is analysis the necessity of electron microscopy for the {{diagnosis of}} childhood glomerulopathies. Methods: 134 cases of renal biopsy with some clinical data retrospectively were reviewed. The contribution of electron microscopy to the final diagnosis was graded as necessary – diagnosis could not be reached without it, supportive – it increased the level of confidence in the final diagnosis and noncontributory – the diagnosis don't need electron microscopy for confirmation. Findings: The contribution of electron microscopy to the final diagnosis was necessary in 51 cases (38 %), supportive in 40 cases (≅ 30 %) and noncontributory in 43 cases (32 %). Conclusion: In conclusion the results <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>about</b> 68 % of childhood glomerulopathies the ultrastructural study was necessary or supportive, so electron microscopy still remains an important tool in diagnosis of childhood glomerulopathies...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{studied the}} lipid profile of 1. 635 {{patients}} {{of both sexes}} {{by means of the}} dosage ofplasma lipids, their distribution according to age and sex, and the calculation of known ratios which are considered risk indices for atherosclerosis. A new risk index has been proposed which includes, apart from the previously used parameters, also triglyceridemiae. Correlation tests have been carried out. In the sample studied about 38 % have a lipid parameter above the norm and the risk factor indices identify different situations, from the mildest which concem the increase of a single parameter to more substantial changes involving variations of several parameters. The incidence of the triglyceride blood level (which was above overage in 27 % of the cases) was emphasized when assessing atherogenic risk and also its connection with the inverse correlation with cholesterol - HDL. The sample tested <b>showed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>about</b> 25 % of the cases, an above overage risk {{and at the same time}} cholesterol- HDL below the norm in both sexes. Whilst reiterating that elettrophoresis of plasma lipids does not always give rise to a clear and reliable interpretation, the authors suggest that comprehensive haemato-chemical data (total cholesterol, LDL and HDL fractions, triglycerides) and the indices which are derived from them can be an effective method in assessing atherogenic risk...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to verify if (1) the average of shear-wave {{velocity}} from the surface to 30 m depth (VS 30) is a good proxy of site amplification {{in a country with}} complex geology like Italy, (2) the grouping of VS 30 in different soil classes and relevant spectra in the Italian seismic codes is adequate, and (3) shallow shear-wave profiles (VS 10) could be a more economical tool for site classification. To answer the first two questions, we examined 40 estimates of VS 30 derived from microzonation projects we performed in Italy (27 obtained with downhole measurements, plus 13 velocity profiles obtained with surface techniques). In all the sites, we installed seismic instrumentation to record earthquakes and to estimate site response using horizontal to vertical spectral ratios (HVSR). The comparison between HVSR and VS 30 <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>about</b> one-third of the sites that VS 30 is not a good proxy of observed amplification effects if the site does not have a monotonically increasing velocity profile. The reason VS 30 does not provide satisfactory estimates in Italy is linked to peculiar geological settings that are widespread in the country. We then compared the observed amplifications from earthquake HVSR data with the ones provided by the Italian seismic code, noting a substantial underestimation by the code, a somewhat unsettling situation because HVSR is usually considered to be a lower bound for amplification estimated with other techniques. Finally, we studied 45 VS downhole profiles to 30 m depth performed also at sites where earthquake recordings are not available. On this data set, we noticed that VS 10 could predict site classification with the same performances of VS 30. We consider alternative soil classification schemes that include soil frequency besides the velocity profile. In this two-parameter approach, VS 10 could be substituted for VS 30...|$|E
40|$|The cholesterol-containing {{complexes}} in {{the urine}} of normal subjects and patients with diseases accompanied by hyperexcretion of urinary cholesterol were characterized. In normal subjects, the major portion of the recovered urinary cholesterol was eluted in the void volume fractions after gel chromatography on Bio-Gel A- 5 m; this suggested an association with a macromolecular complex above 5 X 10 (6) daltons. A comparable elution pattern was seen {{in most of the}} urines of the patients with benign or malignant diseases of the kidneys or the urogenital tract. However, in single patients with hyperexcretion of urinary cholesterol, considerable amounts of cholesterol were detected in the included volume of the column. This was caused by additional excretion of high density lipoproteins or both high and low density lipoproteins {{in the urine}} which could be identified in these fractions by agarose electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. These results indicate that the macromolecular complex represents the majority of the recovered urinary cholesterol in normal subjects and in disease states with known hyperexcretion. Macroscopically, the isolated cholesterol- containing complex in the void volume fractions was turbid, and electron microscopy showed lipoprotein-like particles with diameters ranging from 300 to 700 A. The chemical analysis revealed median values of protein (46. 0 %), triglycerides (16. 3 %), cholesterol (8. 2 %), and phospholipids (29. 5 %) in normal subjects and comparable results in the patients with benign or malignant diseases of the kidney and the urogenital tract. Ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine were the main phospholipid components. After ultracentrifugation in a CsCl gradient, the cholesterol-containing complex was found between densities 1. 1 and 1. 3 g/ml. By SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis, up to 17 protein subunits in the molecular weight range of 14, 000 to 87, 500 were separated. Immunodiffusion studies <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>about</b> 40 % precipitin lines against anti-human albumin, but no reactions against anti-human apoHDL and anti-human apoLDL. However, immunodiffusion of the macromolecular complex against anti-liver-specific and anti-kidney- specific lipoproteins revealed single precipitin lines. In conclusion, the isolated cholesterol-containing urinary complex showed many characteristics of membrane-associated protein-lipid particles of the human kidney and even the liver. These proteolipids are the major source of urinary cholesterol in normal and disease states. ...|$|E
