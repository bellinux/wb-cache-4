5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a <b>swinging</b> <b>pendulum</b> blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps {{installed}} to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a <b>swinging</b> <b>pendulum</b> was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E

500|$|In 132, Zhang Heng {{presented}} to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention, the first seismoscope. A seismoscope records the motions of Earth's shaking, but unlike a seismometer, it does not retain a time record of those motions. It was named [...] "earthquake weathervane" [...] (houfeng didongyi 候風地動儀), and {{it was able to}} roughly determine [...] the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from. According to the Book of Later Han (compiled by Fan Ye in the 5thcentury), his bronze urn-shaped device, with a <b>swinging</b> <b>pendulum</b> inside, was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles/kilometers away. This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this natural disaster. The Book of Later Han records that, on one occasion, Zhang's device was triggered, though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi (modern Gansu Province), the same direction that Zhang's device had indicated, and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most celebrated}} test of Earth's {{rotation}} is the Foucault pendulum first built by physicist Léon Foucault in 1851, {{which consisted of}} a lead-filled brass sphere suspended [...] {{from the top of}} the Panthéon in Paris. Because of the Earth's rotation under the <b>swinging</b> <b>pendulum,</b> the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude.

2500|$|Functionally, a Gitton water clock {{consists}} of four subsystems: An oscillator (the pendulum), a frequency divider, a minute counter (the minute discs), and an hour counter (the hour balls). Water from a pump in the basement, just below the clock, is pumped through a pipe running up {{the middle of the}} clock into a reservoir at the top. The water then drips down onto a scoop at the top which is connected to the green, <b>swinging</b> <b>pendulum.</b> The pendulum causes the scoop to dump the water into a series of siphons. The siphons fill and empty into the minutes' globes. A Siphon is a tube in an inverted [...] "U" [...] shape which causes the solution to flow up, without pumps, powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity. One minute globe represents two minutes. When all thirty-minute globes are full, they empty and an additional hour globe fills. Twice a day, at one o'clock, all of the hour globes and minute discs are full and the water empties until only the first hour globe is left full.|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} opinion, the time {{taken for a}} <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> is not {{constant}} regardless {{of the size of}} the swing; the swing time changes with the size of the <b>swing,</b> see <b>Pendulum.</b> If the amplitude changes from 4° to 3°, the period of the pendulum will decrease by about 0.013 percent, which translates into a gain of about 12 seconds per day. This is caused by the restoring force on the pendulum being circular not linear; thus, the period of the pendulum is only approximately linear in the regime of the small angle approximation. To be time independent, the path must be cycloidal. To minimize the effect with amplitude, <b>pendulum</b> <b>swings</b> are kept as small as possible.|$|R

50|$|The support {{structure}} {{is dependent on}} the velocity of the surface of the Earth where it is located. The point of connection of the pendulum moves with the surface velocity vectors of the Earth at that latitude. At the equator the support-point moves with the equatorial rotation of the Earth and moves the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> along with this rotation. At the poles the support-point is located on the axis of the Earth so the support-point rotates but does not have a horizontal velocity component as it does at the equator (and a progressively less horizontal velocity component with increasing latitude). The plane of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing,</b> however, is independent of the surface velocity vectors underneath the swing since there is only one point of connection. The point of connection is configured such that the plane of <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> is free to swing in any direction in relation to the structure of the connection point.
