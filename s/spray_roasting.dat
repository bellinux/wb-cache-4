50|$|The roast gas is {{conveyed}} {{through the}} system {{by means of an}} exhaust gas fan (VI). Fans in plants provide pressure increases of approx. 200 mbar and are feedback-controlled to maintain a relative pressure of -3 mbar between reactor and atmosphere to avoid any overpressure-related leakinge of acid gas.To rinse the impeller and cool the gas as well as to remove remaining traces of HCl from the roast gas, the exhaust gas fan is commonly supplied with quenching water, which is separated from the exhaust gas stream by means of a mist eliminator (VII) at the pressure side of the fan.In a final scrubber, commonly consisting of a combination of wet scrubbers such as venturi scrubbers (IX) and scrubber columns (X), remaining traces of HCl and dust are removed.In some plant, absorption chemicals such as NaOH and Na2S2O3 are used to bind HCl and Cl2 (which is created under certain circumstances in several, but not all <b>spray</b> <b>roasting</b> reactors).|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{pyrohydrolysis}} {{techniques are}} widely applied for regeneration of spent pickling liquors providing an excellent environmental and economical strategy {{to the problem}} of waste disposal/recovery, also thanks to the high acid recovery efficiencies (> 99 %) achieved. In fact, in these processes, iron chlorides are converted into iron oxides and hydrogen chloride at high temperature in <b>spray</b> <b>roasting</b> or fluidized bed reactors. Though the state-of-the-art technologies have been successfully applied only to large-scale plants, the development of small-scale units, able to perform a delocalized regeneration of spent solutions where these latter are actually produced, would be strongly needed in order to minimize the transportation of hazardous spent pickling and fresh HCl solutions to/from pickling factories from/to large centralized regeneration plants. In the present work, a steady-state simulation model for regeneration of spent pickling liquor via <b>spray</b> <b>roasting</b> has been developed, aiming at the analysis of performance of a small-scale unit. The simulation and optimization of the process has been carried out using Aspen Plus simulator. A simplified model of the spray roaster, based on the data collected from studies reported in the literature, has been implemented and exported from Aspen Custom Modeler. Solid recovery from roaster off-gases has been obtained by a cyclone and a Venturi scrubber, where the spent pickling liquor is concentrated prior to be sprayed into the reactor. Hydrogen chloride is absorbed in an adiabatic absorber, where a sub-azeotropic (18 – 20 wt%) hydrochloric solution is obtained. Prior to the stack, a scrubber is required to wash off the exhaust gases. Several parametric studies have been performed. Different designs of solid separators have been compared in order to investigate the particulate separation efficiency of the process, while absorption column’s packing types and rinse water flow rates have been varied in order to investigate their effects on HCl recovery and acid gas emissions...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose the synthesis of optimal iron oxides by oxyprecipitation of steel pickling liquors in order to obtain Ba-hexaferrite with high magnetic properties using the ceramic process. As a raw material, it was used sulphuric liquors with iron concentration of 43 g/l. The studied variables for the oxyprecipitation step were temperature, pH, stirring speed, flow of oxidizer to obtain goethite and magnetite. The samples were characterized by XRD and SEM. These oxides were wet milled with barium carbonate and the mixture was calcined in order to obtain Ba-hexaferrite. A VSM was used for determine the magnetic properties and the morphology was studied by XRD and SEM. With these results five iron oxides were selected and the conditions of the ceramic process (calcination temperature and time) for obtaining hexaferrite were optimized versus Hc...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{case from the}} steel industry, waste {{hydrochloric}} acid from the pickling process is regenerated using <b>spray</b> <b>roasting.</b> The process is driven by four burners placed symmetrically along {{the periphery of the}} cylindrical main section of the reactor. Severe problems with gas backflow and sintering of iron oxide inside the burner chamber have led to a complete shut down of the process 1 - 2 times every week, which is a frequency which significantly affects the productivity. In this study the influence of a kick-out on the gas flow {{in the vicinity of the}} burner chamber is investigated numerically. It is shown that the kick-out geometry creates a vortical low pressure region preventing the inflow of gas and hence the sintering of iron oxide. This has led to a significant increase in the productivity with no additional shut-downs than needed for the ordinary maintenance every 6 - 8 weeks. Validerad; 2011; 20110321 (stlu...|$|E
40|$|A {{process at}} SSAB regenerates waste {{hydrochloric}} acid (HCl), from the pickling process, with the <b>spray</b> <b>roasting</b> technique. Waste HCl acid is sprayed {{into a hot}} chamber where {{the water in the}} droplets is evaporated then a chemical process when iron chlorides is oxidized to form hematite and HCl gas. The regenerated HCl is sent to the process for steel pickling and the hematite powder is sold. With a good quality of the powder the process is ran with profit. But today they have problem to control quality. Because of the aggressive environment inside this process the furnace is closet which makes it hard to do measurements inside the process. To get an impression of the velocity profile and temperature distribution it is therefor a good idea to simulate the process. This project aims to, raise the knowledge about the process. By Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations in the commercial software Ansys CFX the present study will explain temperature distri- bution, velocity profiles, particle distribution and how the evaporation process changes when nozzle position and angle is changed. Results shows that the temperature is highest close to the wall and decreases in the region 40 - 100 cm from the wall and the temperature is almost constant close to center. These results has also been compared with measurements. Results further shows that the evaporation process is dependent of position and angle of the nozzle. Where position has a larger impact on the rate of evaporation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{hydrochloric}} acid (HCl) from the pickling process at SSAB EMEA in Borl¨ange, Sweden, is regenerated using {{a technique called}} <b>spray</b> <b>roasting</b> where waste HCl is sprayed into a hot reactor through four spray nozzles {{at the top of}} the reactor. The regeneration (drying) process is driven by four natural gas burners placed symmetrically along the periphery of the reactor and causes the water in the waste acid droplets to evaporate. Through chemical reactions the iron chloride is oxidized to form hematite and chloride gas; the latter to be used for manufacturing of new HCl which anew is used in the pickling process. The produced byproduct in form of hematite is sold and used in e. g. the electronic industry and as filling material for road constructions. A good quality of the hematite powder vouch for profit of the sold product, and hence an enhanced economy for the whole regeneration process which in turn motivates a continued regeneration rather than shipping away the waste acid and continuously buying new HCl. Due to the hostile environment inside the reactor, measurements and optical visualizations are difficult to perform. This limitation lead to a poor understanding of the dynamics inside the reactor as the process is a black box where waste acid is injected and hematite and chloride gas is collected; what happens in-between the two stages is not known to any larger extent. Here Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a useful tool for the modeling of the physics inside the reactor. In this licentiate thesis, the commercially available CFD software Ansys CFX has been used to model the gas flow and temperature inside the regeneration reactor as part of the main goal of modeling the whole regeneration process. As a first approach, the gas flow and temperature behavior are of certain interest as these quantities determine the dynamics of the injected droplets through their journey inside the reactor, and hence the regeneration process. The present work comprise two papers devoted to the actual application of HCl regeneration, and one paper which emphasize the importance of grid independency studies and the impact of grid element size in regions with high gradients. In the two application-focused papers (Paper A and C) the gas flow and temperature profile inside the reactor is resolved together with the particle (droplet) distribution. In Paper C the study is developed to also comprise the influence on theses quantities due to different locations and spray directions of the spray nozzles located {{at the top of the}} reactor.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is {{a method}} to numerically pre- dict flow patterns. In this thesis the method is used to predict the flow in a {{hydrochloric}} acid regeneration plant located at SSAB EMEA in Borl ̈ange and to investigate the flow in a burner region of a rotary kiln at LKAB in Kiruna. The {{first part of the}} thesis concerns the topic of waste hydrochlo- ric acid (HCl) from the pickling process at SSAB. The waste acid is regenerated using a technique called <b>spray</b> <b>roasting</b> where waste HCl is sprayed into a hot reactor through four spray nozzles {{at the top of the}} reactor. The regeneration (drying) process is driven by four natu- ral gas burners placed symmetrically along the periphery of the reactor and causes the water in the waste acid droplets to evaporate. Through chemical reactions the iron chloride is oxidized to form hematite and chloride gas; the latter to be used for manufacturing of new HCl which is used in the pickling process. The byproduct in form of hematite is sold and used in e. g. the electronic industry and as filling material for road constructions. Good quality hematite powder enables profitable sale of the product, and hence an enhanced economy for the whole regenera- tion process which in turn motivates continued regeneration rather than shipping away the waste acid and continually buying new HCl. Due to the hostile environment inside the reactor, measurements and optical visualizations are difficult to perform. This constraint leads to poor understanding of the dynamics inside the reactor, since the process is a black box where waste acid is injected and hematite and chloride gas are collected; what happens between the two stages is not adequately known. Here CFD is a useful tool for the modeling of the physics inside the reactor. In this thesis, the flow inside the reactor is resolved and modeled, leading to improved understanding of the regeneration process. Also, a purely numerical approach is considered where the impact of the wall-grid resolution on the bulk flow is investigated. The second part of the thesis deals with the aerodynamics in a rotary kiln, which is a large rotating oven used in the mining industry for drying purposes. At one end of the kiln a large diffusion flame is placed in order to support the process with heat so that moisture from the material can be evaporated. The flame is fed with secondary air to achieve complete combustion. Traditionally the flame is controlled and stabilized by cre- ating a short and intense combustion zone by feeding just sufficient air for complete combustion. In the kiln used in this project, the material is sensitive to shock drying and uses oxygen to complete the oxidization stage. Hence more secondary air than what is needed for combustion is fed through the secondary air channels, making the flame longer and harder to control. Earlier research of the process has been focused on the cold flow from the secondary channels and has found a possible problem related to vortex shedding in the burner region. In this work the burner is inserted into a water model from the earlier work and PIV/PLIF mea- surements are performed to see concentration fields of the burner fluid. Numerical work is also performed in order to study the details of the vortex shedding and burner interaction. Careful validation is performed with experimental data from two interesting cases, the square cylinder and free jet, before the two models are combined to see the effect of vor- tex shedding on the mixing of the jet and secondary air. In analyzing the results of the vortex shedding and centerline concentration, dynamic mode decomposition is used to find the predominant structures of the system. In this thesis, the CFD software Ansys CFX has been used, which is commercially available, as well as the open source project OpenFOAM. Godkänd; 2015; 20150911 (simjoh...|$|E
