5|$|Preparations for the {{disposal}} of equipment began {{in the second half}} of 1944 when the War Cabinet directed the military to survey all stocks and indicate any <b>surpluses.</b> General Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hindered these preparations as he believed they were premature and that the Army's stocks needed to be maintained until Japan was defeated. This position was opposed by the acting Minister for the Army, and the RAAF and RAN made some attempts to identify their <b>surpluses,</b> but was successful in delaying the Disposal Commission's work until July 1945. As a result, relatively little military equipment was sold between September 1944 and June 1945.|$|E

5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade <b>surpluses</b> and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E

5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or <b>surpluses.</b> The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, the Army had more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar <b>surpluses</b> existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the citadel, the Tây Sơn never again attempted to recapture the city—the building gave Nguyen Anh a further psychological advantage over his opponents. The citadel helped to secure the southern region, which allowed Nguyễn Ánh to implement domestic programs to strengthen himself economically in preparation to fight the Tây Sơn. He used the newfound security to undertake agrarian reforms. Due to Tây Sơn naval raids on the rice crop, the area had been suffering long term rice shortages. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally underexploited because it had been occupied by Vietnamese people only relatively recently. Nguyễn Ánh's programs resulted in large amounts of previously idle land being cultivated. Large <b>surpluses</b> of grain, taxable by the state, were generated.|$|E

A simple debt dynamics equation, incorporating real shocks, is constructed, and the probability of exceeding the critical debt level is simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. The results show that the variable <b>surplus</b> rule performs better than the simple fixed <b>surplus</b> rule, by reducing debt sustainability concerns and the necessary medium-term primary <b>surplus.</b> This result hinges on the government''s ability to make a credible commitment to the variable <b>surplus</b> rule in the medium run.

40|$|The article first infers how {{consumer}} <b>surplus</b> in {{a market}} is linked to revenue under different assumptions about fare elasticity and when using different types of demand functions. This information is added to producer <b>surplus</b> in order to derive social <b>surplus.</b> The method, thus, produces a simple approach for authorities to assess social <b>surplus</b> {{in a market}} and its benefits to the users. A modified exponential demand function is applied to calculate consumer <b>surplus</b> and social <b>surplus</b> for 97 ferry services in Norway regulated by the state. The calculations are based on empirical data concerning ferry fare, revenue data at service level and reasonable assumptions about fare point elasticity for services covering different distances. In 2007, these services generated welfare for the users (consumer <b>surplus)</b> and the society (social <b>surplus)</b> amounting to about 5. 8 billion NOK and 4. 3 billion NOK, respectively. Consumer <b>surplus</b> and social <b>surplus</b> varied considerably amongst the services. Only 3 of the 97 services operate with positive profits and, hence, without subsidies.
