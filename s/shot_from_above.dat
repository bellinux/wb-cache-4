25|$|The ball {{came very}} close to hitting the ground before Harris scooped it up. In the {{sideline}} views of both film and video, Harris had caught the ball out of frame, and came running into frame from the right side on his path to the end zone. The only other known NBC video was an end zone <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> and behind the goalposts depicting Harris scooping the ball before it touched the ground. The best NFL Films shot of the play, from ground level, is a tight shot from the end zone of Harris snaring the ball, with his feet and the ground just out of frame below.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{disagree}} {{on the details of}} Reynolds' death, including the specific time (either 10:15a.m. or 10:4010:50a.m.), the exact location (on East McPherson Ridge, near the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry, or West McPherson Ridge, near the 19th Indiana), and the source of the bullet (a Confederate infantryman, a Confederate sharpshooter, or friendly fire). One primary source was Sergeant Charles Henry Veil, his orderly and unit Color Guard, who described the events in a letter in 1864 and then contradicted some of the details in another letter 45 years later. A letter from Reynolds' sister, Jennie, stated that the wound had a downward trajectory from the neck, implying that he was <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above,</b> presumably a sharpshooter in a tree or barn. Historians Bruce Catton and Glenn Tucker make firm assertions that a sharpshooter was responsible; Stephen Sears credits volley fire from the 7th Tennessee against the 2nd Wisconsin; Edwin Coddington cites the sister's letter and finds the sharpshooter theory to be partly credible, but leans towards Sears' conclusion; Harry W. Pfanz agrees that the location was behind the 2nd Wisconsin, but makes no judgment about the source of the fire. Steve Sanders, writing in Gettysburg magazine, suggested the possibility of friendly fire based on some accounts, and concludes that it is as equally likely as enemy fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{staging of}} the song {{included}} two pairs of additional dancers, two of whom performed breakdance and acrobatic moves. The television production involved some Busby Berkeley-style <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> and darkened sequences during which the performer's costumes were illuminated with integral neon strips. There {{were a couple of}} pyro effects during the song, including at the very end.|$|R
60|$|Eddie {{rose and}} {{as he did so}} he {{staggered}} and grew very white. Billy dismounted and ran forward, putting an arm about him. Another <b>shot</b> came <b>from</b> <b>above</b> and Billy Byrne's pony grunted and collapsed.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} the {{loophole}} the pistol <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> again rang out; but the door was of heavy seasoned wood, three inches thick, and the bullets failed to penetrate. Then the shield ascended step by step, until it reached the barrier. There it stopped, for the strength that could {{be brought to bear}} upon it was altogether insufficient to move in the slightest the solid pile, and after some time spent in vain efforts, the shield was taken back again, as gradually and carefully as it had been advanced, until out of the range of the pistols of the defenders.|$|R
500|$|Richard Johnson was {{credited}} later with killing Tecumseh personally, {{which he used}} to become a [...] "career politician" [...] and master of the Great Crossings area. Indian reports were that Tecumseh {{was killed by a}} man on horseback, and Johnson {{was one of the few}} mounted men at that side of the battle. (His own men had dismounted, and Shelby's were infantry.) Furthermore, Johnson, who had been wounded four times already, had been shot in the shoulder by an Indian chief who was advancing to tomahawk Johnson, when he shot back and killed the Indian instantly with a single pistol shot. A nineteenth-century source asserts that Tecumseh's body was found, near Johnson's hat and scabbard, <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> (as from horseback), and wounded with Johnson's usual load of two buckshot and a pistol ball.|$|E
500|$|The parade {{was filmed}} at Universal Studios Hollywood in California on the New York Street set, due to safety concerns. The set was {{designed}} to resemble 2nd Avenue; the parade was <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> by helicopters and stitched into matte shots of the real-life street. It took three weeks to film, with 1,500 extras {{being used in the}} scene, along with three custom designed floats. Other parts of the film to be shot in Los Angeles, California included store interiors, and the warehouse fight scene between Howard and the criminal Santas, for which a Pasadena furniture warehouse was used. Turbo-Man was created and designed for the film. This meant the commercials and scenes from the Turbo-Man TV series were all shot by Levant, while all of the Turbo-Man merchandise, packaging and props shown in the film were custom made one-offs and designed to look [...] "authentic, as if they all sprang from the same well." [...] Along with Columbus and Levant, production designer Leslie McDonald and character designer Tim Flattery crafted Turbo-Man, Booster and Dementor and helped make the full-size Turbo-Man suit for the film's climax. Principal production finished in August; Columbus [...] "fine-tun the picture until the last possible minute," [...] using multiple test audiences [...] "to see where the big laughs actually lie." ...|$|E

Reid's photographs inspired such terms as [...] "nostalgic" [...] and [...] "moody." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many of the bomb-disposal {{scenes were}} filmed in what {{appeared}} to be deep, freshly dug holes lined with wooden shoring (the way real bomb disposal often happened). In fact, these scenes were shot using two different physical sets intercut: a short above-ground wooden fence that appeared to be the top of the shaft down to the bomb (but was not in fact excavated); and a 30-foot above-ground hollow wooden tower with a muddy area inside at the bottom (often <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above,</b> looking down). A side of the bottom was also removable to facilitate [...] "bottom-of-shaft" [...] close-ups.|$|E

In another scene, the band is walking down the street when Bono is run over by a car (driven by Elvis) while reading a copy of C.S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters. The next scene shows Bono in the {{hospital}} flatlining and about to die, when a bolt of red lightning strikes his heart monitor turning his skin white, his shirt red, and causing his fingernails to grow, thus transforming him into MacPhisto. He makes his appearance, terrifying the doctors and the other band members. The video ends with an orchestra of Batmen playing the outro on strings, then a <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> of Bono repeatedly transforming into MacPhisto and Bono alternately.|$|E
2500|$|Howard Brennan was a steamfitter who {{was sitting}} {{across the street from}} the Texas School Book Depository and {{watching}} the motorcade go by. He notified police that he heard a <b>shot</b> come <b>from</b> <b>above</b> and looked up to see a man with a rifle fire another <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> the southeast corner window on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking through the window. Brennan gave a description of the shooter, and Dallas police subsequently broadcast descriptions between 12:45p.m., 12:48p.m., and 12:55p.m. After the second shot was fired, Brennan recalled, [...] "This man I saw previous was aiming for his last shot... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark." ...|$|R
60|$|The men, who {{numbered}} a {{dozen or}} so, and were well-armed, were apparently relieved to find that our travellers were not bandits, in regard to whom their questions showed that they felt some anxiety. They had witnessed Pedro's <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> the heights <b>above,</b> and looked upon him with no little surprise and much respect as they commented on his power with the rifle.|$|R
5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> high <b>above</b> the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|R
5000|$|... "Homage to Gaudí" [...] {{explores the}} {{interface}} {{of architecture and}} nature, inside and outside. The architect’s undulating, flourishing edifices -walls, caves, gates, towers- are so organic, it’s hard to tell where the manmade stops and nature takes up, particularly when rendered in Monet’s inside-out palette. Monet also focuses more here {{on the kind of}} cropping and composing devices inherent in photography, making two towers <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> seem so reduced in scale they look like side-by-side bowling pins, and framing them inside a rugged vertical opening in an image he says is an homage to a Barnett Newman [...] "zip" [...] painting.Another in the series shows a pigeon sitting on a balcony encrusted with dazzling floral mosaics, juxtaposed with actual nature beyond that has the ethereal quality of an Impressionist landscape dissolving into dappled paint.|$|E

Dr. Haluk Ince, the director of Istanbul's Medical Examination Institute, said, [...] "from the analysis of the bullet distance on one of the bodies, the gun was fired between 2 and 14 centimeters' distance from the victim's head."

40|$|An {{interactive}} public site-specific telepresent installation for Staro Rīga from November 15 th to 18 th 2014, {{designed for}} site-specific impromptu performance and user interaction.   Staro Rīga, was a festival of light taking {{place during the}} Latvain independence celebrations {{and as part of}} the European City of Culture 2014 programme of events. This work celebrated the history of cinema, with key moments recreated as sets with references to cinematic genres, containing converged scenes and sets from the history of cinema including George Meliers "La Lune", Eisensteins "Battleship Potemkin", Casablanca and "Vertigo". The installation took live oblique camera <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> the screens of two separate audience groups in Riga, both located on large 40 m 2 blue ground sheets, which then combined them on screen via a chroma-key video switcher in a single composited image. As the merged audiences started to explore this collaborative, shared telepresent space they discovered the ground beneath them, as it appeared on screen as a digital backdrop, locating them in a variety of environments. Through these playful environments the audience participants were offered the opportunity to direct and change the outcomes of this installation through an open system of interaction. These unique transitory outcomes relied entirely on the roles and performances the public participants brought to these urban screens and the experiences they chose to live out. Contextualized by their urban and commercial environments and recontextualized by a diverse array of interactive backdrops, our aim was to allow these public audiences the opportunity and agency to reclaim these urban screens...|$|R

50|$|In late February, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide {{was removed}} from Haiti by the US Military. On March 7, 2015, Ortega had been on {{assignment}} in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, covering street protests for his tenth day when violence erupted around 2 p.m. It was reported that the initial shots came from anti-Aristide protester but that shots were returned from the other direction. In the crossfire, US photojournalist Michael Laughlin, Sun-Sentinel of Florida, was wounded. There were two accounts of Ortega's killing. According to US journalist Peter Andrew Bosh of the Miami Herald, Ortega {{had been in a}} house, located at Rue Lamarre 41-43, and providing aid with others to his wounded colleague, and when he stepped out of the house, he was shot twice. However, German photojournalist Marcel Mettelsiefen said Ortega was in a courtyard when he was <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>above.</b> He could have been shot by either anti-Aristide protesters or by US Marines, although a Marine spokesperson disputed this assertion at the time. He took two bullets, one to the chest and one to the abdomen, in the accounts. The group was pinned down by gunfire and had to leave Ortega and others wounded unattended for several minutes. Witnesses say that one of bullets that hit Ortega in either the chest or abdomen also hit a Haitian citizen Joseph Franois. His interpreter was also killed.|$|E
