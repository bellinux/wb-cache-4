5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.|$|E

5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on the <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma {{came in contact with}} water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
