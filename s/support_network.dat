The order was intended to rob the guerrillas of their <b>support</b> <b>network</b> in Missouri. On October 2, a group of 450 guerrillas under Quantrill's leadership met at Blackwater River in Jackson County and left for Texas.|$|E

40|$|Background Personality affects {{psychological}} wellbeing, {{and social}} <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> may mediate this effect. This {{may be particularly}} pertinent in later life, when social structures change significantly, {{and can lead to}} a decline in psychological wellbeing. Aim To examine, in an older population, whether the relationships between neuroticism and extraversion and mental wellbeing are moderated by available social <b>support</b> <b>networks.</b> Method We gathered information from 536 community-dwelling older adults, regarding personality, social <b>support</b> <b>networks,</b> depressive symptomatology, anxiety and perceived stress, as well as controlling for age and gender. Results Neuroticism and extraversion interacted with social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> to determine psychological wellbeing (depression, stress and anxiety). High scores on the social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> measure appear to be protective against the deleterious effects of high scores on the neuroticism scale on psychological wellbeing. Meanwhile, individuals high in extraversion appear to require large social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> in order to maintain psychological wellbeing. Conclusion Large familial and friendship social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> are associated with good psychological wellbeing. To optimise psychological wellbeing in older adults, improving social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> may be differentially effective for different personality types...|$|R

5|$|Ravalomanana's {{announcement}} sparked retaliatory {{actions by}} the Ratsiraka administration, resulting in frequent defamatory attacks {{in the press and}} a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs (55.6 million Euros) in unpaid back taxes, and two other lawsuits in relation to his management of Tiko, which were later settled out of court. These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana's campaign <b>support</b> <b>network,</b> Tiako iMadagasikara (TIM), and in speeches the candidate delivered in urban and rural areas across the island, with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko. Tiko distribution channels were used to distribute posters, baseball caps, tee-shirts and other promotional materials.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{spent more}} than $6 million on actions related to the NAP-CHT in 2013. In September of that year, Kellie Leitch, Minister responsible for the Status of Women and Minister of Labour, announced {{that the government would}} give the Women's <b>Support</b> <b>Network</b> of York Region $200,000 to initiate a project aimed at eradicating human trafficking in the Regional Municipality of York, and she appealed to the NAP-CHT when making the announcement. In February 2013, the Toronto City Council decided to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the NAP-CHT. That May, during a meeting of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly at United Nations Headquarters in New York City that was convened to discuss the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, the Canadian delegation spoke about the NAP-CHT.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925 {{tensions}} between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini {{to set up a}} financial <b>support</b> <b>network</b> for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from the realities of the revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.|$|E

This study also explored differences between how the clients assess their quality of life and <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> and how primary caseworkers asses the quality of life and <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> of their clients. Thirty intellectually handicapped adults (18 men & 12 women) and their primary caseworkers were randomly selected to participate in the study. Significant differences were found between client and primary caseworker evaluations of clients' quality of life and their social <b>support</b> <b>networks.</b> Friends as <b>support</b> providers was strongly associated with better quality of life. The findings also indicated that there were significant differences in female and male client satisfaction with quality of life...|$|R

5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had a <b>support</b> <b>network</b> in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{research}} evidence showing the crucial role of social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> in defining successful coping strategies by female-headed families, especially in South European Countries. In such a context, single mothers are more vulnerable {{to the risk of}} social isolation {{due to the lack of}} childcare, the limited rights to even a low subsistence income and the labor market rigidity -which discourages women’s participation in the work force. The present contribution aims at analyzing social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> of single mothers by considering the role of kinship and friendship ties as essential sources of support and generators of social integration. An ego-centered network approach is adopted to reconstruct social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> of a sample of single mothers in Naples. The pattern of relationships on which social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> are based, within and across family boundaries, are analyzed by means of multilevel logistic regression models. More specifically, we aim at understanding: i) on which kind of social <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> single mothers rely for daily living; ii) which characteristics of ego and alteri explain the presence of non-kin among alteri in the personal networks; iii) which factors affect the strength of ego-alteri ties in terms of closeness and of importance...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> that are {{available}} to British Indian women studying at a ‘new’ (post 1992) university in the South East of England, UK. It {{will examine the}} support that women draw upon whilst at university and discuss the ways in which these <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> enable women to develop strategies for success. Thirty-two in-depth interviews were carried out with British Indian women who were studying for a Social Sciences or Education Studies degree in one university. All of the interviews were tape-recorded and the data transcribed. The findings suggest that British Indian women are able to use their <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> to enable them to succeed in higher education. The article will draw upon the work of Putnam (2000) to argue that within their communities at university, women engage in their <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> from which they develop ‘bonding’ and ‘bridging’ social capital. <br/...|$|R
