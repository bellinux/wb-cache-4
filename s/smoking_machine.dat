40|$|Aim: Much {{has been}} written about the {{toxicity}} of narghile (hookah, shisha) smoke. However, it is seldom mentioned that narghile smoke is actually far less complex than that of cigarettes. In spite of being a much simpler object to research, there has been a world of avoidable and preventable confusion due, to a great extent, to the inappropriate use of the narghile <b>smoking</b> <b>machine</b> designed at the US-American University of Beirut that now is considered to be “standardised”. This machine has allowed the claims of high yields of tar, CO, PAH, heavy metals and, lastly, volatile aldehydes. Consequently, any public health intervention against narghile (hookah, shisha) use requires a long overdue critique of this machine on which a large amount of the peer-reviewed “waterpipe” literature uncritically relies. Public health policy makers should be aware of the unprecedented degree of confusion in this field. Methods: The analysis is twofold. On one hand, the classical FTC (Federal Trade Commission) regime applied to cigarette testing (and behind the official figures printed on cigarette packs) is presented, whereby it is recalled that a 35 -ml puff is drawn each minute for only a few minutes. On the other hand, a discussion follows about the relevancy of the narghile <b>smoking</b> <b>machine</b> based on averaging a complex human and social activity to a puff relentlessly drawn every 17 s over a full hour, with, marginally, the heating source (coal) in the same position over the smoking mixture (contrary to common practice). It is assumed that such stress-strain conditions result in abnormal perturbations in the chemical reactions at stake. The case of aldehyde generation is taken as an example. Results: The narghile <b>smoking</b> <b>machine</b> was modelled after the one for cigarettes, which not only is an inappropriate reference, but also is totally irrelevant for a kind of tobacco use that is different from all points of view. The narghile <b>smoking</b> <b>machine</b> and its underlying smoking topography represent a biased toxicological model of the related practice. Human-centered alternatives are presented.

For this purpose, eight human subjects smoked a common Lights (10. 6 mg ‘tar’/cig) commercial cigarette and the exhaled particulate-phase smoke from three cigarettes was collected on Cambridge pads for each smoker. The smoke collection from the human subjects was vacuum assisted. The cigarette butts from the smokers were collected and analyzed for nicotine. The machine smoking was performed with a Borgwaldt RM 20 CSR <b>smoking</b> <b>machine</b> working under conditions recommended by the U. S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The nicotine levels for the cigarette butts from the smokers were used to normalize the level of exhaled smoke condensate {{to that of the}} FTC smoking conditions. The smoke condensates from exhaled smoke as well as that from the machine smoking were analyzed by a gas chromatographic technique with mass spectral peak identification. The retention efficiency for 160 compounds was calculated from the ratio of the compound peak areas in the exhaled smoke (normalized by the corresponding butt nicotine level) vs. the areas of the corresponding peaks from the chromatogram of the smoke generated by the <b>smoking</b> <b>machine.</b> In the calculation of the results, it was assumed that the composition of mainstream smoke remains practically constant at different smoking regimes. All compounds found in the machine-generated smoke were also present in the exhaled smoke, but at different levels. About one third of the compounds were retained more than 66 % by the smoker. Another third of the compounds were retained between 33 % and 66 %, {{and the rest of the}} compounds were retained very little from the mainstream particulate-phase of the cigarette smoke. The compounds retained more than 66 % were in general compounds with lower molecular weight and with higher water solubility, which eluted first from a 5 % phenyl dimethyl-polysiloxane (DB- 5 MS) chromatographic column. The compounds retained less than 33 % from smoke were those with higher molecular weights and boiling points, which had longer elution times from the chromatographic column. These compounds consisted mainly of long-chain hydrocarbons (saturated or squalene type) and phytosterol-type compounds. The compounds retained between 33 % and 66 % had intermediate chromatographic retention times. No attempt was made to evaluate or identify new compounds formed in the exhaled smoke. The results were obtained from a limited number of subjects, but among these the retentions for individual compounds did not show large differences, indicating that the retention process is not very different for the subjects evaluated.

After evaporation of the solvent, either acetone or cyclohexane, they were freeze dried and homogenised with sterile horse serum. The freeze drying made the waxy condensates brittle and facilitated the homogenising process.

To illustrate this approach we examined four toxicants (acetone, N′-nitrosoanatabine, phenol and pyridine) with respect to tar, and explored International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Health Canada Intense (HCI) regimes. We compared this approach with other methods for assessing toxicants in cigarette smoke, such as ratios to nicotine or tar, and linear regression.
