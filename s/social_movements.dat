40|$|The criminalization of {{violence}} against women over the past forty years represents both <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> success and the paradoxical alignment of feminism with increasingly punitive carceral policies. This historical analysis of the shifting <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> field during its formative years from 1973 to 1986 refutes dominant <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> paradigms for understanding <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> cooptation and demobilization. The research interrogates the processes and mechanisms of contestation between <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> and {{the criminal justice system}} and, more broadly, relationships between civil society and the state. A closer focus at the historical construction of the anti-domestic violence <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> field during this period reveals the ways that the very dynamics of contestatory success generate the conditions for an expanding carceral state, eventually resulting in blurred boundaries between civil society and the state and the domination of the field by criminal justice institutions and carceral political logics. Through the analysis of semi-structured interviews of 57 <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> actors, governmental policymakers and criminal justice personnel and the extensive analysis of archival materials, this historical case study of California and Minnesota, early innovators of hallmark <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> strategies and institutions pursuing criminalization, contributes to feminist, criminological and <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> scholarship regarding the dynamics of <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> field development over time...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, 2003 The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} {{the link between the}} values of individuals taking action towards sustainability and how their actions are guided by a <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> organization. Guided by the literature presented in new <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> theory I began to investigate the cultural aspects of a contemporary <b>social</b> <b>movement.</b> As my research evolved, new <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> theory provided me with a context to better understand the role of the <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> organization in promoting awareness and activism. My research took place at The Aprovecho Research Center. Aprovecho is a research and educational institution striving to provide techniques for simple and cooperative living. Using qualitative research methods I interviewed fourteen individuals at the Research Center. The work that follows is a case study of Aprovecho, a <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> organization. I found that as a <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> organization Aprovecho is actively shaping the culture of activism revolving around sustainable living.

40|$|Whilst we {{acknowledge}} that Hezbollah {{is considered by}} some as a <b>social</b> <b>movement,</b> there is a distinct shortage of literature that tries to describe it as such using <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> theory. We discuss that Resource Mobilisation Theory would be an effective <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> theory in discussing how Hezbollah mobilises key resources such as its support base and conscience constituents. It is also effective in analysing the different tactics and strategies employed by the organisation. Moreover it can be utilised in explaining how Hezbollah uses its resources such as the media and institutions in order to relate to society. Furthermore, we argue that Political Opportunity Theory can be used to explain why Hezbollah built political alliances and how they exploited weaknesses in the Lebanese political system. We argue that although Hezbollah can be defined as a <b>social</b> <b>movement,</b> it is too institutionalised to be solely considered as a <b>social</b> <b>movement...</b>|$|R

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and <b>social</b> <b>movements,</b> wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E
