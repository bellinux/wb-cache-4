5|$|Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that it was probably a tree squirrel and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to the squirrel family (<b>Sciuridae),</b> which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E

25|$|Predator species include coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), falcons (Falconidae), and hawks and eagles (Accipitridae) prey {{on adult}} and {{juvenile}}s. Crows and ravens (Corvus spp.) and magpies (Pica spp.) consume juvenile birds. Coyotes, ground squirrels (<b>Sciuridae</b> spp.), and badgers {{are the most}} important mammalian nest predators. Among bird species, magpies and ravens commonly prey on Greater Sage-Grouse nests.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many members}} of the family <b>Sciuridae,</b> the eastern gray {{squirrel}} is a scatter-hoarder; it hoards food in numerous small caches for later recovery. Some caches are quite temporary, especially those made near the site of a sudden abundance of food which can be retrieved within hours or days for reburial in a more secure site. Others are more permanent and are not retrieved until months later. Each squirrel is estimated to make several thousand caches each season. The squirrels have very accurate spatial memory for the locations of these caches, and use distant and nearby landmarks to retrieve them. Smell is used partly to uncover food caches, and also to find food in other squirrels' caches. Scent can be unreliable when the ground is too dry or covered in snow.|$|E

5000|$|Carleton and Musser (2005) {{redefined the}} rodent suborders on {{morphological}} and molecular grounds. They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families, <b>Sciuridae,</b> Aplodontiidae, and Gliridae. Of these, only the <b>Sciuridae</b> are truly sciuromorphous. The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous. The connection between Aplodontiidae and <b>Sciuridae</b> {{has been proposed}} numerous times in the past. The two families have been united into a common infraorder (Sciurida) or superfamily (Sciuroidea). It has long been suggested that dormice (Gliridae) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha, and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed [...] "pseudomyomorphy". The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies, {{and to a lesser}} degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys.|$|E
