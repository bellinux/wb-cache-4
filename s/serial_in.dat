40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model that replicates three observed phenomena <b>in</b> securities markets: <b>serial</b> correlation <b>in</b> trades; <b>serial</b> correlation <b>in</b> squared price changes (conditional heteroskedasticity); and more persistent <b>serial</b> correlation <b>in</b> trades than in squared price changes. In the model exogenous news is captured by signals that informed agents receive. Agents trade anonymously through a market specialist, {{who does not}} receive a signal. We show that entry and exit of informed traders following the arrival of news produces <b>serial</b> correlation <b>in</b> the number of trades and <b>serial</b> correlation <b>in</b> squared price changes. Because the bid-ask spread of the market specialist tends to shrink as individuals trade and reveal their information, the <b>serial</b> correlation <b>in</b> trades is more persistent than the <b>serial</b> correlation <b>in</b> squared price changes. ...|$|R
