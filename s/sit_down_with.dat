5|$|I {{really wanted}} to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks {{and one of those}} videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is an American {{roots and}} blues rock album of protest songs with music {{characterized}} by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played {{all of the}} instruments, including bass, guitar, and mandolin, {{with the exception of}} drums by his son Joachim. A deeply political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and <b>Sit</b> <b>Down</b> <b>with</b> forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues.|$|E

500|$|The present-tense {{relationship}} between Alvy and Annie {{was not the}} narrative focus of this first cut, but Allen and Rosenblum recognized it as the dramatic spine, and began reworking the film [...] "in the direction of that relationship."

[...] According to Allen, [...] "I didn't <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're going to write a picture about a relationship.' I mean the whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it." ...|$|E

500|$|That We Can Play was {{recorded}} {{with a single}} stereo Pro Tools track and [...] "outboard, secondhand vintage synths and sequencers". Ford explained {{the process of making}} each song in an interview with XLR8R: [...] "It's almost like we just <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> gear and are like, 'Whoa, this sounds sweet,' and then we'll make a beat, and be like, 'What if we do this?' and something comes out and we move from there. Where it gets really complex—and you can't be a slacker—is you have to inventorize all these tiny sounds and constantly be trying to fit all of these moving parts together and see what sticks—and it's a lot of repetitive, careful-listening kind of work." ...|$|E

Among four Daley campaign appearances on a Sunday shortly before the primary was a rally of Polish Highlanders at 4808 S. Archer Ave. In a videotaped television newscast, it appeared that Daley said, [...] "You want a white mayor to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> everybody." [...] Sawyer said he was [...] "shocked." [...] Daley explained, [...] "It was my standard stump speech. I'm not maybe the best speaker in town, but I have never used the word [...]" [...] That Friday, the campaign watchdog group CONDUCT censured Daley and commended Sawyer for his [...] "rejection of racially inflammatory comments." ...|$|E
500|$|George {{is still}} singing {{as they enter}} Alton Benes's hotel. Elaine has not arrived yet, so they <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> her father and nervously order drinks. They have an awkward {{conversation}} with him; Alton asks who is the [...] "funny guy" [...] (Jerry), to which George says it's Jerry. Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton {{he has to make}} a phone call. He meets Jerry in the bathroom and both mention how terrified they are because of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not show up in the next ten minutes. When they return, Alton receives a message from Elaine, who will arrive in thirty minutes, which worries them both.|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies {{to the state and}} city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E
500|$|Cruise's {{representative}} {{responded to}} the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise's involvement were [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "he never said that". According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that [...] "Tom {{had nothing to do}} with this matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'" [...] A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue, specifically responding to allegations of Cruise's reputed corporate power play.|$|E
500|$|Simkins, {{a son of}} Edgefield, while {{recognizing}} faults in Tillman's racial policies, stated that [...] "no South Carolinian, with the single exception of Calhoun, has ever made a profounder impression on his generation than Tillman." [...] The late senator's supporters and protégés remained long in South Carolina, encouraging a view of Tillman as a great man in state and national history. James F. Byrnes, for example, repeated Tillman's themes of race war {{on the floor of}} the House of Representatives in 1919. In 1940, Byrnes, by then a senator and soon to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, dedicated a statue of Tillman outside the South Carolina State House and called him the state's [...] "first New Dealer". Others who knew and at one time admired Tillman included Strom Thurmond, son of Tillman's Edgefield attorney, who saw and was inspired by Tillman's campaigning style as a boy. Other southerners were highly negative: Lyndon B. Johnson said of Tillman, [...] "He might have been president. I'd like to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> him and ask how it was to throw it away for the sake of hating." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1990 William Bennett, who at {{the time}} was drug czar of the United States, visited a drug {{treatment}} centre in Pittsburgh and upon noticing a poster of Bart remarked, [...] "You guys aren't watching The Simpsons, are you? That's not going to help you any." [...] When a backlash over the comment ensued, Bennett apologized, claiming he [...] "was just kidding" [...] and saying [...] "I'll <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the little spike head. We'll straighten this thing out." [...] In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him [...] "angry, confused, frustrated." [...] In response, Matt Groening said, [...] "That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal. He thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do." [...] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, [...] "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply {{in the form of a}} short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] in which Bart replied, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a pen and paper".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{highlight}} in {{the debate}} happened when candidates were asked by Chris Matthews {{if they need to}} go to Congress to get authorization to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, if they were president of the United States.

Romney replied, [...] "You <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> your attorneys and (they) tell you what you have to do..."

Such a relationship, in Hoover's opinion, would be a bulwark against the spread of radicalism reflected in the rise of the [...] "Wobblies," [...] the Industrial Workers of the World. The Hoover initiative got no encouragement from those at the meeting. The obstacles that Hoover did not comprehend, [...] Ching recorded in his memoir, were that Gompers had no standing in the affairs of any company except to the extent that AFL unions had organized the workers, and that the federation's focus on craft unionism precluded any effective organization of the mass-production industries by [...] affiliates.|$|E
