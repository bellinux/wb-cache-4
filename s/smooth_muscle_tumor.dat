40|$|Abstract Background The {{diagnosis}} of uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> {{depends on a}} combination of microscopic features. However, a small number of these tumors still pose difficult diagnostic challenges. Aim To investigate progesterone receptor (PR) and p 53 expression in leiomyomas (LMs), atypical leiomyomas (ALMs), <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP), and leiomyosarcomas (LMSs) and to evaluate the potential utility of the selected immunohistochemical markers in differentiating these tumors. Materials and methods Immunohistochemical expression of PR and p 53 was investigated in 41 uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> comprising: 15 LMS, 4 STUMP, 6 ALM and 16 LM. Quantitative evaluation of PR and p 53 expression was graded on a scale from 0 to 3 +. Results Leiomyosarcomas showed reduced PR expression. All LMs as well as ALMs and STUMP were stained intensely for PR. Conversely, LMS was strongly stained with p 53, while the three non-sarcomatous groups (STUMP, ALM, LM) were either entirely negative or weakly stained for p 53. Regarding both PR and p 53 expression, the difference between the LMS group and the three non-sarcomatous groups was highly significant (p Conclusion Immunohistochemistry for PR and p 53 is valuable as an adjunct tool to morphological assessment of problematic uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|A 48 -year-old woman {{underwent}} total abdominal hysterectomy with {{conservation of}} the ovaries and tubes.

40|$|Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> are a {{group of}} {{intramural}} GI tumors formerly known as leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. This retrospective study was made to review our experience in surgical management of GI <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors.</b> Methods: The clinical records for patients with GI <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> during 1993 - 1999 were reviewed. Results: Ten tumors were located in stomach. Abdominal pain was the main presenting symptom followed by GI bleeding. The preoperative diagnosis was made by enhanced computerized tomography (CT) on eleven patients out of thirteen, while upper GI endoscopy with biopsy identified six tumors out of thirteen patients had the test. Tumors were treated by conservative excision in four and radical excision in fourteen. Histology was leiomyoma in six patients (with mitotic figures &# 60; 4 per 10 high power field) and leiomyosarcoma was found in twelve patients (with mitotic figures&# 62; 4 per 10 high power field). Median follow-up was 4 years. There was one recurrence for leiomyoma (size: 6 cm). All patients with leiomyosarcoma presented later with metastasis and died.

40|$|Leiomyoma is {{a benign}} <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> {{that is very}} rarely located in the oral cavity.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Smooth muscle tumors of {{uncertain}} malignant potential {{represent a}} histologically heterogeneous group of uterine smooth muscle tumors that cannot be diagnosed as either benign or malignant. Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential are usually clinically benign, {{but should be}} considered tumors of low malignant potential because they can occasionally recur or metastasize to distant sites. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 62 -year-old Mongol woman diagnosed with a retroperitoneal <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> of uncertain malignant potential and lung metastasis, with a history of prior hysterectomy. The case was initially misdiagnosed as retroperitoneal sarcoma, and our patient received chemotherapy. However, no interval change {{in the size of the}} retroperitoneal mass and metastatic lung nodules was seen over a period of at least five years. She underwent partial resection of the retroperitoneal mass for the purposes of debulking and establishing a histopathological diagnosis. The diagnosis of the retroperitoneal mass was then confirmed as a <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> of uncertain malignant potential. Conclusion Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential have an unpredictable clinical course, and relapses generally appear to occur after a long disease-free interval of up to several years. Therefore, patients diagnosed with smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential should receive long-term follow-up. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mesenchymal tumors of {{the lower}} {{reproductive}} tract of women are poorly understood {{at the molecular level}} as a result in part of the lack of relevant animal models. The present study describes a novel model of gynecological <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> in which these neoplasms arise in Eker rats as part of a familial cancer syndrome. The tumors develop {{as a result of a}} germline mutation in the tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC 2) gene, and predisposition to tumor development is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Uterine and/or cervical tumors arise spontaneously as single or multicentric neoplasms and increase in incidence with increasing age. The tumors were classified into three phenotypic variants of leiomyoma/leiomyosarcoma and into stromal cervicovaginal tumors on the basis of cytological and histological features and immunostaining patterns for <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> actin and desmin. Tumors histologically identical to the typical human myometrial leiomyoma arose, as did a subset of atypical leiomyomas having an epithelioid phenotype. Eker rats were found to develop both benign and malignant <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors.</b> The high spontaneous incidence of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> of uterus and cervix in this rodent model provides a unique opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of these clinically important gynecological neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intraocular <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> {{have long}} been a subject of controversy. The advent of {{immunohistochemistry}} with antibodies against HMB- 45, S- 100, <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> actin, desmin, and vimentin has helped greatly in the distinction between <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> and melanocytic lesions. METHODS: Twenty-seven archival tissue blocks from patients who had had intraocular leiomyomas or leiomyosarcomas diagnosed were located and fresh sections cut and stained for the above markers. The cases constituted 24 iris lesions and 3 ciliary body lesions. RESULTS: All 24 iris tumors were reclassified as iris melanocytic lesions. Two of the three ciliary body leiomyomas retained their classification, and the third was reclassified as a spindle B-cell melanoma. CONCLUSION: The authors suggest that intraocular leiomyomas are much rarer than previously suggested and {{that many of the}} cases previously reported in the literature are open to question...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> {{is usually not}} difficult.
