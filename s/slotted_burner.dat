In fact, this simple test case produces a two-dimensional laminar premixed flame, useful for understanding. In laboratory scale burner, it was observed that the tonal acoustic excitation of the flame changes the flame topology, the velocity and radical OH concentration field. 1, 2 Kartheekeyan et al. 3 observed that tonal pressure fluctuation induces asymmetry and oscillations in the laminar flame front generated by <b>slotted</b> <b>burner</b> (SB). For this reason, during the design stage of a SB, an aeroacoustic study is of primary importance. Hence, in the present research, wall pressure fluctuations generated within a <b>slotted</b> <b>burner</b> have been studied experimentally for several mass flow rates. Wall pressure fluctuations have been measured through wall mounted microphones, providing single and multi-variate pressure statistics both in the time and in the Fourier domain. Furthermore the use of the wavelet based auto-conditioning permitted us to detect the signatures embedded into the pressure fluctuations. Finally in order to give an interpretation of the pressure signals, acoustic and aerodynamic investigations have been carried out as well. The analysis of the acoustic response of the <b>slotted</b> <b>burner</b> has been conducted numerically, whereas the aerodynamic study has been carried out by means of RANS simulation...|$|E

Several interesting cases are considered explicitly; these include effects of negative and extremely high values of gravity.

In addition, our burner has easy optical access for detailed laser diagnostics. Flame displacement speeds were measured using a high-speed camera and related flow fields of unburned gases were visualized by particle image velocimetry.

40|$|Partially {{premixed}} flames (PPFs) {{represent a}} class of hybrid flames containing multiple reaction zones. These flames are established when less than stoichiometric quantity of oxidizer is molecularly mixed with the fuel stream before entering the reaction zone where additional oxidizer is available for complete combustion. This mode of combustion {{can be used to}} exploit the advantages of both nonpremixed and premixed flames regarding operational safety, lower pollutant emissions and flame stabilization. A double flame containing a fuel-rich premixed reaction zone, which is anchored by a nonpremixed reaction zone, is one example of a partially premixed flame. A triple flame is also a PPF that contains three reaction zones, namely, a fuel-rich premixed zone, a fuel-lean premixed zone, and a nonpremixed reaction zone. Herein we focus on two aspects of our investigation, one involving the development of optical diagnostics that can be used on a microgravity rig, which has been recently fabricated, and the other on the numerically predicted differences between normal- and zero-gravity PPFs.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. The FGM technique is a new method to reduce chemical kinetics. It has already proven to be accurate for modelling (partially-) premixed flames in DNS, LES and RANS settings. Previous research has focussed on flames with unit Lewis number transport models, thereby neglecting preferential diffusion effects. High accuracy was gained using a single progress variable Ycv 1 to describe the flame kinetics. The method is extended in the present contribution for non-unit Lewis numbers by introducing an additional mixing parameter Ycv 2 in the manifold, describing the combined fluctuations in enthalpy and element mass fractions due to flame stretch and preferential diffusion. The resulting 2 D FGM is used in 2 D DNS of a circular flame and compared with detailed chemistry. The agreement is near perfect thereby opening the way to model 3 D turbulent CH 4 -H 2 -air flames on a <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> with realistic non-unit Lewis numbers.

40|$|Buoyant pool {{fires are}} {{representative}} of accidental and arson related fires resulting in extensive property damage and injury to people. Continued research in pool fires is needed to support technology based efforts to reduce fire losses. Motivated by this, a study of radiation and flow characteristics of two laboratory scale buoyant diffusion flames, mimicking pool fire behavior, was undertaken. ^ Radiation is the primary mode of fire spread in case of accidents. Temporally and spectrally-resolved radiation data from flames are critical for validation of numerical models for fire protection engineering. In the present work, time series of spectral radiation intensities were measured in a 7. 1 cm ethylene (C 2 H 4) pool fire. Both soot and gaseous species (CO 2 and H 2 O) significantly contribute to the radiation output. Autocorrelations and power spectral densities (PSD) of the radiation data reflect the 2 ̆ 2 puffing 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon typically observed in pool fires. ^ Stochastic time series models have been successfully applied to radiation calculations in momentum-driven jet flames in the past. Due to fundamentally different flow characteristics, previous time series models cannot be extended to pool fires. Therefore, a new model was developed to simulate radiation time series in pool fires. Autocorrelations, PSD and probability density functions (PDF) of the simulated radiation time series matched well with the measurements in the 7. 1 cm C 2 H 4 fire, thus validating the new model. ^ Understanding of fire flow fields is important since fire size, and hence the radiation output, {{is related to the}} fire induced flow field. Therefore, three-dimensional (3 D) velocities were measured in a 7. 1 cm methane (CH 4) fire. To the author 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge, these are the first simultaneous measurements of all three velocity components in a pool fire. Based on instantaneous measurements and mean squared velocity fluctuations, the fire flow field is inherently three dimensional. ^ Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology, is extensively used for simulating laboratory scale and realistic fires. Here, FDS was evaluated using data from the present 7. 1 cm CH 4 fire and linear <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> fire data from the literature. Main findings of the numerical study were: (i) 3 D simulations are needed for accurate estimates of temperatures and velocities in <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> fires, even with the two-dimensional (2 D) source geometry, and (ii) based on the agreement between calculated and measured velocity statistics, FDS can capture both mean and turbulence characteristics of 3 D velocity fields in pool fires. ...|$|R

Measurements {{were carried out}} using the <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> method at 1 bar for fresh gases temperatures of 27 °C and 57 °C and for variable equivalence ratios going from 0. 8 to 1. 2. The hydrogen content in the fuel was varied from 0 % to 30 % in volume and the steam content in the air was varied from 0 to 112 g/kg (0 e 100 % of relative humidity). Numerical calculations were performed using the COSILAB code with the GRI-Mech 3. 0 mechanism for one-dimensional premixed flames. The calculations were implemented first at room temperature and pressure and then extended to higher temperatures (up to 917 K) and pressures (up to 50 bar). Measurements of laminar burning velocities of methanee hydrogeneair and methaneeairesteam agree with the GRI-Mech calculations and previous measurements from literature obtained by different methods. Results show that enrich- ment by hydrogen increases of the laminar burning velocity and the adiabatic flame temperature.

40|$|The {{influence}} of stratification {{on the structure}} of turbulent methane/air combustion is investigated using experimental data from laboratory scale burners: a weakly turbulent <b>slot</b> <b>burner,</b> and a higher turbulence co-annular swirl burner. The degree of stratification can be controlled independently of the overall fuel/air flow rate. The resulting measurements of scalar and velocity fields provide detailed test cases for existing and emerging turbulent flame models, covering a range of u'/sL from 1 to 10, turbulence intensities from 5 % to 60 %, and stratification ratios from 1 to 3. Simultaneous Rayleigh/Raman/CO-LIF measurements of temperature and major species concentrations - CH 4, CO 2, CO, H 2, H 2 O and O 2 - along a line are used to investigate the structure of a series of flames in both the <b>slot</b> and swirl <b>burners.</b> Concurrent cross-planar OH-PLIF allows thermal gradients to be angle corrected to their three-dimensional values. Finally, non-reacting and reacting velocity fields complete the flame database. The behavior of major species concentrations in the <b>slot</b> and swirl <b>burner</b> with respect to temperature is found to agree well on the mean with unstrained premixed laminar flame calculations. Scalar means conditioned on stoichiometry also show good agreement, aside from hydrogen which is enhanced under stratified conditions. Surface density function and scalar dissipation are lower than calculated values in all cases, suggesting that turbulence-induced thickening dominates the effect of increased strain. Metrics commonly used to derive flame surface density (FSD) were investigated. FSD may be determined using a statistical method based on measurements of temperature and its gradient, or a geometric method based on 2 D temperature or LIF imaging. A third metric, an extension of the geometric method, is proposed. Good agreement is observed between the three metrics. The current database provides the first detailed high resolution scalar measurements for premixed and stratified flames. The data analysis provides insight into the physics of stratification: for the flames considered, the effects of stratification appear to be surprisingly small compared to those of turbulence, even at significant stratification ratios. The datasets provide a means of validating current and future computational turbulent combustion models.

40|$|A laminar methane-air {{diffusion}} flame is interacted with vortices {{of various sizes}} and strengths {{in order to better}} understand unsteady stretch and history effects on turbulent flames. The nitrogen-diluted fuel stream of a Wolfhard-Parker <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> is acoustically forced, producing repeatable two-dimensional vortices that strain and curve the flame. Phase locked, planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) diagnostics are used to quantify the response of the OH-radical to the vortex-induced stretch. Acetone PLIF images are used to clarify the relationship between the vortex structure and the flame. The results show that the vortex causes significant variations in the OH layer thickness. In particular, negative strain produces a doubling of the flame thickness. Such large increases in OH layer thickness are not predicted by the laminar flamelet model (LFM) because negative strain rates cannot be simulated using standard counterflow flamelet geometry. Local extinction of the OH layer due to high strain is observed near the flame base. Peak OH mole fraction levels vary considerably more than adiabatic LFM predictions. In particular, the peak OH decreases by a factor of two with downstream distance. This decrease is believed due to dilution of reactants by combustion products formed elsewhere in the flow. A simplified model is proposed, which shows the OH concentration is sensitive to product dilution through the scalar dissipation rate...|$|R

A peak area recorded on the chart paper is proportioned to each other atlkyl lead content. The apparatus for gas chromatography, which was developed, consisted of an aluminum-made thermostat chamber (28 cm in diameter and about 7 cm in height) with a column of Teflon tube (3 mm × 3 m).

The methodology incorporates detailed chemical kinetics and a mixture model for differential species diffusion. Methane chemistry and transport are modeled using the DRM- 19 (20 -species, 84 -reaction) mechanism derived from the GRI-Mech 1. 2 mechanism along with its associated thermodynamics and transport databases. Adaptive mesh refinement dynamically resolves the flame and turbulent structures. Detailed comparisons with experimental measurements show that the computational results provide a good prediction of the flame height, {{the shape of the}} time-averaged parabolic flame surface area, and the global consumption speed (the volume per second of reactants consumed divided by the area of the time-averaged flame). The thickness of the computed flame brush increases in the streamwise direction, and the flame surface density profiles display the same general shapes as the experiment. The structure of the simulated flame also matches the experiment; reaction layers are thin (typically thinner than 1 mm) and the wavelengths of large wrinkles are 5 – 10 mm. Wrinkles amplify to become long fingers of reactants which burn through at a neck region, forming isolated pockets of reactants.

40|$|Characteristics of {{propagating}} nonpremixed edge-flames {{were investigated}} in a counterflow, annular <b>slot</b> <b>burner.</b> A high-voltage direct current (DC) {{was applied to}} {{the lower part of the}} burner and the upper part was grounded, creating electric field lines perpendicular to the direction of edge-flame propagation. Upon application of an electric field, an ionic wind is caused by the migration of positive and negative ions to lower and higher electrical potential sides of a flame, respectively. Under an applied DC, we found a significant decrease in edge-flame displacement speeds unlike several previous studies, which showed an increase in displacement speed. Within a moderate range of field intensity, we found effects on flame propagation speeds to be negligible after correcting the flame displacement speed with respect to the unburned flow velocity ahead of the flame edge. This indicates that the displacement speed of an edge-flame strongly depends on ionic wind and that an electric field has little or no impact on propagation speed. The ionic wind also influenced the location of the stoichiometric contour in front of the propagating edge in a given configuration such that a propagating edge was relocated to the higher potential side due to an imbalance between ionic winds originating from positive and negative ions. In addition, we observed a steadily wrinkled flame following transient propagation of the edge-flame, a topic for future research. © 2016 The Combustion Institut...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{velocities}} of premixed laminar flames {{with precision}} remains a controversial {{issue in the}} combustion community. This paper studies the accuracy of such measurements in two-dimensional <b>slot</b> <b>burners</b> and shows that while methane/air flame speeds can be measured with reasonable accuracy, the method may lack precision for other mixtures such as hydrogen/air. Curvature at the flame tip, strain on the flame sides and local quenching at the flame base can modify local flame speeds and require correc- tions which are studied using two-dimensional DNS. Numerical simulations also provide stretch, dis- placement and consumption flame speeds along the flame front. For methane/air flames, DNS show that the local stretch remains small so that the local consumption speed {{is very close to}} the unstretched premixed flame speed. The only correction needed to correctly predict flame speeds in this case is due to the finite aspect ratio of the slot used to inject the premixed gases which induces a flow acceleration in the measurement region (this correction can be evaluated from velocity measurement in the slot section or from an analytical solution). The method is applied to methane/air flames with and without water addition and results are compared to experimental data found in the literature. The paper then discusses the limitations of the slot-burner method to measure flame speeds for other mixtures and shows that it is not well adapted to mixtures with a Lewis number far from unity, such as hydrogen/air flames...|$|R

In this scenario, which can be termed as a coarse scale Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), reconstruction of the filtered flame using a spatially filtered flamelet (1 -D laminar flame) is analysed. First, DNS of a turbulent premixed <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> is computed to generate a reference database.

The filtered DNS source term, molecular diffusion and subgrid convection of the reaction progress variable is compared with a flamelet convoluted with top-hat profiles of the same order. The source term and molecular diffusion are approximated well from the filtered flamelet while the unresolved convection shows deviation. Finally, the reconstruction of the turbulent flame is tested a posteriori on the same filter widths (mesh size) and the results are compared.

Round and <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> nozzles with the same cross-sectional area were tested at a constant nozzle-to-plate distance of 2 d. The Reynolds number was selected to range from 1, 000 to 1, 700, {{in order to produce}} a laminar flow.

When compared to the round jet, the slot jet provided more uniform heat flux on the impingement plate, but the peak heat flux was not so concentrated. The slot jet produced different heat flux distributions along the length and width of the impingement plate, and the average heat flux was higher along the direction of the slot width (i. e., the plate width) in the present study, especially when the Reynolds number or the equivalence ratio was increased.

40|$|The scalar {{dissipation}} rate {{is widely used}} in combustion analysis to describe a characteristic transport time scale. This time scale is often used with Damköhler number arguments (describing {{the ratio of the}} mixing time to the chemical time) to determine if kinematic conditions within reacting flows will cause extinction. However, for extinction analysis in fires, transport time scales are assumed to be relatively long and flow effects are generally ignored. In the current study, transport time scales in fires and their associated scalar {{dissipation rate}}s are explored analytically and computationally to determine if extinction events should be expected in fires and under what conditions they may occur. Particular attention is given to the compartment fire scenario where air vitiation effects will weaken flames and increase the probability of extinction.

The <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> with large aspect ratio (L/W), length of L= 60 mm and width of W= 6 mm was used to eliminate the three- dimensional effect of temperature field. Two kinds of mixed fuels, LFG 70 (70 %CH 4 - 30 %CO 2 on volume basis) and LFG 50 (50 %CH 4 - 50 %CO 2) were used to investigate flame characteristics under the test conditions of 100 ≤ Re ≤ 600 and 0. 7 ≤ φ ≤ 1. 3. The present measurement reveals that the variation of maximum flame temperature with increment of Reynolds number is mainly due to heat transfer effects and is negligible. On the other hand, the equivalence ratio and fuel composition have a noticeable effect on flame temperature. In addition, the results show that the LFG flames compared to the CH 4 ones have a lower flame temperature. With increment of CO 2 volume fraction at lean combustion, thermal flame height is augmented while at stoichiometric and rich combustion, its value reduced. Thermal flame height augments linearly by Reynolds number increase, while its increment at rich mixture is higher and the effect of Reynolds number at lean mixtures is insignificant.

However, {{it is well known}} that most systems behave differently at cold start and in the permanent regime and the coupling between the temperature of the solid material and combustion instabilities still remains unclear. The aim of this thesis is to study this mechanism. This work presents an experimental investigation of combustion instabilities for a laminar premixed flame stabilized on a <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> with controlled wall temperature. For certain operating conditions, the system exhibits a combustion instability locked on the Helmholtz mode of the burner. It is shown that this instability can be controlled and even suppressed by changing solely the temperature of the burner rim. A linear stability analysis is used to identify the parameters playing a role in the resonant coupling and retrieves the features observed experimentally. Detailed experimental studies of the different elementary processes involved in the thermo-acoustic coupling are used to evaluate the sensitivity of these parameters to the wall temperature. Finally a theoretical model of unsteady heat transfer from the flame root to the burner-rim and detailed experimental measurements permit to establish the physical mechanism for the temperature dependance on the flame response.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} propagation {{speed of}} a premixed flame can be significantly enhanced by the onset of Darrieus–Landau (DL) instability within the wrinkled and corrugated flamelet regimes of turbulent com- bustion. Previous studies have revealed the existence of clearly distinct regimes of turbulent propagation, depending {{on the presence of}} DL instabilities or lack thereof, named here as super- and subcritical respec- tively, characterized by different scaling laws for the turbulent flame speed. In this study we present experimental turbulent flame speed measurements for propane/air mixtures at atmospheric pressure, variable equivalence ratio at Lewis numbers greater than one obtained within a Bun- sen geometry with particle image velocimetry diagnostics. By varying the equivalence ratio we act on the cut-off wavelength and can thus control DL instability. A classification of observed flames into sub/super- critical regimes is achieved through the characterization of their morphology in terms of flame curvature statistics. Numerical low-Mach number simulations of weakly turbulent two-dimensional methane/air <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> flames are also performed both in {{the presence or absence of}} DL instability and are observed to exhibit similar morphological properties. We show that experimental normalized turbulent propane flame speeds S T =S L are subject to two distinct scaling laws, as a function of the normalized turbulence intensity U rms =S L, depending on the sub/supercrit- ical nature of the propagation regime. We also conjecture, based on the experimental results, that at higher values of turbulence intensity a transition occurs whereby the effects of DL instability become shadowed by the dominant effect of turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{with several}} {{different}} flame holder geometries {{were conducted to}} investigate {{the degree to which}} combustion roughness can be altered by altering the flame intensity and flame distribution in a ducted combustion system. The effect of admitting primary air through a plane-slotted or a slotted-swirl vane flame holder was compared and the combustion roughness and noise was contrasted with that obtained with a closed front-end perforated can. The <b>slotted</b> front-end <b>burners</b> produced much smoother burning and less noise than the closed front-end can. No advantage was apparent with swirl vs nonswirl when approximately the same inlet flow distribution was maintained. Preheated inlet air provided somewhat smoother combustion as compared with ambient temperature air. The combustion roughness with methyl alcohol was briefly compared with that of isooctane; indications are that it burns more smoothly, but more detailed studies are needed to substantiate these indications...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} partial premixing on locally rich, near-stoichiometric, and lean flame regions were {{investigated}} in stratified, iso-octane/air turbulent V-flames by varying the mean equivalence ratio gradient along the exit plane of a rectangular <b>slot</b> <b>burner.</b> Instantaneous {{heat release rate}} (HRR) images {{were obtained from the}} product of spatially registered, near-simultaneously acquired OH and CH 2 O planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) images. HRR data were analyzed within a region of interest (ROI) that was determined from separate 3 -pentanone tracer PLIF measurements. The ROI was unique to each gradient flame setting, and was configured to ensure the mean range of equivalence ratios being analyzed was constant among gradient conditions. This allowed distinction of the effects of mean equivalence ratio gradient at the flame front from effects associated with having different ranges of equivalence ratios within the flame zone. Individual flame realizations were studied for differences in the local peak HRR and instantaneous flame thickness 3 ̆b 4 t as they varied with curvature among gradient conditions. While general trends for the fully-premixed cases were consistent with Lewis number theory, subtle changes in the normalized distribution of local peak HRR vs. curvature were observed for locally rich and locally lean flames propagating in different mean 3 ̆d 5 gradients. Negligible changes were observed for near-stoichiometric flames, suggesting that gradient effects may influence the local thermodiffusive stability of off-stoichiometric mixtures more significantly. Ensemble averages of individual peak HRR and 3 ̆b 4 t values within each ROI were separately evaluated, and differences among gradient conditions were greater than those observed for the normalized distributions with curvature. For all flame settings considered, an increase in either of the peak HRR or 3 ̆b 4 t led to a decrease in the other. Gradient effects were observed when comparing back- and front-supported locally rich flames, which experienced opposite changes in peak HRR of + 10. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study of turbulent fire suppression is presented. For this work, a novel and canonical facility has been developed, featuring a buoyant, turbulent, methane or propane-fueled diffusion flame suppressed via either nitrogen dilution of the oxidizer or {{application of a}} fine water mist. Flames are stabilized on a <b>slot</b> <b>burner</b> surrounded by a co-flowing oxidizer, which allows controlled delivery of either suppressant to achieve a range of conditions from complete combustion through partial and total flame quenching. A minimal supply of pure oxygen is optionally applied along the burner to provide a strengthened flame base that resists liftoff extinction and permits the study of substantially weakened turbulent flames. The carefully designed facility features well-characterized inlet and boundary conditions that are especially amenable to numerical simulation. Non-intrusive diagnostics provide detailed measurements of suppression behavior, yielding insight into the governing suppression processes, and aiding the development and validation of advanced suppression models. Diagnostics include oxidizer composition analysis to determine suppression potential, flame imaging to quantify visible flame structure, luminous and radiative emissions measurements to assess sooting propensity and heat losses, and species-based calorimetry to evaluate global heat release and combustion efficiency. The studied flames experience notable suppression effects, including transition in color from bright yellow to dim blue, expansion in flame height and structural intermittency, and reduction in radiative heat emissions. Still, measurements indicate that the combustion efficiency remains close to unity, and only near the extinction limit do the flames experience an abrupt transition from nearly complete combustion to total extinguishment. Measurements are compared with large eddy simulation results obtained using the Fire Dynamics Simulator, an open-source computational fluid dynamics software package. Comparisons of {{experimental and}} simulated results are {{used to evaluate the}} performance of available models in predicting fire suppression. Simulations in the present configuration highlight the issue of spurious reignition that is permitted by the classical eddy-dissipation concept for modeling turbulent combustion. To address this issue, simple treatments to prevent spurious reignition are developed and implemented. Simulations incorporating these treatments are shown to produce excellent agreement with the experimentally measured data, including the global combustion efficiency...|$|R
