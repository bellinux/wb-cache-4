5000|$|Class 2 - Medium Rigid Vehicle: Any <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> with GLW 18001 kg or {{less with}} light trailer of 3500 kg or less, any {{combination}} vehicle with GCW 12001 kg or less, any <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> of any weight {{with no more}} than two axles, or any Class 1 vehicle.|$|R

30|$|The PRFSS {{includes}} intramunicipal data to have {{a better}} understanding of urban freight activities in a first estimate (light duty vehicles LDV are not included in the survey). Opposite to the international transport, transport within municipalities, with a share of one third of tonnes, produces less than 5 % of running kilometers and 3 % of tonne kilometers. Urban freight activities are not exclusively based on small <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> because they carry less than 10 % of total tonnes, and need the support of medium <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles.</b> There is private service dominance in short distances using small and medium <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Opposite, there is public service dominance in longer distances using higher capacity vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|... any <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a GLW of {{more than}} 18,000 kg that has {{no more than two}} axles ...|$|R

25|$|A Heavy Combination (HC class) license covers semi-trailers, or <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles</b> towing {{a trailer}} with a GTM {{of more than}} 9 tons.|$|R
5000|$|Models {{produced}} {{included both}} two-axle and three-axle <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> {{with large numbers}} of each. In its history, Vétra only built one articulated trolleybus. [...] This was a prototype for Algiers, Algeria. Built in 1950/51, it was designated model VA4.SR and had four axles, three in the front section and one in the trailing section. It was tested on the Paris trolleybus system in January 1951. This prototype was unsuccessful, and it was eventually rebuilt into a three-axle <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R

30|$|Vehicle time {{utilization}} {{varies from}} 71 to 82 % depending on service and vehicle type (Table 2). The lowest value of vehicle time utilization belongs to large <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Heavy Rigid (HR class) license {{covers a}} <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> with 3 or more axles with a towed trailer not {{weighing}} more than 9 tons GTM. Also articulated buses.|$|R
40|$|Up until now, loads {{analyses}} of the X- 33 RLV have been done at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) using aerodynamic loads derived from CFD and wind tunnel models of a <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Control forces and moments are determined using a <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> trajectory analysis and the detailed control load distributions for achieving the desired control forces and moments, again on the <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle,</b> are determined by Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. However, static aeroelastic effects upon the load distributions are not known. The static aeroelastic effects will generally redistribute external loads thereby affecting both the internal structural loads {{as well as the}} forces and moments generated by aerodynamic control surfaces. Therefore, predicted structural sizes as well as maneuvering requirements can be altered by consideration of static aeroelastic effects. The objective of the present work is the development of models and solutions for including static aeroelasticity in the calculation of X- 33 loads and in the determination of stability and control derivatives...|$|R

50|$|In October 2006, Stagecoach ordered 45 Plaxton Panther bodied Volvo B12BT 15-metre 63 seat coaches. The three-axle {{coaches were}} the longest <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the UK on their {{introduction}} to service in February 2007, {{and the first}} of their kind {{to be built in}} Britain.|$|R
50|$|Until 1959, such {{rigidity}} {{was seen}} as beneficial to occupant safety among automotive engineers. Modern theories of vehicle crashworthiness point in the opposite direction, towards vehicles that crumple progressively. A completely <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> might have excellent bumper protection for vehicle components, but would offer poor occupant safety.|$|R
25|$|Class 2: any <b>rigid</b> goods <b>vehicle</b> over 7½ long tons.|$|R
25|$|A Light Rigid (LR class) license {{covers a}} <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a {{gross vehicle mass}} (GVM) not more than 8 tons, with a towed trailer not {{weighing}} more than 9 tons GTM (Gross Trailer Mass).

50|$|Initially, a {{fleet of}} six rigid trolleybuses was {{available}} for use on the Zurich system. They were made by Saurer, Tüscher, FBW and SWS, carried fleet nos. 51 to 56, and differed technically or structurally from each other. By 1957, the number of <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles</b> of various types in the fleet had increased to 57 units.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{due to the}} {{extension}} of the system to Herbstäcker, two used <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> both built in 1961, made their way from Lucerne to Schaffhausen. With a total of 13 trolleybuses, the Schaffhausen fleet thus reached its historical peak. The two ex-Lucerne vehicles, nos. 206 (formerly Lucerne 226) and 207 (formerly Lucerne 227) were in service until 1991.|$|R
50|$|Monorail {{vehicles}} {{often appear}} similar to light rail vehicles, {{and can be}} staffed or unstaffed. They can be individual <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> articulated single units, or multiple units coupled into trains. Like other advanced rapid transit systems, monorails can be driven by linear induction motors; like conventional railways, vehicle bodies can {{be connected to the}} beam via bogies, allowing curves to be negotiated.|$|R
