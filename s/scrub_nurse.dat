40|$|Cases of {{retained}} {{foreign objects}} after surgery {{have been a}} problem {{since the beginning of}} modern surgery. However, the preventive measure to this problem has remained rather primitive – through manual surgical count by <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses.</b> The process of counting is subject to errors under stressful environment, such as time pressure, distractions, and high cognitive workload. The objective {{of this study is to}} measure the differences in the performance and attention patterns according to the expertise of the <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> within an operating theatre, finally drawing a conclusion on the means through which the performance of <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> can be optimized to reduce chances of errors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE The current {{trend toward}} {{increasingly}} integrated technological support {{systems and the}} rise of streamlined processes in the OR have led to a growing demand for personnel with higher levels of training. Although simulation systems are widely used and accepted in surgical training, they are practically non-existent for perioperative <b>nursing,</b> especially <b>scrub</b> <b>nursing.</b> This paper describes and evaluates an interactive OR environment simulation to help train <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses.</b> METHODS A system comprising multiple computers and monitors, including an interactive table and a touchscreen combined with a client-server software solution, was designed to simulate a <b>scrub</b> <b>nurse's</b> workplace. The resulting demonstrator was evaluated under laboratory conditions with a multicenter interview study involving three participating ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments in Germany and Switzerland. RESULTS The participant group of 15 <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> had an average of 12. 8 years hands-on experience in the OR. A series of 22 questions was used to evaluate various aspects of the demonstrator system and its suitability for training novices. DISCUSSION The system received very positive feedback. The participants stated that familiarization with instrument names and learning the instrument table setup were the two most important technical topics for beginners. They found the system useful for acquiring these skills as well as certain non-technical aspects. CONCLUSIONS Interactive training through simulation is a new approach for preparing novice <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> for the challenges at the instrument table in the OR. It can also improve the lifelong training of perioperative personnel. The proposed system is currently unique in its kind. It can be used to train both technical and non-technical skills and, therefore, contributes to patient safety. Moreover, it is not dependent on a specific type of surgical intervention or medical discipline...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{and describe the}} factors that impact {{on the performance of}} scrub nurses' non-technical skills performance during the intra-operative phase of surgery. Background: Non-technical skills have been identified as important precursors to errors in the operating room. However, few studies have investigated factors influencing non-technical skills of <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses.</b> Design: Prospective observational study. Methods: Structured observations were performed on a sample of 182 surgical procedures across eight specialities by two trained observers from August 2012 -April 2013 at two hospital sites. Participants were purposively selected <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses.</b> Bivariate correlations and a multiple linear regression model were used to identify associations among length of surgery, patients' acuity using the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification system, team familiarity, number of occasions scout nurses leave the operating room, change of scout nurse and the outcome, the non-technical skills performance of <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses.</b> Results: Patient acuity and team familiarity were the strongest predictors of scrub nurses' non-technical skills performance at hospital site A. There were no correlations between the predictors and the performance of <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> at hospital site B. Conclusion: A dedicated surgical team and patient acuity potentially influence the performance of scrub nurses' non-technical skills. Familiarity with team members foster advanced planning, thus minimizing distractions and interruptions that impact on scrub nurses' performance. Development of interventions aimed at improving non-technical skills has the potential to make a substantial difference and enhance patient care. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background There is no {{widely used}} method to {{evaluate}} procedure-specific laparoscopic skills. The first {{aim of this}} study was to develop a procedure-based assessment method. The second aim was to compare its validity, reliability and feasibility with currently available global rating scales (GRSs). Methods An independence-scaled procedural assessment was created by linking the procedural key steps of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy to an independence scale. Subtitled and blinded videos of a novice, an intermediate and an almost competent trainee, were evaluated with GRSs (OSATS and GOALS) and the independence-scaled procedural assessment by seven surgeons, three senior trainees and six <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses.</b> Participants received a short introduction to the GRSs and independence-scaled procedural assessment before assessment. The validity was estimated with the Friedman and Wilcoxon test and the reliability with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). A questionnaire was used to evaluate user opinion. Results Independence-scaled procedural assessment and GRS scores improved significantly with surgical experience (OSATS p = 0. 001, GOALS p < 0. 001, independence-scaled procedural assessment p < 0. 001). The ICCs of the OSATS, GOALS and independence-scaled procedural assessment were 0. 78, 0. 74 and 0. 84, respectively, among surgeons. The ICCs increased when the ratings of <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> were added to those of the surgeons. The independence-scaled procedural assessment was not considered more of an administrative burden than the GRSs (p = 0. 692). Discussion/conclusion A procedural assessment created by combining procedural key steps to an independence scale is a valid, reliable and acceptable assessment instrument in surgery. In contrast to the GRSs, the reliability of the independence-scaled procedural assessment exceeded the threshold of 0. 8, indicating that it can also be used for summative assessment. It furthermore seems that <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> can assess the operative competence of surgical trainees...|$|R

40|$|Background: Surgical teams rely on {{surgical}} gloves as {{a barrier}} to protect themselves against blood-borne pathogenic infections during surgery. Double-gloving is adopted by surgeons to tackle the problem of glove perforation. Nevertheless, double-gloving is not practiced commonly by operating room nurses and there are only limited studies about double-gloving that targets only perioperative nurses. The aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness of double-gloving in protecting perioperative nurses by comparing the frequency of glove perforation between single-gloving and double-gloving groups. Methods: A prospective and randomized study was performed. Nurses were assigned randomly to single-gloved and double-gloved groups for comparison of the glove perforation rate. Water-leakage and air-inflation tests were used to detect glove perforation. Results: Glove perforations was detected in 10 of 112 sets of single-gloves (8. 9 %) and 12 of 106 sets of outer gloves in the double-gloved group (11. 3 %). There was no inner double-glove perforation (0 %). Glove perforations were found in 6 and 4 of the 112 sets of single-gloves for the first assistants (5. 36 %) and the <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> (3. 57 %), and 5 and 7 of 106 sets of outer gloves in the double-gloved group for the first assistants (4. 72 %) and the <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> (6. 60 %), respectively. The average occurrence of perforation was 69. 8 minutes (range, 20 - 110 min) after the beginning of surgery. The sites of perforation were localized mostly on the left middle finger (42 %) and the left ring finger (33. 3 %). Conclusions: Based on the findings of the study, double-gloving is indeed effective in protecting operating room nurses against blood-borne pathogen exposure. It should be introduced as a routine practice. Institute of Textiles and ClothingSchool of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} study, a {{literature}} review and semi-structured interviews with experienced <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> (n= 25) and consultant surgeons (n= 9), identified ‘communication’, ‘teamwork’, ‘situation awareness’ and ‘coping with stress’ skills as important skills for scrub practitioners. The second study used focus groups (n= 4 groups) of experienced <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> (total n= 16 participants) to sort and label the extracted non-technical skill data, from study 1, into skill categories and underlying elements. The focus groups also generated ‘behavioural markers’ describing good and poor performance of those elements. This preliminary taxonomy contained eight categories with 28 underlying elements. An expert panel, comprising two psychologists and a {{subject matter expert}} used an iterative process, {{with reference to the}} system design guidelines, to refine the taxonomy. The resulting prototype was called the Scrub Practitioners’ List of Intraoperative Non-Technical Skills (SPLINTS) system which had three skill categories – ‘Situation awareness’; ‘Communication and teamwork’; ‘Task management’, each of which had three underlying elements. The third study tested the psychometric properties of the prototype SPLINTS system. Scrub practitioners (n= 34) attended a single-day evaluation session where they received training (5 hours) and practice (1 hour) using the SPLINTS system before rating the scrub practitioner’s behaviour seen in standardized surgical video scenarios (n= 7) (1 hour). Within-group agreement was acceptable (r wg >. 7) for the three skill categories and for six of the nine elements. Future work will assess the usability of SPLINTS system in the operating theatre environment. This project has provided scrub practitioners with a structured method for training and assessing an important aspect of performance, which could help to reduce adverse events in the operating theatre.

40|$|Abstract — The current {{trend toward}} robot assistants and the {{execution}} of autonomous tasks in minimally invasive surgery increases the operation complexity of telepresence systems. The available input channels are currently limited to traditional human-computer interfaces. We introduce two human-robot interfacing modalities that aim to make robotic surgery more intuitive. To reduce the surgeon’s mental load, gaze-contingent camera control is implemented. Eye tracking is performed by means of head worn tracking goggles. The tracking goggles are tightly integrated with a stereoscopic visualization system, based on the polarization method. The second technique supports <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> during surgical tool interaction, e. g. tool exchange, via haptic gestures executed on the robot. Strain-gauges sensors installed at the instrument are used to detect hand tapping sequences, which trigger activation of specified commands. I...|$|R

40|$|Infections are a {{major source}} of {{morbidity}} and cause of mortality during the post-operative phase for patients. Wound infections are the second most commonly encountered type of nosocomial, hospital-acquired, infection in the United States (Nichols, 2007 : 8). Owing to the fact that wound infection may be induced, such as, by not applying infection control and sterile technique principles in the operating room complex, it is imperative to implement infection control principles and apply sterile technique principles. The researcher noticed that some of the sterile technique principles were not carried out in the operating room complex which lead to the necessity to assess the knowledge of registered nurses’ regarding the implementation of infection control and sterile technique principles. The main goal {{of the study was to}} explore and describe the knowledge of registered nurses’ in two private hospitals in the Nelson Mandela Metropole, related to infection control and sterile technique principles in the operating room complex. Following the analysis of the data, the researcher made recommendations for changes to be made to the existing infection control guidelines in the operating room complex. The research design was quantitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual in nature. The sample consisted of all the registered <b>nurses</b> known as <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses,</b> in the operating room complex. The unit managers were excluded from the study, because the researcher utilized their assistance with the handing out and collecting of the questionnaires because, not all <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> were at work at the same time. Firstly a pilot study was conducted (in both private hospitals) to confirm the reliability of the data collection instrument. Data was collected by means of a questionnaire that was self-administered and consisted out of three sections: Section A – Biographical Data; Section B – Knowledge Base Related to Infection Control Principles and Section C – Knowledge Base Related to the Principles of Asepsis.

We have studied the incidence and circumstances of surgical glove perforation using a sensitive electronic device. The glove perforation rate during elective general surgery was compared with that seen during an anastomosis workshop, where surgical trainees operated in a laboratory setting. A total of 220 gloves were tested for perforations pre- and postoperatively during general elective surgical procedures. During the surgical training workshop 72 gloves were tested. Fifty-two gloves (24 %) were perforated during surgical procedures.

The perforation rate for <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> was surprisingly high at 22 %. Glove perforation among trainees was significantly lower during workshop procedures than at elective surgery (17 % vs 46 %, P < 0. 05, chi 2), probably because glove perforation occurs commonly at wound closure.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{physical}} and chemical agents are capable to course chromosomal aberra-tions. Ionizing radiation is frequent and well known course of chromosomal aberrations. If de-oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is irradiated before synthesis chromosomal – type aberrations are caused. Chromatid – type aberrations are results of DNA damages occurred during or after synthesis. Some of these changes could exist at patients several years after exposition. Biologi-cal dosymetry – cytogenetics analysis of persons occupational exposed to ionizing radiation in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{have been carried out}} in "Center for Human Genet-ics " of Medical Faculty in Sarajevo. In this study we have evaluated cytogenetics fi ndings of persons employed in a zone of radiation. Cytogenetics fi ndings have been demonstrated in al-lowed limit in (,) examinees, and cytogenetics fi ndings were out of normal values in (,) examinees. Th e majorities who have been employed in a zone of ionizing radiation were in age group - (,) and age group - (,). Radiological technicians (,) were exposed the most to ionizing radiation, than clinical nurse specialists (,), radiolo-gists (,), physicians (,) machines technicians (,), pneumologist (,), orthopedists (,) and <b>scrub</b> <b>nurses</b> (,). Biological dosimetry – cytogenetics analysis have been carried out at (,) male and (,) female examinees. Th e most frequent aberration have been presented with, in the form of acentric fragments, than chromatid fragments with,, dicentric chromosomes with,, gaps with,, minutes with, and interarm interchanges with,.
