He and his brother and four sisters emigrated to the United States to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm near Belleville, Illinois. The family later moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where both parents died. After serving as an {{apprentice}} confectioner in St. Louis, Dekum and a friend, Frederick Bickel, went gold prospecting in California and Idaho before settling in Portland.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film {{could be made}} for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be {{impossible}} to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after Mitch Glazer declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.|$|E

If he cooperates, McGarrett will ensure they stay in America. Sang Min reveals that Hesse is going to leave the island on a Chinese freighter. Danny and McGarrett hastily drive to the docks. They then proceed to assault the freighter, where they {{dispatch}} several of Hesse's guards. McGarrett confronts Hesse, and shoots him off the boat. At the end of the episode, the new team settle into their new office space, and cannot <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> name for their new unit.|$|E

5|$|In the Star Trek universe, {{prior to}} the arrival of Voyager in the Delta Quadrant, {{hostilities}} between the Trabe and the Kazon led to the Trabe keeping them subjugated. Violence between the Kazon was encouraged to limit the risk of them rising up against the Trabe. Before being conquered by the Trabe, the Kazon were the most advanced society in the quadrant. On stardate 2346, Jal Sankur united the sects into the Kazon Order or the Kazon Collective to overthrow the Trabe. The Kazon stole the Trabe's technology and ships and, rather than <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new homeworld, became a nomadic species. After achieving independence from the Trabe, the Kazon continued to fight among themselves for control of resources and technology.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, a large anti-Polish protest {{took place}} in Lazdijai, with cries to march on Sejny. The last Lithuanian attempt to retake the town was made on August 28. The Lithuanians (about 650 men) were {{defeated}} by the combined forces of the Polish Army (800 men) and PMO volunteers (500 men). On August 27, the Poles officially demanded that Lithuanians retreat behind the Foch Line. On September 1, Rudnicki announced incorporation of PMO volunteers into the 41st Infantry Regiment. During the negotiations on September 5, representatives {{of the two groups}} agreed to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> detailed demarcation line; Lithuanians agreed to retreat by September 7. The Polish regular army units did not cross the Foch Line, and refused to aid the PMO insurgents still operating on the Lithuanian side.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 1846, after a final {{attempt to}} {{pressure}} Mexico to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boundary for Texas, Secretary of War William L. Marcy ordered Brigadier General Zachary Taylor {{to move his}} army, which included May's dragoon squadron, to the Rio Grande. Taylor's destination was the river's north bank, directly opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros, which stood at a natural choke-point and controlled access to well-traveled routes to the south. When Taylor refused to leave the region, Mexican cavalry ambushed a dragoon detachment under Captain Seth B. Thornton on April 25, 1846, which officially commenced hostilities. On May 8, 1846, the two main forces met at the Battle of Palo Alto, where May's squadron was held in reserve and mounted an unsuccessful cavalry charge.|$|E

25|$|Hearts {{finished}} league runners-up {{again in}} 1988 and 1992. The club reached the quarter-finals of the 1988–89 UEFA Cup losing out to Bayern Munich 2–1 on aggregate. After MacDonald's summer 1990 departure the club struggled to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> manager. Within a two-year period, Joe Jordan, Sandy Clark and Tommy McLean were all sacked.

25|$|Moreover, the {{new system}} was {{dramatically}} simpler to use. After locating the target in the sighting system, the bombardier simply made fine adjustments using two control wheels throughout the bomb run. There {{was no need for}} external calculation, lookup tables or pre-run measurements - everything was carried out automatically through an internal wheel-and-disc calculator. The calculator took a short time to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> solution, with setups as short as 6 seconds, compared to the 50 needed for the Mk. XI to measure its ground speed. In general, the bomb run needed to be only 30 seconds long.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{signing with}} Corinthians in January 2010, Roberto Carlos told TV Globo {{that he hoped}} {{to play at the}} 2010 World Cup and {{believed}} his return to Brazilian football may help him return to the national team, as manager Dunga had yet to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> left back. However, he was left off the 30-man provisional squad that was submitted to FIFA on 11 May 2010, along with Ronaldinho and Ronaldo. Despite his deep desire to do so, Roberto Carlos was ultimately not named in Dunga's final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad for the World Cup. Instead, Brazil newcomer Michel Bastos earned a spot for the left back position.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Davis {{had been}} clearly {{struggling}} with his game, displaying the classic {{symptoms of a}} confidence problem in his technique. His cue action, which was once regarded by his peers as {{the best in the}} game, was now in tatters, with Davis seemingly unable to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> feathering up drill, going from slow and deliberate in some matches to randomly speeding up in others. He also soon brought comments from commentators with regard to his overreliance on safety play, and over thinking his shots. It was clear that Davis had a serious problem and ultimately one he would never recover from. 1989 proved to be his last appearance in a World Final, unthinkable at the time.|$|E

25|$|Miyamoto {{made several}} {{games for the}} Nintendo 64, mostly from his {{previous}} franchises. His first game on the new system, {{and one of its}} launch titles, was Super Mario 64, for which he was the principal director. In developing the game, he began with character design and the camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take, and spent months to select an appropriate camera view and layout. The original concept involved a fixed path much like an isometric type game, before the choice was made to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> free-roaming 3D design. He guided the design of the Nintendo 64 controller in tandem with that of Super Mario 64.|$|E
25|$|In August 1850 William Strong {{arrived in}} the Oregon Territory after being {{appointed}} by President Taylor to the Oregon Supreme Court the previous year. The trip to Oregon for the family started aboard the ship Supply that took them around Cape Horn on {{the southern tip of}} South America to San Francisco, California where they transferred to a sloop-of-war vessel named the Falmouth that delivered them to Astoria, Oregon on August 13. On the trip were also Strong’s wife and two children, the new secretary for the territory Edward D. Hamilton, and the new governor John P. Gaines, but Strong’ oldest son Frederick died after contracting Yellow Fever in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Strong family would then <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Cathlamet on the Columbia River where William would file a land claim under the Donation Land Claim Act on September 27.|$|E
25|$|Although Congress did not {{formally}} adopt the McMillan Plan, {{it began to}} implement it piecemeal {{over the next several}} years. In 1910, Congress enacted legislation establishing the United States Commission of Fine Arts, a body of federally-appointed architects, landscape architects, and others who began to formally push for construction of the bridge envisioned by the McMillan Plan. On March 4, 1913, Congress enacted the Public Buildings Act which, among other things, created and funded an Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission whose purpose was to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> design for the bridge and report back to Congress. Its members included the President of the United States, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairs of the committees on public grounds and buildings of the House and Senate (or their designees). But Congress appropriated no money for the commission's operation due to the onset of World War I, and it remained inactive.|$|E

25|$|While the astrophysical {{community}} {{has yet to}} <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single, universally favored model for the progenitors of short GRBs, the generally preferred model is the merger of two compact objects {{as a result of}} gravitational inspiral: two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole. While thought to be rare in the Universe, a small number of cases of close neutron star - neutron star binaries are known in our Galaxy, and neutron star - black hole binaries are believed to exist as well. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, systems of this nature will slowly lose energy due to gravitational radiation and the two degenerate objects will spiral closer and closer together, until in the last few moments, tidal forces rip the neutron star (or stars) apart and an immense amount of energy is liberated before the matter plunges into a single black hole. The whole process is believed to occur extremely quickly and be completely over within a few seconds, accounting for the short nature of these bursts. Unlike long-duration bursts, there is no conventional star to explode and therefore no supernova.|$|E
25|$|A Pawnee tribal {{delegation}} visited President Thomas Jefferson. In 1806 Lieutenant Zebulon Pike, Major G. C. Sibley, Major S. H. Long, among others, began {{visiting the}} Pawnee villages. Under pressure from Siouan tribes and European-American settlers, the Pawnee ceded territory to the United States government in treaties in 1818, 1825, 1833, 1848, 1857, and 1892. In 1857, they {{settled on the}} Pawnee Reservation along the Loup River in present-day Nance County, Nebraska, but maintained their traditional way of life. They were subjected to continual raids by Lakota {{from the north and}} west. On one such raid, a Sioux war party of over 1,000 warriors ambushed a Pawnee hunting party of 350 men, women and children. The Pawnee had gained permission to leave the reservation and hunt buffalo. About 70 Pawnee were killed in this attack, which occurred in a canyon in present-day Hitchcock County. The site is known as Massacre Canyon. Because of the ongoing hostilities with the Sioux and encroachment from American settlers to the south and east, the Pawnee decided to leave their Nebraska reservation in the 1870s and <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new reservation in Indian Territory, located in what is today Oklahoma.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Rocker {{was once}} again an {{important}} figure in a strike by London's garment makers. In late April, 1,500 tailors from the West End, who were more highly skilled and better-paid {{than those in the}} East End, started striking. By May, the total number was between 7,000 and 8,000. Since much of the West Enders' work was now being performed in the East End, the tailors' union there, {{under the influence of the}} Arbeter Fraint group, decided to support the strike. Rudolf Rocker on the one hand saw this as a chance for the East End tailors to attack the sweatshop system, but on the other was afraid of an anti-Semitic backlash, should the Jewish workers remain idle. He called for a general strike. His call was not followed, since over seventy percent of the East End tailors were engaged in the ready-made trade, which was not linked with the West End workers' strike. Nonetheless, 13,000 immigrant garment workers from the East End went on strike following a May 8 assembly at which Rocker spoke. Not one worker voted against a strike. Rocker became a member of the strike committee and chairman of the finance sub-committee. He was responsible for collecting money and other necessities for the striking workers. On the side he published the Arbeter Fraint newspaper on a daily basis to disseminate news about the strike. He spoke at the workers' assemblies and demonstrations. On May 24 a mass meeting was held to discuss the question of whether to <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> compromise proposed by the employers, which did not entail a closed union shop. A speech by Rocker convinced the workers to continue the strike. By the next morning, all of the workers' demands were met.|$|E
