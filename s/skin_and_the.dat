5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may {{complain}} of abdominal pain (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of the abdomen), fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise). Some may report jaundice (yellow discoloration of the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> whites of the eyes).|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed on metallic sandwich structures as an armor for aeronautical applications. Several combinations of AA 5086 -H 111 aluminium <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> aluminium honeycomb core have been studied, considering medium-velocity <b>and</b> highenergy impacts. <b>The</b> aim is to establish links between <b>the</b> sandwich performances <b>and</b> <b>the</b> material <b>and</b> geometrical parameters. An elasto-plastic, strain-rate dependent behavior has been implemented to represent <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> core. The sandwich model has been calibrated <b>and</b> validated from <b>the</b> experimental data. Dynamic effects, as well as strong couplings between <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> core {{appear to have a}} significant effect on the target performance...|$|R

5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus, but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|The line Ashes, Ashes {{in colonial}} {{versions}} of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or blackening of their <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> theory has been adapted {{to be applied to}} other {{versions of the}} rhyme. In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague.|$|E

5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> joints.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A is mounted slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on the starboard side at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the aircraft's centerline. The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) ammunition drum can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, armor plates of differing thicknesses between the aircraft <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> emergence of additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design {{proved to be the}} most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear as unique as possible.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} parts and {{derivatives}} of pygmy lorises in trade, {{such as the}} <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hair. All parts of the animal are used in traditional Khmer medicine. In Vietnam, medicine such as bone glue of monkey, is mainly produced by local people, but a smaller portion is also destined for restaurants or sold to visitors. The species is especially used for the assumed medicinal value of its hair. Traders have reported that they have difficulty keeping pace with demand—one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. In Cambodia, the deeply rooted tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow loris in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes were {{probably}} common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different {{parts of their}} bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread. Shields, sandals and drums were made using the <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins {{was used by the}} medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds. The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in North America on June 7, 2011, in Europe on June 8, 2011, in Australia on June 9, 2011, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany on June 10, 2011, and in Japan on July 7, 2011. On February 18, 2011, before the game's release, Special Edition and Hero Edition versions of Infamous 2 were announced for pre-order. The Special Edition included an Original Cole skin, a Golden Amp <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Electrocution Grenade power. The Hero Edition included everything from the Special Edition but also included: a Cole MacGrath statue, a sportable sling pack modeled after Cole’s, a Kessler skin, the Lightning Hook power, a Reaper skin, a Sly Cooper's cane skin, a samurai sword skin, a caveman club skin, the Infamous #1 comic, and Infamous 2 The Red Soundtrack. The Hero Edition came {{with all of the}} DLC except for the Stalker Grenades and the Sniper Blast powers, and the three extra Subway Missions, which are now all available via the PlayStation Store.|$|E
50|$|The quagga (Equus quagga quagga) became {{extinct in}} the wild in the late 1870s due to hunting for meat <b>and</b> <b>skins,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subspecies' endling died in captivity on 12 August 1883 at the Artis in Amsterdam.|$|R

25|$|The <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lens {{have the}} same embryological origin and so can be {{affected}} by similar diseases. Those with atopic dermatitis and eczema occasionally develop shield ulcers cataracts. Ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with cuneiform cataracts and nuclear sclerosis. Basal-cell nevus and pemphigus have similar associations.|$|E
50|$|The postganglionic axons of the SCG {{innervate}} {{blood vessels}} in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> cause <b>the</b> vessels to constrict. Constriction of the blood vessels causes a decrease in {{blood flow to the}} skin leading to paling of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> retention of body heat. This plays into the fight-or-flight response, decreasing blood flow to facial <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> redirecting <b>the</b> blood to more important areas like the blood vessels of muscles.|$|R

25|$|Beothuk canoes {{were made}} of caribou or seal <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bow of the canoe was {{stiffened}} with spruce bark.

25|$|The {{appropriate}} surgical {{management of}} an alar lobule defect {{depends upon the}} dimensions (length, width, depth) of the wound. Anatomically, the nasal <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semi-rigid aesthetic subunit that forms the graceful curve of the alar rim, and provides unobstructed airflow through the nostrils, the anterior nares.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{influence}} of Christian Evangelicals caused arrangements for mixed bathing to be reassessed. Moral pressures forced some town councils to establish zones for the women and men to bathe separately. A half-hearted attempt was made to suggest to men that torso-suits would be fashionable, but this was resisted by genteel swimmers who believed that torso-suits restricted the contact between the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> saltwater.|$|E
