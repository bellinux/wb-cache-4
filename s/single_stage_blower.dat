40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a compliant foil bearing for estimation of the thrust force in a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> radial <b>blower</b> under operational conditions. The bump foil of the thrust bearing behaves as a nonlinear spring. The knowledge of the spring deflection curve allows estimation of the actual thrust force for a measured bump deflection at the given rotational speed. To acquire the deflection curve, static calibration of the axial shaft displacement sensor was performed. During the calibration, the information about voltage signals of the sensor for the given loading force was collected. The measured voltage values at different speeds and loadswere then converted into the thrust force. The results were verified by comparison to the thrust force resulting from the pressure distribution on the impeller...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} unusual {{features}} of this military engine is the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fan; most trainer and combat engines have multi-staged fans, <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fans normally being the preserve of civil and military transport turbofans. Ivchenko Lotarev chose a very low specific thrust (net thrust/airflow) cycle for the DV-2, so a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fan is sufficient to develop the desired fan pressure ratio. Even so, the pressure ratio produced is somewhat higher than that normally developed by a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fan. Owing to the low specific thrust, the bypass ratio for the engine is higher than normal for a military turbofan.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of specific power requirements and the membrane {{area on the}} CO 2 recovery ratio and the CO 2 concentration is investigated for CO 2 membrane separation from a pressurized gas stream. Three different membrane configurations of a simple <b>single</b> <b>stage,</b> a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> with permeate recycle, and an ideal two-cascade are considered. A feed gas containing 40 % H 2 and 60 % CO 2 and having a total pressure of 2. 5 MPa is used. In the cases of a simple <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> and a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> with permeate recycle, a higher CO 2 recovery ratio leads to a larger membrane area and higher energy consumption for the gas recycle. In addition, a higher CO 2 concentration needs a larger membrane area and considerable power. An ideal two-cascade reduces the compressor power requirement as compared to a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> with permeate recycle; however, it increases the membrane area. A lower CO 2 concentration in the recovered CO 2 stream implies a smaller membrane area and lower power requirement in the CO 2 capture from the pressurized gas stream...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} a pilot-scale spiral wound nanofiltration cascade with regard to separation of mono- and disaccharides from a mixture of inulin of different polymer sizes. The choices of the membrane and operational conditions were based on <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> experiments. Two 3 -stage cascade configurations with GE membranes were tested, a counter-current product recycle cascade (configuration 1) and an adapted cascade (configuration 2). The results show that the performance of the cascaded systems is significantly improved as compared to conventional <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> concentration and diafiltration. The yield increased from 77 % in a conventional <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> system, to 89 % in a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> diafiltration system, to 99 % in the cascaded systems. The yield is improved without any loss in purity. The purity of the inulin mixture was in the range of 94 - 96 %. </p...|$|R
