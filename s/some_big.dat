5|$|Billy Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider {{who rode}} the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute {{uprising}} of 1860 he was chased by {{a band of}} Paiute Indians on horseback {{and was forced to}} retreat into the hills behind <b>some</b> <b>big</b> rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike <b>some</b> <b>big</b> cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E

Norris was a fast-rising prospect with slick skills and <b>some</b> <b>big</b> wins under his belt already. Ferguson's ring rust showed as he was outpointed over 12 dull rounds.|$|E
25|$|The 1912 Giro d'Italia saw <b>some</b> <b>big</b> {{changes to}} how the general {{classification}} was to be run; the race was to be centered around the team instead of the individual, meaning that {{the leader of the}} race would be a single team.

The changes to the general classification were met with strong opposition from the start. Fourteen teams lined up at the start in Milan. Atala-Dunlop, which consisted of Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, Eberardo Pavesi, and Giovanni Micheletto, led the race from start to finish. Ganna was the only member of Atala-Dunlop that didn't finish the race, as he dropped out during the fifth stage. Galetti became the first three-time winner of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
