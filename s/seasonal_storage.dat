40|$|Ground source {{heat storage}} can {{condition}} buildings with reduced consumption of fossil fuels, {{an important issue}} in modem building design. However, <b>seasonal</b> heat <b>storage</b> can cause soil temperature fluctuations and possibly deformation of soft clays. This thesis evaluates the thermo-mechanical response of soft clays to <b>seasonal</b> heat <b>storage</b> and associated temperature fluctuations. A literature review reveals that, in normally consolidated to lightly overconsolidated clays, increases in soil temperature can lead to significant plastic strains {{and a reduction in}} soil strength. This behavior can be modeled through constitutive formulations that include thermal strain within the elasto-plastic framework of the well-known Modified Cam-Clay Model. The current research uses the MCC Picard (1994) model to study the ground response to a buried heat exchange pipe. The spacing of the pipe was found to govern the effectiveness of ground heat storage. With only one pipe in semi-infinite soil, heat transfer to the ground dissipates quickly and thermal-mechanical interaction is negligible; however, <b>seasonal</b> heat <b>storage</b> is not possible. Closely spaced heat pipes would permit effective <b>seasonal</b> heat <b>storage,</b> but could undergo significant thermally induced consolidation deformations. by Shoshanna Dawn Saxe. Thesis (S.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} recover surface mass or geoid height changes from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) time-variable gravity models, spatial smoothing {{is required to}} minimize errors from noise. Spatial smoothing, such as Gaussian smoothing, not only reduces the noise but also attenuates the real signals. Here we investigate possible amplitude attenuations and phase changes of <b>seasonal</b> water <b>storage</b> variations in four drainage basins (Amazon, Mississippi, Ganges and Zambezi) using an advanced global land data assimilation system. It appears that Gaussian smoothing significantly affects GRACE-estimated basin-scale <b>seasonal</b> water <b>storage</b> changes, e. g., {{in the case of}} 800 km smoothing, annual amplitudes are reduced by about 25 - 40 %, while annual phases are shifted by up to 10 °. With these effects restored, GRACE-estimated water storage changes are consistently larger than model estimates, indicating that the land surface model appears to underestimate terrestrial water storage change. Our analysis based on simulation suggests that normalized attenuation effects (from Gaussian smoothing) on <b>seasonal</b> water <b>storage</b> change are relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the true signal.
