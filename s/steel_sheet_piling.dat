40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. <b>Steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{structures}} in the marine environment is a major problem. The deterioration {{of this kind of}} structures is costly and difficult to predict both when designing new structures and when estimating the remaining service life time for existing structures. The aim of this investigation was to find indicative values for the corrosion rate of <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> on the Swedish west coast. Such corrosion rates (mm/year) can be used both when designing new structures by oversizing the steel thickness and when estimating the bearing capacity of existing <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> structures. Earlier investigations on the corrosion rates along the Swedish east coast – with salinity from about 0. 2 % - 0. 8 % – are still used today as guidelines for the corrosion rate of all steel {{structures in the}} Swedish maritime environment even though the salinity on the west coast can be as high as 3. 0 %. <b>Steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wharfs located in the port of Halmstad on the Swedish west coast were inspected by ultrasonic measurements. Three wharf structures with a total length of about 700 m were inspected. None of the inspected wharfs had or have had cathodic protection. The thickness measurements of the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> structures were performed by divers. The age of the three inspected <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> structures ranged from 36 to 51 years. The dimensions of the original <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> sections are known. One of the quay structures is located along a river. The salinity at all wharfs varied from low values at the surface to approx. 2 % at the bottom (also in the river outflow).

The common interlock may be crimped or welded to prevent inter-pile movement, creating an asymmetric section which may exhibit a reduced bending strength due to oblique (biaxial) bending.

40|$|Road between Weleri - Patean is a {{national}} road that has {{an important role in}} regional and national economic development. The road is an alternative route that connects the “Pantura” to the “Selatan” route. In January 2012, there was a catastrophic landslide occurred in kilometers 50 from Weleri to Patean. It 2 ̆ 7 s 6. 8 meters in height and 8 meters in lenght landslide. As result,, only half the roads are passable by vehicles, and by the implementation of on way system, the flow of traffic became pretty slow. After slope stability analysis using Fellenius method is performed, it is shown that the SF or safety factor of the slope is 0. 665 and for 1. 284 by using Plaxis V. 8. 2 program. Both SF less than normal safety factor which is 1. 3. So it can be inferred that the slope is in critical condition. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} install special reinforcement to restrain or stabilize the slope. The first alternative of slope reinforcement is gabion, the second alternative is retaining wall and the third alternative is <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> reinforcement. Based on finite element method calculation using Plaxis V. 8. 2 software, it is found that gabion changes the safety factor of the slope from 1, 284 to 1. 512 and gives 4. 645 cm displacement. Meanwhile, retaining wall increases the value of safety factor from 1. 284 to 1. 538 and gives 4. 365 cm displacement.

50|$|The dam {{was named}} for Samuel T. Hauser. Hauser Dam was a steel dam built on masonry {{footings}} on top of gravel, with {{the ends of the}} dam anchored in bedrock {{on either side of the}} river. The Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company constructed the dam for the power company. J.F. Jackson, a Wisconsin Bridge and Iron engineer, designed the structure. Martin Gerry supervised the construction for the power company. Gerry and Wisconsin Bridge engineer James McKittrick argued several times over the dam's design, and Gerry ordered a number of changes to the dam to strengthen it. The dam was 630 ft long and 75 ft high. Because 300 ft of the center section of the dam was built on a gravel riverbed and the rest on bedrock, sheet pilings (supplied by the L. P. Friestedt Company of Chicago, which had a patented <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> system) were driven 35 ft into the riverbed and the steel of the dam attached to the pilings. The pilings were set at an angle of 1.5:1 to discourage sliding, and a triangular masonry footing capped with concrete on the upstream side set against the pilings in the riverbed to support the dam. The upstream face of the dam was covered in concrete, and a 20 ft deep layer of volcanic ash laid down on the upstream riverbed extending 300 ft from the dam to discourage seeping. The spillway was 500 ft wide and 13 ft deep. The 10 horizontal turbines in the powerhouse delivered 14,000 kilowatts of power. The total cost of the dam at that time was $1.5 million. The United Missouri Power declared Hauser Dam operational on February 12, 1907.|$|E

40|$|Iowa Highway Research Board Project TR- 568 was {{initiated}} in January 2007 {{to investigate the}} use of <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> as an alternative foundation component for Low Volume Road (LVR) bridges. A total of 14 different sites were initially investigated in several counties as potential candidates {{for the construction of}} demonstration projects utilizing steel sheet pile abutments. Based on site conditions, three sites were selected for demonstration projects; these are located in Black Hawk, Boone, and Tama Counties. Each of the demonstration projects utilizes a different experimental abutment system. <b>Steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piling,</b> typically used for retaining structures in the United States, has been used as bearing piles in Europe for the past 50 years and is a potential alternative for use as the primary component in LVR bridge substructures. To investigate the viability of axially-loaded sheet pile abutments, a demonstration project was constructed in Black Hawk County, Iowa. The project involved construction of a 40 ft, single-span bridge utilizing axially-loaded <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> as the primary foundation component. The site chosen for the project consisted of primarily silty clays underlain by shallow bedrock into which the sheet piling was driven. An instrumentation system (consisting of strain gages, deflection transducers, earth pressure cells, and piezometers) was installed on the bridge for obtaining live load test data as well as long term performance data. Live load testing of the bridge structure was performed on November 3, 2008 by placing two loaded trucks (approximately 24 ton each) at various locations on the bridge and recording data. Maximum axial stresses occurring in the piles were approximately 0. 5 ksi and were comparable to estimates made by analysis for a design lane-load distribution width of 10 ft. Flexural stresses, in general, were significantly less than those estimated by analysis and maximum values were approximately 0. 2 ksi. Earth pressures recorded during live load testing (with maxima of approximately 100 psf) were also significantly lower than earth pressures estimated by analysis. These results suggest the method of analysis for lateral earth pressures applied to the sheet pile wall was conservative. Long-term monitoring of the bridge from November 2008 through February 2009 was also performed; the datalogging system was damaged by flooding in March 2009 and subsequent long-term monitoring was terminated. Variations in earth pressure over time were observed with the largest variations in earth pressure occurring behind the abutment cap. The earth pressures experienced cycles that varied in magnitude from 50 psf to 1500 psf, suggesting long-term loading due to freeze/thaw cycles of the soil and the thermal deformation of the superstructure elements may be the critical factors in the design of sheet pile abutment and backfill retaining systems rather than vehicular live loads. The demonstration projects in Boone and Tama Counties were designed using a geosynthetically reinforced soil backfill with a steel sheet pile backfill retention abutment system. Each of the bridge superstructures is supported by spread footings bearing on the reinforced soil mass abutment systems. The bridge superstructure in Boone County is a 100 ft long, three span J 30 C- 87 continuous concrete slab bridge while the superstructure for Tama County utilizes two 89 ft railroad flatcars bolted together. Structural monitoring systems (including strain gages, earth pressure cells, and piezometers) were developed for load testing and long-term monitoring of these projects as well. Construction of the project in Boone County was completed in fall 2009 and live load testing was subsequently performed on November 13, 2009. Maximum flexural stresses experienced in the sheet pile elements were 0. 08 ksi and were significantly lower than estimated by analysis. Vertical and horizontal earth pressures in the backfill (with maxima of 410 psf and 50 psf, respectively) were also lower than expected, suggesting a conservative design approach. Construction of the project in Tama County was completed in August 2010 with subsequent load testing performed in October 2010.

In this paper, three-dimensional finite element model on the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile,</b> purlin, internal support and soil can be established. Through compassion computing value of model and monitoring value, conclusions are drawn...|$|R

The {{following}} spring a new power plant project was undertaken, to provide six boilers, a compressor and a primary connection to the Edison system. An additional waterfront project, comprising two 980 ft timber piers and a <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> bulkhead, {{was started in}} the summer of 1941, followed in September by construction of an additional shop 420 ft long and 120 ft wide.|$|R
