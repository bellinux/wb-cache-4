25|$|After the 1966 {{abolition}} by Louis Robichaud of {{the elected}} County Council level of government, municipalities were constrained to deposit their refuse nearby, as the municipalities {{were unable to}} own property outside their jurisdiction. This led to unsanitary conditions in several locations, and over time the dumps became full. This fact led to a realization that regional service delivery needed to be reinvented. The Regional Service Delivery Act of 2012, which was introduced by Minister of Local Government Bruce Fitch, created bodies corporate that regulate regional planning and <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal,</b> and provide fora for discussion on a regional level of police and emergency services and regional sport, recreational and cultural facilities.

40|$|The {{integrated}} gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) coal {{conversion process}} has been demonstrated to be a clean, efficient, and environmentally acceptable method of generating power; however, it generates <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> materials in relatively large quantities. For example, a 400 -MW power plant using 4000 tons of 10 % ash coal per day may generate over 440 tons/day of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> of slag, consisting of vitrified mineral matter and unburned carbon. The <b>disposal</b> of the <b>wastes</b> represents significant costs. Regulatory trends with respect to <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> <b>disposal,</b> landfill development costs and public concern make utilization of <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> a high-priority issue. As coal gasification technologies find increasing commercial applications for power generation or production of chemical feed stocks, it becomes imperative that slag utilization methods be developed, tested and commercialized in order to offset disposal costs. Praxis {{is working on a}} DOE/METC funded project to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of making lightweight and ultra-lightweight aggregates from slags left as solid by-products from the coal gasification process. The project objectives are to develop and demonstrate the technology for producing slag-based lightweight aggregates (SLA), to produce 10 tons of SLA products with different unit weights from two slags, to collect operational and emissions data from pilot-scale operations, and to conduct laboratory and commercial scale evaluations of SLA with conventional lightweight and ultra-lightweight aggregates...|$|R

Large application rates of milk onto land, or disposing in a hole, is problematic as the residue from the decomposing milk will block the soil pores and thereby reduce the water infiltration rate through the soil profile.

30|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposals</b> (open dumps, landfills, {{sanitary}} landfills or incinerators) {{represent a}} {{significant source of}} metals released into the environment (Yarlagadda et al. 1995; Waheed et al. 2010; Iwegbue et al. 2010; Bretzel and Calderisi 2011; Rizo et al. 2012). Leachate is produced primarily in association with precipitation that infiltrates through the refuse and normally results in the migration of leachate into the groundwater zone and pollutes it (Samuding 2009). Due to migration of leachate, soils have been contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, chromium, and cadmium and these heavy metals in <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> lead to serious problems because they cannot be biodegraded (Hong et al. 2002). The major sources of heavy metals in landfills are the co-disposed industrial wastes, incinerator ashes, mine wastes and household hazardous substances such as batteries, paints, dyes, inks, etc. (Erses and Onay 2003). Soil contamination by heavy metals from <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> sites is a serious problem in industrial and urban areas (Mandal and Sengupta 2006). Soils are regarded as the ultimate sink for heavy metals discharged into the environment, as many heavy metals are bound to soils (Obiajunwa et al. 2002). Furthermore, when screening for pollutants in soil and leachate at contaminated sites, the results are often required directly, since classification of the soil is needed before determination of remediation techniques (Banar et al. 2007). Hence, this study has been carried out to assess the soil contamination around the local dump area where the municipal <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> have been disposed for about 45  years.|$|R
