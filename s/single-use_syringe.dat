50|$|In 1998, Mike Weiss and Paul Danzinger were {{approached}} by an inventor who had trouble selling an auto-retractable and <b>single-use</b> <b>syringe</b> (Safety Syringe) because the group purchasing organization (GPO) refused to adopt his new, more expensive, safer syringes. The inventor turned his hope toward Mike Weiss and Paul Danzigner with those issues. Together, Mike and Paul brought {{a lawsuit against}} the GPOs, but the case never went to trial. Several years later Mark Lanier settled the case for $150 million.|$|E

50|$|The FDA {{reported}} several previous incidents {{related to}} tainted drugs packaged at compounding pharmacies. Fungal contamination {{in relation to}} sterile drug recalls represents the second-most common form of microbiological contamination. In August 2011, the FDA reported that repackaged injections of Avastin (bevacizumab) caused serious eye infections in the Miami, Florida, area. A pharmacy had repackaged the Avastin from single-use vials into multiple <b>single-use</b> <b>syringes,</b> distributing them to multiple eye clinics, and infecting at least 12 patients. Some patients lost the remaining vision in the eye being treated.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{naloxone}} <b>single-use</b> <b>syringe</b> kits {{are distributed}} and available at various clinics and emergency rooms. Alberta Health Services is increasing the distribution points for naloxone kits at all emergency rooms, and various pharmacies and clinics province-wide. Also in Alberta, take-home naloxone kits {{are available and}} commonly distributed in most drug treatment or rehabilitation centres, {{as well as in}} pharmacies where pharmacists can distribute single-use take-home naloxone kits or prescribe the drug to addicts. All Edmonton Police Service and Calgary Police Service patrol cars carry an emergency single-use naloxone syringe kit. Some Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol vehicles also carry the drug, occasionally in excess to help distribute naloxone among users and concerned family/friends. Nurses, paramedics, medical technicians, and emergency medical responders can also prescribe and distribute the drug.|$|E
40|$|Products {{from the}} {{packaging}} industry and from biomedical engineering made of polyoelefins have been separately collected {{in order to}} obtain different test fractions of defined composition and qualitatively known foreign substances: Paint pails, plastics detergent bottles, <b>single-use</b> <b>syringe</b> and infusion flasks. With these test fractions the effect of different types of concentration and separation units on the material properties of recycled products has been studied. By optimized, differentiated concentration/separation steps combined with improve material properties brought about by certain foreign substances, economically competitive secondary products can be obtained.

40|$|In this work, was {{evaluated}} {{the stability of}} anti-VEGF activity of Bevacizumab (Avastin®) repackaged in individual 1 mL <b>single-use</b> <b>syringes</b> stored at different conditions. Bevacizumab repackaging <b>single-use</b> <b>syringes</b> results from the off-label use of the drug as an intravitreal agent {{in the treatment of}} retinal diseases. Bevacizumab stability was assessed by assaying the anti-VEGF activity using an indirect ELISA method and by a Dynamic Light Scattering study. The thermal stability of the drug was also studied by calorimetric analysis, aimed to evaluate thermodynamic parameters associated to the thermal unfolding process. Furthermore, microbiological and fungal tests on the Bevacizumab syringes were performed. As a result, a significant decrease of the anti-VEGF activity was detected when syringes were exposed to UV light at temperature of 37 °C. Under these conditions the Dynamic Light Scattering study showed an increase of the average size of Bevacizumab, probably due to aggregation, evidenced also by calorimetric studies. In conclusion, Bevacizumab stability, stored under different conditions, was assessed considering three different aspects: biological activity, microbial contamination and physico-chemical properties. Bevacizumab is stable, under sterile conditions, for 3 months at 4 °C and for 7 days at room temperature, although exposed to indirect light sources, while a brief exposure of the drug to direct UV radiation resulted harmful...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{managing}} health care waste {{is one of}} critical concerns in Sudan. The immunization programs are generating thousands of <b>single-use</b> <b>syringes</b> and sharps yearly. Due to risks associated with sharps {{it is very important}} to manage them properly and to ensure they remain safe to the health care workers and the community at large. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a safe injection as safe to the patient, the worker, and safe to the environment. The objective of the study is to assess medical immunization waste management in Khartoum Locality...|$|R
50|$|Behavior change communication, or BCC, is an {{approach}} to behavior change focused on communication. It {{is also known as}} Social and Behavior Change Communication, or SBCC. The assumptions is that through communication of some kind, individuals and communities can somehow be persuaded to behave in ways that will make their lives safer and healthier. BCC was first employed in HIV and TB prevention projects. More recently, its ambit has grown to encompass any communication activity whose goal is to help individuals and communities select and practice behavior that will positively impact their health, such as immunization, cervical cancer check up, employing <b>single-use</b> <b>syringes,</b> etc.|$|R
30|$|Since the {{recommended}} therapeutic dosage of intravitreal antibiotics {{is very small}} and carefully titrated to prevent retinal toxicity, {{it is important that}} this dose is maintained each time an injection is prepared [39]. Standard protocols have to be followed to ensure accuracy, precision as well as reproducibility. The injections have to be prepared under strict aseptic conditions, under a certified laminar flow by trained personnel. Preferably, a printed reference display sheet should be consulted while preparing injections every time as dilution errors may be toxic. Mehta et al. reported that vancomycin, ceftazidime and moxifloxacin prepared in <b>single-use</b> polypropylene <b>syringes</b> retain potency, sterility and stability up to 24 weeks when stored at 0 C or 80 C [60].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Poor {{injection}} practices transmit potentially life-threatening pathogens. We modelled the cost-effectiveness {{of policies}} for the safe and {{appropriate use of}} injections in ten epidemiological subregions {{of the world in}} terms of cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. METHODS: The incidence of injection-associated hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections was modelled for a year 2000 cohort over a 30 -year time horizon. The consequences of a "do nothing" scenario were compared with a set of hypothetical scenarios that incorporated the health gains of effective interventions. Resources needed to implement effective interventions were costed for each subregion and expressed in international dollars (I dollars). FINDINGS: Worldwide, the reuse of injection equipment in the year 2000 accounted for 32 %, 40 %, and 5 % of new HBV, HCV and HIV infections, respectively, leading to a burden of 9. 18 million DALYs between 2000 and 2030. Interventions implemented in the year 2000 for the safe (provision of <b>single-use</b> <b>syringes,</b> assumed effectiveness 95 %) and appropriate (patients-providers interactional group discussions, assumed effectiveness 30 %) use of injections could reduce the burden of injection-associated infections by as much as 96. 5 % (8. 86 million DALYs) for an average yearly cost of 905 million I dollars (average cost per DALY averted, 102; range by region, 14 - 2293). Attributable fractions and the number of syringes and needles required represented the key sources of uncertainty. CONCLUSION: In all subregions studied, each DALY averted through policies for the safe and appropriate use of injections costs considerably less than one year of average per capita income, which makes such policies a sound investment for health care...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>single-use</b> {{disposable}} <b>syringes</b> along with myriad similar {{products for the}} health care industry has raised interest in the impact of these devices on the environment. Interest does not stop at impact of the device, but also includes associated pharmaceutical agents. Across the spectrum of health care, providers as well as end users of products are assessing the impact of product design and contents upon land, air, and water. In this issue of Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Pfützner and colleagues tackle the issue by focusing on a product for the diabetes patient. As environmental sustainability {{has become part of the}} evaluation process of many products, their assessment sheds some interesting light on the impact of a group of devices when compared and contrasted against the ever-popular disposable coffee cup or beer/soda aluminum can. Regional variations in waste disposal practices need to be understood when conducting these types of assessments...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dental {{procedures}} involve {{contact between}} instruments and the patient's tissues, blood or saliva. This study evaluated {{the efficacy of}} the standardized sterilization of non-disposable air/water syringe tips and corrosion and contaminant build-up in these tips. METHODS: The bacterial contamination of single-use and multiple-use non-disposable air/water syringe tips after routine use and sterilization was compared to that of single-use disposable tips by microbial culturing on PCA and blood agar plates. The effect of flushing the syringe tips prior to sterilization was also measured. The amount of corrosion in single-use and multiple-use non-disposable syringes was measured by SEM and EDS analyses. RESULTS: Non-disposable syringe tips had significantly (p < 0. 05) greater bacterial contamination than single-use disposable tips. There were no statistically different levels of contamination between flushed and non-flushed non-disposable <b>syringes</b> or between <b>single-use</b> and multiple-use non-disposable syringes. SEM and EDS analyses showed greater evidence of corrosion and contaminant build-up in multiple-use <b>syringes</b> compared to <b>single-use</b> non-disposable <b>syringes.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Sterilization of non-disposable air/water syringes is not completely effective and rinsing, or the number of uses, does not affect the effectiveness of sterilization. There may be a lower risk of cross-infection from the use of disposable air/water syringe tips, instead of non-disposable ones...|$|R
50|$|The {{barrel of}} a syringe is made of plastic or glass, usually has {{graduated}} marks indicating the volume of fluid in the syringe, and is nearly always transparent. Glass syringes may be sterilized in an autoclave. However, most modern medical syringes are plastic with a rubber piston, because this type seals much better between the piston and the barrel {{and because they are}} cheap enough to dispose of after being used only once, reducing the risk of spreading blood-borne diseases. Reuse of needles and syringes has caused spread of diseases, especially HIV and hepatitis, among intravenous drug users. Syringes are also commonly reused by diabetics, as they can go through several in a day with multiple daily insulin injections, which becomes an affordability issue for many. Even though the syringe and needle are only used by a single person, this practice is still unsafe as it can introduce bacteria from the skin into the bloodstream and cause serious and sometimes lethal infections. In medical settings, <b>single-use</b> needles and <b>syringes</b> effectively reduce the risk of cross-contamination.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the twentieth century, as {{hospitals}} cleaned up, they came to produce more and more rubbish. Beginning in the 1970 s and gaining pace in the 1980 s and 1990 s, <b>single-use</b> plastic items (<b>syringes,</b> blood bags, tubing) saturated everyday medical practice across the globe. This essay brings the question of plastic to bear upon the longer history of twentieth-century sanitary science. The widespread adoption of single-use disposable medical plastics consolidated a century’s worth of changes in medical hygiene. As strange as it may seem today, the initial uptake of medical plastics was not driven primarily by concerns about hygiene. Plastic began as a mid-century technology of convenience and durability. It was not {{until the end of the}} twentieth century that it morphed into a powerful symbol and instrument of medical hygiene. Today, both patients and practitioners have embraced plastic as an indispensable technology of clean medicine. The procession of single-use medical plastics through everyday medicine now comprises a constant, if disposable, infrastructure of medical hygiene. This new processional infrastructure of disposable hygiene has produced another, albeit unintended, consequence. This new regime has exponentially increased hospitals’ material out-puts. In so doing, plastic has refigured the ecologies of everyday medicine. Plastic hygiene has rendered hospitals factories of medical garbage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The common {{failure of}} health systems to ensure {{adequate}} and sufficient supplies of injection devices {{may have a}} negative impact on injection safety. We conducted an assessment in April 2001 to determine to which extent an increase in safe injection practices between 1995 and 2000 was related to the increased access to injection devices because of a new essential medicine policy in Burkina Faso. Methods We reviewed outcomes of the new medicine policy implemented in 1995. In April 2001, a retrospective programme review assessed the situation between 1995 and 2000. We visited 52 health care facilities where injections had been observed during a 2000 injection safety assessment and their adjacent operational public pharmaceutical depots. Data collection included structured observations of available injection devices and an estimation of the proportion of prescriptions including at least one injection. We interviewed wholesaler managers at national and regional levels on supply of injection devices to public health facilities. Results Fifty of 52 (96 %) health care facilities were equipped with a pharmaceutical depot selling syringes and needles, 37 (74 %) of which had been established between 1995 and 2000. Of 50 pharmaceutical depots, 96 % had <b>single-use</b> 5 ml <b>syringes</b> available. At all facilities, patients were buying syringes and needles out of the depot for their injections prescribed at the dispensary. While injection devices were available in greater quantities, the proportion of prescriptions including at least one injection remained stable between 1995 (26. 5 %) and 2000 (23. 8 %). Conclusion The implementation of pharmaceutical depots next to public health care facilities increased geographical access to essential medicines and basic supplies, among which syringes and needles, contributing substantially to safer injection practices in the absence of increased use of therapeutic injections. </p...|$|R
