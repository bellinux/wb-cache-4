"Dark Star" [...] Commander Powell {{was killed}} during {{hyperdrive}} {{as a result}} of an electrical short behind his <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> <b>panel,</b> but remains onboard ship in a state of cryogenic suspension. The ship's remaining crew consists of Lt. Doolittle (helmsman, and originally second-in-command), Sgt. Pinback (bombardier), Cpl. Boiler (navigator), and Talby (target specialist). The crew members perform their jobs with abject boredom, as the tedium of their tasks over 20 years has driven them [...] "around the bend." [...] They have created distractions for themselves: Doolittle, formerly a surfer from Malibu, California, has constructed a musical bottle organ; Talby spends his time in the ship's observation dome, content to watch the universe go by; Boiler obsessively trims his moustache, enjoys smoking cigars, and shoots targets with the ship's emergency laser rifle in a corridor.|$|R
2500|$|The Bedford Chevanne {{was a small}} {{commercial}} vehicle based on the GM T platform Vauxhall Chevette estate. Unlike the Chevette it had a flat rear floor, no <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> and <b>panels</b> {{in place of the}} side windows. It was introduced in September 1976. Intended as a replacement for the Bedford HA, the Chevanne was replaced by the Astravan before the HA was cancelled. It was fitted with the same 1,256cc inline-four as the Chevette (and the Bedford HA), although here it produced [...] with a 7.3 to 1 compression ratio. As part of making the Chevanne as car-like as possible, it was also available with a three-speed automatic transmission. The automatic also included a heavy-duty battery and front suspension, better carpeting, and a higher compression engine (8.7 to 1) with [...]|$|R

50|$|The {{first batch}} of genuine OmniTowns {{to appear in}} the United Kingdom were {{delivered}} to Nottingham City Transport in 2004 for use on tram feeder services. The bodywork, in common with the OmniDekka, was built by East Lancs but received front and <b>rear</b> <b>panels</b> from Scania, to match the OmniCity/OmniDekka. The body only differed from the East Lancs Myllennium in terms of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the {{construction}} of each Classic, Centurion would actually use two different Ford trucks: an F-Series crew-cab pickup and a Bronco. The wheelbase was shortened from 168 inches to 140 inches (9 inches longer than the Suburban), and the Bronco <b>rear</b> quarter <b>panels,</b> hardtop, and tailgate were mated to the pickup bodywork. [...] Early models used fiberglass <b>rear</b> body <b>panels,</b> but later, these were made from steel. [...] As the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> of the Bronco was retained, the Centurion Classic featured three-row seating for up to nine people.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{operating}} noise performance of a seat adjuster mechanism, benchmarking measurements were conducted in different cars for six and eight types of seat adjustment operation. The six types of operation include: seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front end down, <b>seat</b> <b>rear</b> end up and <b>seat</b> <b>rear</b> end down. The eight types of operation include: seat moving forward, seat moving backward, seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front end down, <b>seat</b> <b>rear</b> end up and <b>seat</b> <b>rear</b> end down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and root causes of the noise problem have been analysed and discussed in this paper. The noise characteristics have been identified, and the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify sound quality of the seat adjuster. The objective assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|R

5000|$|... 1989 {{introduced}} an extensive exterior redesign {{which included a}} longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The [...] 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over — even the luggage compartment was over [...] larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors—all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the rear shelf package on the 2-door models. While the parcel shelf on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> headrest <b>panel,</b> and a long 3-bulb horizontal brake lamp, the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted parcel shelf and pedestal brake lamp from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the Bose compact disc player, an electrically heated windshield, {{and a set of}} four reversible carpeted floor mats.|$|R
5000|$|The 1936 model {{got a new}} name, the Minx Magnificent, and a restyle {{with much}} more rounded body. The chassis was {{stiffened}} and the engine moved forwards to give more passenger room. The <b>rear</b> <b>panel,</b> hitherto vertical, was now set at a sloping angle, and the manufacturers offered the option of a folding luggage grid which could {{be attached to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> and was available for [...] "two pounds, seven shillings and sixpence" [...] (slightly under £2.40) painted. A Commer-badged estate car was added to the range.|$|R
