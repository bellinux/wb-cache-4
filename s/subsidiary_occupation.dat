5000|$|In real history, {{wage labour}} arises {{out of the}} {{dissolution}} of slavery and serfdom—or of the decay of communal property, as with Oriental and Slavonic peoples—and, in its adequate, epoch-making form, the form which takes possession of the entire social being of labour, out of the decline {{and fall of the}} guild economy, of the system of Estates, of labour and income in kind, of industry carried on as rural <b>subsidiary</b> <b>occupation,</b> of small-scale feudal agriculture, etc. In all these real historic transitions, wage labour appears as the dissolution, the annihilation of relations in which labour was fixed on all sides, in its income, its content, its location, its scope, etc. Hence, as negation of the stability of labour and of its remuneration. The direct transition from the African's fetish to Voltaire's [...] "Supreme Being", or from the hunting gear of a North American savage to the capital of the Bank of England, is not so absurdly contrary to history, as is the transition from Bastiat's fisherman to the wage labourer.|$|E

40|$|The Kashmir valley {{represents}} temperate {{climatic conditions}} {{and is known}} for its bivoltine sericulture. The sericulture in the region however, sustains on tree type of plants. Majority of sericulturists in this traditional area have taken up mulberry cultivation on small land holdings as a life sustaining occupation. Other farmers with more land have taken up it as <b>subsidiary</b> <b>occupation.</b> Mulberry is facing stiff competition from other economic crops. In order to make the mulberry cultivation more profitable and sustainable, intercrops can be practiced with them. Medicinal plants like Lavendula officinalis, Atropa belladonna and Echinacea purpurea are important source of alkaloids and essential oils, which have huge demand in pharmaceutical industry. The wider spacing available in the tree type of plantation of mulberry facilitates the cultivation of these medicinal plants as an intercrop.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the Bhiwani district of Haryana state, which was selected purposively on the basis of maximum area under dryland agriculture. From the four blocks in the Bhiwani district 200 farmers (50 farmers from each block) were selected randomly. The concept of sustainable agriculture involves the evolution of a new type of agriculture rich in technology and information, with much less than intensive energy use and market purchased inputs. Thus, sustainability is the successful management of resources to satisfy the challenging human needs, while maintaining or enhancing the quality of environment and conserving natural resources. Keeping in view the ever-increasing population, development of dry land agriculture, the depletion of natural resources, environmental pollution and limitations of sustainable agriculture a {{study was conducted}} to find out the perception of dryland farmers about economic and social aspects of sustainable dryland agriculture in Haryana (India). The study revealed that majority of the farmers perceived minimum tillage, crop diversification, soil fertilization application, integrated nutrient management, weed control, integrated pest management, maintaining plant population, drought resistant varieties, moisture and water conservation practices, agro-forestry and <b>subsidiary</b> <b>occupation</b> like livestock, poultry, horticulture, vegetable etc., as economically feasible, viable, as well as socially acceptable and sustainable for sustainable dryland agriculture.

40|$|On {{comparison}} of three milk procurement systems of open economy namely vendor, cooperative and integrated contract system members of integrated contract system {{were found to}} have better education and landholdings. Among the members of vendor and cooperatives there was less remarkable difference in education, but better land holdings were noticed in cooperative system. Majority of the farmers had dairying as <b>subsidiary</b> <b>occupation</b> and wide range of experience. The members of cooperatives and integrated contract systems had better herd size and dairy income than the farmers of vendor system. But between cooperative and contract system, members, there was not much remarkable difference in herd size and dairy income. The credit behaviour and investment by cooperative and integrated members was higher than vendor system members. On comparing cooperative and contract system members, the cooperative members showed better credit behaviour and higher investment. Members in contract system had better extension agency contact followed by members of cooperatives. But the members of cooperative had better mass media exposure than others. Similarly, majority of members of the cooperative and integrated contract systems had medium to high level of economic motivation. Members of vendor system had low degree economic motivation on comparison. Majority of the members of all the three systems had medium to high level of aspiration in dairy farming. But the above differences were not significant between cooperative and integrated contract farming systems.

40|$|Sericulture is {{labour-intensive}} and well-suited {{to small}} and marginal farms with surplus labour, especially female labour. Ample labour {{and a small}} land-base encourage farmers to practise sericulture as a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>occupation.</b> While income from crop production is seasonal, sericulture provides a year-round income, which is an important incentive for small farmers to take up sericulture. The agricultural production is seasonal, while consumption is evenly spread over the years. Under such circumstances, the planners and policymakers are confronted {{with the challenge of}} formulating a suitable agricultural production policy with which the desired growth of agricultural production can be achieved. In the present study, optimum cropping patterns for different categories of sericulturists have been suggested by selecting Siddlaghatta in Kolar and Kollegal talukas in Mysore as study areas. The primary data have been collected using the personal interview method. The deterministic linear programming technique has been employed to work out the maximum attainable returns by small, medium and large farmers through the optimum allocation of various crops, sericulture and livestock (dairy), using the available resources. The model has suggested fewer crops in the cropping pattern of both the areas. The model has also suggested shifting of the cropping pattern from subsistence-dominated crops like ragi to commercial crops like bivoltine sericulture in the Kolar area and crossbreed sericulture in the Musore area. The suggested cropping patterns have increased the gross income in the range of 83. 55 to 388. 68 per cent in the Kolar area and 2. 71 to 10. 70 per cent in the Kollegal area.
