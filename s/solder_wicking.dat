40|$|Electronics {{soldering}} is {{a technique}} used frequently in the manufacturing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) to attach small electronic parts or wires together. Often times the need to remove a solder joint arises; {{this is known as}} desoldering. <b>Solder</b> <b>wick,</b> fine braided copper wire infused with rosin, {{is one of the most}} effective ways to desolder because it results in the cleanest joints. Currently using <b>solder</b> <b>wick</b> involves several time consuming and somewhat awkward steps. This report will cover the process behind designing, manufacturing, and testing a new ergonomic, dispenser for <b>solder</b> <b>wick</b> that can be used with one hand. After coming up with a new design, I made a functional prototype to assist in testing the design. The prototype was made with an ABS plastic material. To determine if the Solder Qwik Pen is a significantly faster method to use compared to a coil of <b>solder</b> <b>wick,</b> an experiment was done. The experimentâ€™s results showed that the Solder Qwik Pen did have a significantly faster average time among users than the <b>solder</b> <b>wick</b> coil. Not only is the Solder Qwik Pen an improvement on the old <b>solder</b> <b>wick</b> method of desoldering, it could easily lead to other products being sold as companion products...|$|R

50|$|Chips {{are at risk}} {{of being}} damaged by the {{repeated}} heating and cooling of reballing, and manufacturers' warranties sometimes do not cover this case. Removing <b>solder</b> with <b>solder</b> <b>wick</b> subjects devices to thermal stress fewer times than using a flowing solder bath. In a test twenty devices were reballed, some several times. Two failed to function, but were restored to full functionality after reballing again. One was subjected to 17 thermal cycles without failing.|$|R
50|$|Suction {{pumps are}} used to suck away molten solder, leaving {{previously}} joined terminals disconnected. They are primarily used to release through-hole connections from a PCB. The desoldering head must be designed so that the extracted solder does not solidify so as to obstruct it, or enter the pump, and can be removed and discarded easily. It {{is not possible to}} remove a multi-pin part by melting solder on the pins sequentially, as one joint will solidify as the next is melted; pumps and <b>solder</b> <b>wick</b> are among methods to remove solder from all joints, leaving the part free to be removed.|$|R
40|$|As wafer {{surfaces}} become topographically more challenging, achieving uniform resist coatings in deep vias, {{over high}} mesas, and three-dimensional (3 -D) features {{may no longer}} be possible using conventional, solvent based, spin-coated liquid photoresist (LPR). Thinning of the resist on the high areas and pooling of the resist in the deep areas are common problems. Electrophoretic photoresist (EPR) may be used to achieve conformal 3 -D resist coverage over high topography regions, while maintaining the high resolution and wet etch resistance properties of spin-coated LPR. Also, EPR may offer a higher throughput than spin-coated LPR. This presentation will describe two distinct applications where conformal masking of high topography wafer surfaces is needed and achieved by using EPR. The first application involves a silicon-on-glass (SOG) device technology that requires conformal masking of retrograde silicon pedestal structures up to 170 Pm high. The second application is for GaAs wafer through substrate via holes. For high power GaAs devices, a solder-stop metal needs to be masked inside the via to prevent Au-Sn eutectic <b>solder</b> from <b>wicking</b> into the hole during the solder die attach step. 1,...|$|R
