25|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} some of the many types of <b>Spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is no {{cure for}} <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia,</b> which is {{currently}} {{considered to be a}} progressive and irreversible disease, although not all types cause equally severe disability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> (SCA), {{also known}} as spinocerebellar atrophy or spinocerebellar degeneration, is a progressive, degenerative, genetic disease with {{multiple}} types, each {{of which could be}} considered a disease in its own right. An estimated 150,000 people in the United States have a diagnosis of <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> at any given time. SCA is hereditary, progressive, degenerative, and often fatal. There is no known effective treatment or cure. SCA can affect anyone of any age. The disease is caused by either a recessive or dominant gene. In many cases people are not aware that they carry a relevant gene until they have children who begin to show signs of having the disorder.|$|E
40|$|The {{group of}} <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> (SCAs) {{includes}} more than 20 subgroups based only on genetic research. The “ataxia genes” are autosomal; the “disease-alleles” are dominant, and many of them, but not all, encode a protein with an abnormally long polyglutamine domain. In DNA, this domain can be detected as an elongated CAG repeat region, which {{is the basis of}} genetic diagnostics. The polyglutamine tails often tend to aggregate and form inclusions. In some cases, protein–protein interactions are the key to understanding the disease. Protein partners of ataxia proteins include phosphatases and components of chromatin and the transcriptional machinery. To date, investigation of <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> involves population genetics, molecular methods, and studying model organisms. However, there is still no efficient therapy for patients. Here, we review the genetic and molecular data gained on <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias...</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{diseases}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of adult-onset DRPLA include Huntington's and the <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias.</b> For juvenile-onset, familial essential myoclonus and epilepsy (FEME), Lafora, Unverricht-Lundborg, Neuroaxonal dystrophy, Gaucher's disease, Sialidosis, and Galactosialidosis.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{molecular}} {{genetic research}} has unraveled {{a major part}} of the genetic background of autosomal dominant and recessive <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias.</b> These advances have also allowed insight in (some of) the pathophysiologic pathways assumed to be involved in these diseases. For the clinician, the expanding number of genes and genetic loci in these diseases and the enormous clinical heterogeneity of specific ataxia subtypes complicate management of ataxia patients. In this review, the clinical and neuropathologic features of the recently identified <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> are described, and the various molecular mechanisms that have been demonstrated to be involved in these disorders are discussed...|$|R
25|$|There {{are five}} typical autosomal-recessive {{disorders}} in which ataxia is a prominent feature: Friedreich ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA), spastic ataxia. Disorder subdivisions: Friedreich's ataxia, <b>Spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia,</b> Ataxia telangiectasia, Vasomotor ataxia, Vestibulocerebellar, Ataxiadynamia, Ataxiophemia, Olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of TBP {{is a long}} string of glutamines in the N-terminus of the protein. This region modulates the DNA binding activity of the C-terminus, and modulation of DNA-binding affects the rate of transcription complex formation and initiation of transcription. Mutations that expand the number of CAG repeats encoding this polyglutamine tract, and thus increase the length of the polyglutamine string, are associated with <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> 17, a neurodegenerative disorder classified as a polyglutamine disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> (SCA) {{is one of}} a {{group of}} genetic {{disorders}} characterized by slowly progressive incoordination of gait and is often associated with poor coordination of hands, speech, and eye movements. A review of different clinical features among SCA subtypes was recently published describing the frequency of non-cerebellar features, like parkinsonism, chorea, pyramidalism, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, among others. As with other forms of ataxia, SCA frequently results in atrophy of the cerebellum, loss of fine coordination of muscle movements leading to unsteady and clumsy motion, and other symptoms.|$|E
50|$|As more repeat {{expansion}} diseases {{have been}} discovered, several categories {{have been established}} to group them based upon similar characteristics. Category I includes Huntington's disease (HD) and the <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> that are caused by a CAG repeat expansion in protein-coding portions of specific genes. Category II expansions {{tend to be more}} phenotypically diverse with heterogeneous expansions that are generally small in magnitude, but also found in the exons of genes. Category III includes fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, two of the <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias,</b> juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Friedreich's ataxia. These diseases are characterized by typically much larger repeat expansions than the first two groups, and the repeats are located outside of the protein-coding regions of the genes.|$|R
50|$|In humans, Purkinje {{cells can}} be harmed {{by a variety}} causes: toxic exposure, e.g. to alcohol or lithium; {{autoimmune}} diseases; genetic mutations causing <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias,</b> Unverricht-Lundborg disease, or autism; and neurodegenerative diseases that are not known to have a genetic basis, such as the cerebellar type of multiple system atrophy or sporadic ataxias.|$|R
40|$|The past 25 {{years have}} seen {{enormous}} progress in the deciphering of the genetic and molecular basis of ataxias, resulting in improved understanding of their pathogenesis. The most significant milestones during this period were the cloning of the genes associated with the common <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias,</b> ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich ataxia. To date, the causative mutations of more than 30 <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> and 20 recessive ataxias have been identified. In addition, there are numerous acquired ataxias with defined molecular causes, so that the entire number of distinct ataxia disorders exceeds 50 and possibly approaches 100. Despite this enormous heterogeneity, a few recurrent pathophysiological themes stand out. These include protein aggregation, failure of protein homeostasis, perturbations in ion channel function, defects in DNA repair, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The clinical phenotypes {{of the most common}} ataxia disorders have been firmly established, and their natural history is being studied in ongoing large observational trials. Effective therapies for ataxias are still lacking. However, novel drug targets are under investigation, and it is expected that there will be an increasing number of therapeutic trials in ataxia. © 2011 Movement Disorder Societ...|$|R
25|$|Episodic ataxia (EA) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder characterized by sporadic bouts of ataxia (severe discoordination) {{with or without}} myokymia (continuous muscle movement). There are seven types recognised but the majority are due to two recognized entities. Ataxia can be provoked by stress, startle, or heavy exertion such as exercise. Symptoms can first appear in infancy. There are at least 6 loci for EA, of which 4 are known genes. Some patients with EA also have migraine or progressive cerebellar degenerative disorders, symptomatic of either familial hemiplegic migraine or <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia.</b> Some patients respond to acetazolamide though others do not.|$|E
25|$|Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is {{characterized}} by acetazolamide-responsive attacks of ataxia with or without migraine. Patients with EA2 may also present with progressive cerebellar atrophy, nystagmus, vertigo, visual disturbances and dysarthria. These symptoms last from hours to days, in contrast with EA1, which lasts from seconds to minutes. Like EA1, attacks can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but also by coffee and alcohol. EA2 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, which encodes the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.1, and is also the gene responsible for causing <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> type-6 and familial hemiplegic migraine type-1. EA2 is {{also referred to as}} episodic ataxia with nystagmus, hereditary paroxysmal cerebellopathy, familial paroxysmal ataxia and acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia (AHPCA). There are currently 19 mutations associated with EA2, though only 3 have been characterized electrophysiologically, table 2 and figure 2. Of these, all result in decreased current through these channels. It is assumed that the other mutations, especially the splicing and frameshift mutations, also result in a drastic decrease in CaV2.1 currents, though {{this may not be the}} case for all mutations. CACNA1A is heavily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum where it is involved in coupling action potentials with neurotransmitter release. Thus, decrease in Ca2+ entry through CaV2.1 channels is expected to result in decreased output from Purkinje cells, even though they will fire at an appropriate rate. Alternatively, some CACNA1A mutations, such as those seen in familial hemiplegic migraine type-1, result in increased Ca2+ entry and, thereby, aberrant transmitter release. This can also result in excitotoxicity, as may occur in some cases of <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> type-6.|$|E
25|$|A March 2000 {{study by}} National Human Genome Research Institute {{comparing}} the fruit fly and human genome estimated that about 60% of genes are conserved {{between the two}} species. About 75% of known human disease genes have a recognizable match in the genome of fruit flies, and 50% of fly protein sequences have mammalian homologs. An online database called Homophila is available to search for human disease gene homologues in flies and vice versa. Drosophila is {{being used as a}} genetic model for several human diseases including the neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson's, Huntington's, <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> and Alzheimer's disease. The fly is also being used to study mechanisms underlying aging and oxidative stress, immunity, diabetes, and cancer, as well as drug abuse.|$|E

Very {{little is known about}} the function of these proteins, but presumably they are member of LSm-domain rings that interact with RNA. [...] There is some evidence that LSm12 is possibly involved in mRNA degradation and LSm13-16 may have roles in regulation of mitosis. [...] A large protein of unknown function, ataxin-2, associated with the neurodegenerative disease <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> type 2, also has a N-terminal LSm domain.|$|E
2500|$|Lazzarini was {{recruited}} in 1990 to study ataxia {{as part of}} the RWJMS new William Dow Lovett Center for Neurogenetics. In the early 90s, {{she was a member of}} the team studying neurodegenerative syndromes including olivopontocerebellar atrophy (a degeneration of neurons in the brain present in syndromes such as Machado-Joseph disease) and <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> (SCA). [...] To study the causes of SCA, the researchers first had to locate a family having a large number of members with the disease; according to UMDNJ, Lazzarini [...] "established a pedigree that may be the largest in North America". [...] One of Lazzarini's patients had located family records the led to a hundreds of individuals in one family encompassing eight generations and including 21 members who had the disease.

2500|$|Familial hemiplegic {{migraine}} (FHM) is an autosomal dominant type of {{hemiplegic migraine}} that typically includes weakness {{of half the}} body which can last for hours, days or weeks. It can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as ataxia, coma and paralysis. There is clinical overlap in some FHM patients with episodic ataxia type 2 and <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> type 6, benign familial infantile epilepsy, and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. There are 3 known loci for FHM. FHM1, which accounts for approximately 50% of FHM patients, is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the P/Q-type calcium channel α subunit, CACNA1A. FHM1 is also associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM2, which accounts for <25% of FHM cases, is caused by mutations in the /-ATPase gene ATP1A2. FHM3 is a rare subtype of FHM and is caused by mutations in a sodium channel α-subunit coding gene, SCN1A. These three subtypes do not account for all cases of FHM, suggesting the existence {{of at least one}} other locus (FHM4). Many of the non-familial cases of hemiplegic migraine (sporadic hemiplegic migraine) are also caused by mutations at these loci. A fourth gene that has been associated with this condition is the proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) - an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex. [...] A fifth gene associated with this condition is SLC4A4 which encodes the electrogenic NaHCO3cotransporter NBCe1.|$|E
40|$|The {{autosomal}} dominant <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of degenerative diseases presenting with ataxic gait, limbs ataxia, dysarthria and cerebellar oculomotor disturbances. Usually, cerebellar signs {{are associated with}} pyramidal signs, extra-pyramidal signs, spinal signs and signs of peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathological studies have disclosed an involvement of the cerebellum and its afferent/efferent pathways, of the brainstem and of the spinal cord. Distinct entities are now recognized :SCA 1, SCA 2, SCA 3 /Machado-Joseph disease, SCA 4, SCA 5, SCA 6, SCA 7 and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In most cases, a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion has been demonstrated by genetic investigations. Moreover, {{recent studies have shown}} that {{autosomal dominant}} <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> are characterized by intra-nuclear inclusions containing polyglutamine in affected cells. These complexes might play a determinant role in the neurodegenerative process. Cell death could be due to accumulation of a polyglutamine as a result of trinucleotide repeats.

40|$|In {{this review}} we explore the {{similarities}} between <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> and dystonias, and suggest potentially shared molecular pathways using a gene co-expression. network approach. The <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by coordination problems caused mainly by atrophy of the cerebellum. The dystonias are another group of neurological' movement disorders linked to basal ganglia dysfunction, although evidence is now pointing to cerebellar involvement as well. Our gene co -expression network approach identified 99 shared genes and showed the involvement of two major pathways: synaptic transmission and neurodevelopment. These pathways overlapped in the two disorders, with a large role for GABAergic signaling in both. The overlapping pathways may provide novel targets for disease therapies. We need to prioritize variants obtained by whole exome sequencing in the genes associated with these pathways {{in the search for}} new pathogenic variants, which can than be used to help in the genetic counseling of patients and their families.

2500|$|Physical {{therapists}} {{can assist}} patients in maintaining {{their level of}} independence through therapeutic exercise programmes. [...] One recent research report demonstrated a gain of 2 SARA points (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) from physical therapy. In general, physical therapy emphasises postural balance and gait training for ataxia patients. General conditioning such as range-of-motion exercises and muscle strengthening would also be included in therapeutic exercise programmes. [...] Research showed that <b>spinocerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> 2 (SCA2) patients [...] with a mild stage of the disease gained significant improvement in static balance and neurological indices {{after six months of}} a physical therapy exercise training program. Occupational therapists may assist patients with incoordination or ataxia issues through the use of adaptive devices. Such devices may include a cane, crutches, walker, or wheelchair for those with impaired gait. Other devices are available to assist with writing, feeding, and self care if hand and arm coordination are impaired. A randomised clinical trial revealed that an intensive rehabilitation program with physical and occupational therapies for patients with degenerative cerebellar diseases can significantly improve functional gains in ataxia, gait, and activities of daily living. Some level of improvement was shown to be maintained 24 weeks post-treatment. Speech language pathologists may use both behavioral intervention strategies as well as augmentative and alternative communication devices to help patients with impaired speech.|$|E
