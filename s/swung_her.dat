25|$|Tragedy {{stuck the}} zoo twice in 1954, {{first with the}} death of Albert Barnett the zoo foreman. Barnett died after a finger became {{infected}} in what was initially thought to be a minor injury sustained at work. In August, another staff member, 65-year-old Frank Lane, who had also worked at the zoo since its opening like Barnett, was killed in a much publicised accident. Lane had just fed a young elephant, Kassala, and was climbing back through the rails between the stalls when Jamuna <b>swung</b> <b>her</b> trunk knocking him into the wall and killing him instantly. Barnett had been Jamuna's regular keeper and it was reported she had been upset since his death. It is believed Lane's death {{was the result of a}} tragic accident rather than a deliberate attack. Jamuna spent the rest of her life without incident.|$|E
500|$|With Task Force 61, Cushing {{took part}} in the bitterly contested Battle of Santa Cruz in October 1942. Outnumbered, the force stalled the Japanese from their advance toward Guadalcanal. [...] At the Battle of Guadalcanal, Cushing was perhaps the first US ship to strike the enemy on that November day in 1942. In the {{fighting}} that followed, she sustained several hits amidships and slowly began to lose power, but was able to fire six torpedoes by local control at the [...] In his book, Destroyer Operations in World War II (1953), Theodore Roscoe said, “ Three of the “fish” seemed to hit the bulls-eye; if they did, it was with tack-hammer thumps. They may have exploded prematurely. But Hieis lookouts must have seen them coming, for the big ship <b>swung</b> <b>her</b> bow to the left and lumbered westward, disappearing into the smoke-haze.” ...|$|E
500|$|After repairs Texas was {{assigned}} to the North Atlantic Squadron, and patrolled the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. In February 1897, she left the Atlantic for a brief cruise to the Gulf coast ports of Galveston, Texas, and New Orleans. She arrived in Galveston, Texas on 16 February 1897 and anchored in [...] of water. The local pilot assured her captain that this was the best berth in the harbor for a ship of Texass length. However a strong tide <b>swung</b> <b>her</b> around onto a mud bank and held there. She was not able to get herself off and even the assistance of the U.S. Revenue Steamer Galveston was to no effect. Late the next day she was hauled off by the use of her port anchor and a tug. These two incidents gave her a reputation as being a jinxed or unlucky ship and earned her the nickname [...] "Old Hoodoo".|$|E
60|$|The Uncle Toby <b>swung</b> to <b>her</b> chain, head-sails ran down, and the Kanaka crew {{sprang to}} fore and main-halyards and sheets.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind had}} come up quite strong toward night, and when the little craft <b>swung</b> to <b>her</b> anchors some {{distance}} from the shore Teddy was feeling decidedly disagreeable.|$|R
60|$|At high-water next day, the Rio Negro floated off the mud {{and when}} she <b>swung</b> to <b>her</b> anchor Kit went into Adam's room. Adam was very weak, but looked up.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{hours after}} {{departure}} from Munising, a severe November gale struck Myron and Miztec with northwest winds blowing , a rapidly dropping temperature, and heavy snow. When the pounding seas opened the wooden seams on the aged Myron, her pumps {{could not keep}} up with below deck water. Ice build up on Myron changed her center of gravity and made her unstable in the heavy seas. Her [...] engine could {{not keep up with}} the accumulation of water and ice until she was reduced to a speed of [...] Captain Walter Neal, of Myron, decided to drop Miztec off near Vermilion Point before he attempted to fight their way to the shelter of Whitefish Bay. The battered Miztec dropped her anchors, <b>swung</b> <b>her</b> bow to the seas, and survived the storm.|$|E
2500|$|An Admiralty {{salvage officer}} came aboard and cut away several hundred tons of wreckage. This {{relieved}} {{the strain on}} her bulkhead, which was then patched and shored up with heavy timbers. She was towed into Yarmouth {{for a few hours}} but was then towed north again by two tugs. A northerly gale arose and <b>swung</b> <b>her</b> about violently, and she was often awash. The tugs and Wandle sheltered in the Humber to escape heavy seas and in a bay to wait for fog to pass. On the fifth day after being torpedoed, Wandle finally reached the River Tyne. On 5 December she was dry-docked at John Readhead & Sons' shipyard in South Shields. During this whole period of salvage and towing, the volunteer crew led by Captain George Mastin, Mate Edward Clarke and Engineer [...] "Stanley" [...] Johnson, remained with the Wandle, until she was safely docked at Redheads, to ensure no salvage claims were made on the owners.|$|E
2500|$|A convoy {{located on}} 26 February {{did not offer}} a chance of attack, because [...] had first fired on it causing its escorts to chase Balao from the scene. Two days later, Balao sighted smoke on the horizon and {{commenced}} tracking three ships and an escort. Shortly after midnight, Balao went to battle stations and closed for attack. After firing her six bow tubes at the lead ship, the submarine <b>swung</b> <b>her</b> stern toward the wing ships in the formation and fired her stern tubes. Balao heard several explosions at the expected times, as torpedo after torpedo struck home. One of the damaged ships trained a [...] gun on Balao, but a heavy internal explosion silenced the gun before Balao could be hit. The submarine could see nothing except heavy smoke in the target area, but radar watched as two [...] "pips" [...] disappeared from the screen. Balao lured the escort out of the target area in order to double back {{to look for the}} third freighter. Radar and lookouts failed to locate the merchantman, so Balao returned to patrol the shipping lanes after a very successful attack. Postwar study of Japanese shipping records identified her victims as the 2,723-ton freighter Shoho Maru and the 6,803-ton passenger cargoship Akiuro Maru.|$|E
60|$|They {{strained}} and the houseboat came loose, but alas! at {{that moment}} both sweeps slipped and slowly but surely the Dora <b>swung</b> into <b>her</b> former position and became jammed tighter than before.|$|R

60|$|Gasping for breath, Rhoda, in a last desperate effort, <b>swung</b> out <b>her</b> right hand, {{seized the}} confronting spectre by its {{obtrusive}} left arm, and whirled it backward to the floor, starting up {{herself as she}} did so with a low cry.|$|R

6000|$|Ali <b>swung</b> upon <b>her</b> in a rage. [...] "Did I not bid thee wait below, thou {{daughter}} of shame?" [...] he stormed. [...] "She has followed me up, my lord, to thrust herself in here upon you. Shall I drive her forth?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fresh breeze}} was bearing the little vessel swiftly on, and before any inmate of the Pemberton house was astir, she <b>swung</b> to <b>her</b> anchor close inside the harbor, {{while the two}} men listened to the story which Mark had to tell.|$|R
60|$|Joan {{shook her}} head. In one stride Kells reached her and <b>swung</b> <b>her</b> {{spinning}} before him. The physical violence acted strangely upon Joan--roused her rage.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am glad we both won, {{though to}} be {{perfectly}} candid I think mine is decidedly the fullest." [...] But as she <b>swung</b> up <b>her</b> birch pannier the handle broke, and down went basket, berries and all, into the long grass rustling at her feet.|$|R
60|$|On {{the fifth}} morning, or rather afternoon, a {{different}} step approached--lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, {{with a black}} silk bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket <b>swung</b> to <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
