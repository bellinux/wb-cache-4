40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to the {{investigation}} of critical phenomena using the geometric theory of singular perturbations, namely, the black swans and canards techniques. The interest to critical phenomena is occasioned by not only of safety reason, in many cases namely the critical regime is the most effective in technological processes. The sense of criticality here is as follows. The critical regime corresponds to chemical reaction separating the domains of self-accelerating reactions and domains of slow reactions. Recall that a canard (or French duck) is a trajectory of a singularly perturbed system of differential equations if it, at first, follows a stable slow integral manifold, and then an unstable one. In both cases the distances travelled are more than infinitesimally small. The slow integral manifold is defined as an invariant surface of slow motions. A canard trajectory may be considered as the result of gluing stable (attractive) and unstable (repulsive) slow integral manifolds at one point of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>surface,</b> due to the availability of an additional scalar parameter in the differential system. If we take an additional function of a vector variable parameterizing the <b>breakdown</b> <b>surface,</b> we can glue the stable and unstable slow integral manifolds at all points of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>surface</b> simultaneously. As a result we obtain the continuous stable/unstable integral surface or black swan. It is possible t...|$|R

To assess propagation of such discharges on the electrode coating surface and hence the impact on capacitor performance, we have recently developed a surface plasma model under non-equilibrium conditions. Through the identification of an electrical field mechanism and a temperature gradient mechanism, we have established a parametric range within which these surface plasmas are unlikely to elongate. Theoretical models of surface discharges are useful for a quantitative understanding of failure mechanisms in film capacitors. In this contribution, we extend our work farther to study the dynamics of plasma propagation. Two propagation modes are identified, namely the elongation and extinction modes, and they are numerically explored over a very wide parametric range. Detailed features of plasma propagation provide important insights into their impact on capacitor performance. These results are also useful to aid optimization of capacitor designs through capacitor electrode architecture and insulation clearanc...|$|R

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of charges on polymeric insulation under high voltage DC stress {{is a major}} concern in the transmission system as its formation distorts the local electric field and has an adverse impact on the electrical performance. By undergoing fluorination treatment on the insulation, improved surface properties similar to fluoropolymers can be attained without changing the bulk properties of the original material. The change in chemical components at the surface of polymeric insulation should lead to a corresponding change in electrical properties at the surface and thus can suppress charge build up. Previous research on surface flashover on fluorinated epoxy resin at atmospheric condition shows a significant improvement in flashover strength. In this paper, the authors investigated the effect of different degree of fluorination treatment on cast epoxy resin on suppressing surface charge accumulation and its contribution towards the improvement in <b>surface</b> <b>breakdown</b> strength. In comparison to previous research, it has been found that there is an optimum time duration of fluorination treatment which improves the <b>surface</b> <b>breakdown</b> strength of epoxy spacer. The mechanisms that govern the effect of fluorination treatment on surface flashover were discussed...|$|E

The morphology of the nanoparticles and composites, {{as well as}} the thermal conduction characteristics and electrical properties of the composites were investigated via conventional testing methods. The thermal conductivity increased along with the SrTiO 3 weight fractions, and the thermal conductivity of the SrTiO 3 /epoxy composite with 40 wt % weight fraction increased to 0. 52 W/mK. The dielectric constant increased along with the weight fractions and decreased along with frequency, thereby suggesting that the interfacial and dipole polarization do not follow the changes in the electrical field direction at high frequency. The dielectric constants at 1 kHz frequency increased along with temperature. <b>Surface</b> <b>breakdown</b> tests illustrated further improvements in the thermal and electrical properties of the composites.

This article appeared in the Journal of Applied Physics and may be found at: [URL] breakdown discharges are one probable failure mechanism of metallized polymeric film capacitors used in power systems, traction drives, and other technological applications. To assess whether <b>surface</b> <b>breakdown</b> discharges may undergo considerable elongation on the electrode surface to affect significantly capacitor performance, an equivalent electric circuit model is developed for metallized polymer film capacitors under the thermal equilibrium condition. With the aid of a surface field gradient mechanism, propagation of surface plasmas is studied and the necessary condition for their possible elongation is obtained. Numerical examples of a metallized film capacitor are used to demonstrate that <b>surface</b> <b>breakdown</b> plasmas and their elongation are unlikely to affect capacitor performance in a significant fashion. Then the generic problem of plasma propagation is restudied under thermally nonequilibrium conditions. Based on a heat conduction formulation in the one-dimensional limit, a temperature gradient mechanism is proposed to explain the possible elongation of breakdown plasmas on an electrode surface. Numerical examples are again used to deduce that thermally nonequilibrium surface plasmas are unlikely to evolve into catastrophic flashover arcs to fail film capacitors...|$|E

Delayed degradation of enamel matrix proteins or inhibited protein removal results in impaired and incomplete crystal growth, producing hypomineralized and porous enamel. Severely fluorosed teeth may undergo post-eruptive <b>surface</b> <b>breakdown</b> and post-eruptive dark brown to black staining. Methods: A 13 year old girl presented with severely discoloured maxillary central incisors. Initial aesthetic {{management of}} these teeth was conservative, including in-office tooth whitening, microabrasion and take-home whitening. Results: Dark brown to black staining of the teeth was reduced successfully without the need for gross mechanical preparation of the enamel. Further improvement of aesthetics was achieved with composite veneers. Conclusions: Conservative treatment options such as tooth whitening and microabrasion can dramatically improve severely discoloured fluorosed teeth. This can provide a satisfactory interim outcome or minimize the removal of discoloured enamel and dentine prior to the provision of composite veneers. The use of casein phospho-peptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACPTM) may enhance remineralization and decrease post-operative sensitivity following tooth whitening and microabrasion procedures in hypomineralized teeth.
