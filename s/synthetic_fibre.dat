40|$|Purpose – Establishing {{toughness}} {{performance in}} concrete using steel fibres is well understood, and design guides {{are available to}} assist with this process. What is less readily understood {{is the use of}} Type 2 <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> to provide toughness. This problem is exacerbated by the wide range of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> available, with each different fibre providing different structural properties. This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the relative pull-out values of two single fibre types, i. e. steel and Type 2 <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres.</b> The pull-out test results have informed the doses of fibre additions to beams which have been used to equate near equal toughness performance for each fibre type. Findings – The results show that <b>synthetic</b> Type 2 <b>fibres,</b> when used at a prescribed additional volume, can provide toughness equal to steel fibre concrete. Originality/value – The scientific study of fibre pull-out behaviour is well understood and described herein under additional reading. Practical testing to show contractors and clients how to balance the dose of fibres in concrete, so that <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> {{could be used as a}} steel fibre replacement, is not well researched.

Therefore, natural fibres keep going their importance. On the other hand, nowadays, new generated <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> having different structure are produced and introduced under different trade names by different firms. They all claimed that these <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> offer comfort performance as that of the natural fibres. In this study, we aimed to determine some using performance properties of the fabrics knitted from natural fibres such as cotton, wool and regenerated fibres such as bamboo, and also conventional and new generated <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> such as Coolmax polyester etc. For this aim, we focus on air permeability, water vapour permeability, water absorption, fire retardant property and also pilling behaviour of these fabrics. In the scope of the study, we used the yarns with the same yarn count and twist level to compare the fabric performance properties. Also all yarns were knitted with the same fabric structure and loop density. Keywords- Cotton, bamboo, new generated fibres, air permeability...|$|R

2500|$|Flintshire - A {{subsidiary}} of a German company, the British Glanzstoff Manufacturing Company started an artificial silk factory in Flint in 1907. During World War I the factory closed down but {{was taken over}} by Courtaulds in 1917. In 1913, the company had started making the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> viscose rayon, made from cellulose derived from imported wood pulp or cotton waste. Courtaulds in September 1919 bought the old Muspratt Alkali factory in Flint from United Alkali Co Ltd and called it Castle Works, where after conversion they started production in 1922 of manufactured viscose rayon yarn. Courtaulds also in December 1927 bought the Holywell Textile Mill in Flint which they called Deeside Mill and after reconstruction and alterations was used for yarn processing. At its height Courtaulds employed over 10,000 people at four sites. At Greenfield, some [...] further down the Dee estuary, two additional large rayon production facilities existed from 1936 onwards, named Number 1 and Number 2. These mills employed over 3,000 people. Textile production declined from 1950, and Aber works shut initially in 1957, opened for rayon in 1966, and pulled down in 1984. Castle works closed in 1977 and Deeside Mill in 1989. The number 1 facility at Greenfield was mothballed in 1978, and the entire site was decommissioned in the mid 1980s.|$|E

However, the beneficial effect of fibres depends on their length and flexibility. The analysis of load-deflection curves obtained made it possible to fit the simple function, describing the post-peak behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete, which can be useful for the calculation of G F value.
