Sold with {{a package of}} McDonald's BBQ <b>sauce</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side using the slogan [...] "McDonald's is my kind of place"; it {{was inspired by a}} franchisee's version of an Arby's sandwich. The sandwich failed due to the costs of getting roast beef slicers; no matter how many sandwiches they could sell, it would never turn a profit.|$|E
2500|$|As in many coastal states, seafood {{is readily}} available. Shellfish is {{extremely}} popular, with clams {{being used in}} multiple ways. The quahog is a large local clam usually used in a chowder. (The word quahog comes from the Narragansett Indian word [...] "poquauhock"; see A Key into the Language of America by Roger Williams 1643.) It is also ground and mixed with stuffing (and sometimes spicy minced sausage) and then baked in its shell to form a stuffie. Steamed clams are also a very popular dish. Calamari (squid) is sliced into rings and fried and is served as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically Sicilian-style (i.e., tossed with sliced banana peppers and with marinara <b>sauce</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side).|$|E
2500|$|The several {{regional}} {{variants of}} pho in Vietnam, particularly divided between [...] "northern pho" [...] (...) and [...] "southern pho" [...] or [...] "Saigon pho" [...] (...) [...] Northern pho tends to use somewhat wider noodles {{and much more}} green onion, and garnishes offered generally include only vinegar, fish sauce and chili <b>sauce.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, southern Vietnamese pho broth is slightly sweeter and has bean sprouts and {{a greater variety of}} fresh herbs. Pho may be served with either pho noodles or kuy teav noodles (...) [...] The variations in meat, broth, and additional garnishes such as lime, bean sprouts, ngò gai (Eryngium foetidum), húng quế (Thai/Asian basil), and tương đen (bean sauce/hoisin sauce), tương ớt (hot chili sauce, e.g., Sriracha sauce) appear to be innovations made by or introduced to the South.|$|E

2500|$|Each Southern locale {{has its own}} {{variety of}} barbecue, {{particularly}} sauces. North Carolina sauces vary by region; eastern North Carolina uses a vinegar-based sauce, {{the center of the}} state uses Lexington-style barbecue, with a combination of ketchup and vinegar as their base, and western North Carolina uses a heavier ketchup base. Lexington calls itself [...] "The Barbecue Capital of the World"; it has more than one BBQ restaurant per 1,000 residents. South Carolina is the only state that traditionally includes all four recognized barbecue sauces, including mustard-based, vinegar-based, and light and heavy tomato-based sauces. Memphis barbecue is best known for tomato- and vinegar-based sauces. In some Memphis establishments and in Kentucky, meat is rubbed with dry seasoning (dry rubs) and smoked over hickory wood without sauce. The finished barbecue is then served with barbecue <b>sauce</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side.|$|E

These kind of books are wrong, and yet I never go into a train but what they pile 'em up on me. No good {{can come out of}} an international clinch between the Old-World aristocracy and one of us fresh Americans. When people in real life marry, they generally hunt up somebody in their own station. A fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same high-school and belonged to the same singing-society that he did. When young millionaires fall in love, they always select the chorus-girl that likes the same kind of <b>sauce</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lobster that he does. Washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boarding-houses. No, sir, you can't make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of C. D.

60|$|It had originated, {{not with}} Innocent Smith, but with Michael Moon. He {{was in a}} strange glow and {{pressure}} of spirits, and talked incessantly; yet {{he had never been}} more sarcastic, and even inhuman. He used his old useless knowledge as a barrister to talk entertainingly of a tribunal that was a parody on the pompous anomalies of English law. The High Court of Beacon, he declared, was a splendid example of our free and sensible constitution. It had been founded by King John in defiance of the Magna Carta, and now held absolute power over windmills, wine and spirit licences, ladies traveling in Turkey, revision of sentences for dog-stealing and parricide, as well as anything whatever that happened in the town of Market Bosworth. The whole hundred and nine seneschals of the High Court of Beacon met once in every four centuries; but in the intervals (as Mr. Moon explained) the whole powers of the institution were vested in Mrs. Duke. Tossed about among the rest of the company, however, the High Court did not retain its historical and legal seriousness, but was used somewhat unscrupulously in a riot of domestic detail. If somebody spilt the Worcester <b>Sauce</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tablecloth, he was quite sure it was a rite without which the sittings and findings of the Court would be invalid; or if somebody wanted a window to remain shut, he would suddenly remember that none but the third son of the lord of the manor of Penge had the right to open it. They even went to the length of making arrests and conducting criminal inquiries. The proposed trial of Moses Gould for patriotism was rather above the heads of the company, especially of the criminal; but the trial of Inglewood on a charge of photographic libel, and his triumphant acquittal upon a plea of insanity, were admitted to be in the best tradition of the Court.|$|E

5000|$|Many SCA events feature food {{ranging from}} simple [...] "fighter's fare" [...] or a [...] "peasant lunch" [...] of bread, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, {{and a simple}} {{vegetable}} or meat soup, to elaborate multi-course feasts served {{over a period of}} several hours. Such feasts may focus on dishes from England, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, or other locations and times within the SCA's period of study. Common dishes are roasted beef or chickens with mustard or other <b>sauces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side, meat pies, cheese-filled ravioli, green salads, [...] "armored turnips" [...] (turnips sliced and layered with cheese and spices), glazed carrots, applesauce, and pears or apples cooked in wine.|$|R

60|$|Marcia {{had never}} dined in a restaurant, {{and she was}} {{somewhat}} bewildered by the one into which they turned. There was a great show of roast, and steak, and fish, and game, and squash and cranberry-pie in the window, and at the door a tack was driven through a mass of bills of fare, two of which Bartley plucked off as they entered, with a knowing air, and then threw on the floor when he found the same thing on the table. The table had a marble top, and a silver-plated castor in the centre. The plates were laid with a coarse red doily in a cocked hat on each, and a thinly plated knife and fork crossed beneath it; the plates were thick and heavy; the handle {{as well as the}} blade of the knife was metal, and silvered. Besides the castor, there was a bottle of Leicestershire <b>sauce</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, and salt in what Marcia thought a pepper-box; the marble was of an unctuous translucence in places, and showed the course of the cleansing napkin on its smeared surface. The place was hot, and full of confused smells of cooking; all the tables were crowded, so that they found places with difficulty, and pale, plain girls, of the Provincial and Irish-American type, in fashionable bangs and pull-backs, went about taking the orders, which they wailed out toward a semicircular hole opening upon a counter at the farther end of the room; there they received the dishes ordered, and hurried with them to the customers, before whom they laid them with a noisy clacking of the heavy crockery. A great many of the people seemed to be taking hulled corn and milk; baked beans formed another favorite dish, and squash-pie was in large request. Marcia was not critical; roast turkey for Bartley and stewed chicken for herself, with cranberry-pie for both, seemed to her a very good and sufficient dinner, and better than they ought to have had. She asked Bartley if this were anything like Parker's; he had always talked to her about Parker's.|$|E
