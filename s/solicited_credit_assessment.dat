Accurate and scientific <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> is of great significance to the operational decisions of shareholders, corporate creditors, and management. Building a good and reliable <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> model is key to <b>credit</b> <b>assessment.</b> Traditional <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> models are constructed using the support vector machine (SVM) combined with certain traditional dimensionality reduction algorithms. When constructing such a model, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are first applied to reduce {{the dimensions of the}} samples, so as to prevent the correlation of the samples’ characteristic index from being too high. Then, machine learning of the samples will be conducted using the SVM, in order to carry out classification assessment. To further improve the accuracy of <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> methods, this paper has introduced more cutting-edge algorithms, applied isometric feature mapping (Isomap) for dimensionality reduction, and used the relevance vector machine (RVM) for credit classification. It has constructed an Isomap-RVM model and used it to conduct financial analysis of China's listed companies. The empirical analysis shows that the <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> accuracy of the Isomap-RVM model is significantly higher than that of the Isomap-SVM model and slightly higher than that of the PCA-RVM model. It can correctly identify the credit risks of listed companies...|$|R

30|$|According to Dinh and Kleimeier (2007), the {{determination}} of loans {{does not depend on}} the borrower’s income or the amount of collateral, but rather on the qualitative analysis (of, for example, the borrower’s personality, reputation, or social status). Because the maintenance of social credit relationships is expensive, banks typically adopt the credit scoring model to quantitatively analyze a borrower’s credit situation to determine loans and identify whether a borrower can obey the contract. Banks’ <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> of corporate customers is a multiple-criteria decision-making problem in which various elements are comprehensively assessed. The construction of an effective <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> model requires that credit staff possess sufficient professional knowledge and practical experience. Previous <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> studies have mostly analyzed the opinion of a group of credit staff by using a single precise value, which cannot fully describe the actual distribution of credit staff opinions and tends to diminish minority and peculiar opinions. Therefore, precise values are inapplicable in actual decision environments and constructed <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> models do not possess the features of anti-catastrophism and sensitivity, which are the criteria of a superior assessment system (Hsieh 2003). Srinivasan and Kim (1988) stated that <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> can be conducted using theory-based scientific and objective methods. The experience of credit decision managers and senior credit staff responsible for <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> can be applied to <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> models for determining credit categorization and rating weights (Chiou and Shen 2011; Lee et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Title: The {{amortization}} requirements' {{impact on}} banking operations organization and <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> Authors: Annie Majlöf and Therese Hasselgren Supervisor: Titti Eliasson Examiner: Eva Berggren Keywords: <b>Credit</b> <b>assessment,</b> organization change, banks, amortization requirement Purpose: The {{purpose of our}} study {{is to increase the}} understanding and to find out how a regulation change, as the amortization requirement, may affect and change the organization and <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> in various banks. Problem background: Swedish households are currently highly leveraged where the high indebtedness is partly a result of low amortization rate. Measures to reduce debt may therefore be necessary to reduce households' sensitivity to economic disruptions. If the amortization rate increases, the high leverage of households would attenuate. For this reason, an amortization requirement is introduced with the purpose of reduce debt and increase households’ resistance. If the market requires change it is necessary that organizations change accordingly. As a result of new regulations and requirements the need of change arises and directly affects organizations, such as adaptation of procedures and processes, internal systems and skill development. Research problem: How can the amortization requirement affect and change the organization and <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> in banks? Method: This study is of qualitative character since the empirical material consists of qualitative interviews. The intention is to acquire increased comprehension rather than to make generalization possible. We derived our empirical study based on our theoretical framework in order to later analyze the two parts. Based on the analysis {{we have been able to}} draw conclusions and to bring discussion. Conclusion: The study came out into that the amortization requirement creates a rational and a saner repayment culture. As a result of the regulation change there has been some change in the banks’ organization in various aspects. A conclusion is that the <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> when granting <b>credit</b> is more restrictive and limited as a result of the requirement claim. However, the amortization requirement constitutes a varied impact on banks’ organization and <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> process...|$|R

Without collateral, a bank may deny credit even if its <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> suggests that the project is marginally profitable. Collateral improves the bank’s payoffs from financing such marginally profitable projects, thus mitigating the inefficiency arising from discretionary credit decisions.

Banks represent {{one of the primary}} stakeholders and financiers of a company, and place great emphasis on financial reports in their <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> process. The question is, however, how useful the financial information actually is. According to previous research, banks consider accounting information as troublesome in some respects, mostly due to accounting choices and judgments. As the newly introduced K-regulations in Sweden are mandatory from 2014, {{it is not clear how}} the choice between K 2 and K 3 will affect a company’s creditworthiness. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of accounting information presented in financial reports, as a part of banks’ information need in the <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> process. Methodology: To achieve the purpose, a qualitative research was used. Empirical material was gathered through semi-structured interviews with respondents representing five different banks in Sweden. The respondents were bank officers with great knowledge in the <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> process.

Building on asymmetric information theory, factors identified in previous research are grouped into the theoretical categories of risk-assessment, risk-alignment, and risk-shifting. Hypotheses are developed as to what influences lending officers' <b>credit</b> <b>assessments.</b> In addition, it is hypothesized that risk-taking proclivity interacts with other variables. A conjoint experiment involving 114 lending officers is used to test the hypotheses, which are, by and large, supported by the data. Furthermore, the study investigates how individual differences in experience among lending officers affect the <b>credit</b> <b>assessments,</b> e. g., more experienced lending officers use more sophisticated decision policies involving interactions. When the results from the experiments were compared with the lending officers' self-perceived assessments, it was discovered that lending officers have limited insight into their own <b>credit</b> <b>assessments.</b> The findings of this study have implications for SMEs, lending officers, and lending organizations. The results can assist SMEs to better tailor loan applications. Banks can use the results to make comparisons with their existing credit guidelines, which could assist them in improving their decision-making. The three theoretical categories identified provide a foundation for future research on bank lending to SMEs. The developed model can facilitate empirical research on bank lending under asymmetric information by providing a structure and categorizing previous research into relevant categories...|$|R
