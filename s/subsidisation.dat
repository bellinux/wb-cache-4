50|$|Although {{there was}} a {{category}} of industries left {{to the private sector}} (Schedule C above), the sector was kept under state control through a system of licenses.

This was done to counter regional disparities that existed in the country. Licenses to increase the production were issued only if the government was convinced that the economy required more of the goods.|$|E

50|$|Hayden {{increased}} the Labor vote at the 1980 election, but {{was replaced by}} Bob Hawke in 1983, who led Labor back to office at the 1983 election. Hawke was defeated as Labor leader in a 1991 spill against Paul Keating who had been Treasurer of Australia since 1983. Hawke is Labor's longest-serving Prime Minister and Australia's third-longest-serving Prime Minister. Hawke and Keating led Labor to victory at five consecutive federal elections: 1983, 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993. The Hawke and Keating Labor governments radically transformed the Australian economy, departing from a historical bipartisan Keynesian approach to the Australian economy, with the change of the Australian dollar from a government-fixed exchange rate to a floating exchange rate. Extensive deregulation of financial and banking systems occurred, both of which made Australia significantly more integrated with the global economy. Privatisation of state sector industries occurred, including Qantas and Commonwealth Bank. The tariff system was dismantled, and the <b>subsidisation</b> of some loss-making industries ended. Low-income centralised wage fixing was introduced through the Prices and Incomes Accord, and enterprise bargaining was introduced. The tax system was changed, including the introduction of fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax. Superannuation in Australia was implemented with a 9% employer contribution. Tertiary education fees in Australia saw a HECS payment system introduced {{as a replacement for}} fee-free tertiary education which had been removed after Whitlam. Medicare was introduced as a replacement for Medibank which had also been removed after Whitlam. Dental insurance through the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was introduced, but was removed after Labor lost government. Funding for schools was considerably increased, financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer, native title in Australia was recognised, and progress was made in directing assistance to the most disadvantaged recipients over a whole range of welfare benefits. The Parliament of Australia itself was reformed in several ways. The duration of the 13-year Labor government saw thousands of Acts passed by the Australian Parliament, though Labor did not have a Senate majority.|$|E
