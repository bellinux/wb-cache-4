25|$|In August 2007, Warner Independent Pictures {{acquired}} the North American rights and Pathé the international rights to distribute Slumdog Millionaire theatrically. However, in May 2008, Warner Independent Pictures was shut down, {{with all of}} its projects being transferred to Warner Bros., its parent studio. Warner Bros. doubted the commercial prospects of Slumdog Millionaire and suggested that it would go straight to DVD without a US theatrical release. In August 2008, the studio began searching for buyers for various productions, to relieve its overload of end-of-the-year films. Halfway through the month, Warner Bros. entered into a pact with Fox Searchlight Pictures to <b>share</b> <b>distribution</b> of the film, with Fox Searchlight buying 50% of Warner Bros.'s interest in the movie and handling US distribution.|$|E
25|$|Video {{rights to}} all the films and TV {{specials}} were licensed by Media Home Entertainment and Kartes Video Communications in the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the rights were acquired by Paramount Pictures and the company released all of the TV specials under their Paramount Home Video label. The distribution rights to the TV specials are now with Warner Bros. Television and Warner Home Video, who purchased the rights from Paramount in 2007 and managed by its classic animation division. Paramount holds the home media rights to all four theatrical releases, having acquired the rights to A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home following the merger of its parent Viacom with CBS; CBS' former subsidiary Cinema Center Films released the first two films in theaters and CBS/Fox Video released them on home video while Paramount handled production and home video distribution Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!). The two companies do not <b>share</b> <b>distribution</b> of the films on television; CBS Television Distribution handles the first two films while Trifecta Entertainment and Media handles the later two.|$|E
25|$|Advanced economies {{account for}} the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most {{important}} region in 2010, followed by North America $1.409 trillion and Asia $1.161 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace. The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance <b>share</b> <b>distribution</b> across the world is China. According to Sam Radwan of ENHANCE International LLC, low premium penetration (insurance premium as a % of GDP), an ageing population and the largest car market in terms of new sales, premium growth has averaged 15–20% in the past five years, and China {{is expected to be the}} largest insurance market in the next decade or two.|$|E
40|$|Competition between varying ideas, {{people and}} {{institutions}} fuels {{the dynamics of}} socio-economic systems. Numerous analyses of the empirical data extracted from different financial markets have established a consistent set of stylized facts describing statistical signatures of the competition in the financial markets. Having an established and consistent set of stylized facts helps to set clear goals for theoretical models to achieve. Despite similar abundance of empirical analyses in sociophysics, there is no consistent set of stylized facts describing the opinion dynamics.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{statistical}} properties of household consumption-expenditure budget <b>share</b> <b>distributions</b> - {{defined as the}} share of household total expenditure spent for purchasing a specific category of commodities - for a large sample of Italian households in the period 1989 - 2004. We find that household budget <b>share</b> <b>distributions</b> are fairly stable over time for each specific category, but profoundly heterogeneous across commodity categories. We then derive a parametric density that is able to satisfactorily characterize (from a univariate perspective) household budget <b>share</b> <b>distributions</b> and: (i) {{is consistent with the}} observed statistical properties of the underlying levels of household consumption-expenditure distributions; (ii) can accommodate the observed across-category heterogeneity in household budget-share distributions.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel secure key <b>sharing</b> and <b>distribution</b> {{scheme for}} network {{mobility}} (NEMO) group communications is proposed.

Both forward and backward secrecy are guaranteed by compulsive key refreshment and automatic key refreshment mechanisms, which provide dynamic in-progress group communication joining/ leaving and periodic keys renewal, respectively.

40|$|The authors study brand-share {{dynamics}} among competing brands in new repeat-purchase categories. In such new categories, {{market shares}} are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can {{take into account}} the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's market <b>share</b> and its <b>distribution</b> over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's market <b>share</b> and <b>distribution,</b> is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled market <b>share</b> and <b>distribution.</b> Empirical results using data from the U. S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between market <b>share</b> and <b>distribution</b> exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early {{in the life of the}} new category small short-term changes in market <b>share</b> or <b>distribution</b> may generate larger long-term changes in market <b>share</b> and <b>distribution.</b> Later, such momentum appears absent, In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{increased}} {{processing power}} and storage capacity of in-home and mobile computing devices has motivated their inclusion in distributed and cloud computing systems.
