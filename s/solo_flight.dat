5|$|Achievements in gliding {{have been}} marked by the {{awarding}} of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first <b>solo</b> <b>flight,</b> national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the Gliding Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E

5|$|Developing a {{love for}} motor vehicles, motor cycles and flying as a teenager, Lock joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as an AC2 Airman u/t Pilot (No. 745051) on 17 February 1939, and was {{promoted}} to Sergeant the following day. He undertook his initial peacetime training mostly on weekends and some week nights with 28 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School (No. 28 E) run by the company 'Reid & Sigrist' at Meir, outside Stoke-on-Trent and made his first <b>solo</b> <b>flight</b> within the month.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May {{he became}} the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate. He passed as Second Class Flier. He {{was good enough to}} be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of <b>solo</b> <b>flight</b> himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{used his}} {{position}} {{to create an}} extensive bureaucracy and involve himself {{as much as possible}} in the decision making. He gained acceptance into Hitler's inner circle, and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests. He began acting as Hitler's personal secretary on 12 August 1935. Bormann assumed Hess' former duties, with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei (Party Chancellery), after Hess' <b>solo</b> <b>flight</b> to Britain on 10 May 1941 to seek peace negotiations with the British government. He had final approval over civil service appointments, reviewed and approved legislation, and by 1943 had de facto control over all domestic matters. Bormann was one of the leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches and favoured harsh treatment of Jews and Slavs in the areas conquered by Germany during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{began his}} {{military}} training on 1 October 1940 at the 10th Flying Regiment in Neukuhren. On 1 March 1941, he progressed to the Luftkriegsschule 2 (Air War School 2) in Berlin-Gatow, {{making his first}} flight with an instructor four days later, followed in just under three weeks by his first <b>solo</b> <b>flight.</b> He completed his basic flying training in October 1941 and began advanced flight training at pre-fighter school 2 in Lachen-Speyerdorf on 1 November 1941. There, Hartmann learned combat techniques and gunnery skills. His advanced pilot training was completed on 31 January 1942, and, between 1 March 1942 and 20 August 1942, he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Bf 109 at the Jagdfliegerschule 2 (Fighter Pilot School 2) in Zerbst/Anhalt.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, Baker {{followed}} his ambition {{of joining the}} Australian Flying Corps and applied for a transfer to become an air mechanic when the opportunity arose. His application proved successful, though he was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training. Embarking for the United Kingdom the following month, he was posted to No. 5 Training Squadron as a cadet pilot for his initial aviation instruction. On 27 March, Baker graduated as a pilot in the Australian Flying Corps and was commissioned as a second lieutenant; he had completed his first <b>solo</b> <b>flight</b> earlier that month. In May, he was posted for a course at No. 2 School of Aerial Fighting and Gunnery.|$|E

5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a <b>solo</b> <b>flight</b> to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|In December 1937 {{he began}} flight {{training}} at the No. 7 Elementary Flying School (EFS) at Desford. It was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual instruction with their flight instructor. For Braham, progress was slow and {{he made his first}} <b>solo</b> <b>flight</b> after 14 hours of dual instruction. On 9 March 1938 Braham flew solo {{for the first time in}} a Tiger Moth. In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge. After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin training on military aircraft. Now assigned to the No. 11 EFS he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on the Hawker Hart. He completed his advanced flight training on 20 August 1938 and began the final phase of training in the Hawker Fury. He completed his training in formation flying, aerobatics and gunnery practice over the next four months, graduating in December 1938.|$|E
5|$|His {{military}} training began on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School (Luftkriegsschule 2) at Gatow, on the south-western outskirts of Berlin. He swore the National Socialist {{oath of allegiance}} on 21 April 1936. Flight training began on Monday, 7 August 1936 at Gatow. His first flight was in a Heinkel He 72 Kadet D-EYZA single engine biplane. Lent logged his first <b>solo</b> <b>flight</b> on 15 September 1936 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz. By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook. In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises, Lent {{was involved in a}} road accident, breaking his upper leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months. This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to Fähnrich. On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to Oberfähnrich (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to Leutnant. By this time, he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time, mostly in daylight flights, in single engine training aircraft.|$|E
