25|$|Geotechnical {{investigations}} are performed by geotechnical engineers or engineering geologists {{to obtain information}} on the physical properties of soil and rock around a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. This type of investigation is called a <b>site</b> <b>investigation.</b> Additionally, geotechnical {{investigations are}} also {{used to measure the}} thermal resistivity of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves soil sampling and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.|$|E
2500|$|The Lockheed toxic {{clean-up}} site, {{just east}} of the Golden State Freeway, later became home to the Empire Center. Four developers competed to be selected to build the $300 million outdoor mall on the site. In 1999, Lockheed picked Los Angeles-based Zelman Cos. from among other contenders to create the retail-office complex on a [...] site. Zelman purchased the land in 2000 for around $70 million. As part of the sales agreement, Lockheed carried out extensive soil vapor removal on the site. Lockheed had manufactured planes on the site from 1928 to 1991. Together with $42 million for demolition and $12 million for <b>site</b> <b>investigation,</b> Lockheed would eventually spend $115 million on the project.|$|E
2500|$|Victorian groups VUFORS and PRA invited Dr. J. Allen Hynek {{to visit}} Australia. He {{accepted}} the invitation and in 1973 arrived in Australia, spending {{four days in}} Melbourne, followed by short stops in Sydney, ACT, Brisbane and Papua New Guinea. While in Victoria, Dr. Hynek also met with Rev. William Gill, {{who was involved in}} the famous [...] "close encounters of the third kind" [...] case that occurred in the Anglican mission village at Boianai, Papua, New Guinea,. He also journeyed to Papua, which enabled him to undertake a detailed on <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> into this famous case. Victorian members of VUFORS and PRA arranged that, during his stay in the ACT, he was able to talk with Shamus O'Farrell, discussing O'Farrell's famous 1954 Sea Fury incident.|$|E

2500|$|In-situ gas {{tests can}} be carried out in the {{boreholes}} on completion and in probe holes made in the sides of the trial pits as part of the <b>site</b> <b>investigation.</b> [...] Testing is normally with a portable meter, which measures the methane content as its percentage volume in air. [...] The corresponding oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are also measured. [...] A more accurate method used to monitor over the longer term, consists of gas monitoring standpipes should be installed in boreholes. [...] These typically comprise slotted uPVC pipework surrounded by single sized gravel. [...] The top 0.5m to 1.0m of pipework is usually not slotted and is surrounded by bentonite pellets to seal the borehole. [...] Valves are fitted and the installations protected by lockable stopcock covers normally fitted flush with the ground. [...] Monitoring is again with a portable meter and is usually done on a fortnightly or monthly basis.|$|E
