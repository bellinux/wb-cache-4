5|$|Many of Sorabji's {{works are}} {{written for the}} piano or have an {{important}} piano part. His writing for the instrument was influenced by that of composers such as Liszt, Alkan and Godowsky, {{and he has been}} described as a composer-pianist in their tradition, partly because he was one of the 20th century's most prolific piano composers. It exhibits particularly the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony and its use of polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of systems of more than two <b>staves</b> in Sorabji's keyboard parts, reaching its peak on page 124 of the manuscript of his Third Organ Symphony (1949–53), which uses 11 <b>staves,</b> as well as frequent calls for use of the sostenuto pedal.|$|E
5|$|The symphony is scored for solo soprano, four flutes (two players {{doubling}} on piccolos), four clarinets in B, two bassoons, two contrabassoons, four horns in F, four trombones, harp, {{piano and}} strings. Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces: 16 first violins, 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, and 8 double basses. For {{most of the}} score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate staff. Thus the string writing is mainly in ten different parts, on ten separate <b>staves.</b> In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts, which are written on the same staff, so that ten <b>staves</b> are still used for {{a greater number of}} parts.|$|E

5000|$|During the Middle Ages all wooden {{churches in}} Norway (about 1,000 in total) were {{constructed}} as <b>stave</b> churches, with only 271 masonry constructions.

5|$|The passage {{beginning}} at bars 231 ("NUN: Scrutemur vias nostras") presents a rhythmic texture new to Stravinsky, which strongly resembles the multilayered rhythms of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße, which Robert Craft was rehearsing in Stravinsky's home {{at precisely the}} time of composition (16 January to 14 February 1958). Stravinsky attended not only these rehearsals but also the recording sessions for Zeitmaße, following the score with great interest. The published score of Threni is also the first of Stravinsky's works to adopt the notational device of replacing the <b>staves</b> in silent measures with whites space on the page, a feature frequently found in Stravinsky's manuscripts as early as 1916, but only in print from this point onward. This feature {{is also found in}} Stockhausen's score.|$|E
5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the <b>staves</b> (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E

50|$|In Norway, {{they were}} {{gradually}} replaced and many survived until the 19th century when {{a substantial number}} were destroyed. Today, 28 historical <b>stave</b> churches remain standing in Norway. <b>Stave</b> churches were particularly common in less populated areas in high valleys and forest land, and fishermen's villages on islands and in minor villages along fjords. Around 1800 in Norway 322 <b>stave</b> churches were still known {{and most of these}} were in sparsely populated areas of Norway. If the main church was masonry the annex church could be a <b>stave</b> church. Masonry churches were mostly built in towns, along the coast, and in rich agricultural areas in Trøndelag and East Norway, {{as well as in the}} larger parishes in fjord districts i Western Norway. During 1400s and 1500s no new churches were built in Norway. Norway's <b>stave</b> churches largely disappeared until 1700 and were replaced by log buildings. Several <b>stave</b> churches were redesigned or enlarged in a different technique during 1600-1700, for instance Flesberg <b>stave</b> church were converted into cruciform church partly in log construction. According to Dietrichson, most <b>stave</b> churches were dismantled to make room for a new church, partly because the old church had become too small for the congregation, partly because the <b>stave</b> church was in poor condition. Fire, storm, avalanche and decay were other reasons. In 1650 there were about 270 <b>stave</b> churches left in Norway, and in the next hundred years 136 of these disappeared. Around 1800 there were still 95 <b>stave</b> churches, while over 200 former <b>stave</b> churches were still known by name or in written sources. From 1850 to 1885 32 <b>stave</b> churches fell, since then only the Fantoft <b>stave</b> church has been lost.|$|R

5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying <b>staves</b> or clubs, living {{beyond the}} bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood <b>staves</b> or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E
5|$|The 26 rongorongo texts with letter {{codes are}} inscribed on wooden objects, each with between 2 and 2320 simple glyphs and {{components}} of compound glyphs, for over 15,000 in all.

The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and <b>staves,</b> were works of art and valued possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names {{in the same manner}} as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though others may be as old or older.

5|$|As the Mary Rose {{was built}} and served {{during a period}} of rapid {{development}} of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of <b>staves</b> or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and breech loaded, from the back, and equipped with simpler gun-carriages made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one pair of wheels, or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, jagged holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.|$|E
