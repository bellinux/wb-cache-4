5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, three {{countries}} applied {{to make their}} debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries. The semi-final was introduced in 2004 {{in an attempt to}} prevent situations like this. The Union <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> forty countries, but by 2005 thirty-nine were competing. In 2007, the EBU lifted the limit, allowing forty-two countries to compete. Two semi-finals were held {{for the first time in}} 2008.|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would {{be among the most}} highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

United States Federal Aviation Authority regulations <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> 250 nmol/mol {{with a maximum}} four-hour average of 100 nmol/mol. Some planes are equipped with ozone converters in the ventilation system to reduce passenger exposure.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic is a Group 1 carcinogen. The {{amount of}} arsenic in rice varies widely with the {{greatest}} concentration in brown rice and rice grown on land formerly used to grow cotton, such as in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. White rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, which account collectively for 76 percent of American-produced rice, had higher levels of arsenic than {{other regions of the}} world studied, possibly because of past use of arsenic-based pesticides to control cotton weevils. Jasmine rice from Thailand and Basmati rice from Pakistan and India contain the least arsenic among rice varieties in one study. China has <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> 150 ppb for arsenic in rice.|$|E
25|$|For {{their mutual}} {{assurance}} {{and stability of}} the currency, members of the eurozone have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets agreed limits on deficits and national debt, with associated sanctions for deviation. The Pact originally <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> 3% of GDP for the yearly deficit of all eurozone member states; with fines for any state which exceeded this amount. In 2005, Portugal, Germany, and France had all exceeded this amount, but the Council of Ministers had not voted to fine those states. Subsequently, reforms were adopted to provide more flexibility and ensure that the deficit criteria took into account the economic conditions of the member states, and additional factors.|$|E

500|$|The Metallurgical Laboratory's Health Division set {{standards}} for radiation exposure. Workers were routinely tested at University of Chicago clinics, but {{this could be}} too late. Personal quartz fiber dosimeters were procured, as were film badge dosimeters, which recorded cumulative dosage. Stone's Health Division worked closely with William P. Jesse's Instrumentation Group in the Physics Division to develop detectors, including portable Geiger counters. Herbert M. Parker created a metric for radiation exposure he called the roentgen equivalent man or rem. After the war, this replaced the roentgen as the standard measure of radiation exposure. Work to assess the toxicity of plutonium got under way when the plutonium [...] at the Clinton Engineer Works began producing it in 1943. The project <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> 5 micrograms (μg) in the body, and work practices and workplaces at Chicago and Clinton were modified {{to ensure that this}} standard was met.|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} concerning how many producers should receive an {{award from the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their work in producing the film. In 1999, the Academy decided that up {{to a maximum of}} three producers are eligible to be included in an award for a film. The rule was implemented to prevent a large number of involved filmmakers to appear on stage when a film was receiving an award. The Producers Guild of America (PGA) has not <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> producers that can be honored for a film. In the case of Little Miss Sunshine, there were five producers (Marc Turtletaub, Peter Saraf, Albert Berger, Ron Yerxa, and David Friendly) and the Academy did not want to include Berger and Yerxa. The two producers were responsible for finding the script, introducing the directors to the other producers, choosing the cinematographer, assisting in the re-shoot of the ending, and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival. The Academy acknowledged that the two were partners in the production process, but declared that only individual producers are recognized by the Academy. Deeming the two producers' work as a collective effort, the Academy refused to consider either Berger or Yerxa for the award. Producer David Hoberman commented on the support for honoring all five producers, stating [...] "If there are five people actually involved in producing a movie, there's no reason why someone who's made a good enough film to be nominated for an Academy Award should be precluded from being rewarded for the work they did." [...] Lynda Obst who was affiliated with an Academy Award producer committee, also commented: [...] "By and large, five people don't make a movie. If this is an exception, then it's a sad situation. But you don't destroy a rule for an exception." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hot {{water can}} cause painful, {{dangerous}} scalding injuries, especially {{in children and}} the elderly. Water at the outlet should not exceed 49 degrees Celsius. Some jurisdictions <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> 49 degrees on tank setpoint temperature. [...] On the other hand, water stored below 60 degrees Celsius can permit the growth of bacteria, {{such as those that}} cause Legionnaire's disease, which is a particular danger to those with compromised immune systems. One technical solution would be use of mixing valves at outlets used for sinks, baths or showers, that would automatically mix cold water to maintain a maximum below 49 C. A proposal to add this to the building code of Canada was unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 January 2012, Air France-KLM {{announced}} their three-year transformation plan, called Transform 2015, to restore profitability. This plan works by restoring competitiveness through cost-cutting, restructuring the short- and medium-haul operations and rapidly reducing debt. The main {{objective of this}} plan was to turn Air France-KLM back into a world player by 2015. Air France had been losing 700 million euros a year. As the financial results of 2011 demonstrated, the long-haul operations, also subject to increasing competition, {{would not be able}} to offset these losses. On 22 February 2012, Air France released their plan for summer schedule.
