5|$|The uptake of {{nutrient}} {{and water}} by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the upper layer of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from desiccation by a continuous {{supply of water}} from the sinker root. The water supplied to the laterals by the sinker root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from the water table into <b>surface</b> <b>soil,</b> a process known as hydraulic redistribution. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much biomass, only for it to be lost {{at the end of the}} growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that is critical in the competition for nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, <b>surface</b> <b>soil</b> is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E

Higher values of organic C, exchangeable Ca and pH occurred more frequently in <b>surface</b> <b>soils,</b> while exchangeable A 1 and exchangeable Mg were generally higher in subsoils. A correlation matrix gave significant, but not strong, linear correlations between soil attributes associated with soil acidity (pH and Ca, Mg and A 1 saturations). Soil solutions were extracted from surface and subsoil horizons of 48 of these acid soils and analysed for pH, EC, Na, K, Ca, Mg, SO and monomeric Al. Ionic strengths and activities of monomeric Al species were calculated. Soil solution pH tended to be lower in subsoils than in <b>surface</b> <b>soils,</b> but very few values were Ca. Mean values for activities of A 1 OH, AK(OH), Al(OH) and AISO in <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> exceeded those for subsoils, but activities of Al were similar.

Typically farmers break up hardpan up with a subsoiler, which acts as a long, sharp knife to slice through the hardened layer of soil deep below the <b>surface.</b> <b>Soil</b> erosion due to improper land and plough utilisation is possible. Contour ploughing mitigates soil erosion by ploughing across a slope, along elevation lines.

Infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen ground, rock, concrete, paving, or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions not connected to a stream channel, because the velocity of overland flow depends on the surface slope. Endorheic basins may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know how much water is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the <b>surface</b> <b>soil</b> appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E

We investigated the influence of earthworm invasion on soil microbial biomass and activity in <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> of Allegheny northern hardwood forests in central New York state. Earthworm activity in these sites had transformed <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> with clear Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons (forest floor) overlying mineral soil, to more uniformly mixed organic-enriched A horizons. The highest concentrations of microbial biomass and activity occurred in the forest floor. Microbial biomass (assayed by chloroform fumigation-extraction) nearly doubled in surface (0 - 5 cm) mineral soils in response to earthworm activity, an effect that corresponded directly to redistribution of organic matter from forest floor into the mineral soil. Microbial activity in <b>surface</b> mineral <b>soils</b> was even {{more sensitive to the}} presence of earthworms than microbial biomass. For example, substrate-induced respiration (or maximum initial respiratory rate, MIRR) was 6. 7 -fold greater, basal respiration was 5 -fold greater, and microbial respiration per unit microbial biomass (metabolic quotient, qCO(2)) was almost 3 -fold greater in <b>surface</b> mineral <b>soils</b> where earthworms were present than in earthworm-free sites. Of the activity indices, only MIRR was higher when expressed on an organic matter basis. <b>Surface</b> mineral <b>soils</b> where earthworms were, 9 present thus appear to retain a high proportion of the microbial biomass and activity found in mor organic horizons. Our findings suggest that earthworm activity stimulates the activity of soil microorganisms, probably by enhancing organic C availability via processing and mixing of litter. The relative pattern in microbial properties did not change over the growing season; however, there were some seasonal changes in the proportional differences between worm and no-worm soils. Our results indicate interactions among earthworms, organic matter, and soil microbial activity that should alter the carbon and nutrient balance of northern hardwood forest <b>surface</b> <b>soils,</b> relative to non-invaded soils.

This {{study was designed to}} quantify the relative proportion of eroded <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> and collapsed bank sediment in the fine suspended sediment load of multiple runoff events in Goodwin Creek, MS using activities of 7 Be and 210 Pbxs. Each source material must have a unique radionuclide signature relative to the other to quantify the contributions from the different source areas to the suspended sediment load. Due to different erosion processes controlling the sediment delivery to streams, namely sheet erosion and bank collapse, eroded <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> will have higher activities of the 7 Be and 210 Pbxs than collapsed bank sediment. The fine suspended sediment, which is a mixture of eroded <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> and collapsed bank sediment, will have an intermediate radionuclide signature that is quantified in terms of the relative contribution from both source materials. A simple two-end member mixing model would determine the relative contribution from each source area to the total fine sediment load. The radionuclide signature of suspended sediments would lie roughly along the mixing line between the signatures of the two end-member sources of sediment. Data presented here focus on one runoff event and suggest that eroded <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> are more abundant in the suspended sediment early in the runoff event; however, collapsed bank sediment dominates the suspended load later in the runoff event...|$|R
