The following tasks also explain {{the different types of}} conservation. Piaget proposed that children's inability to conserve is due to weakness in the way children think during the preoperational stage (ages 2-6). This stage of cognitive development is characterized by children focusing on a single, salient dimension of height or length, while ignoring other important dimensions about a situation. [...] Children during this stage also tend to focus on the <b>static</b> <b>characteristics</b> of objects, instead of focusing on when objects undergo changes, which is a critical element of the following tasks.|$|E
50|$|The word metadyne {{is derived}} from the Greek words for {{conversion}} of power. While the name {{is believed to have been}} coined by Joseph Maximus Pestarini in a paper which he submitted to the Montefiore International Contest at Liège, Belgium in 1928, the type of machine which it described had been known since the 1880s. The first known British patent for a direct-current, cross-field generator was obtained by A. I. Gravier of Paris in 1882, and two further patents were obtained by E. Rosenberg in 1904 and 1907. Rosenberg later became the chief electrical engineer for Metropolitan-Vickers, and his machine produced a cross field by applying a short-circuit to an additional set of brushes. M. Osnos looked at the practical arrangements for several such machines in 1907, and in the same year, Felton and Guilleaume obtained a British patent, number 26,607, which described auxiliary windings, armature windings and multiple commutators, although all in fairly general terms. He also indicated that they could be used to transform a constant voltage into a constant current. Other patents were obtained prior to 1910 by Mather & Platt, Brown Boverei and Bruce Peebles.Pestarini worked on developing the theory of such machines between 1922 and 1930, although he concentrated on their <b>static</b> <b>characteristics,</b> rather than their dynamic characteristics. He contributed three papers on the subject to Revue Générale de l'Electricité in 1930, which included some practical applications. The main one was the use of the constant-current output for the control of traction motors on electric vehicles and the operation of cranes, areas in which he had some practical experience, following trials in conjunction with the Alsthom Company in France. In 1930, he made a trip to Britain, and the Metropolitan-Vickers company took his ideas and developed a working system. Unlike Rosenberg's solution, Pestarini, who later became a Professor at the Institute Electrotechnico Nazionale Galileo Ferraris in Turin, connected the additional brushes to an external supply to produce a transformer metadyne. The machine worked as a voltage-to-current amplifier because the flux generated by the current to the load opposed the flux in the control circuit. Development work at Metropolitan-Vickers in the 1930s was led by Arnold Tustin, and the company held the British patents for the Metadyne.|$|E
