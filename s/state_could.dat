50|$|Justice Felix Frankfurter concurred {{with the}} court's decision. He {{noted that the}} purpose of the Natural Gas Act was to occupy the gap in state {{regulation}} caused by the earlier Supreme Court cases which held that <b>states</b> <b>could</b> not regulate interstate gas or electric transactions. Because <b>states</b> <b>could</b> not regulate sales for resale on gathering lines, Frankfurter argued that Congress intended the FPC to regulate such sales.|$|R

5|$|The third case, Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington (Puyallup III), {{was decided}} in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing {{that under the}} {{doctrine}} of sovereign immunity, Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing {{for a majority of}} the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe's sovereign immunity, the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river that ran through the Puyallup Reservation as long as the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Besides the 1874 Supreme Court ruling, a {{critical}} moment came on December 15, 1879, when Judge Lorenzo Sawyer of the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in Orton, 32 F. 457 (C.C.D. Cal. 1879), {{that the federal government}} controlled the railroad land grants, and more importantly, the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> not control ultra vires acts of corporations.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer afford to}} pay interest on government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist <b>state</b> <b>could</b> defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E

5|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces {{at the dawn of}} the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German religious orders, and in 1212, Daugirutis' treaty with Novgorod shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian Tomas Baranauskas argues that a Lithuanian <b>state</b> <b>could</b> be said to exist as early as 1183.|$|E
5|$|Within four days, 2,300 men had {{answered}} Ellsworth's call. A selection {{of only the}} most desirable men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's full strength. When the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> not afford to supply the new troops, fundraisers were successful in raising $60,000 for the regiment, enough to provide uniforms, several different models of Sharps rifles, and provisions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus {{restored}} the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican <b>state</b> <b>could</b> be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, {{the first phase of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the shutdown. However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental <b>state</b> <b>could</b> be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, Breckinridge {{served as}} an {{independent}} commander in the lower Mississippi Valley, securing Confederate control of the area by taking Port Hudson, which helped halt the federal advance down the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, General Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Mississippi, was preparing an invasion of Kentucky, and Breckinridge was ordered to join him. Confederate leaders believed that Breckinridge's presence in the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> spur enlistments. Van Dorn was reluctant to lose command of Breckinridge and his men, {{and by the time}} he relented on October 15, Bragg was already retreating from the state after being defeated at the Battle of Perryville. Breckinridge and his division of 7,000 men met Bragg at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With Kentucky solidly under Union control, Breckinridge's wife and children moved south and followed his troops as closely as was safely possible.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian <b>state</b> <b>could</b> stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and to build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.|$|E
5|$|The {{news agency}} {{was founded in}} 1937, when the country was still a colony in the Dutch Empire, by {{independence}} activists dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} local coverage by the Dutch-owned Aneta news agency. Antara's operation was absorbed into the Dōmei Tsushin news network following invasion by the Japanese in 1942. Its staff {{played a key role in}} the broadcast of Indonesia's proclamation of independence and assumed control of the Dōmei facilities in the region at the end of the war. The agency remained under private management until it was placed under the control of the presidency in the 1960s when the government shifted its focus from decolonization to nation-building. Antara became an institution through which the <b>state</b> <b>could</b> promote its policies.|$|E
