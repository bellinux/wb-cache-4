5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, <b>Shadow</b> suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, <b>Shadow</b> remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, <b>Shadow</b> wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with <b>Shadow</b> reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches <b>Shadow,</b> and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells <b>Shadow</b> of an old agreement <b>Shadow</b> made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, <b>Shadow</b> searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, various <b>shadowing</b> {{properties}} are {{considered for a}} positively expansive map on a compact metrizable space. We show that the Lipschitz <b>shadowing</b> property, the s-limit <b>shadowing</b> property and the strong <b>shadowing</b> property are all equivalent to the (usual) <b>shadowing</b> property for a positively expansive map.

40|$|We study three {{notions of}} <b>shadowing</b> property: {{classical}} <b>shadowing</b> property, limit (or asymptotic) <b>shadowing,</b> and s-limit <b>shadowing.</b> We show that classical and s-limit <b>shadowing</b> property coincide for piecewise linear interval maps with constant slopes, and are further {{equivalent to the}} linking property introduced by Chen. We also construct a system which exhibits <b>shadowing</b> but not the limit <b>shadowing</b> property, and we study how <b>shadowing</b> properties transfer to maximal transitive subsystems and inverse limits (sometimes called natural extensions). Where practicable, we show that our results are best possible by means of examples. Comment: 22 page, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Performances of {{cellular}} networks over κ-μ <b>shadowed</b> fading with long-term <b>shadowing</b> {{has been studied}} in the existing literature. However, the impact of κ-μ <b>shadowed</b> fading with instantaneous <b>shadowing</b> on performances {{of cellular}} networks is unknown. Therefore, this letter analyzes the downlink coverage probability of a Poisson network with double <b>shadowed</b> fading which is composed of a large-scale fading of lognormal distribution and κ-μ <b>shadowed</b> fading with integer fading parameters. The closest base station association rule without <b>shadowing</b> is considered. For analytical tractability, the double <b>shadowed</b> fading is approximated as a weighted sum of κ-μ <b>shadowed</b> distributions based on the Gaussian-Hermit quadrature. As a main theoretical result, a closed-form expression for the downlink coverage probability of a Poisson network under double <b>shadowed</b> fading for the desired signal and arbitrary fading for the interfering signals is successfully derived. Numerical simulations reveal that the double <b>shadowed</b> fading provides a pessimistic coverage on a Poisson network compared with the long-term <b>shadowing</b> which is incorporated into cell selection.

5|$|Egyptian <b>shadow</b> clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of <b>shadow</b> clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a <b>shadow</b> over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the <b>shadow</b> cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third <b>shadow</b> clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the <b>shadow</b> cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its <b>shadow</b> in the opposite direction.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{practical}} recommendations for <b>shadowing</b> as a method of organizational study with a focus on the situated processes and practices of <b>shadowing</b> fieldwork. Design/methodology/approach – This paper reflects on the <b>shadowing</b> experiences of three researchers – in a hospital emergency department, nuclear power plants, and entrepreneur workspaces – to generate recommendations by identifying and synthesizing solutions that emerged during the encounters with the challenges and opportunities in <b>shadowing.</b> Findings – Considering <b>shadowing</b> as an ongoing and emergent research process can be helpful to prepare for particular aspects of <b>shadowing</b> fieldwork. <b>Shadowing</b> presents research challenges that may emerge in the practice of fieldwork, including how to negotiate awkward conversations with participants, what to bring and wear, and how to take notes. Practical implications – Though the recommendations for <b>shadowing</b> are based on particular experiences and may not generalize to all <b>shadowing</b> engagements, they offer concrete, practical recommendations useful across experience levels. The recommendations should sensitize researchers to the intimate and situational character of <b>shadowing,</b> and offer strategies for coping with the distinctive requirements of <b>shadowing.</b> Originality/value – By looking across diverse experiences of <b>shadowing,</b> the paper generated guidelines that help to make sense of <b>shadowing</b> processes, manage uncertainty in the field, and build on the emerging work on <b>shadowing.</b> The ten recommendations provide insight into <b>shadowing</b> that are of particular value to graduate students, junior researchers, and those new to <b>shadowing.</b> Moreover, the experienced shadower may find value in the camaraderie of shared experience, the concrete ideas about another 2 ̆ 7 s experience of <b>shadowing,</b> and insight in recommendations that capture aspects of fieldwork that they are also exploring...|$|R
