No sapeco, a erva-mate é submetida à temperatura elevada das chamas, do mesmo modo como era realizado pelos primeiros exploradores desta matéria prima. A falta de controle na temperatura deste processo acarreta na contaminação do produto por hidrocarbonetos policíclicos aromáticos (HPAs), por pirólise do produto ou carreamento da fumaça. Visando sugerir um sistema ideal de sapeco, foi desenvolvido um sapecador elétrico, forno esteira, com o qual foi estudada a inativação térmica das enzimas polifenoloxidase e {{peroxidase}} da erva-mate. As condições testadas em laboratório seguiram a definição das proporções folhas e talos, empregadas nas unidades industriais do município de Catanduvas, SC, bem como, as amostras foram caracterizadas quanto à composição centesimal. As amostras de erva-mate estudadas neste trabalho apresentaram os seguintes teores de proteína (14, 19 ± 0, 62 g/ 100 g), extrato etéreo (9, 01 ± 1, 10 g/ 100 g), cinzas (6, 00 ± 0, 29 g/ 100 g), fibra bruta (6, 00 ± 0, 29 g/ 100 g) e glicídeos (48, 30 ± 2, 07 g/ 100 g). A erva-mate como matéria prima apresentou densidade aparente de 27, 43 ± 6, 04 kg/m 3 e, proporção folhas/talos de 1, 79 ± 0, 29. A matéria prima apresenta irregularidades em suas dimensões a serem consideradas em futuros projetos industriais, a cinética de inativação térmica das enzimas nas folhas deve levar em consideração estas irregularidades. O forno esteira foi caracterizado em relação às condições de operação. O forno atingiu estabilidade térmica após 90 min. A temperatura de ajuste não correspondeu à temperatura real do forno esteira. O efeito da temperatura sobre o tempo de residência foi mais acentuado nas menores freqüências. Neste trabalho, foi avaliado o efeito do sapeco em forno esteira, sem contato direto com as chamas, na inativação das enzimas, a cor e a degradação da clorofila da erva-mate. A POD apresentou maior termo estabilidade em relação a PFO. Os modelos bifásico e por etapas consecutivas apresentaram os melhores ajustes aos dados de inativação térmica da POD (R 2 = 0, 99) para a condição estudada. A erva-mate processada em forno esteira foi comparada com a erva-mate processada em escala industrial. Foi verificado que em forno esteira, a temperatura de 255 ºC, por 20 segundos, pode substituir a operação de sapeco industrial. Este binômio tempo temperatura tem a vantagem significativa sobre a cor verde e minimização da degradação da clorofila, além de representar uma redução significativa na temperatura de processamento tradicionalmente empregada na operação industrial de sapeco da erva-mate. The green colouring of {{the mate}} marketed in Brazil is obtained by submitting mate leaves {{to the high}} temperatures of flames. This traditional process is known as sapeco and it inactivates the oxide reductase enzymes in mate tea. The sapeco process is {{carried out in the}} same manner as it used to be carried out by the first exploiters of this raw material. Since there is no temperature control in this process, the product is eventually contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), by pyrolysis of the product, or by deposition of smoke. Aiming to suggest an ideal system of sapeco that can avoid these contaminants, an electric conveyor oven was developed and the thermal inactivation of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase enzymes in mate was studied when performed with such conveyor oven. The conditions tested in laboratory followed the same proportion of leaves to twigs as that applied in the industrial units of the municipal district of Catanduvas, SC. Also, the samples were characterized in relation to their centesimal composition. The mate samples studied in this work showed the following contents: protein (14. 19 ± 0. 62 g/ 100 g), ethereal extract (9. 01 ± 1. 10 g/ 100 g), ashes (6. 00 ± 0. 29 g/ 100 g), crude fibres (6. 00 ± 0. 29 g/ 100 g), and total carbohydrates (48. 30 ± 2. 07 g/ 100 g). Mate as raw material showed a apparent density of 27. 43 ± 6. 04 kg/m 3 and a leaves to twigs proportion of 1. 79 ± 0. 29. There are irregularities in the dimensions of this raw material to be considered in future industrial projects; the kinetics of thermal inactivation of the enzymes in the leaves should take these irregularities in consideration. The conveyor oven was characterized in relation to operating conditions. The oven has reached thermal stability after 90 min. The <b>settled</b> <b>temperature</b> did not match the real temperature. The effect of temperature on the residence time was more pronounced in the lower frequencies The effect of the sapeco on the inactivation of the enzymes, the colour, and the chlorophyll degradation in mate was evaluated in this work, where the sapeco was performed in a conveyor oven, without any direct contact with the flames. POD presented more thermal stability than PFO. The biphasic and consecutive steps models showed the best adjustment to the data of thermal inactivation of POD (R 2 = 0. 99) in the condition studied. The mate processed in the conveyor oven was compared with mate processed in industrial scale. The results showed that the sapeco performed in the conveyor oven at a temperature of 255 ºC for 20 seconds can substitute the process of industrial sapeco. This time-temperature binomial has a significant advantage on the green colour and on the minimization of chlorophyll degradation, besides representing a significant reduction in the processing temperature traditionally used in the industrial sapeco of mate...|$|E

Migration to warmer water may allow females to breed annually and to encounter more adult males needed to fertilize subsequent clutches.

This document describes the rheology of slurries containing MST, CST, and simulated sludge that sat at indicated temperatures for up to 13 weeks. A previous SRNL report described preliminary rheology data of slurries containing MST and sludge. Preliminary results of the irradiation tests are also presented in this report, though additional data are still being collected. Rheology of the long term settling samples (6, 12, and 24 months) and additional irradiation test results will be reported at a later date. Conclusions from this analysis are as follows: (1) Slurries containing MST and unground CST have the largest shear strength. Due to the high shear strengths measured in slurries containing unground CST, evaluations of specific tank contents and mixing capability should be performed prior to any addition of this material into a waste tank. Experimentally determined shear strengths indicate mixing could be problematic in mixtures containing unground CST. (2) Increasing the ground CST fraction in the slurry increases the slurry shear strength, yield stress, and consistency. (3) Increasing the sludge fraction in the slurry decreases the slurry shear strength, yield stress, and consistency. (4) Slurries containing VSL ground CST have larger shear strength, yield stress, and consistency than slurries containing SRNL ground CST. (5) The effects of <b>settling</b> time and <b>temperature</b> on slurry shear strength are slurry dependent. (6) No effects of <b>settling</b> time and <b>temperature</b> on slurry yield stress or consistency were observed. (7) Radiation up to 100 MRad does not appear to affect properties of shear strength, yield stress, or consistency of process feeds...|$|R

Briefly, PLGA of 200 [*]mg was dissolved in 5 [*]mL dichloromethane, followed by mixing with 300 [*]μL of 10 [*]mg/mL KLH using a vortex mixer for 2 [*]min. The resulting mixture emulsified via sonication at 20 % amplitude for 20 [*]s using a sonic dismembrator (Model 500; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The primary emulsion {{was added dropwise}} into 200 [*]mL 1 % (w/v) PVA and stirred for 10 [*]min at 500 [*]rpm. The above suspension was emulsified through sonication at 50 % amplitude for 120 [*]s. The secondary emulsion was stirred overnight to allow organic solvent to evaporate. After <b>settling</b> at room <b>temperature</b> for 30 [*]min, precipitant was removed. NPs in suspension were collected by centrifuge at 20, 000 [*]g, 4 °C for 30 [*]min (Beckman Coulter Avanti J- 251, Brea, CA, USA). Pellet was washed using ultrapure water for three times. The final suspension was freeze dried (LABCONCO FreeZone 4.5, Kansas City, MO, USA) and stored at 2 °C for later use.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{installment}} of a paper in three parts, where we use noncommutative geometry to study the space of commensurability classes of Q-lattices and we show that the arithmetic properties of KMS states in the corresponding quantum statistical mechanical system, the theory of modular Hecke algebras, and the spectral realization of zeros of L-functions {{are part of a}} unique general picture. In this first chapter we give a complete description of the multiple phase transitions and arithmetic spontaneous symmetry breaking in dimension two. The system at zero <b>temperature</b> <b>settles</b> onto a classical Shimura variety, which parameterizes the pure phases of the system. The noncommutative space has an arithmetic structure provided by a rational subalgebra closely related to the modular Hecke algebra. The action of the symmetry group involves the formalism of superselection sectors and the full noncommutative system at positive temperature. It acts on values of the ground states at the rational elements via the Galois group of the modular field. Comment: 80 pages, LaTeX, 3 eps figure...|$|R
40|$|The e¡ect of {{temperature}} on the development, growth, survival and settlement of Perna viridis was studied under controlled conditions to provide infor-mation {{needed for the}} development of commercial hatchery technology for green mussel P. viridis. Total mortality of the larvae occurred after 24 h at tem-peratures of 33 1 C and 35 1 C. At 24 1 C, larvae took longer to <b>settle</b> than at <b>temperatures</b> of 27 1 C, 29 1 C and 31 1 C. For optimum larval development (8 ^ 13 h), growth (17. 270. 84 mmday^ 1) and survival (55. 27 0. 84 %), a hatchery rearing temperature of 31 1 C is required. For settlement no signi¢cant di¡erence was seen between the percentage settlement at 29 1 C (49. 373. 34 %) and 31 1 C (45. 871. 76 %). How-ever, the process of settlement began and ended ear-lier at 29 1 C (from 15 to 18 days) thanat 31 1 C (from 18 to 20 days). Thus for larval settlement a temperature of 29 1 C is recommended...|$|R
5000|$|Plant ecology has {{its origin}} in the {{application}} of plant physiology to the questions raised by plant geographers. Carl Ludwig Willdenow {{was one of the first}} to note that similar climates produced similar types of vegetation, even when they were located in different parts of the world. Willdenow's student, Alexander von Humboldt, used physiognomy to describe vegetation types and observed that the distribution vegetation types was based on environmental factors. Later plant geographers who built upon Humboldt's work included Joakim Frederik Schouw, A.P. de Candolle, August Grisebach and Anton Kerner von Marilaun. Schouw's work, published in 1822, linked plant distributions to environmental factors (especially temperature) and established the practice of naming plant associations by adding the suffix -etum to the name of the dominant species. Working from herbarium collections, De Candolle searched for general rules of plant distribution and <b>settled</b> on using <b>temperature</b> as well. Grisebach's two-volume work, Die Vegetation der Erde nach Ihrer Klimatischen Anordnung, published in 1872, saw plant geography reach its [...] "ultimate form" [...] as a descriptive field.|$|R
40|$|Planar Rayleigh {{scattering}} (PRS) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) {{were used}} to investigate the vitiated air component of a coaxial hydrogen/vitiated air nonpremixed turbulent jet flame that is ejected at a Mach number of 2. All experiments were performed with a xenon chloride tunable excimer laser. Planar information for both techniques was obtained using laser sheets 6 cm high, 5 cm wide, and 300 micron thick. In this flow field, the effective Rayleigh {{cross section of the}} components in the vitiated air was assumed to be independent of composition. Therefore, the PRS technique produced signals which were proportional to total density. When the flow field was assumed to be at a known and uniform pressure, the PRS signal data for the vitiated air could be converted to temperature information. Also, PLIF images were generated by probing the OH molecule. These images contain striation patterns attributed to small localized instantaneous temperature nonuniformities. The results from the PLIF and PRS techniques {{were used to}} show that this flow field contains a nongaseous component, most likely liquid water that can be reduced by increasing the <b>settling</b> chamber wall <b>temperature...</b>|$|R
40|$|Farm Ponds Northeast Thailand {{are often}} too turbit {{to be used}} forirrigation and fish culture. The study was carried out to {{determine}} the appropriate amont of alum needed to reduce water turbility and also to measure the effect of alum on the pH of the ponds water. Increasing amonts of alum were added to samples of turbit water. The suspensions were allowed to <b>settle</b> at room <b>temperature</b> for varying lengths of {{time in order to}} determine the flocculation values. The pH of the treated water was measured since excess acidity colud have a detrimental effect on fish culture. Light transmittance of the turbid water measured by a Secchi disk corresponded with that determined by spectrophotometer and by sediment concentration. Flocculation values were 25 and 50 mg alum L for water having a Secchi disk value greater than 15 cm and less than 6 cm respectively. The alum concentration required to decrease the pH of the water samples below 4. 5 ranged from 100 to 1, 000 mg alum L, depending on the sample but the pH of water from all ponds receiving alum at flocculation values was higher than 5...|$|R
