40|$|The {{role and}} {{importance}} of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) has increased with globalisation {{and the growth of}} global institutions. Not only do INGOs {{play a major role in}} aid delivery in developing countries, they also serve as the voice of the people in the growing global governance system. Thus they have an increasing impact on the social and economic welfare of people around the world. For this reason, the performance and management of INGOs is vital. However, research on their management is lacking. INGOs possess unique characteristics including complex environments, value-based missions and no financial bottom line. Therefore, management practices, like internal communication, that are generally developed for for-profit organisations need to be evaluated for suitability within the INGO context. <b>Strategic</b> internal <b>communication</b> has been identified as driving organisational performance. Internal communication can be defined as strategic when its purpose is to align internal stakeholders with the organisation’s strategic intent. By facilitating <b>strategic</b> alignment, internal <b>communication</b> can play a critical role in organisational performance. Research on <b>strategic</b> internal <b>communication</b> is limited and virtually non-existent when considered within the INGO context. However, by considering <b>communication</b> management theory, <b>strategic</b> management theory and NGO management theory, it is possible to develop theoretical propositions on the strategic functioning of internal communication in INGOs. In particular, the theory suggests that a postmodern approach to strategic management and <b>strategic</b> internal <b>communication</b> can assist INGOs in addressing many of the challenges they face. This study explores the strategic functioning of internal communication in INGOs through exploratory, qualitative case studies. The evidence shows that internal communication in INGOs does not generally function strategically. However, the function is recognised as having potential to improve the performance of these organisations. In particular, there is support for the suitability of a postmodern approach to <b>strategic</b> internal <b>communication</b> in INGOs. Dissertation (MPhil) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|South Africa’s {{democratic}} political regime {{opened up a}} global operating environment, affecting all {{sectors of the economy}} including the nonprofit sector. Models of sustainability have become more important than ever, with an increased emphasis on management models in this sector. New information and communication technologies such as the Internet and especially website technology have produced a challenging need for communication management paradigms. Operating within a context of increasing uncertainty may lead to nonprofit organisations looking outside the boundaries of their own sector for new management models and ideas. <b>Strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> is a management idea rooted in private sector knowledge. More specifically, Niemann’s (2005) conceptual model for the implementation of <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> has the potential to address the sustainability issue within the website arena. The present study evaluates the application of <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> according to Niemann’s (2005) conceptual model, among a selection of South African nonprofit organisation websites. Lack of research regarding <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> within the South African nonprofit sector was the main motivating factor for this study. The study also represents an attempt to empirically test Niemann’s (2005) normative model within a specific context, thus helping to assess the scientific validity of the model. An exploratory qualitative research design was employed, with evidence collected by means of a content analysis of nonprofit websites and an e-mail questionnaire intended for the most senior communication/marketing staff member of each organisation. From an external perspective, nonprofit websites display many of the elements of Niemann’s (2005) conceptual model. Yet, evidence about the internal communication management aspects of the same organisations indicates that essential elements of the model are absent.

40|$|Change {{on various}} levels in globalised markets necessitates organisations {{to adopt a}} stakeholder-based {{approach}} to communication management and marketing management. In {{order to meet the}} needs of these stakeholders, organisations need to create and nourish long-term relationships between the organisation, its brands and its stakeholders. <b>Strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> is fundamental in relationship building between these components to ensure that the organisation is viewed as cohesive. However, after almost 15 years of existence, the concept of integrated communication is still seen as a difficult concept to implement in organisations. Literature proposes various implementation models (predominantly developed in Europe and America) for the implementation of integrated communication. While these models could in theory be applied on an international scale, the South African context calls for specific communication approaches, as the country is in a unique situation in a post-apartheid era. It is therefore contended that there is a need for a <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> implementation model for the South African business landscape, based on the specific needs related to this distinct environment. Therefore, the primary research objective of this study was to develop a conceptual model for <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> implementation in the South African marketplace. The research was conducted through three phases, based on the Mitroff et al. (1974) model of systematic problem solving. Phase 1 consisted of the literature review to determine the theoretical status of the concept of integrated communication. Phase 2 explored the state of integrated communication implementation among advertising and communication agencies in South Africa empirically, through in-depth interviews. These interviews were conducted with the strategic planning directors (or an equivalent) of the top ten advertising and communication agencies in South Africa, to establish the extent to which integrated communication is practised by these representatives of the field. Phase 3 consisted of the development of the conceptual implementation model of <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> in the South African marketplace, based on the findings from the first two phases. The proposed conceptual model for the implementation of <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> in the South African marketplace is based on the fundamental principle that the strategic intent of the organisation drives all communication and that learning organisational principles, amid profound global and national changes, incessantly reposition the organisation based on the consequent changes in the marketplace. In order to promote unity of effort in relationship building, the organisation needs to be integrated on three levels, namely the organisational, stakeholder and environmental levels, which form the centre of the conceptual model. At the core of the organisational integration area is the renaissance communicator, which could be the key to <b>strategic</b> integrated <b>communication</b> implementation. The renaissance communicator contributes to the organisational success through the alignment of communication objectives with the strategic intent of the organisation and the subsequent changing business landscape, thereby ensuring unity of effort in all organisational efforts through strategic consistency.
