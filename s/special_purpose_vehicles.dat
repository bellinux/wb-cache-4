25|$|Through the {{political}} turmoil, Buenaventura doggedly persisted with {{his efforts to}} relieve the banking sector of its crippling burden of bad loans. Although the transition of power from Estrada to Arroyo interrupted congressional discussions on the issue, the talks eventually resumed, tracking the rescue plan outlined by the BSP and the Bankers Association of the Philippines. Finally, in 2003, congress passed the <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Vehicles</b> Act, allowing banks to sell their bank loans at a discount and giving them regulatory incentives that {{made it easier to}} book the losses.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Buenaventura became central bank governor, over fifteen {{percent of the}} total loan {{portfolio}} of the entire banking sector was considered non-performing loans. Within the next year, this peaked at seventeen percent. The need to unload these bad loans before they collapsed the industry spurred the BSP-led lobby for the <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Vehicles</b> Act, a law that would allow banks to sell their bad loans at a discount to companies that specialized in taking over bad loans and turning them around. Carefully orchestrating the lobby before both houses of Congress, Buenaventura led the efforts for the passage of the law, telling lawmakers that the banking industry needed the flexibility since the government did not have the resources to launch its own rescue efforts.|$|E

500|$|Nobumasa Yokoo, former {{banker who}} {{had dealt with}} Olympus when he worked for Nomura, is also cited as being behind certain other of the {{transactions}} under the spotlight. Having founded Global Company in the late 1990s, he persuaded Olympus to invest ¥30billion in their venture capital fund in 2000. In 2003, Olympus made a piecemeal acquisition of an information technology group, ITX. Akinobu Yokoo, Yokoo's older brother, was chief financial officer for ITX. The elder Yokoo became a group executive officer after Olympus became majority owners. Nobumasa Yokoo also introduced three small, unprofitable companies {{in which he was}} shareholder and executive that Olympus acquired for ¥73.4billion – News Chef, a maker of microwave cookware, Altis and Humalabo. According to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Olympus acquired the companies from Cayman Island-based funds between 2007 and 2010. Nikkei Business reported informed sources deriding these as [...] "shell companies". Part of the transaction took place on 25 April 2008, when Olympus paid the equivalent of 7million to funds named Dynamic Dragons II and Global Targets. Seventeen Cayman and BVI <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>vehicles</b> were used to make payments; funds flowed through Commerzbank AG, Societe Generale SA and LGT Bank. The WSJ noted that there were a large number of frequent and complex corporate changes (name and ownership) but determined from the paper trail that Dynamic Dragons II [...] "was part of a network of elusive Japanese firms and financiers that often invested together, and whose ties and identities were constantly shifting." [...] Kenji Takasago, associate professor at Kobe University suggested the complexity of the scheme was to obscure the money trail.|$|E
