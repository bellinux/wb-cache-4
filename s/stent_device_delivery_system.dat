40|$|PURPOSE: Rapid revascularization in {{emergent}} large vessel occlusion with endovascular embolectomy {{has proven}} clinical benefit. We sought to measure device-clot interaction {{as a potential}} mechanism for efficient embolectomy. METHODS: Two different radiopaque clot models were injected to create a middle cerebral artery occlusion in a patient-specific vascular phantom. A radiopaque stent retriever was deployed within the clot by unsheathing the device {{or a combination of}} unsheathing followed by pushing the device (n= 8 /group). High-resolution cone beam CT was performed immediately after device deployment and repeated after 5 min. An image processing pipeline was created to quantitatively evaluate the volume of clot that integrates with the stent, termed the clot integration factor (CIF). RESULTS: The CIF was significantly different for the two deployment variations when the device engaged the hard clot (p= 0. 041), but not the soft clot (p= 0. 764). In the hard clot, CIF increased significantly between post-deployment and final imaging datasets when using the pushing technique (p= 0. 019), but not when using the unsheathing technique (p= 0. 067). When we investigated the effect of time on CIF in the different clot models disregarding the technique, the CIF was significantly increased in the final dataset relative to the post-deployment dataset in both clot models (p= 0. 004 - 0. 007). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates in an in vitro system the benefit of pushing the Trevo <b>stent</b> during <b>device</b> <b>delivery</b> in hard clot to enhance integration.

This method has been introduced as one of the most appropriate methods for hydrophilic agents. Scanning electron microscopy showed that prepared particles were spherical with smooth surface without aggregation. Particle size varied from 570 nm to 29 μm in different experimental conditions. Stirring speed, polymer concentration, impeller type, and dropping size had a significant effect on the particle size. The polydispersity index of particles showed a strong relationship with the surfactant concentration, impeller type, and dropping size. It was concluded that increasing in temperature up to 50 °C or changing in dropping rate has a little effect on reducing the size of PLGA particles.

40|$|Surface {{tunability}} {{and their}} ability to translocate plasma membranes make chemically functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) promising intracellular <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes in the central nervous system (CNS). The present study aimed to determine the biological impact of different types of multiwalled CNTs (MWNTs) on primary neuronal and glial cell populations isolated from fetal rat frontal cortex (FCO) and striatum (ST). Neurons from both brain regions were generally not affected by exposure to MWNTs as determined by a modified LDH assay. In contrast, the viability of mixed glia was reduced in ST-derived mixed glial cultures, but not in FCO-derived ones. Cytotoxicity was independent of MWNT type or dose, suggesting an inherent sensitivity to CNTs. Characterization of the cell populations in mixed glial cultures prior to nanotube exposure showed higher number of CD 11 b/c positive cells in the ST-derived mixed glial cultures. After exposure to MWNTs, CNT were uptaken more effectively by CD 11 b/c positive cells (microglia), compared to GFAP positive cells (astrocytes). When exposed to conditioned media from microglia enriched cultures exposed to MWNTs, ST-derived glial cultures secreted more NO than FCO-derived cells. These results suggested that the more significant cytotoxic response obtained from ST-derived mixed glia cultures was related to the higher number of microglial cells in this brain region.

This review intends to recapitulate the principles of biofuel cell development and the progress over the years, thanks to the contribution of cross-​disciplinary researchers that have combined knowledge and innovative ideas to the field. The emergence of biofuel cells, as a response to the demand of elec. power devices that can operate under physiol. conditions, are reviewed. Implantable biofuel cells operating inside living organisms have been envisioned for over fifty years, but few reports of implanted devices have existed up until very recently.

DESIGN: Descriptive study of consecutive non-randomised patients undergoing a new method of patent ductus arteriosus closure with detachable coils. SETTING: Tertiary centres for paediatric cardiology. PATIENTS: 71 consecutive patients, aged 1. 2 - 22 years, with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) underwent elective transcatheter closure. 45 had native PDAs (group A) with a minimum diameter of 1. 0 mm- 5. 0 mm (median 2. 0 mm). A further 26 had undergone one or more previous occlusion attempts (group B). INTERVENTIONS: A total of 133 detachable (Cook) spring coils were successfully implanted in 70 patients. The procedure was performed transvenously in 51 patients, retrograde arterially in 13, and by both routes in a further 6 patients. One 5 mm coil migrated but was successfully retrieved. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In group A colour flow Doppler echocardiography showed that complete occlusion was achieved in 40 / 45 (89 %) at 24 hours, 41 / 45 (91 %) at 1 month, and 44 / 45 (98 %) by 6 months post procedure. Occlusion rates in residual PDAs were 22 / 25 (88 %) occluded at 24 hours, 23 / 25 (92 %) at 1 month, and 24 / 25 (96 %) at 6 months follow up.

Among others, poly-(lactic acid) [PLA], derived from renewable resources, is currently being used {{in a number of}} biomedical applications, such as in sutures, <b>stents,</b> drug <b>delivery</b> <b>devices,</b> and tissue engineering [1]. Besides, the biodegradable petroleum-based polyester poly-(ε-caprolactone) [PCL] has also been widely studied [2 – 4]. However, these polymers are inappropriate for numerous uses where highly flexible biodegradable materials are required [5]. Therefore, different strategies have been reported to properly modify the intrinsic properties of both polymers, including the use of additives and nanoparticles [6 – 8]. Another possible strategy is constituted by blending or copolymerizing them together, allowing the fabrication of a variety of biodegradable materials with improved properties in comparison with those of the parent homopolymers [3, 9]. Biodegradable PLA-blend-PCL materials can offer a wide variety of physical properties; the glassy PLA with a relatively high degradation rate shows better tensile strength, while the rubbery PCL with a much slower degradation rate shows better toughness [10]. As reported in the scientific literature, the PCL/PLA blend can form typical immiscible morphologies (of few micrometer scales) such as spherical droplets, fibrous and co-continuous structures by varying the homopolymer composition [11, 12].|$|R

In both cases a spindlelike morphology was obtained, resulting from an aggregation process of smaller subunits which also gave rise to high specific surface area.

The luminescent nanoparticles showed the typical red luminescence of Eu 3 +, which was more efficient for the fluoroapatite particles than for the hydroxyapatite.
