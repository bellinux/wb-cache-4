25|$|To {{have the}} {{superior}} sensitivity of crystal Bonse-Hart interferometry without <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> limitations, the monolithic crystals {{have been replaced}} with nanometric x-ray phase-shift gratings. The first such gratings have periods of 200 to 400 nanometers. They can split x-ray beams over the broad energy spectra of common x-ray tubes. The main advantage of this technique is that it uses most of the incoming x-rays {{that would have been}} filtered by the crystals. Because only phase gratings are used, grating fabrication is less challenging than techniques that use absorption gratings. The first grating Bonse-Hart interferometer (gBH) operated at 22.5 keV photon energy and 1.5% spectral bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the {{charging}} process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in {{the central part of}} the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from −15 to −25 Celsius, see figure to the right. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and graupel (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> design {{elements}} of the aircraft were from an earlier generation, the Hurricane {{proved to be a}} match, to an extent, for the Luftwaffes Messerschmitt Bf 109E. In his book, Duel of Eagles, British ace Peter Townsend, who flew Hurricanes with No. 85 Squadron RAF during the Battle of Britain, provides examples demonstrating how the Hurricane's superior turning ability could offset the Bf 109's higher speed. This small turning circle often allowed a well flown Hurricane to get onto the tail of a 109 even more quickly than a Spitfire, assuming a 109 pilot was unwise enough to be lured into a turning match. Against the Hurricane was the aircraft's relatively slow acceleration and a top speed some 10–30mph (16–48km/h) slower, depending on altitude. This meant that the 109 pilot often held the initiative when it came to breaking off or attacking during combat. At higher altitudes especially, the Hurricane was hard-pressed to keep up with a well flown 109, or even a Bf 110.|$|E

500|$|Art {{directors}} Nilo Rodis and Dave Carson {{designed the}} Klingon Bird of Prey, while George constructed the model. Nimoy wanted {{the ship to}} be reminiscent of an attacking bird, with movable wings that changed {{depending on whether the}} ship was in a cruising or attack posture. George took design cues from sketches of bodybuilders and football players, incorporating the starship equivalents of down-stretched, threatening arms and muscular shoulders, together with what looked like shoulder pads and a chin guard on the ship's outstretched neck. Although the stolen Romulan ship thread was cut from the film, the Bird of Prey design had incorporated elements of Romulan design. [...] "It has <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> bird shape, but it's more ominous", Ralston said. A graphic bird design was integrated into the ship's underside.|$|E
500|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} [...] originated as {{a logical}} extension of Ernst Mayr's concept of genetic revolutions by allopatric and especially peripatric speciation {{as applied to}} the fossil record.

Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr's ideas mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was concerned with explaining the morphological discontinuity (or [...] "sudden jumps") found in the fossil record. Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould's paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been [...] "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" [...] and that punctuated equilibrium [...] "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology." ...|$|E

There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it [...] "a whale of a book" [...] and another that said [...] "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style [...] "offensively pedestrian".|$|E
500|$|Nihilistic {{initially}} {{looked at}} existing game engines {{such as the}} Quake engine and Unreal Engine, but decided those engines, which were primarily designed for first-person shooters, would not be sufficient for its point-and-click driven RPG and decided to create its own engine for development of Redemption. This was the NOD engine, which the developers could customize for the game's 3D perspective and role-playing mechanics. The team also considered that developing its own engine would allow it to freely reuse code for future projects or to license the engine for profit. NOD was prototyped using the Glide application programming interface (API) because the team believed {{it would be more}} stable during the engine's development, intending that once the engine was more complete, it would be moved to a more general API designed to support a wide range of hardware such as Direct3D. However, once a basic engine was in place in Glide, the programmers turned their attention to gameplay and functionality. By June 1999, Redemption was still running in Glide, which at that point lacked <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> features the team needed to demonstrate at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. When the team eventually switched to Direct3D, it was forced to abandon some custom code it had built to compensate for Glide's limitations such as texture and graphic management, which required the re-exporting of hundreds of levels and models for the new software. The late API switch also limited the time available to test the game's compatibility {{on a wide range of}} hardware. The team focused on building the game for hardware accelerated systems to avoid the limitations of supporting a wider range of systems, which had restricted the development of the company founders' previous game, [...] (1997).|$|E
