5|$|In defence of his nation, the Drapier {{turns around}} claims of treason and papal loyalty against Wood and his {{defenders}} (especially Walpole), calling them as treasonous as the Jacobite rebels and the Parliamentary rebels. The Drapier believed that God's providence supported {{the people of}} Ireland, but his will required the people of Ireland to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the treasonous British.|$|E
5|$|Ferris and {{his friends}} collect the Ferrari and depart for home, but shortly {{discover}} many miles {{have been added to}} the odometer, and Cameron becomes catatonic. Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets the car on blocks and runs it in reverse to try to take miles off the odometer without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly kicking the car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race in reverse through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> his father.|$|E
5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes {{that this is not}} her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by the image of her step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up in the real world. Olivia is able to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E

5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering {{experts from the}} United States spent {{a period of time}} in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of the buildings. The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E
25|$|Vivekananda {{played a}} major role in the growing Indian {{nationalism}} in the late 19th and the 20th century, encouraging many Indians with his success and appeal in the west.

Keyes, a fellow Freemason, encouraged him to publicly <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the anti-Masonic fervor that was sweeping {{the country in the}} aftermath of the Morgan affair. Keyes also was heavily involved in politics and was a stalwart of the Democratic party. As a result, he joined the Democratic party, effectively becoming Keyes's understudy.|$|E
25|$|After the German {{attack on}} Denmark and Norway, the British refused any further {{contacts}} with emissaries of the German military opposition, fearing another Venlo incident. The opposition largely dissolved after the German conquest of France in summer 1940 because Halder no longer dared to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> an apparently successful Hitler. It only regained momentum in 1944 {{when a new}} generation of younger officers decided to conspire against the ruthless Nazi regime.|$|E
25|$|He {{was married}} a second time, in 1865 or 1866, to Birajmohini. He had protested {{strongly}} against this second marriage and even had his mother’s support {{but he could}} not finally <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the wishes of his father. He was greatly repentant for what happened and was mentally disturbed about it. Umesh Chandra Dutta sent him a copy of Theodore Parker’s Ten Sermons and Prayers. He found solace in reading the book. The realities of life in that age shocked him and the incident pushed him further towards the Brahmo Samaj.|$|E

Ultimately, she fails to stop the attack of a legendary demon known as Humbaba, requiring the party's intervention. Returning later on, the player finds her willing to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> Humbaba, joining the player in the fight and avowing {{to make the world}} safe for children. At the game's conclusion, expected to fade from existence with the remaining Espers, Terra is informed by the Magicite remnant of her father, Maduin, that so long as some human element of her remains anchored in the world, she will continue to exist.|$|E
25|$|Nuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a {{young girl}} gets engaged at an early age, the wedding and consummation ceremonies are {{essentially}} delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she pretty much has the free will to choose her mate. Now, her parents can choose a mate for her, but they ask for her consent. It is quite tough for parents to force their daughter to marry a man she isn't attracted to or simply dislikes. Nuer girls do <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> being pressured by family {{when it comes to}} marriage issues.|$|E
25|$|Officially, the {{constitution}} of Sri Lanka guarantees human rights as ratified by the United Nations. However, human rights in Sri Lanka have come under criticism by Amnesty International, Freedom from Torture, Human Rights Watch, and the United States Department of State. British colonial rulers, the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), {{and the government of}} Sri Lanka are accused of violating human rights. A report by an advisory panel to the UN secretary-general has accused both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government of alleged war crimes during final stages of the civil war. Corruption remains a problem in Sri Lanka, and there is currently very little protection for those who <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> corruption.|$|E

25|$|In 1818 John Edwards senior died. John Edwards junior {{was now in}} sole {{possession}} of Rheola. He had married twice and both wives brought considerable inheritances with them which, added to his own inheritance and successful professional activities, meant he was a person of some substance. He had run for parliament to represent Glamorganshire in 1817 and failed to be elected. The local landed gentry, unimpressed {{by the idea of}} an outsider and a mere solicitor representing them, ensured a preferred candidate, Sir Christopher Cole, was elected. At the next year's general election, Edwards stood again, and Cole could not afford to run against him. Capitalising on his Neath valley residence and Welsh ancestry, Edwards stood as one who would <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the clique of landed gentry. He appealed to lesser gentry, industrialists and professional men, and was, uniquely for a county seat, elected against the interests of the leading landowners, who duly snubbed him. Two years later, when his term of office ended, he did not stand again, and chose rather to focus on the Wells constituency, where he served for two further years from 1830.|$|E

500|$|Kellner's diary {{takes to}} task {{not only the}} German people who elected Hitler, but the {{citizens}} and leaders of other nations who remained indifferent to evidence that dictators in Germany, Italy and Japan were plotting to take possession of the entire world. In a number of entries, Kellner accused politicians in the democracies of failing to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the dictators.

500|$|Comstock {{threatened}} Ortiz {{with legal}} action, and the manager– unaware that Comstock could not arrest him, and fearful {{that he could}} cause trouble for the gallery– was initially frightened. He consulted with Arthur Brisbane of the New York Evening Journal, who {{told him he had}} nothing to fear, and sent some reporters to cover the story. The following day, the controversy was highly covered in the press, who hailed Ortiz as [...] "one art expert with the courage to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> Comstock and his dictatorship". Following Comstock's visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company, ogling September Morn. The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of September Morn, so that it could remain in his window.|$|E
500|$|The letter serves {{one other}} purpose: to {{delight in the}} Drapier's lack of being {{captured}} and his victory over Whitshed. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, {{was the one who}} actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials. A letter written anonymously by Swift, [...] "Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury", motivated the Irish jury to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> Whitshed and release the printer. The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as he could just be flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared this letter is [...] "in some ways the best written of all the Letters".|$|E
