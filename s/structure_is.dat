40|$|International audiencePlasma {{irregularity}} structures {{associated with}} an Equatorial Spread-F (ESF) event were recorded by the Indian VHF Radar on 26 ? 27 April 2006 near midnight hours. The plasma <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> found to be isolated without having bottomside structure. They moved predominantly downward and the <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> found to be less turbulent than their post-sunset counterparts. However, the <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> characterized by meter-scale size irregularities. These <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> identified {{for the first time}} as plasma depletion structures using simultaneous, collocated measurements of OI 630. 0 nm airglow intensity variations. The variation of the base height of ionospheric F layer over dip equator is also presented to buttress the result.

5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E
5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} bovids have horns, {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess horns. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> a pair of simple bony {{protrusions}} without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E
