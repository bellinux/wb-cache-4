500|$|Pacific Gas and Electric {{initially}} {{reported that}} peak ground accelerations {{in the range}} of [...]16–.4g were recorded {{on the floor of the}} refueling building on the plant's strong motion instruments (accelerometers). Low voltage from a faulty power supply left the instruments in a condition that was functional, but the records were not considered reliable. Three TERA Technology film recorders were also in use as a backup system, but these instruments also did not produce any usable records, because lack of maintenance had allowed dirt and grit to get inside. Only records from one instrument (an Engdhal peak <b>shock</b> <b>recorder)</b> was believed to be operating correctly, and with a close examination of the energy dispersed at various frequencies, an estimate of [...]15–.25g was given for the event at that location.|$|E

Abstract Plastic totes have been commonly used to transport healthcare products from a distribution center to a retail store. Damages often occur in partially-filled totes. This article reviews the research performed at the Healthcare Packaging Consortium, including problem validation, {{the use of a}} bubble wrap sheet {{at the bottom of a}} plastic tote to cut down potential damages, the use of air pillows at the top of the a tote to reduce immediate and subsequent impact accelerations, and equations developed to predict drop height and impact acceleration at the interior tote bottom based on peak accelerations logged from a <b>shock</b> <b>recorder...</b>|$|E

Abstract Wood pallets are often put in circulation for several years. In a pallet’s lifetime it goes through several wet-dry cycles. In this study, softwood pallet specimens were compressed statically and impacted at different water contents through an accelerated drying process for three repeated wet-dry cycles. A static compressive strength test was performed along the grain of pallet stringers to avoid the effect of loadings in different grain directions. Instead of using the standard drop test from a drop tester, an incline impact test was performed to obtain more consistent impact accelerations. Impact data was recorded by a <b>shock</b> <b>recorder</b> to simplify the {{set up for the}} experiment. This study has found that there is no significant effect of the wet-dry cycles on static compressive strength and impact acceleration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During distribution, {{consignments}} undergo numerous handling processes both mechanized and manual. These {{operations are}} known to produce drops and impacts of varying severity which have a potential to cause damage to the product. These shocks are the main parameters required for the optimum design of protective packaging systems. The severity of the shocks is often {{described in terms of}} their effective (free-fall equivalent) drop height (EDH) and impact orientation, in order to facilitate the laboratory testing conducted on a free-fall apparatus. The preferred approach is to survey the shocks with self-contained tri-axial <b>shock</b> <b>recorders</b> and process the data {{in such a way that}} statistical distributions of expected drop heights and orientations are obtained. On the other hand the Real Drop Height (RDH) method, based on the measurement of free fall time, is also used, mainly to discriminate between free-fall events and more commonly occurring complex causes of shocks, primarily for the quality control of distribution environment. The focus of the paper is on the EDH method and on the use of characteristic parameters of the tri-axial acceleration shock pulse to determine the EDH. An accurate estimate of the coefficient of restitution between the instrumented test package and the impact surface must be known and this poses a problem as it cannot always be established for every event during distribution...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the concept}} of intercepting orbits {{from a pair of}} Space Station {{serviced}} free flyers, a class of impact and shock wave experiments pertinent to planetary science can be performed. One proposed free flying vehicle is an impactor dispensor, and the second is the impact laboratory. How collision is achieved by utilizing essentially twice orbital velocity is demonstrated. The impactor dispensor contains a series of small flyer plates or other projectiles which are launched into the trajectory of the impactor laboratory at appropriate positions. The impactor laboratory is a large impact tank similar to those in terrestrial gun laboratories, except that it contains a supply of targets and instrumentation such as high speed cameras, flash X-ray apparatus, and digital <b>recorders.</b> <b>Shock</b> and isentropic pressures of up to 20 Mbar are achievable with such a system which provides 15 km/sec impact velocities for precisely oriented projectiles...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{setup and}} test {{results of an}} autonomous <b>shock</b> resistant data <b>recorder</b> which addresses the existing need for reliable data acquisition in the harsh environment of strong blast loading. The recorder offers programmability for sampling rate, trigger level and pretrigger value. It features a 12 bit amplitude resolution, a maximum sampling rate of 210 kS/s, and a storage capability of 16. 000 data points. The overall acquisition time varies from 75 ms to 150 s, depending on sampling rate and internal software. The recorder itself occupies a volume of only about 12 cm 3. Shock resistance of the electronics was demonstrated in an analog version of the system against loads of more than 100, 000 g. As no cabling is required, the recorder offers extreme flexibility with respect to relocation. Furthermore, band width limitations and susceptibility to disturbances are minimized. The recorder can easily be programmed on-site, if required. And due to the integration of a nonvolatile RAM, data may be recovered days or even years after test performance, in case the system is buried in debris. Setup and main features of the recorder will be presented along with test measurements verifying the working principles under extreme conditions...|$|R
