5|$|A {{separate}} {{account of the}} battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon, stated that Rædwald's army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfrith's men cut their way through to him and slew him. After {{the death of his}} son, Rædwald furiously breached his lines, killing Æthelfrith amid a great <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> the Northumbrians.|$|E

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of white {{settlers}} to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, including the unsanctioned <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it shallow and hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E
5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> animals in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, {{the rival}} Obrenović dynasty seized {{power in the}} country and forced Prince Alexander Karađorđević into exile. Ljotić's father was forced out of the country in 1868 after being implicated in a {{conspiracy}} against the Obrenović dynasty and its head, Prince Milan. He did not return to Serbia until Milan's abdication on 6 March 1889. Apart from being a close friend of Serbia's future king, Peter I, Ljotić's father was also the first person to translate The Communist Manifesto into Serbian. Ljotić's maternal great-grandfather, knez Stanoje, was an outlaw who was killed in the <b>Slaughter</b> <b>of</b> the Knezes in January 1804.|$|E

5|$|Officers in {{the field}} {{were well aware of}} the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote that this was just an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E
5|$|The second group, plates 48 to 64, {{detail the}} effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after Wellington's armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year. In these plates, Goya's focus is {{directed}} away from the generalised scenes of <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.|$|E

5|$|Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again {{under the}} rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was {{subsequently}} reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samartian revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Aristodemus: The lone Spartan {{survivor}} of the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> the 300 at the Battle of Thermopylae had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by Leonidas I because of an eye infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot. Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed {{to fight in the}} disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.|$|E

5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gaozong and the {{emergence}} of the Mongols, the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with the Mongols in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged by years of warfare, lacked economic capacity and yielded little defensibility. This breaking of alliance meant open warfare between the Mongols and the Song Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which was taken by the Mongols with ease.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> his workers as the Red Army approached.

5|$|Initially, the {{administration}} of justice at village level was the responsibility of village assemblies, which usually consisted of the elders of the village. However, {{towards the end of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom a group of ten villages, known as dasagam, was responsible for upholding justice in that area. The laws and legal measures to be followed by them were proclaimed by the king. Several rock inscriptions that record these proclamations have been found in archaeological excavations. Punishments differed from ruler to ruler. Some kings, such as Sanghabodhi (247–249) and Voharika Tissa (209–231) were lenient in this aspect, while rulers like Ilanaga (33–43) and Jetthatissa I (263–273) were harsher. However, crimes such as treason, murder and <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> cattle were generally punishable by death.|$|E
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used}} in candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
