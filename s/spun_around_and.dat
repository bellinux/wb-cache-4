25|$|At {{the same}} venue, {{then he went}} on with Michael Bevan to score an unbeaten 73-run 9th wicket {{partnership}} to ease Australia to victory which saw him hit 34 not out. In the Super Six stage, he came in against New Zealand at 84–7. He and Michael Bevan again saved Australia with his highest score of 64 as Australia put up a winning total batting first. In the semi-final against Sri Lanka, he bowled tightly conceding 0–18 in 10 overs but his pressure caused the spectacular run out of Aravinda de Silva as he picked up <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> threw down the stumps to prevent a tight single off his own bowling. In the final against India, he picked up one wicket bowling Rahul Dravid as Australia won, completing an undefeated campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The damaged aircraft, now {{airborne}} with takeoff thrust engaged, {{began to}} bank to the right. The bank angle increased until the flap {{of the right}} wing struck the cab of an excavator 1,500 meters from the runway threshold. [...] The aircraft's bank angle continued to increase {{to the point that}} the right wing began to cut into the ground and taxiways nearby the closed runway; the flight's continuous right bank by now took it on a northward ground track. [...] The end of the right wing eventually struck the corner of an aircraft repair hangar, causing damage to the hangar and also fracturing the DC-10's right wing. The aircraft <b>spun</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> impacted into an Eastern Airlines service building north of both runways, 26 seconds after it initially touched down. This final impact caused the structural breakup of the aircraft, heavily damaged the two story reinforced concrete building, and caused a large fire. [...] One part of the DC-10's right wing travelled well off airport grounds, impacting a residential building on Matamoros Street in the Peñón de los Baños colonia and causing a fire there as well.|$|E

50|$|Spinner (Sasāruka) {{loves to}} <b>spin</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> play outside. She became a bird-like {{gyroscope}} with wings. She <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> everywhere on her stage. The {{only way to}} stop her is by stretching her head or tail, stopping her relentless spinning. Like Cinder, Spinner can summon happy little bombs.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a butt bump/butt thump, this attack is usually {{performed}} with a running start, when a wrestler jumps into the air, <b>spins</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> thrusts his pelvis backwards, thus hitting the opponent's head or chest with his hip or buttocks.|$|R
5000|$|RockBomb: [...] "Rammstone"+"Grenuke" [...] - The Rammstone <b>and</b> Grenuke <b>spin</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> {{create a}} crater {{in the ground}} after {{falling out of the}} sky.

60|$|Swiftly the {{ferryboat}} {{crossed the}} North River, crowded with boats. Then it {{ran into the}} slip--there was the rattle of the ratchets as the line wheels <b>spun</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> finally the gates were opened.|$|E
60|$|He <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> met Psmith's blandly inquiring gaze. He {{looked at}} Psmith {{carefully}} for a moment. No. The boy he had chased last night {{had not been}} Psmith. That exquisite's figure and general appearance were unmistakable, even in the dusk.|$|E
60|$|Bosinney, {{who wore}} a slouch hat, {{stopped in front of}} him, <b>spun</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> rushed back towards the {{carriage}} he had just left. He was too late. A porter caught him by the coat; the train was already moving on.|$|E
60|$|He was right, and the Rovers saw {{the boat}} ahead <b>spin</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> {{the two men}} leap to their feet in alarm. But then the craft steadied itself, {{and a moment later}} shot into the shadows of the trees beside the old flour mill.|$|R
5000|$|... (voiced by Leigh-Allyn Baker) - Queen Delightful is the ditzy {{ruler of}} Jollywood. Whenever there is trouble, {{she goes into}} a tizzy where she <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> acts like a police light and siren. She then summons the 7D by pulling a rope for the Bing-Bong Bell.|$|R
50|$|The players fly in {{simulated}} jets {{around the}} screen, engaging in an dogfight {{and attempting to}} score hits on their opponent within {{a limited amount of}} time. When a player is hit, their plane <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> an explosion is heard. After a few seconds, the plane recovers, pointing at a random direction.|$|R
60|$|On and on {{went the}} skaters, until the rock was gained. Then Tom Mardell turned so {{suddenly}} {{that he ran}} full tilt into the teacher with whom he was racing. Both <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> came down on the ice with a crash.|$|E
60|$|Thawed by the fire, {{the white}} crust gave way beneath {{the head of}} Gnob, which rolled over like a thing alive, <b>spun</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> came to rest at her feet. But she did not move. Keesh, too, sat motionless, his eyes unblinking, centred steadfastly upon her.|$|E
60|$|Cornered, Gabe Werner {{tried to}} put up a fight, and in this he got by far the worst of it. He managed to get in one or two blows, but then Randy knocked him down, and when he arose to his feet Fred landed on his ear so that the bully <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> lurched heavily against the counter on which rested a number of guns.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is kind of}} you, and I swear I am willing. I haven't {{got another}} drop of {{perspiration}} left in me.

500|$|For {{the opening}} scene, a [...] "special kind of blood" [...] {{was placed in}} <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the actors' eyes to {{simulate}} their brains boiling. For the scene in which the actress is pushed up against a glass door, the special effects department created a device wearing a brown wig with an explosive charge designed to imitate the actress' head exploding. Director Bill Eagles described the scene as [...] "imagin an egg in your microwave <b>spinning</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> at high voltage. What happens? Bang! It just explodes." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{the utmost}} gravity and stateliness my lady {{and the general}} led off the dance, for, {{according}} to the good old fashion, the men and maids in their best array joined the gentlefolk and danced with their betters in a high state of pride and bashfulness. Sir Jasper twirled the old housekeeper till her head <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> around and her decorous skirts rustled stormily; Mrs. Snowdon captivated the gray-haired butler by her condescension; and John was made a proud man by the hand of his young mistress. The major came out strong among the pretty maids, and Rose danced the footmen out of breath long before the music paused.|$|E
60|$|For a {{while longer}} they <b>spun</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> then Daylight {{suddenly}} stood still, released his partner, and stepped back, reeling himself, and fluttering his hands aimlessly, as if to support himself against the air. But Davis, a giddy smile of consternation on his face, gave sideways, turned {{in an attempt to}} recover balance, and pitched headlong to the floor. Still reeling and staggering and clutching at the air with his hands, Daylight caught the nearest girl and started on in a waltz. Again he had done the big thing. Weary from two thousand miles over the ice and a run that day of seventy miles, he had whirled a fresh man down, and that man Ben Davis.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never shall I {{forget the}} sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with which I gazed about me. The boat {{appeared}} to be hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they <b>spun</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.|$|E

50|$|A {{linear motor}} is {{functionally}} {{the same as}} a rotary electric motor with the rotor and stator circular magnetic field components laid out in a straight line. Where a rotary motor would <b>spin</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> re-use the same magnetic pole faces again, the magnetic field structures of a linear motor are physically repeated across the length of the actuator.|$|R
5000|$|Gillespie's dancing, on {{the other}} hand, is {{generally}} praised. One writer said [...] "his unique technique is shown to great effect" [...] in the film. One biographer described Gillespie [...] "skipping about the stage", and another wrote that Gillespie was [...] "quite happy to dance to the band's sounds, ... <b>spinning</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> mugging {{in front of the}} band".|$|R

50|$|Hanging {{from the}} ceiling {{at the center of}} the dance floor, there was the {{hypnotic}} mirror ball cluster--about a dozen mirror balls of various sizes which continually <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> were the focus of the dance floor.|$|E
50|$|The Touchstone Energy 300 {{was held}} April 25 at Talladega Superspeedway. Joe Nemechek won the pole. During the race, Dave Blaneygot <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> flipped onto its side {{and slammed the}} wall with his roof.He walked away.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tail Spin" [...] is a Gerstlauer Sky Fly {{which opened}} in September 2014. The ride was the ninth thrill ride {{to be added to}} the park. Guests sit in a small {{aeroplane}} that they can swing. With enough swinging they can <b>spin</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> in circles. The ride replaced Reef Diver. Tail Spin is the first of its kind in Australia.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} a look around in the boat," [...] {{answered}} Dick, and, having procured the oars, he set off. The current was so strong it was not necessary to use the blades, and he had all he could do to keep the craft from <b>spinning</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> dashing itself against the shore or the other boats which lay along both banks.|$|R

Record store owner Dave Bernath remembered, [...] "The band would literally hit their last note, say 'thank you' and 'goodbye,' they <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> the next band started {{within a minute}} — in seconds! The first band was still fading out when the other band came on! That's {{the way it should}} be!" ...|$|E
50|$|During the 2010 Aaron's 312 Nationwide Series race in Talladega on {{the last}} lap Setzer, driving the #92, was {{involved}} in a huge crash which sent him up the wall and into the catch fence.

Arema won the match 2-1.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Solid Software, published by THQ and distributed by Electro Source. The programming credit for the game is held by D. Scott Williamson. The game <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> wildly in a circle, changing {{the rotation of the}} map also, and making it difficult to continue in the right direction. Rock music plays in the background as one or two players attempt to negotiate a treacherous series of platforms throughout the game's 14 levels.|$|R

50|$|The pilots {{landed the}} {{aircraft}} very smoothly, but {{were afraid that}} the landing gear would collapse and the plane would <b>spin</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> explode. The Tupolev was fueled for the return flight to Budapest as well, therefore {{there were more than}} 30 tons of jet fuel on board. However, the landing roll went safely. The characteristic Tupolev's large landing gear pods, in which the wheels are retracted during flight, were used as sledges and shielded the landing gear, wing and flaps.|$|R
