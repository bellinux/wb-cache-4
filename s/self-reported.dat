40|$|Several {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} correspondence between <b>self-reports</b> and the delayed identity match-to-sample performance they supposedly described. The present two experiments used similar procedures to explore different characteristics of the <b>self-reports.</b> In both studies, match-to-sample responses were successful (earned points) if they were both correct and faster than a time limit. Following each response, a computer-presented query asked whether the response had been successful, and subjects replied by pressing a “Yes” or “No” button. Experiment 1 analyzed <b>self-report</b> latencies from a previously-published study (Critchfield, 1993 a). Latencies generally were longer for <b>self-reports</b> of failure than for <b>self-reports</b> of success. In Experiment 1, a “Yes” or “No” <b>self-report</b> was required to advance the session. In Experiment 2, <b>self-reports</b> were optional. In addition to “Yes” and “No” buttons, subjects could press a third button (a “nondisclosure” option) to remove the <b>self-report</b> query without providing a “Yes” or “No” answer. Across a range of conditions, nondisclosures always occurred more frequently after match-to-sample failures than after successes (i. e., under conditions in which a <b>self-report</b> of failure would be appropriate). The effects observed in the two experiments are consistent with a history of differential punishment for uncomplimentary <b>self-reports,</b> which casual observation and some descriptive studies suggest is a common experience in United States culture.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} whether <b>self-report</b> measures of contact are valid for use in research testing the ‘contact hypothesis’. The vast majority of contact research has relied on the assumed validity of <b>self-report</b> methods of data collection (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), even though the potential weaknesses of <b>self-report</b> methodology generally have been well documented. This reliance is necessary, as <b>self-reports</b> remain the only practical method so far developed of measuring certain of the facilitating conditions developed by Allport (1954 / 1979), and particularly of direct and indirect cross-group friendship (Pettigrew, 1998; Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe, & Ropp, 1997). However, if <b>self-reports</b> are not a valid method for measuring contact, the derived implications of {{a large portion of}} the research effort are potentially flawed. This thesis attempted to address this important oversight, using a variety of methods to investigate whether the use of <b>self-reports</b> in future research on intergroup contact is appropriate. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that <b>self-reports</b> of contact show considerable resistance to context effects, particularly in comparison with <b>self-reports</b> of the more subjective construct of attitudes. Studies 3 - 5 demonstrated that <b>self-reports</b> of contact agree with the observer-reports of a single observer who knows the target intimately – the spouse or parent. Studies 6 and 7 replicate this agreement through the consensually supported observer-reports of three close friends of the target, thereby reducing any variance due to individual response biases. Finally, studies 8 and 9 demonstrate the concurrent criterion-related validity of <b>self-reports</b> of contact, in that they are able to predict contact on a very large online network called Facebook, on which real-world rather than purely online friendships are primarily represented. These findings offer considerable support for the validity of <b>self-reports</b> as a suitable method for measuring contact. As <b>self-reports</b> remain the only method which has thus far proven suitable for the measurement of those aspects of contact which are essential for exploration of the contact hypothesis, this thesis presents a very heartening and optimistic conclusion and supports the continued use of <b>self-reports</b> in contact research.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Research into {{different}} patient populations suggests that, on average, proxies report poorer health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) compared to <b>self-reports.</b> We aimed to investigate whether the difference between proxy reports and <b>self-reports</b> (interrater gap) varies across {{the whole range of}} <b>self-reports</b> from low to high HRQoL scores. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study in 16 Dutch nursing home (NH) dementia special care (DSC) units (n = 256) and 17 somatic units (n = 326). Professional carers, blinded to <b>self-reports,</b> provided EuroQol- 5 D scores from two perspectives: their own perspective (proxy-proxy) of the patients' HRQoL and the estimation of the patient's view (proxy-patient). RESULTS: The interrater gap varied linearly in both DSC and somatic patients from proxy scores overestimating low <b>self-reports</b> to proxy scores underestimating high <b>self-reports.</b> This attenuation tendency existed for both proxy-proxy and proxy-patient perspectives. The interrater gap tended to be smaller for the proxy-patient perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Proxies (professional carers) tend to attenuate <b>self-reports</b> in NH patients with and without dementia toward moderate scores rather than report systematically poorer HRQoL. A proxy-patient perspective may be preferable to a proxy-proxy perspective for the purpose of estimating <b>self-reports.</b> Further research into other populations is needed to understand whether the attenuation tendency is a general phenomenon...|$|R
