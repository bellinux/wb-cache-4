5|$|In 2011, cicadas were {{incorporated}} into a single batch of ice cream in Columbia, Missouri, at Sparky's. The ice creamery was advised by the public health department against making a second batch, a suggestion with which <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> complied.|$|E
5|$|The {{revitalization}} of {{businesses in the}} former village was credited to the influx of artists. Prior to the 1980s, <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> in Rosendale Village had either retired or died, and their shops had become residential or simply abandoned. Newcomers purchased these properties, restored them, and returned them to commercial service.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E

50|$|Back in 1977, Clearwater, Florida {{radio station}} owner Lowell 'Bud' Paxson was {{collecting}} money from local companies that advertised on his station. One local company, a hardware <b>store</b> <b>owner,</b> refused payment, insisting {{that not one}} single customer had heard the broadcast of his radio advertisements. Paxson and the <b>store</b> <b>owner</b> argued back and forth, eventually coming to a compromise: Instead of a financial payment, the <b>store</b> <b>owner</b> gave Paxson a box filled with electric can openers. Paxson took the box, {{and returned to the}} radio station.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Nashville sit-in campaign, sit-ins were staged at {{numerous}} stores in the central business district. Sit-in participants, who consisted mainly of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store lunch counters when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. Later that day, nearly 4000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. When asked if he believed the lunch counters in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should. After subsequent negotiations between the <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> and protest leaders, an agreement was reached {{during the first week of}} May. On May 10, six downtown stores began serving black customers at their lunch counters for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Further {{social changes}} {{brought about by}} the {{presence}} of American military personnel were exemplified in the storm's wake. The use of currency as a means for obtaining goods was first seen in Ulithi in 1956, four years before the typhoon. However, despite the total destruction of markets by Ophelia they were quickly rebuilt, depicting the quick entrenchment of currency in native culture. The reconstruction also accelerated a desire for new goods from trading. <b>Store</b> <b>owners</b> requested a wider range of material to have in stock than seen previously. From a societal standpoint, Ophelia prompted great advances in the Ulithian culture. Women, previously limited to agriculture, housework, and eventually shopping, were found to be doing heavy work (i.e. carpentry, chopping, digging, and lifting) in the immediate wake of the typhoon. A shift in government took place as well, with authority of King Malefich waning to greater power among younger individuals. Malefich also displayed great ineptitude during the storm and was subsequently disposed of as King following Ophelia's passage. The changes in authority occurred due to spontaneous leadership during the storm by the younger persons in order to protect others. Prior to the typhoon, younger members of tribes never spoke during council meetings; however, by 1961 they made their presence known in such meetings.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} Turkey in March 2012, with filming {{reported}} to be continuing until 6 May. Production was expected to take three months in the country. Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul in the film. A group of Turkish teenagers infiltrated a closed set in a railway sidings in Adana to film rehearsals of a fight scene {{on top of a}} train before being caught by security. The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana. Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot drop for the scene. A crane was set up on a train carriage to hold a safety line. Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April. <b>Store</b> <b>owners</b> in the affected areas were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but were not allowed to conduct business, instead being paid TRY750 ($418) per day as compensation. Production faced criticism for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops in the city. Michael G. Wilson denied these claims, pointing out that the film crew had removed sections of rooftops before filming began and replaced them with replicas {{for the duration of the}} shoot; when filming finished, the original rooftops would be restored. The production team negotiated with 613 part owners of the Calis Beach in Fethiye, to film along the coastline.|$|E

25|$|He {{eventually}} parlayed {{his job as}} a bouncer into {{a career}} as a bodyguard that lasted almost ten years. During these years he protected, among others, sixteen prostitutes, nine welfare recipients, five preachers, eight bankers, ten school teachers, and four <b>store</b> <b>owners.</b> As his reputation improved, however, he was contracted to guard, among others, seven clothes designers, five models, seven judges, three politicians, six athletes and forty-two millionaires. He protected well-known personalities such as Muhammad Ali, Steve McQueen, Michael Jackson, Leon Spinks, Joe Frazier and Diana Ross, charging $3,000 per day, to a maximum of $10,000 per day, depending on the clientele's risk-rate and traveling locations.|$|E
25|$|Lionel's first train, the Electric Express, was not {{intended}} for sale to consumers, but rather, as a storefront display. Delivered in December 1900, it operated on a brass track and was powered by a battery and a motor Cowen originally intended to use in an electric fan. Cowen hoped to use the public's fascination with railroads and electricity to capture the public's attention and direct it to the goods for sale. Members of the public started approaching <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> about buying the trains instead, prompting Lionel to begin making toy trains for the general public. Lionel ended up selling 12 examples of the Electric Express.|$|E

25|$|By mid-morning on {{the second}} day {{violence}} appeared widespread and unchecked as heavy looting and arson were witnessed across Los Angeles County. Rioting began to make its way from South Central Los Angeles, going north through the neighborhoods of Central Los Angeles before reaching Hollywood. The looting and fires engulfed Hollywood Boulevard, before making its way south to the neighboring cities of Inglewood, Hawthorne, Compton and Long Beach. Korean Americans noted the law enforcement's abandonment of Koreatown, contrasting it with official defense lines for places like white neighborhoods of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood. Subsequently, they organized their own armed security teams composed of <b>store</b> <b>owners,</b> who defended their livelihoods from assault by the mobs.|$|E

25|$|When {{the police}} left without their prisoners, the {{fighting}} {{stopped for a}} few moments. The truce lasted only {{an hour or two}} as fighting resumed near The Tombs, supposedly brought about by a group of women from the Five Points who had provoked the Dead Rabbits into attacking the Bowery gangs. Bringing reinforcements, the participants were estimated at between 800 and 1000, armed with bludgeons, paving stones, brick bats, axes, pitchforks, and other weapons. Several hundred other criminals also arrived in the area, mostly burglars and thieves, who were not affiliated with either side and simply took the opportunity for looting. Residents and <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> all along the Bowery were forced to barricade their buildings and protect themselves with pistols and muskets.|$|E

25|$|Catalyzed by {{the student}} deaths, mass {{violence}} began almost simultaneously throughout Jakarta the following day. The Matahari department store in the eastern district of Jatinegara and Yogya Plaza in Klender were barricaded and deliberately torched. It was estimated that at least 1,000 people died inside the buildings during the fires. Mobs also attacked Glodok in the northwestern part of the city, where the commercial area of Jakarta's Chinatown was badly damaged. Some <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> reportedly paid local thugs {{to protect them from}} the violence because security forces were largely absent. Riots also occurred near the port of Tanjung Priok in the north, the city of Tangerang to the west, and Kebayoran Baru in the south. Properties owned by Chinese Indonesians were the most common targets.|$|E
25|$|Frank DeSimone {{is accused}} of ruining the Los Angeles family's {{reputation}} and integrity.

25|$|Despite his own {{involvement}} {{in the sale of}} land, Tomoana was alarmed by the rate of Māori land loss in the Hawke's Bay region in the 1850s. In 1856 he joined is elder half-brother Karaitiana Takamoana in an attempt to bridle the rate at which land was being sold by Te Hapuku, another powerful Māori leader from the same area. Eventually their attempt led to open conflict, and between 1857-58 Tomoana fought against Te Hapuku in a war at Te Pakiaka, near Whakatu. During this time he accrued large debts to European <b>store</b> <b>owners,</b> and was forced to lease or sell land to repay what he had owed. By 1867 he had sold a large block at Wahaparata (near the present day site of Havelock North) and had leased over 17,000 acres of land in the Heretaunga Plains to Thomas Tanner for an initial annual sum of £600.|$|E

25|$|The {{country now}} houses over 40 adult movies studios {{featuring}} heterosexual scenes, {{more than any}} other country. The branch, according to founder and president of Adult Video News Paul Fishbein, involves the manufacturers of adult products, distributors, suppliers, retail <b>store</b> <b>owners,</b> wholesalers, distributors, cable TV buyers, and foreign buyers. The production is concentrated in San Fernando Valley (mainly in Chatsworth, Reseda and Van Nuys) and Las Vegas, where more than 200 adult entertainment companies gather to network and show off their latest wares. The world's largest adult movies studio, Vivid Entertainment, generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the internet. Vivid's two largest regional competitors are Wicked Pictures and Digital Playground. Colorado-based New Frontier Media, a leading distributor of adult movies (at NASDAQ since November 2000), is one of the two adult video companies traded publicly, the other one being Spanish Private Media Group.|$|E
25|$|A sales assistant's role {{typically}} includes greeting customers, providing {{product and}} service-related information, providing advice about products available from current stock, answering customer questions, finalising customer transactions and if necessary, providing follow-up service {{necessary to ensure}} customer satisfaction. For retail <b>store</b> <b>owners,</b> it is extremely important to train personnel with the requisite skills necessary to deliver excellent customer service. Such skills may include product knowledge, inventory management, handling cash and credit transactions, handling product exchange and returns, dealing with difficult customers and of course, a detailed knowledge of store policies. The provision of excellent customer service creates more opportunities to build enduring customer relationships {{with the potential to}} turn customers into sources of referral or retail advocates. In the long term, excellent customer service provides businesses with an ongoing reputation and may lead to a competitive advantage. Customer service is essential for several reasons. Firstly, customer service contributes to the customer's overall retail experience. Secondly, evidence suggests that a retail organization which trains its employees in appropriate customer service benefits more than those who do not. Customer service training entails instructing personnel in the methods of servicing the customer that will benefit corporations and businesses. It is important to establish a bond amongst customers-employees known as Customer relationship management.|$|E
25|$|On 27 April 1838, {{a massive}} {{fire broke out}} around 9:00 in the evening. It raged until noon the next day, {{damaging}} over 1,000 buildings, a loss estimated at $3 million at the time. In efforts to put the fire out, all {{the water in the}} city pumps was used up. The fire ruined businesses, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. Many houses were burnt to the ground. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in {{the main part of the}} city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. Several prominent <b>store</b> <b>owners</b> died attempting to save their establishments. When the many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired, a great cultural awakening occurred. In many ways, the fire helped put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Previous to the fire, only a few homes were styled as Greek Revival; many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion.|$|E
