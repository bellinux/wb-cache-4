40|$|The {{flavor and}} texture of the final meat, poultry, or game product depends on how the meat is handled {{following}} slaughter. If you slaughter your own meat, contact your county Extension educator for information. Use only meat from healthy, disease-free animals. The meat should be chilled without delay to 40 degrees F (or lower to prevent spoilage. To hold longer than a few days, freeze at 0 degrees F or lower until canning time. Rinse poultry thoroughly in cold water and drain. Handle meat rapidly and keep everything that touches the meat clean. Debone red meats. Trim off all gristle, bruised spots, and excess fat before canning. Any fat left on the meat may affect sealing. Meat, poultry, and game are low-acid foods and must be processed in a pressure canner at 10 to 15 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) for safety. See Tables 1, 2, and 3 for processing times for all meat types and stock. Meat can be packed either raw or cooked. Pack meat loosely into clean canning jars. Keep precooked meat hot while packing and cover with boiling liquid. Salt adds flavor, but is not necessary for preservation. When ready to serve, boil canned meat and poultry 10 minutes before you taste it—even if it looks and smells all right. If {{this is your first}} time canning, it is suggested that you read “Canning Basics ” for instructions on filling and processing recommendations. Poultry, Rabbit, or Squirrel Choose freshly killed and dressed, healthy animals. Large chickens are more flavorful than fryers. Dressed poultry should be chilled for 6 to 12 hours before canning. Dressed rabbits or squirrels should be soaked 1 hour in water containing 1 tablespoon of salt per quart, then rinsed. Remove excess fat. Cut the poultry, rabbit, or squirrel into suitable sizes for canning. Can with or without bones. Hot Pack Boil, steam, or bake meat until about two-thirds done. If desired, add 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> per quart. Fill jars with meat pieces and boiling broth, leaving 1 -inch headspace. Raw Pack If desired, add 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> per quart. Fill jars loosely with raw meat pieces, leaving 1 -inch headspace. Do not add liquid. Adjust lids and process. Table 1.

2500|$|Oral {{rehydration}} solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened {{and salty}} water) {{can be used}} to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given.

Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the [...] "taste of tears").

30|$|The {{monitors}} {{were asked}} to report the salinity level {{of the water in}} each tube well, using the corresponding tube well tag number, to the local partner every week by phone. To complement the tube well profiles, the monitors visited each household that owned the monitored tube wells and asked about the number of family members, the monthly household income, and the amount of salt added while eating three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) as well as added while cooking. The households were asked how much they consumed salt during a onetime survey period of three consecutive days, from Wednesday to Friday, to include both weekdays (Wednesday and Thursday) and a weekend day (Friday). Salt for cooking was measured in teaspoons, and for consistency in measurement the monitors carried the same <b>teaspoon</b> for reference. <b>Salt</b> added while eating was measured in pinches. All the households used unrefined salt (Khola labon) for both cooking salt and table salt. The weight of one <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> measured with an electronic scale was equivalent to 6 – 8  g. To convert the salt amounts into grams, 7  g was counted as one <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>salt</b> and 0.6  g was counted as one pinch of salt. For depicting data plots and performing statistical analyses of salt intake of households, tube well profiles (salinity and geographical conditions), and economic variables of households, the SAS university edition software (SAS Studio 3.6 with the fourth maintenance release for SAS 9.4) was used.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} said that two people can sleep in thesame bed but have {{different}} dreams. The samephenomenon is sometimes seen when the same data are observed by two people who come to opposite conclusions as to their meaning. A case in point is the contrast in evaluating the implications of the INTERSALT study, 1 as voiced by two figures well known in international research on hypertension. Dr. Simpson of New Zealand writes as follows: " [...] . the INTERSALT data on the slope of blood pressure with age in relation to sodium intake are unique and more encouraging to the idea that salt is important. " 2 But Dr. Swales of England has written: "Salt has only small importance in hypertension. " 3 Two words have been italicized in this latter quotation, "small " and "hypertension, " since they provide a clue that helps explain what I judge to be an erroneous interpreta-tion of INTERSALT and of the whole issue of salt and blood pressure. The error arises from the impos-ing of a strictly clinical approach when the question under study is about implications for the population. Patients and Populations A clinician, observing a patient in his or her office, will note that the blood pressure may change 2, 3, 5, or even 10 mm Hg from one measurement to the next. The clinician will, understandably, call such differences small in magnitude and unimportant for health. But is it appropriate to look at findings on populations, such as in the INTERSALT study, 1 in the same way? The INTERSALT data indicate that if a population, on average, had a daily sodium intake lower by 100 mmol (about 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt),</b> average population systolic blood pressure would be lower by 2 - 3 mm Hg (Table 1). If other relevant aspects of lifestyle were improved in the population (higher potassium intake so that the sodium/potassium ratio was 1 instead of 3 as observed in INTERSALT, average weight lower by about 6 kg [13 lb], and excess alcohol avoided), then population average systolic pressure could be lower by at least 5 mm Hg. Is this difference really small when applied not to the vari-ations of blood pressure of a patient but to a poten-tially lower average blood pressure in a population...|$|R
