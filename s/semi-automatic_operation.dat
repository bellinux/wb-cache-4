2500|$|Paintball marker: {{also known}} as a [...] "paintball gun", this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the {{opposing}} player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a loader or [...] "hopper" [...] or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a compressed-air tank or CO2 tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable silver capsules (12-gram CO2 cartridges) normally seen in pellet guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operation.</b> Further improvements included increased rates of fire; carbon dioxide (CO2) tanks from 3.5 [...] to 40 ounces, and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 5000 PSI. The use of unstable CO2 causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers.|$|E

5000|$|Electrically powered airsoft guns use a {{spring-loaded}} {{piston pump}} just like spring guns, {{but instead of}} manual operation they typically use portable rechargeable battery packs to power an internal electric motor, which transmit through a gearbox to compress the pump spring and propel/load the pellets in a cyclic fashion. Selective fire options among automatic, 3-round burst and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operations</b> are all possible, which gives these guns the popular name [...] "automatic electric guns", or AEGs. [...] These guns often attain muzzle velocities from 150 to 650 ft/s and rates of fire (RoF) between 100 and 1500 rounds per minute.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{microfluidics}} {{has emerged as}} a distinct new field with promising applications for diverse research areas. The ability to precisely control fluids at the microscale allows the execution of a variety of programmable <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operations</b> on the same device, effectively forming a lab-on-a-chip. In particular, droplet-based microfluidic systems – which reliably generate highly uniform microdroplets at a high throughput – enable the controlled compartmentalization of biological material and have the potential to influence mainstream biomedical research. In this thesis, a microfluidic platform is presented that allows the encapsulation of viable cells in agarose microcapsules for applications in cell–based therapy. As an improvement to pre-existing methods of cell encapsulation, the proposed system combines continuous high throughput cell-encapsulation with on-chip microcapsule gelation and purification. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceVirtual {{architectural}} (indoor) {{scenes are}} often modeled in 3 D for {{various types of}} simulation systems. For instance, some authors propose methods dedicated to lighting, heat transfer, acoustic or radio-wave propagation simulations. These methods rely in most cases on a volumetric representation of the environment, with adjacency and incidence relationships. Unfortunately, many buildings data are only given by 2 D plans and the 3 D needs varies from one application to another. To face these problems, we propose a formal representation of consistency constraints dedicated to building interiors and associated with a topological model. We show that such a representation can be used for: (i) reconstructing 3 D models from 2 D architectural plans (ii) detecting automatically geometrical, topological and semantical inconsistencies (iii) designing automatic and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operations</b> to correct and enrich a 2 D plan. All our constraints are homogeneously defined in 2 D and 3 D, implemented with generalized maps and used in modeling operations. We explain how this model can be successfully used for lighting and radio-wave propagation simulations...|$|R

They offered technical specifications and features rivalling much more expensive turntables, including well-engineered s-shaped tonearms with tracking weight and anti-skate adjustments. At the time they were introduced the SL-20 and SL-23, which sold for $100.00 and $140.00, respectively, set a new performance standard for inexpensive turntables.|$|E
50|$|Gas-powered airsoft guns use the {{pneumatic}} {{potential energy}} stored within compressed gas {{to drive the}} shooting mechanism, and thus operate according to an entirely different design principle to spring- or electrically powered airsoft guns. The most common type seen is the gas blowback (GBB) guns. These gas guns use an internal canister (usually within the magazine) that upon trigger-pull releases the prefilled bottled gas via a series of valves to propel the pellet and generate a blowback, which simulates recoil and cyclically loads the next shot. They are capable of both automatic and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Automated close-range photogrammetric {{measurement}} {{has traditionally}} been associated with expensive specialist cameras and usually requires highly controlled image illumination conditions. In the past few years, however, {{there has been a}} significant amount of research into the development of automated routines and algorithms that support the employment of consumer-grade colour digital cameras for everyday photogrammetric measurement tasks. These include, but are not limited to, fully automatic network orientation, image point correspondence determination and camera calibration. This paper discusses the further requirement of a hybrid-measurement approach, where automatic orientation routines are supported, as well as follow-up manual and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operations</b> such as natural feature point extraction, manual point measurement and operator-assisted surface definition via image matching. Control over image illumination is not critical; however the use of retro-reflective targeting ensures a high level of process automation prior to the manual phase of hybrid measurement. Topics discussed include the exploitation of colour from imagery and targeting, issues regarding automatic network orientation and image point correspondence determination in normally exposed imagery, operator-assisted surface extraction, and a special condition placed on the bundle adjustment to support both automatic and manual image measurements. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceModel Based Transformation Example (MTBE) is {{a recent}} track of {{research}} aiming at learning a transformation from examples.

Building the links is done manually, which is a tedious task, while in many cases, they can be de- duced from the examination of the source and transformed models, by using relevant attributes, like names or identifiers. We exploit this characteristic by proposing a <b>semi-automatic</b> matching <b>operation,</b> suitable for discovering matches between the source model and the transformed model. Our technique is inspired by and extends the Anchor-Prompt approach, and is based on the automatic discovery of pairs of anchors (pairs of elements for which there is a strong assumption of matching) to support the whole matching discovery.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s these two lines {{were the two}} busiest on the network, with loads of 140% of {{capacity}} during the evening peak. However, as this change alone was insufficient to overcome this saturation, the length of stations was lengthened from 75 to 90 metres, allowing the lengthening of train from five to six carriages. This work was carried out very quickly and, as early as October 1965, trains of six carriages traversed the line. On 3 October 1966, the first train composed of MP 59 electric multiple units operated on the line. The Line 4 trains were identical to those on Line 1, being composed of four motor and two trailers per train. The line’s MP 59 fleet included 556 carriages, comprising 376 powered carriages and 180 trailers. On 17 July 1967, the last steel-wheeled train left the line to strengthen the service of other with a hundred cars built before 1914 scrapped. In February 1971, line 4 was the second network after line 11 to be equipped with <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operation,</b> with a system known as Grecque (“Greek”).

50|$|The {{weapon is}} {{more prone to}} fire when dropped, and the open {{mechanism}} is more subject to picking up dirt when in the ready position, and so may require an additional ejector door or similar mechanism to exclude dust and dirt. Some open-bolt designs can suffer from {{a condition in which}} bolt retention fails and the weapon discharges even with no trigger input. Open-bolt machine guns could not be synchronized to fire through the arc of a propeller due to the relatively long period between sear disengagement and the ignition of the cartridge, making them harder to use as forward-firing weapons on tractor configuration fighter aircraft. Accuracy can suffer somewhat in an open-bolt design, again due to the longer delay between pulling the trigger and primer ignition, but this is generally less of a concern in automatic weapons, since after the first shot, the operation is indistinguishable from a firearm that fires from a closed bolt. It is only when the trigger is released that the bolt is caught in the rearward position; during automatic fire, both types of bolts are free to operate at full rate, without hindrance. As most open-bolt guns are automatics, generally only weapons, such as submachine guns, converted to <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>operation</b> suffer from this.|$|E

Elastic behavior is modelled by local stabilizing functionals, controlling the mean curvature through the simplex angle extracted at each vertex. Those functionals are viewpoint-invariant, intrinsic and scale-sensitive. Unlike deformable surfaces de- ned on regular grids, simplex meshes are highly adaptive structures, and we have developed a renement process for increasing the mesh resolution at highly curved or inaccurate parts.
