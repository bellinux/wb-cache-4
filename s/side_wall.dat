5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia (or corkscrew): A shot played diagonally upwards {{into the}} front corner hitting the front wall first and then the <b>side</b> <b>wall.</b> The ball then lobs over the court with {{significant}} spin. Ideally it hits the opposite <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> at the back and travels parallel to the rear wall making a return very difficult. This shot is a favourite in exhibition squash but is susceptible to being volleyed.|$|E
25|$|Boast: The ball {{is played}} off a <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> at an angle, or the back wall, {{before hitting the}} front wall. A 'three wall boast' has the ball hit at a <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> such that the ball hits the front wall {{followed}} by the opposite <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> before finally hitting the floor. A 'back wall boast' has the ball struck {{against the back wall}} before reaching the front wall. It is typically not recommended to beginners due to the risk of hitting spectators above and behind players on solid backed courts. A 'trickle boast' is a boast performed at a shallow angle with the front wall at a low trajectory. A 'reverse boast' is a boast played towards the sidewall furtherst from the striker. It is played rarely at high levels due to the high risk of hitting the opponent and the typical ease of counterattack.|$|E

25|$|Nick: The ball is hit {{such that}} after {{striking}} {{the front wall}} the ball connects with the junction between the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> and the floor. The result is the ball either bouncing minimally or 'rolling' out of the nick, ending the rally.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{the effects}} of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> on the {{unsteady}} flow in a duct of rectangular cross-section are considered. In order to show {{the effects of}} the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> on the flow, two illustrative examples are given. One of them is the unsteady flow due to an applied pressure gradient in a duct of rectangular cross-section. The other is the unsteady flow in a duct of rectangular cross-section moving parallel to its length. These effects depend on the values of the aspect ratio. The variations of the velocity and the volume flux with respect to the aspect ratio show that these are appreciable effects of the walls on the flow. It is found that the required time to reach the steady-state for the flow with <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> is shorter than that for the flow without <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> Keywords- Unsteady flow, duct of rectangular cross-section, effect of <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> steady-state 1...|$|R
40|$|Four {{types of}} {{unsteady}} flows of a viscous fluid over a plane wall bounded by two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> are considered. They are flow caused by impulsive motion of a plate, flow due to oscillation of a plate, flow induced by constantly accelerating plate, and flow imposed by a plate that applies a constant tangential stress to the fluid. In order {{to solve these}} problems, the sine and cosine transformations are used, and exact solutions for the velocity distribution are found in terms of definite integrals. The cases for which the time goes to infinity and the distance between two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> goes to infinity are compared with the cases for flows over a plane wall {{in the absence of}} the <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> These provide to know the required time to attain the steady-state and what is the distance between the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> for which the measured value of the velocity or the stress would be unaffected by the presence of the <b>side</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R

The ceiling {{and most of the}} <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> are covered with timber lattice mounted on timber posts, that stops just above the level of the exit doors in the <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> The bottom edge of the lattice is finished with shallow arches trimmed with a double stripe painted in black. At the top of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> is a broad band of decoration achieved by picking out a pattern within the lattice with black paint.|$|R

25|$|The rows of shining lathe turned pillars {{that support}} {{the ceiling of the}} mantapa is a Hoysala-Chalukya {{decorative}} idiom. The mantapa has many deeply domed inner ceiling structures adorned with floral designs. The outer parapet wall of the open mantapa has a total of hundred and forty panel sculptures with depictions from the Hindu epics. Unlike many Hoysala temples where the panels are small and carvings in miniature, these panels are comparatively larger. The Ramayana is sculpted on the south <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> on seventy panels, with the story proceeding quite unusually, in anti-clockwise direction. On the north <b>side</b> <b>wall,</b> all depictions are clockwise, a norm in Hoysala architectural articulation. Twenty five panels depict the life of the Hindu god Krishna and the remaining forty five panels depict scenes from the epic Mahabharata.|$|E
25|$|On {{approaching}} the semicircle from the east, a visitor walks {{along one of}} two walls (right <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> and left <b>side</b> <b>wall)</b> picturing scenes of the war experience in bas relief. As one approaches on the left (toward the Pacific arch), the scenes begin with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams, taking the oath, and being issued military gear. The reliefs progress through several iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a homecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a similar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European theatre. Some scenes take place in England, depicting the preparations for air and sea assaults. The last scene is of a handshake between the American and Russian armies when the western and eastern fronts met in Germany.|$|E

25|$|In {{the arch}} dam, {{stability}} is obtained {{by a combination}} of arch and gravity action. If the upstream face is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the upstream face is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon <b>side</b> <b>wall)</b> are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.|$|E

Another unanticipated problem was that this was the coldest March for thirty years, with snow up to five feet deep, so the escapees had no option but to leave the cover of woods and fields and stay on the roads.|$|E
