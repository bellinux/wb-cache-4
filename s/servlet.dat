40|$|Abstract- Mobicents Sip <b>Servlets</b> {{helps the}} users to create, deploy, and manage {{services}} and applications that integrate voice, video and data {{in real time}} over IP networks. These applications require high resources to run. Mobicents Sip <b>Servlets</b> has not offered a cloud support yet. Running Mobicents Sip <b>Servlets</b> in a cloud would allow the users to adapt the resources used by Mobicents Sip <b>Servlets</b> to the real time load of the applications. We have proposed a solution to migrate Mobicents Sip <b>Servlets</b> on a cloud platform. Our solution provides a set of cloud images that support the Mobicents Sip <b>Servlets</b> platform. Besides, our solution provides an auto-scaling algorithm that automatically scales the number of instances of Mobicents Sip <b>Servlets.</b> It is now possible to deploy SIP applications in a cloud and the platform will adapt its resource according to the need...|$|R
40|$|Our {{recent work}} on {{database}} access using Java <b>servlets</b> (see Yang and Kim 1999) {{focused on the}} performance metering of sequential versus concurrent connection schemes between the web server and the database server. In this paper, we plan to extend the work by comparing the performance of database access between <b>servlets</b> and CGI scripts in the Internet environment. To guarantee a fair comparison, all the parameters in both sets of experiments are identical, except for the connectivity mechanism between the web server and the database server. The first section of this draft paper gives {{an introduction to the}} 3 -Tier WWW model and its integration with Java <b>servlets</b> or CGI to enable database connectivity. The section is followed by a discussion of the <b>servlets</b> that we developed to experiment with distributed data access, and the two different types of servlet-database connection schemes (sequential vs concurrent). The findings from the earlier performance metering experiments using Java <b>servlets</b> are then summarized. The configuration of the performance comparison experiments using <b>servlets</b> and CGI are illustrated in the following section. The paper concludes with analysis of the experiments comparing the performance of <b>servlets</b> vs CGI. ...|$|R
25|$|In a multithreaded program, an {{uncaught}} {{exception in}} a thread may instead result in termination of just that thread, not {{the entire process}} (uncaught exceptions in the thread-level handler are caught by the top-level handler). This is particularly important for servers, where for example a <b>servlet</b> (running in its own thread) can be terminated without the server overall being affected.|$|E
25|$|The Drupal core {{search is}} {{ineffective}} at searching content: There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, {{but they are}} not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module. One of the faceted search options is Apache Solr Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or virtual private server (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a <b>servlet</b> container, e.g. Tomcat, Jetty or Resin. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr SaaS products.|$|E
