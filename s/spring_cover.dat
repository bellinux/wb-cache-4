40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The use {{of cover}} crops in young {{vineyards}} is not widely {{accepted in the}} Pacific Northwest due to concerns of water and nutrient competition between the cover crop and vines. The last 2 years of a 4 -year study started in 2009 are reported here. The study evaluated the use of biomass management of a winter annual cover to enhance growth and conserve soil moisture. A winter annual cover crop of cereal rye (Secale cereale) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum) was planted each fall in a pre-production Vitis vinifera 'Chardonnay' vineyard. Cover-cropped treatments were compared to an unplanted treatment which was never planted to cover crop and kept free of vegetation by tillage and/or herbicides {{for the duration of}} the study. In <b>spring,</b> <b>cover</b> crop biomass was mowed and residues were placed in the alleys, removed from the alleys, or applied as a mulch to the vine row at two densities (one equal to the alley biomass, and one with triple the alley biomass). All treatments were tilled and kept free of vegetation during the summer. Insufficient residue was produced in 2012 and data collected in that year was used to determine residual effects from three prior years of treatments. Higher levels of soil moisture were maintained in mulched treatments through the summer of 2011. Soil mechanical resistance was decreased under the high level of mulch. Root density was increased in mulched vine rows, likely as a result of both increased soil moisture and reduced soil mechanical resistance. In 2011, shoot growth was increased by 17 % in mulch treatments, and fruitfulness was higher in 2011 and 2012. Tissue nitrogen and leaf chlorophyll were increased in mulched treatments at bloom, and potassium and boron were higher with the high level of mulch in 2011. Clusters were larger in the high level of mulch treatment with more berries per cluster, but berry weight and fruit yield were not different. Cover crop and mulch did not alter soluble solids, pH, titratable acidity, or yeast assimilable nitrogen. By using a winter annual cover crop, consisting of a mix of grasses and legumes, and applying the biomass to the vines in the <b>spring,</b> <b>cover</b> crops can be a viable management option for establishing vineyards in the Pacific Northwest...|$|E

While early fruit imports cannot supply such fruit, {{a new technology}} of forcing cherry emerged for an early local supply by covering the crop in spring. In the apparent scarcity of data on the resulting fruit quality, fruit characteristics of forced cherries were compared with those without cover RESULTS: Size and weight of forced cherry fruit were successfully increased by 6 - 14 %. The less negative osmotic potential of the forced fruit (- 3 to - 2 Psipi) indicates less water stress under <b>spring</b> <b>cover</b> compared with field-grown fruit (- 4 Psipi), as confirmed by the larger fruit size and weight. Greater anti-oxidative potentials in the lipophilic (and hydrophilic extract (control min. 185 mE vs. max. 365 mE under cover) of forced fruit in two cvs showed their healthier attribute in terms of bioactive compounds, supported also by an averaged 14 % increase in phenolics, {{as a response to}} the modified environmental conditions and was not investigated before.

The objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects}} of spring-sown cover crop mixture diversity and mechanical cover crop termination method on cover crop and/or cash crop productivity, soil moisture and N, and profitability in an organic cropping system. An experiment was conducted between 2009 and 2011 near Mead, Nebraska, where mixtures of two (2 CC), four (4 CC), six (6 CC), and eight (8 CC) cover crop species, or a summer annual weed mixture were included in a sunflower– soybean–corn rotation. Cover crops were terminated in late May using a field disk or sweep plow undercutter. Undercutting cover crops increased soil NO 3 –N (0 – 20 cm) by 1. 0 and 1. 8 mg NO 3 –N kg– 1 relative to disk incorporation in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Cover crop mixtures often reduced soil moisture (0 – 8 cm) before main crop planting, though cover crop termination with the undercutter increased soil moisture content by as much as 0. 024 cm 3 cm– 3 compared to termination with the disk during early main crop growth. Crop yields were not influenced by cover crop mixture, but termination with the undercutter increased corn and soybean yield by as much as 1. 40 and 0. 88 Mg ha– 1, respectively. Despite differences in productivity between <b>spring</b> <b>cover</b> crop mixtures and weed communities, crop yield was not different among these treatments; thus, profitability of the weed mixture–undercutter treatment combination was greatest due to reduced input costs...|$|E

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the impact fertilizer application timing and cover crops (CC) adoption on the load and concentration of nutrients in subsurface drainage leachate. This experiment was conducted at the Illinois State University Nitrogen Management Field Station, in Lexington, IL. Treatments include a zero control (no N fertilizer and no cover crop), fall dominated N application (70 % fall, 30 % spring) with and without CC, and a spring dominated N application (20 % fall, 80 % spring) with and without CC. A total rate of 224 kg N ha- 1 was applied to all treatments, except the zero control. <b>Spring</b> <b>cover</b> crop sampling revealed an average biomass of 1165 kg ha- 1 and an average N uptake of 42. 5 kg N ha- 1. Soil samples were collected in the spring at four separate depths and were analyzed for inorganic N. Regardless of N fertilizer application system, cover crops demonstrated the ability to decrease the concentration of NO 3 - N 33 - 62 % within the soil profile across the study. The addition of cover crops also reduced the amount of NO 3 - N within at the lower depths of the soil profile by 17 % in the fall system and 37 % in the spring system. The Illinois Nutrient Loss Reduction Strategy presents a target reduction in NO 3 -N losses by 15 % by 2025.

40|$|Cover crops act {{as green}} manure adding organic matter to agricultural-soils. For legume green manures {{to be an}} {{effective}} nitrogen (N) source for organic farming systems, their N release must be in synchrony with crop N demand. The objectives of this study were 1) determine the decomposition rates of three common cover crops (white clover, (Trifolium repens,L) red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and soybean (Glycine max L) in order to determine when most N was released and its synchrony with subsequent corn crop uptake; 2) we focused on the effect of cover crops on soil N levels. This study was conducted in a certified organic field, near Mead, NE. We assessed the decomposition rates and chemical composition of three cover crops with different incorporation time (fall and <b>spring).</b> <b>Cover</b> crop samples were taken and air dried in fall and spring. Litterbags containing plant samples were buried at a depth of 15 cm in December, 2011 and March, 2012. The nine extraction times for fall treatment were 0, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40, 48 weeks after burial. For spring treatment, samples were dug up every four weeks. Soil samples from each experimental unit were taken at the same time. Extracted litterbags were oven-dried and samples were analyzed for biomass fractions (soluble, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) and total C and N content. As conclusion, decomposition rates of five treatments follow the order: white clover incorporated in spring 3 ̆e red clover incorporated in spring 3 ̆e white clover incorporated in fall 3 ̆e red clover incorporated in fall 3 ̆e soybean incorporated in fall. Mass loss, nutrient content, and litter quality were all changed mostly in the first 0 - 3 months, which indicates that early stage of cover crops incorporation is critical to cover crop management. To describe the decomposition process, asymptotic models are more appropriate. Cover crops killed in spring have a better synchrony with corn uptake curve. After growing season, soil following red clover had greater level of soil nitrate-N. Advisor: James R. Brandl...|$|E

Horseweed density, biomass accumulation, and soybean yield data were quantified. Horseweed height, whole plant seed production, and seed subsamples were recorded in the untreated fallow control, winter wheat, and winter rye plots in 2014. Horseweed suppression by winter rye approached 90 %, levels similar to suppression by herbicide systems. In both years, herbicide plots had less than half the horseweed biomass than any of the cover crop systems. In 2013, soybean yields in herbicide plots were at least 1, 500 kg ha[superscript]- 1, nearly more than double yields in cover crop plots. Soybean yields in 2014 were more consistent across treatments; barley and spring rye plots achieved yields equal to or greater than 2, 000 kg ha[superscript]- 1. Winter rye and winter wheat reduced horseweed seed production by 60 % compared to the untreated fallow control, with no effect on individual seed weight. Seed production varied across plants, with the untreated control producing the greatest number of seeds.

40|$|Although most pests of soybeans, Gycine max (L.), in the Northern Great Plains {{are managed}} using pesticides, farm {{management}} practices that encourage biodiversity offer promising long-term, sustainable solutions for controlling insect and weed pests profitably. The recent {{invasion of the}} Northern Great Plains by the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura; Hemiptera: Aphididae) has had potentially important implications for insect communities in soybeans of this region, although recent descriptions of this regional community are scarce. We describe how three pest management systems that vary in the intensity with which they rely on herbicides and insecticides (chemically intensive, reduced chemical, and <b>spring</b> <b>cover</b> crop treatments) affect insect pest populations, arthropod predator communities, weed assemblages, and soybean yield and profitability. Soybean aphids exceeded economic thresholds in all three years, and insecticides successfully suppressed these outbreaks in the two chemical treatments; aphids exceeded the economic injury level in the cover crop treatment in two of three study years. Bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata Forster; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) populations were sub-economic in all treatments; insecticides targeting soybean aphid also reduced bean leaf beetles {{in the first year}} of study when beetle populations were at their highest. Foliar-dwelling predator populations were substantially higher in the cover crop treatment than in the chemical treatments in all years of study; population declines in the latter treatments were strongly associated with insecticide applications targeting soybean aphids. Foliar predator populations did not rebound within the growing season after insecticides were applied. Soil predator populations were largely unaffected by treatment (except in 2006, when they were more abundant in the cover crop treatment than in the chemical treatments). Weed communities varied among treatments and study years, with few consistent trends except that the chemically intensive treatment had lower weed densities than the other treatments. Although input costs of the cover crop and reduced chemical treatments were lower than the chemically intensive treatment, the chemically intensive treatment was the most profitable of the three. Nevertheless, we contend that the cover crops can be managed more efficiently in order to increase the profitability and competitiveness of this treatment while gaining the long-term benefits gleaned from conserving biodiversity in our agroecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) loading from {{subsurface}} drainage is an environmental {{concern in the}} Midwest. The majority of NO 3 -N loading occurs in April, May and June when the crops are not planted or just establishing. In this study, NO 3 -N leaching was monitored under alternative land covers and in a corn-soybean rotation. Land cover treatments in a 2 -year field experiment included: 1) corn-soybean rotation initiated with corn in 2006 and fallow in late fall and early spring (fallow-Corn-fallow-Soybean, fCfS); 2) corn-soybean rotation initiated with soybean in 2006 and fallow in late fall and early spring (fallow-Soybean-fallow-Corn, fSfC); 3) corn-soybean rotation initiated with corn in 2006 with rye cover crop (rye-Corn-rye-Soybean, rCrS); 4) corn-soybean rotation initiated with soybean in 2006 with rye cover crop (rye-Soybean-rye-Corn, rSrC); 5) Corn with established kura clover as a living mulch (kura-Kura-kura-Corn, kKkC); and 6) Pasture as a perennial grass treatment (PP). Subsurface drainage volume and NO 3 -N concentration were monitored. Suction lysimeters were installed to extract the soil water solution for NO 3 -N analysis. Biomass of <b>spring</b> <b>cover</b> crops was sampled to analyze nitrogen (N) content. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine NO 3 -N loss through {{subsurface drainage}} as affected by different land covers; 2) to investigate the NO 3 -N concentrations in the soil water under different land covers and 3) to quantify the nitrogen uptake by different cover crops in the spring. The results from the two-year study indicated that the annual average NO 3 -N loss for fCfS and fSfC treatments was 37. 5 kg N ha - 1 and that the rCrS and rSrC treatments reduced NO 3 -N leaching by 3. 8 kg N ha - 1 during April, May and June. kKkC and PP treatments resulted in 39. 7 % and 59. 9 % annual NO 3 -N leaching reduction, respectively, {{when compared to the}} average NO 3 -N loss of fCfS and fSfC treatments. Rye followed by soybean reduced the NO 3 -N concentration in the soil solution significantly (56. 4 %) at the 30 - and 60 -cm depths, and PP treatment showed the lowest NO 3 -N concentration at those two depths. The average nitrogen uptake by rye was 33. 3 kg N ha - 1 at growth termination, and the average N uptake was 59. 9 kg N ha - 1 for kura clover and 33. 2 kg N ha - 1 for pasture in early June. This study suggested that winter rye cover crop, kura clover as a living mulch and perennial pasture land covers have positive effects on NO 3 -N loss reduction under the weather condition encountered during this study period in Iowa...|$|E
40|$|Occupancy models {{provide a}} useful tool for {{examining}} relationships between species' occurrences and environmental or ecological covariates when detection probability is less than one. This research is focused on the secretive and rare California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) and its wetland habitats in a newly discovered part of its range in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California, USA. In order to examine the Black Rail's distribution, residency, density, relationship to a larger conspecific, the Virginia Rail (Laterallus limicola), and relationship to livestock grazing, three classes of occupancy models were utilized: single-species/single-season models, single season/two-species models, and multi-season/single-species models. In order to develop a wetland classification procedure for identifying potential Black Rail habitats, we evaluated the utility of combining topographic features with spectral and geometric features using high-resolution satellite imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM). The secretive California Black Rail has a disjunct and poorly understood distribution. After a new population was discovered in Yuba County in 1994, we conducted call playback surveys from 1994 - 2006 in the Sierra foothills and Sacramento Valley region to determine the distribution and residency of Black Rails, estimate densities, and obtain estimates of site occupancy and detection probability. We found Black Rails at 164 small, widely scattered marshes distributed along the lower western slopes of the Sierra Nevada foothills, from just northeast of Chico (Butte County) to Rocklin (Placer County). Marshes were surrounded by a matrix of unsuitable habitat, creating a patchy or metapopulation structure. We observed Black Rails nesting and present evidence that they are year-round residents. Assuming perfect detectability we estimated a lower-bound mean Black Rail density of 1. 78 rails ha - 1, and assuming a detection probability of 0. 5 we estimated a mean density of 3. 55 rails ha - 1. The probability of detecting occupancy from a single call playback survey at a marsh was high (mean = 0. 84), and the estimated proportion of marshes occupied (across all years) was 0. 58. The proportion of sites occupied by Black Rails in the foothills remained relatively stable from 2002 - 2006 despite turnover from year to year of specific sites. Irrigation ditches were the primary water source at 75 % of the marshes that had Black Rails. Approximately two-thirds of marshes with Black Rails were on private land. Black Rails are more widespread in the Sierra foothills than was previously known, and the foothills distribution appears to be discontinuous with populations in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. Occupancy surveys may be an improved method for monitoring population trends of this secretive marsh bird where habitat patches are highly fragmented. Two-species occupancy models that account for false absences provide a robust method for testing for evidence of competitive exclusion, but previous model parameterizations were inadequate for incorporating covariates. We present a new parameterization that is stable when covariates are included, the conditional two-species occupancy model, {{that can be used to}} examine alternative hypotheses for species' distribution patterns. This new model estimates the probability of occupancy for a subordinate species conditional upon the presence of a dominant species. It can also be used to test if the detection of either species differs when one or both species are present, and if detection of the subordinate species depends on the detection of the dominant species when both are present. We apply the model to test if the presence of the larger Virginia Rail affects probabilities of detection or occupancy of the smaller California Black Rail in small freshwater marshes that range in size from 0. 013 - 13. 99 ha. We hypothesized that Black Rail occupancy should be lower in small marshes when Virginia Rails are present than when they are absent, because resources are presumably more limited and interference competition should increase. We found that Black Rail detection probability was unaffected by the detection of Virginia Rails, while, surprisingly, Black and Virginia Rail occupancy were positively associated even in small marshes. The average probability of Black Rail occupancy was higher when Virginia Rails were present (0. 74 ± 0. 053) than when they were absent (0. 36 ± 0. 069), and for both species occupancy increased with marsh size. Our results contrast with recent findings from patchy forest systems, where small birds were presumed to be excluded from small habitat patches by larger competitors. Impacts of grazing are often magnified in aquatic environments where livestock congregate for shade, cooler temperatures, green forage and water. We assessed the impact of winter (November-May) cattle grazing on occupancy of California Black Rails inhabiting a network of freshwater marshes in the northern Sierra Nevada foothills of California. As marsh birds are difficult to detect, we collected repeated presence/absence data via call playback surveys and used the "random changes in occupancy" parameterization of a multi-season occupancy model to examine relationships between occupancy and covariates, while accounting for detection probability. Wetland vegetation cover was significantly lower at winter-grazed sites than at ungrazed sites during the grazing season in 2007 but not in 2008. Winter grazing had little effect on Black Rail occupancy at irrigated marshes. However, at non-irrigated marshes fed by natural springs and streams, winter-grazed sites had lower occupancy than ungrazed sites, especially at larger marsh sizes (> 0. 5 ha). Black Rail occupancy was positively associated with marsh area, irrigation as a water source and summer cover, and negatively associated with isolation. Residual dry matter (RDM), a commonly used metric of grazing intensity, may help to explain variation in summer wetland vegetation cover; however, <b>spring</b> <b>cover</b> was not well predicted by RDM. Accurate, transferable and efficient mapping procedures are needed for wetland inventory, assessment and monitoring. Wetland mapping is typically carried out using two types of inputs: (1) spectral reflectance data from imagery and (2) topographic/hydrologic data derived from digital elevation models (DEMs). Hybrid approaches that integrate remotely-sensed imagery with topographic data have shown improved wetland mapping accuracy in several studies. Here we evaluate the performance of nine topographic features (aspect, downslope flow distance to streams, elevation, horizontal distance to sinks, horizontal distance to streams, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope and topographic wetness index) on freshwater wetland classification accuracy in the Sierra foothills of California. To evaluate object-based classification accuracy we test both within-image and between-image predictions using six different classification schemes (naïve Bayes, the C 4. 5 decision tree classifier, k-nearest neighbors, boosted logistic regression, random forest, and a support vector machine classifier) in the classification software package Weka 3. 6. 2. Adding topographic features had mostly positive effects on classification accuracy for within-image tests, but mostly negative effects on accuracy for between-image tests. The topographic wetness index was the most beneficial topographic feature in both the within-image and between-image tests for distinguishing wetland objects from other "green" objects (irrigated pasture and woodland) and shadows. Our results suggest that there is a benefit to using a more complex index of topography than simple measures such as elevation for the goal of mapping small palustrine emergent wetlands, but this benefit, for the most part, has poor transferability when applied between image sections. Occupancy models provide a robust method for examining species-environment relationships when detection probability is imperfect. The Black Rail study system in the Sierra foothills provides a unique and valuable opportunity for examining the effects of interspecific competition and grazing on a threatened subspecies at a regional scale. Further development of wetland mapping procedures will allow for a more complete description of the distribution of this rare and enigmatic marsh bird...|$|E
