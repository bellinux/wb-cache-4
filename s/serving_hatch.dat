25|$|As of April–May 2014 a major re-ordering is planned, so as {{to adapt}} the {{building}} for dual use as a church and a hall for hire to raise funds. This means that Barber's original pews are to be sold, and a new position must be found for the font. The planning application states that two windows will be removed {{on the south side}} of the nave, the sills will be dismantled, and the openings are to be retained for a kitchen <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> and an entry point for the extension. It is not known whether the toilet and kitchen, necessarily visible from the road, will be of sympathetic design. Barber's original polished deal floor, which still exists, may be replaced with other flooring. The church is expected therefore to lose its present completeness of original structure and furnishing by a major local architect. Because the new extension will necessitate re-plastering the western half of the south wall, any remaining original interior wall paintings still hidden under paint will be lost. Planning application no.13/00146/FUL for the extension was submitted on 18 January 2013 and has been granted. When the application was submitted, the Church Architect did not know of the building's date, its architect or its history.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Las Meninas relate to earlier works by Velázquez {{in which he}} plays with {{conventions}} of representation. In the Rokeby Venus—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although [...] "often described as looking at herself, [...] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early Christ in the House of Martha and Mary of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are {{clear that this is}} the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of Los Borrachos of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god Bacchus and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early bodegones, the figures look directly at the viewer as if seeking a reaction.|$|E

50|$|When {{originally}} {{aired on}} ITV, it was 25 minutes 28 seconds long, {{but since the}} death of Diana, Princess of Wales on 31 August 1997, the part of Act 3 where Bean decapitates her picture whilst cutting a new <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> has been cut for some broadcasts, only showing Prince Charles, whose head Bean cuts through with the jigsaw.|$|E
50|$|The {{public house}} was {{originally}} {{built in the}} 18th century {{as a pair of}} cottages. In 1776 it became 'The Sloop', an alehouse with connections to smuggling. In approximately 1830 the landlord, Charles Bower, changed the name to the Square and Compass, as he had been a stonemason. It was bought by Charlie Newman in 1907, great-grandfather of the current proprietor of the same name. At the time it included oil lamps, no running water or flushing toilets and no bar counter. The lights are now powered by electricity and there is running water, but there is still no bar counter - drinks are served through two <b>serving</b> <b>hatches.</b>|$|R

500|$|The hall is {{accessed}} {{from the}} courtyard via a stair up to a triangular lobby, {{which in turn}} links the hall and kitchens by means of two large <b>serving</b> <b>hatches</b> with elliptical arches, unusual for this period. The kitchen tower, virtually a tower house in its own right, is [...] by [...] The vaulted kitchen is on the hall level, above a cellar. One of the best-appointed castle kitchens in Scotland of its date, it has an oven and a [...] wide fireplace. A stair turret, added in 1581 and possibly replacing a timber stair, leads up from the lobby to two storeys of guest rooms. These include the [...] "Royal Apartments", a suite of two bedrooms plus an audience chamber, suitable for royal visitors.|$|R
50|$|The kitchen also retains many {{original}} features including: a sink with legs, sideboard, the <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> and stove recess, and {{the linoleum}} floor covering with its cardboard backing. Metal bracing {{for a hot}} water service is mounted high on a wall. Similar panelling to that used in the bathroom lines the stove recess and the splashback between the sink-top and window sill.|$|E
50|$|The brick building, with a slate roof, {{was granted}} grade II listed status, {{offering}} protection from unauthorised alteration or demolition, in March 1990. The largely intact 1930s interior has six public rooms. Other notable architectural features include a terrazzo-tiled corridor floor, moulded ceiling, original 1930s urinals and the <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> through which {{people in the}} two rear rooms acquire beer from the front bar.|$|E
50|$|On the {{opposite}} side is the large west hall, accessed {{by means of a}} gateway and covered by a pointed barrel vault. This hall, probably used for housing and dining by the soldiers and service personal, was heated by two massive fireplaces and connected to the kitchen {{on the south side of}} the ground floor by a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> and to the kitchen on the northwest of the floor above by a staircase.|$|E

50|$|An Edwardian {{photograph}} {{shows the}} hall with a billiard table, upholstered bobbin-turned chairs, two wicker chairs and a Glastonbury armchair. The entrance hall was converted into a kitchen in 1945. The archway blocked, the screen dismantled, panelling removed and an internal window made into a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch.</b> Only the fireplace and geometrical ceiling were left intact. The room was later made into a study. In 1986 the screen was reconstructed, surviving woodwork re-installed and missing pieces re-carved and some stonework was repaired.|$|E
5000|$|To {{prove himself}} a dab hand at {{whatever}} {{he turned his}} hand to, Stan installed a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> between the kitchen/living room and the front room, but goofed and made it {{big enough for a}} canteen. Hilda liked the hatch, but pointed out that she had little use for it, as they never used the front room anyway. He also ruined Hilda's precious Alpine [...] "muriel" [...] that covered one entire living room wall when he fell asleep in the bath and overflowed water seeped through the floor.|$|E
5000|$|However, the 1960s changed that, with Hygena and Allied Iron Foundries {{in their}} Leisure Lineline range {{introducing}} the wider use of Formica. Until this point, kitchens were either made of metal, and hence polished, or wood and hence {{needed to be}} painted. The introduction of formica meant that no longer was there a need to paint or repaint your [...] "new" [...] kitchen, just use it. Secondly, formica was easy clean, and although most new houses incorporated a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> between kitchen and dining room, more and more families were adopting to the American kitchen diner concept.|$|E
50|$|Hatch {{was later}} {{among those who}} served as a missionary among the Navajo, basing his efforts out of Ramah, New Mexico. In 1871 <b>Hatch</b> <b>served</b> as Erastus Snow's {{interpreter}} during a visit to the Navajo.|$|R

50|$|One of {{its best}} known {{landmarks}} is the pub, The Blue Ship. The pub itself has a main bar {{that dates back to}} the 15th century although the exterior of the pub is Victorian. Hall and Woodhouse beer is <b>served</b> from two <b>hatches</b> straight from the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The current station {{building}} {{was built in}} the late 1980s. The previous and original station building had a prominent tall chimney stack for the station master's coal fire which brought the top of the chimney above platform level. The station itself is constructed on an incline and the ticket office area of the track is raised on an embankment so the chimney was very prominent. The interior of the original station consisted of a large ticket hall with the station master's office and <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> on the left hand side (From the entrance). A tunnel in front of you led to the stairs to the Cheshunt bound platform. This tunnel was used in the rebuild. To the right were the stairs to the Liverpool Street platform. The stairwells were also reused in the rebuild but the concrete steps were replaced with steel ones.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of other shafts on the sett and one of these to the south west is called Flat Rod Shaft. This seems to {{indicate}} that the shaft had pumps operated by flat rods from one of the engine houses, possibly the one at New Engine Shaft. There is another building at the mine which is worthy of examination and this is the small round powder house to the east of the road. It consists of two concentric circular stone walls with a roof which enclosed the whole. The outer wall has a door and the inner wall a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch,</b> allowing for one way movement of miners collecting explosives. The building is in an advanced state of decay and the drawing is a reconstruction. Although a pointed roof is shown, it is possible that it had a flat sloping roof.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 {{after leaving}} school, Grandad {{got a job}} as a {{decorator}} working for the Council, but was sacked after two days for wallpapering over a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch.</b> He then began working as a lamplighter for the London Gas Light and Coke Company, and trained as a chef at the Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, but by the 1930s, he was unemployed and living with his parents and his brothers, George, Albert, and Jack, in Peabody Buildings, Peckham Rye. In 1936, he and his friend Nobby Clarke ran away to Tangier to join the French Foreign Legion, they were however unsuccessful and ended up working becoming gun runners during the Spanish Civil War. They were caught by the authorities. Nobby was tortured but Grandad chose to confess everything under interrogation. Both were deported from Spain and all her territories and dominions. He returned to Peckham and joined the dole queues, marrying his wife Violet sometime before the war, and fathering a son, Reg.|$|E

50|$|To {{have this}} rough {{treatment}} for lengthy periods twice within twenty-five years was an experience {{from which the}} Smith scarcely recovered. The paintings had to be crammed into the museum spaces to leave the two large galleries free for troop accommodation. There were no washing facilities, even for the eating utensils of the troops. Food was <b>served</b> through <b>hatches</b> burst in the west wall, from a field kitchen erected in the grounds. The wrought iron railings {{were removed from the}} front of the building to aid the war effort in the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pseudonym}} [...] "Marie Kelvedon" [...] {{was based}} on the village of Kelvedon Hatch, where Kane grew up. Kane included the following fictitious biography in the programme notes: Marie Kelvedon is twenty-five. She grew up in Germany in British Forces accommodation and returned to Britain at sixteen to complete her schooling. She was sent down from St Hilda's College, Oxford, after her first term, for an act of unspeakable Dadaism in the college dining hall. She has had her short stories published in various European literary magazines and has a volume of poems Onzuiver ('Impure') published in Belgium and Holland. Her Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut was in 1996, a spontaneous happening through a <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> to an audience of one. Since leaving Holloway she has worked as a mini-cab driver, a roadie with the Manic Street Preachers and as a continuity announcer for BBC Radio World Service.

50|$|Rectangular in plan, {{the ground}} floor {{contains}} an engine room, watchroom, dormitory, kitchen, bathroom and recreation room. Tall, vertical, timber, bifold, counterweighted doors to School Road open into the engine room around which the other rooms are arranged in an L-shape. The concrete floor to the engine room has been painted green but the red fire engine guide tracks are evident {{in areas where the}} paint has worn. The watchroom is {{at the front of the}} Station off the engine room and opens into the adjacent dormitory. The fireman's pole terminated in a small hall in the centre of the building to the rear of the engine room. The pole has been removed. The kitchen, bathroom and dormitory open off this hall. The recreation room is to the rear of the Station off the engine room and opening to the rear yard. All ground floor rooms are lined with tongue and groove boarding and have fibro sheeted battened ceilings. The dormitory contains built-in timber cupboards and tilting fanlights to the engine room wall. The bathroom could not be unlocked but a terrazzo floor was evident under the closed door. A <b>serving</b> <b>hatch</b> has been cut into the wall between the kitchen and the recreation room.|$|E
