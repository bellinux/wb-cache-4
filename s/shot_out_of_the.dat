5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky to strike and humble {{the pride of}} the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Nicklaus {{finished}} second to Curtis Strange in the Canadian Open, which marked his seventh and final second-place finish in that tournament; {{this is a}} record for that event.

25|$|McCulloch {{commanded}} the Confederate right wing at the Battle of Pea Ridge (or Elkhorn Tavern), Arkansas, and on March 7, 1862, after much maneuvering his troops overran a key Union artillery battery. Union resistance stiffened {{late in the}} morning, however, and as McCulloch rode forward to scout out enemy positions, he was <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saddle and died instantly. McCulloch always disliked army uniforms and was wearing a black velvet civilian suit and Wellington boots {{at the time of}} his death. Credit for the fatal shot was claimed by sharpshooter Peter Pelican of the 36th Illinois Infantry.|$|E
50|$|Playing in his twentieth Open, 42-year-old Darren Clarke shot an even-par 70 in {{the final}} round to win his first major {{championship}} by three shots. Phil Mickelson, 41, began the day tied for seventh and five <b>shots</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead. He charged to a 30 (−5) on the front nine, equalling his lowest nine-hole stretch in a major. Mickelson made eagle on the 7th hole to tie for the lead and added a birdie on the 10th to move to 6-under for the day. Clarke, the 54-hole leader {{in the final}} pairing a half-hour back, countered with his own eagle on the 7th to open up a two shot lead. A short missed par putt stalled Mickelson's momentum, and he faded on the back nine with three further bogeys to finish with a 68 (−2), tied for second with Dustin Johnson. Johnson, playing with Clarke, also made a strong challenge, and was two <b>shots</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead on <b>the</b> tee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> par-5 14th hole. Johnson tried to reach the green with a 2 iron from the fairway, but pushed it right and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds to end his chances with a double-bogey seven to fall four back. This gave Clarke a four-stroke cushion over his nearest rivals with four holes to play, and he cruised to victory even despite bogeys on his final two holes.|$|R
50|$|Simons is {{probably}} best remembered for nearly winning the U.S. Open in 1971 as an amateur. At <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 21, he shot a third-round 65 to take a two-shot lead after 54 holes at Merion Golf Club near Philadelphia. That set up <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> Simons becoming <b>the</b> first amateur to win the event since Johnny Goodman in 1933. A stroke <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead on the final hole, his tee shot found the rough and he double bogeyed. Simons carded a 76 to finish tied for fifth, three <b>shots</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monday playoff, won by Lee Trevino.|$|R

25|$|In January 1862, Union General George H. Thomas {{began to}} advance on George B. Crittenden's {{position}} at Mill Springs. In rainy conditions, Thomas' army moved slowly, and Crittenden advanced {{to meet them}} before they could be reinforced by forces from nearby Somerset. The battle commenced on January 19, 1862, and favored Crittenden's forces early on. However, in the confusion caused by the rain and fog, Felix Zollicoffer, commander of Crittenden's First Brigade, rode into {{the midst of the}} Union forces. A Confederate officer galloped in, yelling at Zollicoffer to inform him of his mistake. Upon being identified, Zollicoffer was <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saddle and killed, disheartening the Confederates and turning the tide of the battle. Thomas' reinforcements arrived, and Crittenden's forces were forced to retreat across the flooded Cumberland River. Many drowned in the process, and Crittenden was given the blame for the debacle.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1880s {{there was}} no more prey for the wolf or other carnivores: all game animals had been <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Hills and the Great Plains by hunters. Wolves and other hunting animals were {{themselves}} being hunted into extinction. In 1911, 55 gray wolves were killed in the South Dakota Black Hills, with bounties paid. In 1915, 8 more were killed; in 1916, 5 more. A pregnant wolf and her four pups were killed in 1917, and what was possibly her mate was killed in 1920. Without the buffalo and other game to prey on, wolves had to adapt to changing circumstances; they did so by attacking livestock. Many wolves were simply poisoned with strychnine; others were shot in a large federally funded eradication program, which between 1915 and 1920 employed over 300 hunters, who killed a staggering number of animals: 110,000 coyotes, 15,000 bobcats and lynxes, 3,000 wolves. Counting those killed by poison, the total exceeded 250,000.|$|E

500|$|The Huolongjing also {{describes}} and {{illustrates the}} oldest known multistage rocket; {{this was the}} [...] "fire-dragon issuing from the water" [...] (huo long chu shui), which {{was known to be}} used by the Chinese navy. It was a two-stage rocket that had carrier or booster rockets that would automatically ignite a number of smaller rocket arrows that were <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front end of the missile, which was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth, before eventually burning out. This multistage rocket is considered by some historians to be the ancestor of modern cluster munitions.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bedroom and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} and we had a great time working out how to do it," [...] Joel said. [...] "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "facehugger" [...] and its proboscis, {{which was}} made of a sheep's intestine, were <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> egg using {{high-pressure}} air hoses. The shot was reversed and slowed down in editing to prolong the effect and reveal more detail. The facehugger itself was the first creature that H.R. Giger designed for the film, going through several versions in different sizes before deciding on a small creature with humanlike fingers and a long tail. Dan O'Bannon, with help from Ron Cobb, drew his own version based on Giger's design, which became the final version. Cobb {{came up with the}} idea that the creature could have a powerful acid for blood, a characteristic that would carry over to the adult Alien and would make it impossible for the crew to kill it by conventional means such as guns or explosives, since the acid would burn through the ship's hull. For the scene in which the dead facehugger is examined, Scott used pieces of fish and shellfish to create its viscera.|$|E

500|$|Rocket boosters: An {{illustration}} {{and description}} in the 14th century Chinese military treatise [...] Huolongjing by the Ming dynasty military writer and philosopher Jiao Yu shows the oldest known multistage rocket with rocket boosters. The Huolongjing describes and illustrates the oldest known multistage rocket. It was a two-stage rocket that had carrier or booster rockets that would automatically ignite {{a number of}} smaller rocket arrows that were <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{front end of the}} missile, which was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth, before eventually burning out. This multi-stage rocket may be considered the ancestor to the modern YingJi-62 ASCM. The British scientist, sinologist, and historian Joseph Needham points out that the written material and depicted illustration of this rocket come from the oldest stratum of the Huolongjing, which can be dated roughly from 1300–1350 AD. Solid rocket boosters finds its roots in the Chinese invented fire arrows invented during the medieval Song dynasty more than 1000 years ago, using gunpowder as solid rocket propellants. Gunpowder was packed into a bamboo case cylinder and an opening was created on the cylinders other end. As the gunpowder was ignited, it began to burn rapidly and created large amounts of gas that would rush out to create thrust.|$|E
500|$|... "Simpson Tide" [...] {{was one of}} two season nine episodes {{that was}} {{executive}} produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who together were the showrunners for the third and fourth seasons. Although Jean would later return to run the show the following season, it was the last episode that Reiss received an executive producer credit for. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, the episode writers, were working on Jean and Reiss's show The Critic at the time, and pitched an episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserve. Although the episode is partly based on the film Crimson Tide, the original episode pitch was made before the film was released. After the release of the film, the writers decided to start incorporating things from the movie in the script. In the original draft, Bart sneaked on board the submarine with Homer. They were trying to do it [...] "for the comedy of it", but could not get the draft to work, so it was cut. It was difficult for them {{to figure out how to}} get the captain off of the sub and they eventually decided to have him <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torpedo tube, which in the DVD commentary, Al Jean says that Steiger claimed that he really did get stuck in a torpedo tube once.|$|E
500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, <b>shot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to anyone who would listen – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{primarily}} a quiz show, there were occasional digressions; for example, on the premiere episode two contestants {{playing in a}} golf category, in lieu of answering questions, were asked to make a specific shot on a miniature driving range {{that had been set}} up in the studio.
