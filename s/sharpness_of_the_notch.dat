40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a novel elasto-plastic reformulation of the Theory of Critical Distances (TCD) specifically devised to estimate lifetime of notched metallic materials (ferrous and nonferrous) failing in the low/medium-cycle fatigue regime. We used the classic Manson–Coffin and Smith–Topper–Watson approaches, but applied {{in conjunction with the}} TCD. We assumed that the material’s critical distance is a constant whose value does not depend on either the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> or on the number of cycles to failure. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed approach was checked by using a number of experimental results generated by testing cylindrical specimens made of En 3 B, which is a commercial low-carbon steel, and Al 6082, which is a conventional aluminum alloy, containing different geometrical features and tested at applied load ratios of R=- 1 and R= 0. The resulting predictions of fatigue life were highly accurate, giving estimates falling within an error factor (in lifetime) of about 2. This result is undoubtedly encouraging, {{especially in light of the}} fact that the pieces of experimental information needed to calibrate our method can easily be generated by using standard testing equipment, and the necessary stress/strain fields acting on the fatigue process zone can be determined by directly postprocessing elasto-plastic finite element results...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formulation of an elasto-plastic strain based approach suitable for assessing fatigue strength of notched components subjected to in-service variable amplitude cyclic loading. The hypothesis is formed that the crack initiation plane is closely aligned with the plane of maximum shear strain amplitude, its orientation and the associated stress/strain quantities being determined using the Maximum Variance Method. Fatigue damage is estimated by applying the Modified Manson-Coffin Curve Method (MMCCM) along with the Point Method (PM). In the proposed approach, the required critical distance is treated as a material property whose value is not affected either by the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> being assessed or by the profile of the load spectrum being applied. The detrimental effect of non-zero mean stresses and degree of multiaxiality of the local stress/strain histories is also considered. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed design methodology was checked against several experimental data taken from the literature and generated under different uniaxial variable amplitude load histories. In order to determine the required local stress/strain states, refined elasto-plastic finite element models were solved using commercial software ANSYS®. This preliminary validation exercise allowed us to prove that the proposed approach is capable of estimates laying within an error factor of about 2. These preliminary results are certainly promising, strongly supporting the idea that the proposed design strategy can successfully be used to assess the fatigue lifetime of notched metallic components subjected to in-service multiaxial variable amplitude loading sequences...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to compare <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notch,</b> as measured arthroscopically (2 -dimensionally), with <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> as measured by use of computed tomography (CT) (3 -dimensionally). Methods: For 20 cadaveric knees, <b>the</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> entrance were measured arthroscopically, and <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> volume was measured by use <b>of</b> CT. <b>The</b> correlation between <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> entrance and <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> volume was calculated. Intraobserver reliability and interobserver reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arthroscopic and CT measurements were tested. Results: The Pearson correlation coefficients between CT-assessed notch volume and arthroscopically assessed notch height and width at the bottom, middle, and top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> were 0. 603, 0. 506, 0. 551, and 0. 642, respectively. The intraobserver reliability and interobserver reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arthroscopic measurements were above 0. 962 and 0. 819, respectively, and 0. 983 and 0. 975, respectively, for the CT measurements.
