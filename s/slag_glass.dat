B(2) O(3) was added to a simulated waste slag to promote the phase separation. The <b>slag</b> <b>glasses</b> were heat-treated above glass transition temperatures, from which phase separation was successfully induced. The phase-separated <b>slag</b> <b>glasses</b> were still colored in black due to Fe ions, and after soaking in acid, they were successfully bleached, obtaining colorless solids. According to compositional analyses, no Fe ions were confirmed in the remaining insolubles, indicating that Fe ions were preferentially incorporated into the borate-rich phases soluble in acid. The main constituent of the colorless solids was SiO(2) and the end products obtained in the present process were expected as an alternative of pure silica glass...|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanical}} activation {{method for}} saving the accumulated waste energy (about 160 kWh/t) found in phosphogypsum was investigated and developed. The state of phosphogypsum {{in which it}} is disposed to stackpiles can not be used for production of construction materials due to the acidic admixtures present in it, which block its hydration and hardening processes, so new methods for neutralizing this negative effect were investigated. In earlier investigation, various energy consuming additives like Portland cement and lime were used, so the construction material products integral energy expenditures were high. <b>Slag</b> <b>glass</b> could be used for neutralization, hydration and hardening kinetic regulation of phosphogypsum acidic admixtures. The aim of this investigation was to determine the interaction of <b>slag</b> <b>glass</b> with the acidic admixtures present in phosphogypsum.

40|$|A {{chemical}} recycling process using phase separation of glass {{was applied to}} a granulated blast furnace slag with high CaO content. Glasses were prepared by adding B(2) O(3) to the slag {{in order to promote}} phase separation, and the glasses were heat-treated above glass transition temperature. In the subsequent acid-treatment, however, gelation due to the elution of SiO(2) phase containing CaO occurred, not obtaining high SiO(2) solids. Then, pretreatment was introduced to reduce CaO content in slag, where the raw slag was briefly washed in acid. The <b>slag</b> <b>glasses</b> prepared from the pretreated slag were commonly phase-separated by heat-treatment regardless of B(2) O(3) content. After subsequent acid-treatment, colorless insoluble solids were successfully recovered. The end products consist of 70 - 90 mass% SiO(2), and coloring ions such as Mn, Fe and Cr were almost completely removed from the <b>slag</b> <b>glasses.</b> Reutilization as raw materials for glass is expected...|$|R

Transparent and colorless solids containing ca. 80 mass% of SiO(2) were successfully obtained as residues. It was suggested that phase separation took place not in the heat-treatment but in the vitrification process, and further characterizations are however required to investigate the phenomena at microscopic levels in the recycling processes...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{recycling}} process of {{blast furnace slag}} was developed {{in order to obtain}} colorless silica－rich solids by using phase separation of borosilicate glass. B(2) O(3) was added to blast furnace slag to promote the phase separation. The slag glasses were heat-treated above glass transition temperatures. The <b>slag</b> <b>glass</b> prepared from blast furnace slag gelled after the heat treatment and the subsequent three types of acid treatment. The ratios of SiO(2) component in the gels were 40 - 60 mass%. On the other hand, phase separation was observed {{on the surface of the}} slag glasses prepared from pre-treated slag by 2. 5 N HCI after the heat treatment. After soaking in acid, they did not gel and changed to insoluble colorless solids. According to compositional analyses, it was found that the insoluble colorless solids contained 70 - 90 mass% SiO(2). No colored ions such as Cr, Mn, and Fe were confirmed in the remaining insolubles by optical absorption measurement. Therefore, the colorless silica-rich solids were successfully obtained in the present process. The end products obtained in the present process are expected as material of glass...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study the {{utilization}} of industrial by-products {{for the production of}} glass and glass-ceramics was examined. Three industrial wastes were selected due to their mass production: fly ash derived from the combustion of lignite, blast furnace slag from the production of Fe-Ni and blast furnace slag from the production of steel. The capability of the above materials to be vitrified and subsequently devitrified was investigated. Mixtures were obtained using the fly ash, <b>slag,</b> <b>glass</b> cullet, quartz and melting agents at the appropriate proportions and the vitrification process, which took place at 1350 - 1450 °C, was followed. Crystallization was achieved by heat treatment at 900, 950 and 1000 °C. The chemical durability and the stability of the raw materials {{as well as of the}} final products were determined using standard procedures. X-ray and Scanning Electron Microscopy techniques were employed to identify the microstructure of the stabilized products before and after the heat treatment.

Glasses containing spent {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) glass and low-level Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) wastes were produced and examined. Various natural raw materials (eudialyte, datolite concentrates, loam clay, sandstone) were added to NPP wastes to obtain <b>glasses</b> and glassy <b>slags</b> (<b>glass</b> crystalline materials) with low leachability. The NPP waste oxide content in the products reached 30 wt. % for RBMK and institutional wastes and 40 wt. % for boron-containing VVER waste. Joint vitrification of NPP waste, incinerator ash (<b>slag),</b> and CRT <b>glass</b> has also been demonstrated. Ash content in the glassy slags may reach 50 - 70 wt. %. The materials with appropriate compositions had low leaching of waste elements like conventional borosilicate glasses. The structure of the materials obtained was examined with X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, infra-red (IR) spectroscopy, and electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA). Liquid-liquid phase separation and crystallization effects were observed. Two of the glassy compositions were produced by cold crucible melting. Process parameters depend strongly on batch particles distribution in sizes. Milling of CRT glass breakage is required. The best results are reached by treatment of milled batch in an apparatus with a rotating magnetic field...|$|R

Because the requisites for acceptance in the Italian Specifications and Standards have been satisfied and given the positive mechanical performance (indirect tensile strength at 25 °C on dry and wet samples up to 1. 27 MPa and 1. 07 MPa respectively), it has been verified that the marginal aggregates investigated can be used as substitution of the lithic materials in the base courses, also with very high content (up to 70 % on the weight of the aggregates) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the strain-stress distribution (SSD) of porous glass (foamed <b>slag</b> <b>glass,</b> FSG) is assessed by annealing temperature curves according to the given values of the thermomechanical and thermophysical properties of porous glass, which are in correlation with the properties data of the host glass and its structure. When calculating cooling processes (cooling rate) of porous glass products, the A. N. Dauvalter's formula, which takes into account only the stresses arising from the safe product cooling, but {{does not take into}} account those that remained there to the cooling start point, is usually used. The cooling rate in the interval of the annealing zone itself should be sufficiently low so that residual stresses, arising after they pass it, have small values. Since methods, that make it possible to determine the residual stresses that appear in the porous glass after passing through the initial annealing zone, are currently poorly developed, numerical simulation methods should be used to determine the porous glass SSD under the influence of thermal loads. Numerical study of the strain-stress distribution of porous glass allowing for thermal loads in the annealing temperature range was carried out in the Ansys Workbench software package...|$|E

An economical viable {{solution to this}} problem should include utilization of waste materials for new products which in turn minimize the heavy burden on the nationâs landfills. Recycling of waste construction materials saves natural resources, saves energy, reduces solid waste, reduces air and water pollutants and reduces greenhouse gases. The construction industry can start being aware of and take advantage of the benefits of using waste and recycled materials.

The use of swine manure, animal fat, silica fume, roofing shingles, empty palm fruit bunch, citrus peels, cement kiln dust, fly ash, foundry sand, <b>slag,</b> <b>glass,</b> plastic, carpet, tire scraps, asphalt pavement and concrete aggregate in construction is becoming increasingly popular due to the shortage and increasing cost of raw materials. In this study a questionnaire survey targeting experts from construction industry was conducted in order to investigate the current practices of the uses of waste and recycled materials in the construction industry. This study presents an initial understanding of the current strengths and weaknesses of the practice intended to support construction industry in developing effective policies regarding uses of waste and recycled materials as construction materials...|$|E

X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) have been used for determination of mineralogical composition of particulates adhering to surfaces of biomass and occurring in the heavy mineral fraction of topsoils. Quantitative partitioning of contaminants within individual mineral phases has been determined using autoSEM; contaminants were mainly bound in the <b>slag</b> <b>glass</b> (As: 16. 7 %; Cu: 12. 7 %; Pb: 26. 2 %; Zn: 33. 9 % of total concentration) and in metal(loid) -rich Fe-hydroxides (As: 14. 4 %; Cu: 7. 7 %; Pb: 21. 6 %; Zn: 32. 5 %). On biomass- rich topsoil samples, we have experimentally proved that bushfires can be responsible for transformation and re-mobilization of contaminants.
