5|$|Planning began a {{month before}} the {{original}} Dragon Quest was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry. The artwork that was used {{as the basis for the}} characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included <b>students</b> <b>not</b> familiar with the coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, Dragon Quest III.|$|E
5|$|Rossier {{first arrived}} in Japan in 1859, {{at a time when}} early {{experiments}} in photography were being conducted in Kyūshū, particularly in Nagasaki. The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J.L.C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese <b>students</b> <b>not</b> only medicine but also chemistry and photography. Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.|$|E

5|$|The pagoda raids {{provoked}} widespread disquiet {{among the}} Saigonese. At midnight on 22 August, Generals Đôn, Đính and Khiêm informed Nhu that student demonstrations were planned for three consecutive days. They recommended that schools be closed, but when Nhu {{took them to}} see Diệm, the president refused to close the educational institutions. Diệm decided the <b>students,</b> <b>not</b> usually known for political activism, {{should be allowed to}} voice their opinions. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which was met with arrests, imprisonment, and the closure of the campus. These events were repeated at Huế University, which was likewise shut down.|$|E

30|$|As an example, I might {{hypothesize that}} {{attending}} full-day kindergarten increases a student’s reading proficiency because I can also envision a <b>student</b> <b>not</b> attending full-day kindergarten but rather attending part-day kindergarten. That is, I {{can set up}} a sensible counterfactual conditional statement of the sort “what if the <b>student</b> was <b>not</b> exposed to full-day kindergarten”. Rubin (1974) thus links exposability to counterfactual propositions {{and the idea of}} a hypothetical experiment.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Chinese and Indian {{students}} attending national schools, coupled with the increasing number of Malay students attending Chinese and Indian national-type schools, the government announced in April 2005 that all national schools will begin teaching Chinese and Tamil to attract more <b>students,</b> <b>not</b> as mother tongue courses but as elective courses.|$|E

25|$|Ashley was insistent {{that the}} course should provide a broad education, with <b>students</b> <b>not</b> only {{studying}} commerce but also languages and modern history.

25|$|Throughout its history, the University Honors College {{has never}} been a {{membership}} organization, instead allowing participation in its offerings to all motivated university students who have maintained a minimum grade point average.

Other continuing <b>students</b> <b>not</b> meeting such requirements may still gain special permission to take UHC classes, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the non-teaching staff {{organised}} {{a strike}} against the management (headed by then trustee of Parshvanath Charitable Trust – Mr. Tekchand Shah) for non-payment of their salaries. Due to the strike, classes were not held for several days. At the same time, the political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's local branch also held a movement on college campus against then vice-principal and applied chemistry lecturer Mr. S. D. Shah for alleged harassment of some female {{students and staff}} members. The students also protested against {{certain aspects of the}} college that made student life difficult. For example: absence of basic facilities like ceiling fans in classrooms, canteen for the college, etc.; certain college rules like <b>students</b> <b>not</b> being allowed to wear T-shirts (and punishments like college IDs being confiscated, fines of Rs 100 or more being imposed on <b>students</b> <b>not</b> obeying these rules, or found loitering outside class during lecture/practical hours). The events led to the arrest (and later release on bail) of Mr. S. D. Shah, change of the PCT trustee from Mr. Teckchand Shah to Mr. Ashok Bhai Shah, and change of the college principal from Dr. Ram Reddy to Dr. Uttam D. Kolekar. In the transition process, the college was managed by the state government of Maharashtra. Mr. S. D. Shah has not been working in the college since his arrest.|$|E
