25|$|Maynard {{took the}} {{railroad}} to St. Louis, {{and from there}} set out for California. He circulated among several wagon trains fighting cholera, which he had learned about during the 1849 epidemic in Cleveland. When the leader of one <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> train heading for Oregon Territory died, he assumed leadership and thus ended up on Puget Sound. He and widow Catherine Troutman Broshears (June 19, 1816 - Oct 20, 1906) fell in love during their journey; however her brother, Mike Simmons, refused them permission to marry, perhaps {{on the grounds that}} Maynard was still married.|$|E
500|$|To {{finance the}} venture, Rose sold the {{majority}} of his assets, and after paying off his debts was left with $30,000, then a considerable amount of money. These funds enabled him to finance an especially well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses, including two Morgan fillies and a Morgan stallion named Black Morrill; their combined value exceeded $3,000. He also purchased two hundred head of red Durham cattle, which he planned to resell in California for profit. To complete the train, Rose acquired four large ox-drawn prairie schooner style covered wagons, each required three yokes (i.e. six oxen) to pull each wagon. [...] Three wagons were loaded with supplies, and the fourth was used by Alpha Brown and his family. Rose's family traveled in a <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> that had once been used as an ambulance, which was pulled by a pair of mules.|$|E
2500|$|Scenery {{changes are}} {{sometimes}} made mid-scene, while the actors remain {{on stage and}} the curtain stays open. This is sometimes accomplished by using a Hiki Dōgu, or <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> stage. This technique originated {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century, where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform. Also common are stagehands rushing onto the stage adding and removing props, backdrops and other scenery; these kuroko (...) are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible. Stagehands also assist in a variety of quick costume changes known as hayagawari (quick change technique).|$|E

60|$|Near the {{old woman}} was a child playing upon the deck. Perhaps it was her grandchild. The child had a <b>small</b> <b>wagon,</b> which she was drawing about the deck. The wagon looked very much worn and soiled by long usage, but in other respects it resembled very much the little wagons that are drawn about by {{children}} in America.|$|E
60|$|Atlanta was {{destroyed}} {{so far as}} to render it worthless for military purposes before starting, Sherman himself remaining over a day to superintend the work, and see that it was well done. Sherman's orders for this campaign were perfect. Before starting, he had sent back all sick, disabled and weak men, retaining nothing but the hardy, well-inured soldiers to accompany him on his long march in prospect. His artillery was reduced to sixty-five guns. The ammunition carried with them was two hundred rounds for musket and gun. Small rations were taken in a <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> train, which was loaded to its capacity for rapid movement. The army was expected to live on the country, and to always keep the wagons full of forage and provisions against a possible delay of a few days.|$|E
60|$|In the stackyard, the summer's splendid monuments {{of wheat}} and grass were reared {{in gold and}} grey. The wheat was {{littered}} brightly round the rising stack. The loaded wagon clanked slowly up the incline, drew near, and rode like a ship at anchor against the scotches, brushing the stack with a crisp, sharp sound. Tom climbed the ladder and stood a moment there against the sky, amid the brightness and fragrance of the gold corn, and waved his arm to his wife who was passing {{in the shadow of}} the building. Then Arthur began to lift the sheaves to the stack, and the two men worked in an exquisite, subtle rhythm, their white sleeves and their dark heads gleaming, moving against the mild sky and the corn. The silence was broken only by the occasional lurch of the body of the wagon, as the teamer stepped to the front, or again to the rear of the load. Occasionally I could catch the blue glitter of the prongs of the forks. Tom, now lifted high above the <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> load, called to his brother some question about the stack. The sound of his voice was strong and mellow.|$|E

50|$|Since then, <b>smaller</b> <b>wagons</b> {{have been}} sold in the U.S. as less {{expensive}} alternatives to SUVs and minivans. Domestic wagons also remained in the Ford, Mercury, and Saturn lines until 2004 when the bodies began a phase-out, replaced by car-based crossover SUVs and minivans designed to look like station wagons.|$|R

50|$|The {{beginnings}} of the train in America were in 1831 when, {{in the small town}} of Albania, United States appeared the steam train. On August 9 of the same year, with the still primitive machine called “Bull” imported from England, was made the first journey of this locomotive that carried three <b>small</b> <b>wagons</b> with capacity for only 6 passengers each.|$|R

50|$|The 1904 Pope-Waverley Road <b>Wagon</b> was a <b>smaller</b> <b>wagon</b> model. It could seat 2 {{passengers}} {{with an open}} box at {{the rear}} for cargo and sold for US$850. The single electric motor was situated {{at the rear of}} the car and produced 3 hp (2.2 kW). The car used a 24-cell battery and could travel at 5 or 15 mph (8 or 24 km/h).|$|R
5000|$|Covered wagon: {{the name}} given to canvas-topped farm wagons used by North American {{settlers}} to move both {{their families and}} household goods westward. Varieties of this wagon include the Conestoga wagon (larger wagons able to carry large amounts of goods and primarily used on flat trails, for example the Santa Fe Trail) and prairie schooner (<b>smaller</b> <b>wagons</b> more suited for mountainous regions, for example the Oregon and California Trails).|$|R
50|$|The horses {{used are}} usually Tinkers, Fjords and Haflingers. A {{shoulder}} height between 1.40 and 1.45m is ideal. The horses {{should be of}} equal shoulder height, preferably have a long back and an even, calm tread. Training a team of horses usually takes a year.Smaller ponies are used for <b>small</b> <b>wagons,</b> {{but these are not}} suitable for bigger children or adults and the ponies do not have such a calm tread.|$|R
50|$|The very <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> fleet {{consisted}} {{of an unknown}} number of wagons of similar design to those used on the Ffestiniog Railway. Almost all the general freight and mineral traffic originated on or travelled to the FR using FR wagons. All slate traffic was destined for Porthmadog or Minffordd and it also travelled in FR slate wagons as did the output of all the other Ffestiniog Quarries.|$|E
50|$|In {{migration}} settings, {{such as the}} emigrant {{trails of}} the American West and the Great Trek of South Africa, wagons would travel together for support, navigation and protection. A group of wagons {{may be used to}} create an improvised fort called a laager, made by circling them to form an enclosure. In these settings, a chuckwagon is a <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> used for providing food and cooking, essentially a portable kitchen.|$|E
50|$|Britain's {{railways}} were nationalised in 1947 including goods operations. Under the 1954 British Rail Modernisation Plan, massive {{investment was}} made in marshalling yards {{at a time when}} the use of <b>small</b> <b>wagon</b> load traffic with which they dealt was in steep decline. Railway freight services had been in steady decline since the 1930s, initially because of the loss of the manufacturing industry and then road haulage's cost advantage in combination with higher wages.|$|E
50|$|The curved end wagons {{were all}} {{scrapped}} by the 1880s. The <b>smaller</b> capacity <b>wagons</b> were mostly rebuilt {{to a larger}} capacity between 1905 and 1910. They were then joined by the FF class, with the entire series being lettered F. This {{was made possible by}} the scrapping of the <b>smaller</b> capacity <b>wagons.</b> However, records between 1904 and 1914 are vague, and so it cannot be known which numbers had what done to them and when.|$|R
2500|$|Swivel casters are {{commonly}} used on <b>smaller</b> <b>wagons</b> because of the flexible, [...] mobility they offer. As the number of swivel casters attached to a wagon increases, though, it becomes increasingly difficult to align them. Consequently, {{it may be difficult}} or impossible to move a wagon that has a large number of swivel casters when the casters are unaligned. As a result, rigid casters are preferred for larger wagons, which typically require a proportionally higher number of casters.|$|R
50|$|Jose Abad Santos Avenue traces {{its roots}} to the pre-colonial period. The Kapampangan empire {{expanded}} their trades throughout Central Luzon, {{forcing them to}} create roads adjacent to the Pampanga River. Since Nueva Ecija, Bulacan and Rizal (Metro Manila) are readily accessible because the road networks to that locations exist, the empire could not access the province of Zambales and Bataan. Through the years, they developed land tracks accessible by foot and <b>small</b> <b>wagons</b> pulled by horses.|$|R
