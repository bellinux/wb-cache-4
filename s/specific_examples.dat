Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of <b>specific</b> <b>examples,</b> the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes.

They may also be involved in hearing impairment via cochlear damage induced by elevated sound levels, in ototoxicity of drugs such as cisplatin, and in congenital deafness in both animals and humans.

25|$|Fundamental {{results of}} computability theory {{show that there}} are {{functions}} that can be precisely defined but are not computable. Moreover, {{in the sense of}} cardinality, almost all functions from the integers to integers are not computable. The number of computable functions from integers to integers is countable, because the number of possible algorithms is. The number of all functions from integers to integers is higher: the same as the cardinality of the real numbers. Thus most functions from integers to integers are not computable. <b>Specific</b> <b>examples</b> of uncomputable functions are known, including the busy beaver function and functions related to the halting problem and other undecidable problems.|$|E

Bruxism can also be exacerbated by excessive consumption of caffeine, as in coffee, tea or chocolate. Bruxism has also been reported to occur commonly comorbid with drug addiction. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) {{has been reported to}} be associated with bruxism, which occurs immediately after taking the drug and for several days afterwards. Tooth wear in people who take ecstasy is also frequently much more severe than in people with bruxism not associated with ecstasy.|$|E

25|$|This {{equation}} {{was first}} studied extensively in India, starting with Brahmagupta, {{who developed the}} chakravala method to solve Pell's equation and other quadratic indeterminate equations in his Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta in 628, about a thousand years before Pell's time. His Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta was translated into Arabic in 773 and was subsequently translated into Latin in 1126. Bhaskara II in the 12th century and Narayana Pandit in the 14th century both found general solutions to Pell's equation and other quadratic indeterminate equations. Solutions to <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> of the Pell equation, such as the Pell numbers arising from the equation with n = 2, had been known for much longer, {{since the time of}} Pythagoras in Greece and to a similar date in India. The name of Pell's equation arose from Leonhard Euler's mistakenly attributing Lord Brouncker's solution of the equation to John Pell.|$|E
25|$|Stochastic {{processes}} {{may be used}} {{in music}} to compose a fixed piece or may be produced in performance. Stochastic music was pioneered by Iannis Xenakis, who coined the term stochastic music. <b>Specific</b> <b>examples</b> of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in Pithoprakta, statistical distribution of points on a plane in Diamorphoses, minimal constraints in Achorripsis, the normal distribution in ST/10 and Atrées, Markov chains in Analogiques, game theory in Duel and Stratégie, group theory in Nomos Alpha (for Siegfried Palm), set theory in Herma and Eonta, and Brownian motion in N'Shima. Xenakis frequently used computers to produce his scores, such as the ST series including Morsima-Amorsima and Atrées, and founded CEMAMu. Earlier, John Cage and others had composed aleatoric or indeterminate music, which is created by chance processes but does not have the strict mathematical basis (Cage's Music of Changes, for example, uses a system of charts based on the I-Ching). Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson used generative grammars and Markov chains in their 1957 Illiac Suite. See: Generative music.|$|E

The eunuchs {{attempted to}} slander Zhang, who responded with a fu rhapsody called [...] "Fu on Pondering the Mystery", which vents his frustration. Rafe de Crespigny states that Zhang's rhapsody used imagery similar to Qu Yuan's (340–278BC) poem [...] "Li Sao" [...] and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it.|$|E
500|$|Whorf is {{best known}} as the main proponent of what he called the {{principle}} of linguistic relativity, but which is often known as [...] "the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis", named for him and Edward Sapir.

But because Whorf, in his articles, gave <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> of how he saw the grammatical categories of specific languages related to conceptual and behavioral patterns, he pointed towards an empirical research program that has been taken up by subsequent scholars, and which is often called [...] "Sapir-Whorf studies".|$|E
500|$|A {{review by}} Eric Anderson of Bowling Green State University in the Journal of Popular Culture praised the author's use of {{interviews}} throughout the book, writing that it [...] "...shines with McLeod's broad use of interviews... records and reports {{the voices of}} creative {{people who have been}} encumbered by the contemporary intellectual property regime. The incorporation of these interviews, demonstrating as they do <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> of creativity obstructed in specific ways, is this book's most important contribution." [...] Anderson said the book is [...] "an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture." [...] Anderson mentions McLeod's and the book's publisher's uncommon tactic of making the book freely available via a Creative Commons license.|$|E
