50|$|Finally, nanostructured {{materials}} with <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> such as zeolites, and asbestos, {{are used as}} catalysts {{in a wide range}} of critical industrial chemical reactions. The further development of such catalysts can form the basis of more efficient, environmentally friendly chemical processes.|$|E
50|$|Good flow {{properties}} of granules and powders {{are important in}} the manufacturing of tablets and capsules. The distribution of particles should be uniform in terms of number and weight. Very <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> causes attraction, which in turn destabilises the suspension by coagulating.|$|E
50|$|Explosive {{velocity}} {{is increased}} with <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> (i.e. increased spatial density), increased charge diameter, and increased confinement (i.e. higher pressure).|$|R
30|$|The {{crystalline}} structure presented by cellulose after pre-treatment is also {{correlated with the}} biomass <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> used. As referred above, transformation from cellulose I to cellulose II could be observed using [emim][CH 3 COO]. In the pre-treatment of cotton stalk with this IL, Bahcegul et al. demonstrated by XRD analysis that this phenomenon could only be observed for the <b>smallest</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> studied (<[*] 0.15  mm) [64]. Therefore, it can be inferred that <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> are more appropriate to obtain pre-treated samples with higher enzymatic digestibility.|$|R

50|$|The {{protein is}} {{partially}} coagulated by heat, creating a micro dispersion, {{in a process}} known as microparticulation. It is due to the <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of the protein that we perceive the dispersion as a fluid with similar creaminess and richness of fat.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{filtration}} {{is typically}} selected for feeds containing {{a high proportion}} of <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> solids (where the permeate is of most value) because solid material can quickly block (blind) the filter surface with dead-end filtration. Industrial examples of this include the extraction of soluble antibiotics from fermentation liquors.|$|E
50|$|Resistant starch has a <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> white appearance, bland {{flavor and}} low water-holding capacity. Resistant starch {{typically}} replaces flour in {{foods such as}} bread and other baked goods, pasta, cereal and batters because it can produce foods with similar color and texture of the original food. It has also been used for its textural properties in imitation cheese.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{cyanogen chloride}} (CK) filtration performance and airflow resistance of adsorbent beds {{consisting of two}} ASZM-TEDA Carbon layers of different <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> Adsorbent <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> affects filter performance in two ways: (1) <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> results in increased chemical vapor breakthrough time and (2) larger <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> results in lower airflow resistance. CK {{was used as a}} basis for assessing filtration performance because it is a design-limiting agent for NBC filters. The results of the study showed that ASZM-TEDA Carbon beds consisting of an inlet layer of larger <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> followed by a layer of <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> provided a superior trade-off of filtration performance and airflow resistance...|$|R
30|$|Improved {{performance}} of sample Ar 3 {{as compared to}} Ar 1 and Ar 2 is probably because of <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and homogeneous distribution of platinum nano particles.|$|R
50|$|The {{small size}} of {{nanoparticles}} leads to several characteristics that may enhance remediation. Nanomaterials are highly reactive because of their high surface area per unit mass. Their <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> also allows nanoparticles to enter small pores in soil or sediment that larger particles might not penetrate, granting them access to contaminants sorbed to soil and increasing the likelihood of contact with the target contaminant.|$|E
50|$|Solvent {{evaporation}} {{is another}} effective method to prepare nanocapsules. In this process, single or double emulsions are formed from solvents {{and are used}} to formulate a nanoparticle suspension. High speed homogenization or ultrasonication is used to form <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> in the nanoparticle suspension. Once the suspension is stable, the solvents are evaporated using either continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature, or by reducing the ambient pressure.|$|E
50|$|Haze machines, {{also called}} haze {{generators}} or hazers, produce atmospheric effects (haze) {{which tend to}} be less dense than that of fog machines, allowing them to be used in creating more subtle looks. Depending on a venue's or location's ventilation, this haze can stay in the air for hours.Because of the <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of the output from hazers, under 5 micrometres, a hazer typically takes longer to fill the same volume of space with a visible effect relative to a fog machine.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{anhydrous}} lactose <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution on its {{performance in the}} wet granulation process was evaluated. Three grades of anhydrous lactose {{were used in the}} study: “as is” manufacturer grade and 2 <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> fractions obtained by screening of the 60 M lactose. Particle growth behavior of the 3 lactose grades was evaluated in a high shear mixer. Compactibility and porosity of the resulting granules were also evaluated. A uniaxial compression test on moist agglomerates of the 3 lactose grades was performed in an attempt to explain the mechanism of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> effect observed in the high shear mixer. Particle growth of anhydrous lactose in the high shear mixer was inversely related to the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of the starting material. In addition, granulation manufactured using the grade with the <b>smallest</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> was more porous and demonstrated enhanced compactibility compared with the other grades. Compacts with similar porosity and low liquid saturation demonstrated brittle behavior and their breakage strength was inversely related to lactose <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> in the uniaxial compression test, suggesting that material with <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> may exhibit more pronounced nucleation behavior during wet granulation. On the other hand, compacts prepared at higher liquid saturation and similar compression force exhibited more plastic behavior and showed lower yield stress for the grade with <b>smallest</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> The lower yield stress of compacts prepared with this grade may indicate a higher coalescence tendency for its granules during wet granulation...|$|R
50|$|Some {{examples}} of granular materials are snow, nuts, coal, sand, rice, coffee, corn flakes, fertilizer and ball bearings. Powders are a special class of granular material {{due to their}} <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> which makes them more cohesive and more easily suspended in a gas. Granular materials are commercially important in applications as diverse as pharmaceutical industry, agriculture, and energy production. Research into granular materials is thus directly applicable and goes {{back at least to}} Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, whose law of friction was originally stated for granular materials.|$|E
50|$|Vernal pools {{can form}} {{anywhere}} that a depression fills with water. They {{can be found}} on bedrock of many kinds, or in grasslands that form over a variety of soil types containing silts and clays. They can develop hydric soils which are typical of flooded areas, including accumulations of organic matter, but this may not happen in drier areas. In some cases there is a hard pan layer which causes the retention of water in the pools.The hardpan clay basin accumulates water due to the <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and therefore reduced porosity. This permits flooding and development of vernal pools.|$|E
50|$|In the {{application}} method, formerly {{assumed to be}} the only one used for faience glazing; silica, lime and alkalis are ground in the raw state to a <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> thus mixed in water to form a slurry which is then applied to the quartz core. Partial fritting of the slurry favors the first stages of vitrification, which in turn lowers the final firing temperature. The slurry can be then applied to the body, through brushing or dipping, to create a fine, powdery coating. Upon firing, the water from the melting glaze partially diffuses in the sand body, sintering the quartz particles and thus creating some solid bridges in the body.|$|E
30|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> {{and surface}} area are the {{effective}} parameters of photocatalytic activity of nanomaterials. In our previous work, we {{revealed that the}} nano-TiO 2 has <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and higher surface area than the nano-SrTiO 3 [23]. Therefore, photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the nano-TiO 2 {{is more than the}} nano-SrTiO 3 (Figure  1 A,B).|$|R
50|$|MRP {{also can}} improve the sustainability, {{and in some cases}} the performance, of the {{compounds}} in which it is used.

Yttrium aluminum garnet or YAG (Y3Al5O12) doped with rare earth metals (Ce3+, Pr3+, or Nd3+) can be produced through LF-FSP, which have phosphor and laser applications. YAG doped with rare earth metals, Nd:YAG for example, show electron pump lasing behavior. The <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of the rare earth metals provide optical feedback. YAG has been studied because of their high temperature mechanical strength and photonic properties. The development of YAG nanopowders that are easily sintered to full density and transparency have been studied because transparent polycrystalline YAG lasers outperform single crystal YAG lasers.|$|E
50|$|Two main issues {{need to be}} {{addressed}} with respect to the oxidizer if one is using potassium nitrate. The most important issue is the purity of the material. If a purchased material does not perform satisfactorily {{it may be necessary to}} recrystallize the KNO3. The second important issue with respect to the oxidizer portion of a propellant is its particle size. Most propellant makers prefer their KNO3 ground to a <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> such as 100 mesh (about 150 µm) or smaller. This can be done using a coffee grinder. Rock-tumblers can also be used to mill into a fine grained well mixed powder.|$|E
50|$|Toner {{particles}} have electrostatic properties {{by design}} and can develop static-electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum cleaner hoses. Because {{of this and}} the <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> toner should not be vacuumed with a conventional home vacuum cleaner. Static discharge from charged toner particles theoretically may ignite dust in the vacuum cleaner bag or create a small explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by household vacuum cleaner filter bags and can blow through the vacuum motor into the room. So they also can cause overheat by clogging the motor filter and short circuit by their electric conductivity (carbon, iron) when they melt inside the motor.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{including}} a hydrophilic coating around the particles are studied {{across a wide}} range of <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> by performing Monte Carlo simulations of protons diffusing through a system of magnetic particles. A physically realistic methodology of implementing the coating by cross boundary jump scaling and transition probabilities at the coating surface is developed. Using this formulation, the coating has three distinct impacts on the relaxation rate: an enhancement at <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes,</b> a degradation at intermediate <b>particle</b> <b>sizes,</b> and no effect at large <b>particles</b> <b>sizes.</b> These varied effects are reconciled with the underlying dephasing mechanisms by using the concept of a full dephasing zone to present a physical picture of the dephasing process with and without the coating for all sizes. The enhancement at <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> is studied systemically to demonstrate the existence of an optimal ratio of diffusion coefficients inside/outside the coating to achieve maximal increase in the relaxation rate.

30|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in mineral dissolution reaction because, theoretically, a <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> will result in faster dissolution and will increase the availability of divalent metal cations. On the contrary, reducing the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> will require additional energy in the over-all process, and the enhancement may or may not be sufficient to compensate for the additional energy input [10, 12].|$|R
50|$|Sand is a {{sediment}} {{made from}} small grains or particles with diameters between about 60 µm and 2 mm. Mud (see mudflats below) is a sediment made from particles finer than sand. This <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> means that mud particles tend to stick together, whereas sand particles do not. Mud {{is not easily}} shifted by waves and currents, and when it dries out, cakes into a solid. By contrast, sand is easily shifted by waves and currents, and when sand dries out it can be blown in the wind, accumulating into shifting sand dunes. Beyond the high tide mark, if the beach is low-lying, the wind can form rolling hills of sand dunes. Small dunes shift and reshape {{under the influence of}} the wind while larger dunes stabilise the sand with vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{acids in}} soil are {{relatively}} weak, agricultural limestones must be {{ground to a}} <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> to be effective. The extension service of different states rate the effectiveness of stone size particles slightly differently. They all agree, however, that the smaller the particle size the more effective the stone is at reacting in the soil. Measuring the size of particles {{is based on the}} size of a mesh that the limestone would pass through. The mesh size is the number of wires per inch. Stone retained on an 8 mesh will be about the size of BB pellets. Material passing a 60 mesh screen will have the appearance of face powder. Particles larger than 8 mesh are of little or no value, particles between 8 mesh and 60 mesh are somewhat effective and particles smaller than 60 mesh are 100 percent effective.|$|E
50|$|Cyrogenic grinding, {{also known}} as freezer milling, freezer grinding, and cryomilling, is the act of cooling or {{chilling}} a material and then reducing it into a <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> For example, thermoplastics are difficult to grind to small particle sizes at ambient temperatures because they soften, adhere in lumpy masses and clog screens. When chilled by dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen, the thermoplastics can be finely ground to powders suitable for electrostatic spraying and other powder processes. Cryogenic grinding {{of plant and animal}} tissue is a technique used by microbiologists. Samples that require extraction of nucleic acids must be kept at −80 °C or lower during the entire extraction process. For samples that are soft or flexible at room temperature, cryogenic grinding may be the only viable technique for processing samples.A number of recent studies report on the processing and behavior of nanostructured materials via cryomilling.|$|E

30|$|In {{a recent}} study, Bahcegul et al. {{proved that the}} ideal <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of a certain biomass for {{pre-treatment}} might change {{depending on the type}} of the IL used [64]. Once again [emim][CH 3 COO] and [emim][Cl] were used to compare the efficiency in the pre-treatment of cotton stalks in four different <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> (<[*] 0.15  mm, 0.15 - 0.5  mm, 0.5 - 1.0  mm and 1.0 - 2.0  mm). They observed a decrease in the glucose yield for cotton stalks with the <b>smallest</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> (<[*] 0.15  mm) in comparison with larger <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> after pre-treatment with [emim][CH 3 COO]. This could indicate that <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of biomass in pre-treatment with [emim][CH 3 COO] might influence the amount of cellulose recovery. On the other hand, [emim][Cl] works more efficiently with <b>smaller</b> biomass <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> in respect to glucose yield. This opposite trend is explained by the different dissolution rates of the tested ILs. The [emim][CH 3 COO] showed a faster dissolution rate for the <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> allowing more extensive depolymerisation to lower molecular weight water soluble compounds. Therefore, a lower glucose yield was observed since part of cellulose was retained as soluble compounds in the liquid phase after biomass regeneration. After enzymatic hydrolysis, it was confirmed that different sizes of biomass could be ideal for different ILs [64]. Bahcegul et al. also evaluated the lignin extraction after pre-treating the referred <b>size</b> <b>particles</b> of cotton stalks [64]. For all tested <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> in the pre-treatment with [emim][CH 3 COO], less lignin content was determined for each pre-treated sample. However, the highest lignin contents were observed for larger biomass <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> (0.5 - 1.0  mm and 1.0 - 2.0  mm). Therefore, it is clear that pre-treatment with [emim][CH 3 COO] is more efficient using <b>smaller</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes.</b> The same observation was not found in pre-treatment with [emim][Cl], since cotton stalk samples with different <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> had similar lignin content after pre-treatment [64].|$|R
