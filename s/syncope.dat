5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including <b>syncope,</b> hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a <b>syncope</b> can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E

5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure {{may be useful to}} help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from <b>syncope.</b> It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 60 -year-old woman with known {{glossopharyngeal}} neuralgia who was admitted to hospital because of recurrent <b>syncopes</b> associated with episodes of painful sensations in the caudal region of her tongue. Rhythm observation showed prolonged asystole, which was accompanied by a loss of consciousness. The asystole was preceded by an episode of pain. We concluded that the bradyarrhythmia and <b>syncopes</b> where associated with the glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Because of the life-threatening condition, we inserted a permanent dual-chamber pacing device. After implantation of the pacemaker, the patient had no further <b>syncopes,</b> although she still complained of episodic tongue pain...|$|R
40|$|An infant with {{frequent}} upper airways infections presented <b>syncopes</b> during meals and weeping {{since the age}} of eleven months. Cardiac examination was always normal. At 14 months of age, an echocardiogram with colour Doppler demonstrated a severely stenotic isolated supramitral membrane with severe pulmonary hypertension. The membrane was immediately excised curing the malformation and suppressing definitively the <b>syncopes,</b> probably due to decreased cerebral blood flow during exertion. An echocardiogram should always be performed when <b>syncopes</b> remain unexplained in small children. It allows early diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects which do not have auscultatory findings especially those resulting in severe pulmonary venous obstruction...|$|R

5|$|Ottawa {{is one of}} the Ojibwe dialects {{that has}} {{undergone}} the most language change, although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive change is a pervasive pattern of vowel <b>syncope</b> that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their pronunciation. This and other innovations in pronunciation, in addition to changes in word structure and vocabulary, differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} of the morphological innovations that characterize Ottawa is {{the restructuring of}} the three person prefixes that occur on both nouns and verbs. The prefixes carry grammatical information about grammatical person (first, second, or third). <b>Syncope</b> modifies the pronunciation of the prefixes by deleting the short vowel in each prefix.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Background CPVT (catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} ventricular tachycardia) is an inheritable arrhythmogenic disease {{characterized by}} <b>syncopes</b> and cardiac arrest. It was first described in 1975, and has later been {{classified as a}} genetic disease with a great risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. CPVT is mainly caused by mutations in the genes encoding for ryanodine receptor 2. Starting with a case report, we present an overview of CPVT in this article. Material and methods The literature reviewed was identified through a non-systematic search in PubMed. Results Diagnosing CPVT may be difficult. As resting ECG is normal, the <b>syncopes</b> may be misdiagnosed as epilepsy. Information about <b>syncopes</b> related to physical or emotional stress and occurrence of unexplained <b>syncopes</b> or cardiac arrest among family members, are important clues in the diagnostic process. An exercise test often reveals the classic pattern of ventricular arrhythmias at heart rates above 100 beats/min. The diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing. Beta-blocker treatment can improve the prognosis, but if this does not provide sufficient arrhythmic control, an ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) should be considered on an individual basis. Interpretation CPVT is a severe disease with a poor prognosis if left untreated. It is a rare, but important differential diagnosis in young individuals with <b>syncopes</b> or cardiac arrest. Genetic screening of relatives {{has made it possible}} to identify mutation carriers at risk in affected families and provide them with preventive therapy.
