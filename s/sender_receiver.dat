40|$|Abstract — In an intra-domain network where OSPF or IS-IS {{protocol}} is used, the underlay routing {{may not be}} optimized. The {{delay in}} the shortest weight path may be much larger than delay in the shortest delay path from a <b>sender</b> to a <b>receiver.</b> For delay sensitive applications, we investigate the possibility of adding proxies in networks to make the delay in the overlay path between <b>senders</b> and <b>receivers</b> close to the delay in shortest delay path and to reduce the delays from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers.</b> By solving the integer linear programming formulations developed on the overlay logical network, we get optimization results: number of optimal proxies, optimal proxy locations and the improvement in reducing delays from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers.</b> We also apply Dijkstra’s algorithm on the overlay logical network to explore the maximum benefit of placing proxies on reducing delays. From simulation results of 6 ISP networks, we observe that adding proxies significantly reduces the delay from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers</b> for some networks. Finally, we identified a network metric, Default Delay Minimum Delay Ratio(DDMDR), which will provide guidance on whether adding proxies will significantly reduce the delays from <b>senders</b> to <b>receivers</b> in a network.

50|$|Walther's {{research}} also {{led him to}} develop the hyperpersonal model of communication in 1996. Walther's work on the hyperpersonal model is his research that has been most cited by other researchers. The hyperpersonal model finds that in certain circumstances, computer-mediated communication surpasses the affection and emotion of similar situations of face-to-face interpersonal communication. This model also offers a robust view of computer-mediated communication, {{taking into account the}} contributions of the <b>sender,</b> <b>receiver,</b> channel and feedback in a computer-mediated interaction.|$|E

5000|$|In 1992, {{a chapter}} in Communication Yearbook #15, argued that [...] "intrapersonal communication" [...] is a flawed concept. The chapter first itemized the various definitions. Intrapersonal communication, it appears, arises {{from a series of}} logical and {{linguistic}} improprieties. The descriptor itself, 'intrapersonal communication' is ambiguous: many definitions appear to be circular since they borrow, apply and thereby distort conceptual features (e.g., <b>sender,</b> <b>receiver,</b> message, dialogue) drawn from normal inter-person communication; unknown entities or person-parts allegedly conduct the 'intrapersonal' exchange; in many cases, a very private language is posited which, upon analysis, turns out to be totally inaccessible and ultimately indefensible. In general, intrapersonal communication appears to arise from the tendency to interpret the inner mental processes that precede and accompany our communicative behaviors as if they too were yet another kind of communication process. The overall point is that this reconstruction of our inner mental processes in the language and idioms of everyday public conversation is highly questionable, tenuous at best.|$|E

Acting as <b>sender,</b> <b>receiver,</b> and paddler respectively, Abello, Junia, and Tistón established communication with ship 467 using signalling (learned in youth as Scouts of Troop 11), identified themselves [...] "Boy Scouts of America," [...] pushed out by bangkâ (outrigger canoe), got capsised by Japanese fire, swam to the ship, and were taken aboard. They provided information pinpointing Japanese installations and diverting shelling away from populated areas of Tolosa, Leyte. Their intrepid actions made good copy for war correspondents on board ship. For their heroism, Abello was conferred the Philippine Legion of Honor by Pres.

5000|$|However, [...] "No Sense of Place" [...] is {{also criticized}} as proposing modern media {{communication}} as the singular cause of change. These causal {{connections between the}} media and social and cultural changes without exploring other possible factors or influences. Lindlof also argues {{that some of the}} changes that Meyrowitz describes, e.g., the emergence of a middle stage from the perspective of media and the audience, may not be permanent and that adaptations to use of the media and its interpretations may evolve. [...] This view of technology and the way users of technology may adapt its use and meaning is akin to Social Construction of Technology theory and the Dual Capacity model of communication. Social Construction of Technology theory argues that use of media is influenced by an agent's (both senders and receivers) attitudes and behaviors, their expertise of the medium, and external influences on the agents/users of the medium. In part, the Dual Capacity model of communication argues that the communication capabilities of the users (<b>sender,</b> <b>receiver,</b> and/or organization), in conjunction with the user's understanding of task contingencies (i.e., the task and the message) and normative contingencies (e.g., cultural norms) will influence choice of medium for communication.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, Walther {{brought up}} the concept of hyperpersonal communication, which {{demonstrates}} that [...] "CMC that is more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction." [...] Walther proposes that CMC users do take part in hyperpersonal communication. [...] Senders and receivers engage {{in the process of}} selective-self presentation through the message they create and send. This can lead to the idealization of the sender by the receiver based on making attributions from available paralingual cues found in the message. This process is enhanced with asynchronous exchanges, letting both sender and receiver have ample time to consider the messages sent and received. Hyperpersonal interaction would be excessively or above normal personal interaction. In other words, online relationships can develop into hyperpersonal that is excessively personal. When users experience commonality and are self-aware, physically separated, and communicating via a limited-cues channel, they can selectively self-present and edit their communication, enabling them to construct and reciprocate representations of their partners and relations without the interference of environmental reality. Hyperpersonal communication can thus be defined as computer-mediated interaction that is more attractive than experiences in similar FtF exchanges. The hyperpersonal model can be understood by looking at the established communication processes that include <b>sender,</b> <b>receiver,</b> channel, and feedback. The sender uses the process of selective self-presentation; this refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context {{to a greater extent than}} in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent.|$|E

We consider two different measures of quantum correlations: the entanglement (a traditional measure) and the informational correlation (based on the parameter exchange between the <b>sender</b> and <b>receiver).</b> We find the domain in the control parameter space yielding (i) zero entanglement between the <b>sender</b> and <b>receiver</b> during the whole evolution period and (ii) non-vanishing informational correlation between the <b>sender</b> and <b>receiver,</b> thus showing that the informational correlation is responsible for the remote state creation. Among the control parameters, there are the strong parameters (which strongly effect the values of studied measures) and the weak ones (whose effect is negligible), therewith the eigenvalues of the initial state are given a privileged role. We also show that the problem of small entanglement (concurrence) in quantum information processing is similar (in certain sense) to the problem of small determinants in linear algebra.
