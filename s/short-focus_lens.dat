40|$|A {{number of}} {{vibration}} mode shape measurement techniques {{are described in}} which the measurement point of a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is continuously scanned {{over the surface of}} a sinusoidally-excited structure. The LDV vibration output is an amplitude-modulated sine wave and mode shapes, defined along the scan line, may therefore be established by demodulation. Alternatively, in the frequency domain, the LDV output is a line spectrum, with sidebands centred on the excitation frequency and spaced at the scan frequency. The sideband amplitudes give series coefficients for the mode shape defined along the scan line - Fourier coefficients for a circular scan or, via a simple transform, polynomial coefficients for a sinusoidal straight-line or area scan. Useful measurements can also be made, directed at a single point on a structure: a small-diameter circular scan will give the angular vibration of the structure at the centre of the circle; a conical scan, produced with a <b>short-focus</b> <b>lens,</b> will measure the translational vibration at the point of focus, in magnitude and direction...|$|E

50|$|This makes <b>short-focus</b> {{wide-angle}} <b>lenses</b> undesirable for single-lens reflex cameras {{unless they}} are used with the reflex mirrors locked up. On large format view cameras and rangefinder cameras, <b>short-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> are widely used because they give less distortion than the retrofocus design {{and there is no}} need for a long back focal distance.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{varieties}} of wide-angle lens: <b>short-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> and retrofocus lenses.Short-focus lenses are generally {{made up of}} multiple glass elements whose shapes {{are more or less}} symmetrical in front of and behind the diaphragm. As the focal length decreases, the distance of the rear element of the lens from the film plane or digital sensor also decreases.|$|R
50|$|German optics was {{overwhelmingly}} superior, {{as exemplified}} by Carl Zeiss lenses and optical glass. The Allies had to quickly learn to make lenses especially for long foci. In the meantime {{they had to make}} do with such <b>short-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> as could be found. When the U.S. entered the war, the Army urgently requested that American civilians turn in their lenses and optics, including telescopes and binoculars, for aerial use, specifically naming several sought-after German manufactures. Cameras quickly became large and mechanically very complex. German and Italian cameras generally used 13×18 cm plates. France standardized on the advanced deMaria cameras of various configurations. For {{the last two years of}} the war, Britain used almost exclusively the 35-pound, semi-automatic, prop-driven L camera.|$|R
50|$|<b>Short-focus</b> perspective-control (PC) <b>lenses</b> (i.e., 17 mm through 35 mm) {{are used}} mostly in {{architectural}} photography; longer focal lengths {{may also be}} used in other applications such as landscape, product, and closeup photography. PC lenses are generally designed for single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras, as rangefinder cameras do not allow the photographer to directly view {{the effect of the}} lens, and view cameras allow for perspective control using camera movements.|$|R
40|$|A mobile x-ray “knife” {{developed}} by the authors is described. The device is intended for determining the proﬁle of the spatial intensity distribution in the ionizing radiation beam. Its automated motion system combines two actuator types. Signiﬁcant displacements are performed using a goniometric module with a piezoelectric actuator. The angular step of this module is 1 arc second, which corresponds to a linear displacement of 0. 97 µm. As a “ﬁne” drive, a rotating module with a piezoelectric column is used. Its linear step can be varied from 0. 01 to 1 µm at a total number of steps of 1000. The x-ray knife was experimentally tested at the Kurchatov Center of Synchrotron Radiation for diagnostics of the parameters of a <b>short-focus</b> x-ray <b>lens</b> at a photon energy of 18 keV. In the vertical direction, {{the width of the}} proﬁle for the intensity distribution in the beam formed by the lens was 2. 4 µm...|$|R
