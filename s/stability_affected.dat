40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{applicable}} {{model for}} understanding <b>stability</b> <b>affected</b> by combination of incentive and direct control for an economic regulation within mixed-forms. The research on stability of an economic regulation has mostly been focused on incentive or direct control in a U-form or M-form dominated organization. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} has been to discover a universal model for explaining <b>stability</b> <b>affected</b> by combination theory, leading to high mixed-form organizations performance. This dissertation illustrates the relative theories bound to the research topic and moves one step forward into hierarchies, the U-form dominated and M-form dominated mixed forms. And this dissertation puts forward a hypothesis on how to lead an economic regulation to more stable. The suggested theory was empirically tested in a case study and received strong support. The conclusion of the conducted research is that an economic regulation governed by an M-form dominated organization with stronger incentive and less direct control is more stable than a U-form dominated organization with weaker incentive and more direct control...|$|E

Problems with pyritic rock and soil extend globally and across many disciplines. Consequences of pyrite oxidation include heave, concrete degradation, steel corrosion, environmental damage, acid mine drainage, and accelerated weathering of rock with concomitant effects on strength and <b>stability.</b> <b>Affected</b> disciplines include soil science, mining, engineering geology, geochemistry, environmental engineering, and geotechnical engineering. While pyrite problems may be well known in their respective disciplines, there has been to date relatively little cross-disciplinary communication regarding problems with pyritic geomaterials.

40|$|Abstract. Taking the Lijiapo {{landslide}} in Three Gorges Area as an example, {{the study}} {{on the impact of}} seepage field changes caused by water level fluctuation on reservoir landslide stability was carried out. In order to find out the variation in slope stability when the reservoir water level changes at different rate, the stability calculation model was established adopting the Seep module and Slope module of Geoscience software GeoStudio, and calibrated with a long sequence of real-time monitoring data, based on the landslide survey data and test data. The results show that the reservoir landslide <b>stability</b> <b>affected</b> by the seepage field changes with changing reservoir level is controlled by a variety of factors, including the hydrodynamic pressure, hydrostatic pressure, uplift force, physical and mechanical properties (с, φ value change). When the water level fluctuates at a high rate, the impact of the seepage field changes on the stability is mainly affected by the pore water pressure before the stability reaches the extremum, while after the extremum, with the further infiltration or drainage of reservoir water, it is mainly affected by the change of physical and mechanical properties. When the water level fluctuates at a lower rate, the pore water pressure, uplift force and physical and mechanical properties are the dominant factors...|$|E
40|$|Azo {{compounds}} {{have high}} exothermic characteristics and low thermal stability, which have caused many serious thermal accidents around the world. In general, different locations (e. g., equatorial or polar regions) have different UV intensities. If the azo compound exists in an inappropriately stored or transported condition, {{the decrease in}} thermal stability may cause a thermal hazard or ageing. 2, 2 ′-Azobis(2, 4 -dimethyl) valeronitrile (ADVN) is investigated {{with respect to the}} thermal <b>stability</b> <b>affected</b> by UV exposure at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. When ADVN is exposed to 24 h of UV (100 mW/m 2 and 254 nm), T 0 is not only advanced, but the mass loss is also increased during the main decomposition stage. In addition, the apparent activation energy and integral procedural decomposition temperature (IPDT) of ADVN exposed to 24 h of UV is calculated by kinetic models. Therefore, the prevention mechanism, thermal characteristics, and kinetic parameters are established in our study. We should isolate UV contacting ADVN under any situations, avoiding ADVN being aged or leading to thermal runaway. This study provided significant information for a safer process under changing UV exposure times for ADVN. Furthermore, the research method may serve as an important benchmark for handling potentially hazardous chemicals, such as azo compounds described herein...|$|E

30|$|The {{correlation}} between implant length/diameter and the bone quality and implant stability remains controversial. Many researchers reported that larger-diameter implants, {{which had a}} larger area of contact with the supporting bone and put less stress distribution on peri-implant bone, could more favorably secure high levels of initial stability [18]. The biomechanical analysis also showed that the larger the implant diameter, the greater the removal torque, demonstrating that wide implants are more stable than narrow ones in general [19]. Degidi et al. [20] contended that the bone quality was weakly correlated with ISQ, which was significantly affected by implant diameter and length. Wide implants were reportedly {{less likely to have}} their initial <b>stability</b> <b>affected</b> specifically by a low bone quality than general ones [18]. In this study, the maxilla with relatively lower bone density showed a lower level of primary and secondary stability than the mandible. In the maxilla, however, the levels of both primary and secondary stability— 67.42 [*]±[*] 8.87 and 71.52 [*]±[*] 8.11, respectively—were higher than those of minimal ISQ (65) for immediate or early loading [21]. No significant difference was found in the implant survival rate or marginal bone loss by arch, and it was believed that the gap in the bone quality between the maxilla and the mandible had no significant effect on the clinical prognosis of ultrawide implants.|$|E
40|$|In eukaryotes, {{there are}} still steps of the vitamin B 1 biosynthetic pathway not {{completely}} understood. In Arabidopsis thaliana, THI 1 protein has been associatedwith the synthesis of the thiazole ring, a finding supported by the identification of a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) -like compound in its structure. Here, we investigated THI 1 and its mutant THI 1 (A 140 V), responsible for the thiamin auxotrophy in a A. thaliana mutant line, aiming to clarify {{the impact of this}} mutation in the stability and activity of THI 1. Recently, the THI 1 orthologue (THI 4) was revealed to be responsible for the donation of the sulfur atom from a cysteine residue to the thiazole ring in the thiamine intermediate. In this context, we carried out a cysteine quantification in THI 1 and THI 1 (A 140 V) using electron spin resonance (ESR). These data showed that THI 1 (A 140 V) contains more sulfur-containing cysteines than THI 1, indicating that the function as a sulfur donor is conserved, but the rate of donation reaction is somehowaffected. Also, the bound compounds were isolated from both proteins and are present in different amounts in each protein. Unfolding studies presented differences in melting temperatures and also in the concentration of guanidine at which half of the protein unfolds, thus showing that THI 1 (A 140 V) has its conformational <b>stability</b> <b>affected</b> by themutation. Hence, despite keeping its function in the early steps during the synthesis of TPP precursor, our studies have shown a decrease in the THI 1 (A 140 V) stability,which might be slowing down the biological activity of the mutant, and thus contributing to thiamin auxotrophy.

40|$|In this PhD project, the {{investigation}} of the stability of a laminar diffusion flame and the interaction of the flame with acoustic waves inside an acoustically excited cylindrical tube is presented. Interesting phenomena have been observed by studying both the infrasound and sound effect on the flame structure and dynamics. When a cylindrical tube burner is acoustically excited at one end, a standing wave will be produced along the tube burner. By applying a programming controlled signal from a signal generator, the loudspeaker generates acoustic waves with different frequencies and intensities to excite the flame, which can make the flame relatively stable or unstable, even blow out. Different methods in both frequency domain and time domain have been applied to analyze the flame <b>stability</b> <b>affected</b> by acoustic waves. Both infrasound and sound are tested in this research. Infrasound is the acoustic wave with a frequency too low to be heard by human ear covering sounds beneath the lowest limits of human hearing (20 Hz) down to 0. 001 Hz. It is found that infrasound is able to take over buoyancy-driven flame flickering and make the flame flicker at the same frequency as the forcing infrasound. For some infrasound, half excited frequency has been detected clearly in the power spectrum of CH* chemiluminescence signals acquired by a photomultiplier. On the other hand, some higher frequency acoustic wave can have observable effect on flame flickering but the buoyancy-driven flickering is still the dominant oscillating mode; some other higher frequency acoustic wave can make the flame very stable, such as the acoustic wave at 140 Hz. Image processing technique has shown that the influence of acoustic waves on the laminar diffusion flame varies spatially. It is also observed that a diffusion flame may oscillate at different frequency spatially. Taking the flame without acoustic excitation as an example, the inner most area of the flame oscillates at the typical flickering frequency, but the most outer areas of the flame oscillate at the second-harmonic of the typical flickering frequency. Finally, some control strategies are developed for the laboratory tube burner based on the gained physical insights in this research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
