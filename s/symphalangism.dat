The middle and far phalanges of the fourth and fifth toes are often fused together (<b>symphalangism).</b> The phalanges of the hand are commonly known as the finger bones.

40|$|SummaryMultiple synostoses {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by premature onset of joint fusions, which initially affect the interphalangeal joints, by characteristic facies, and by deafness. We performed linkage analysis {{on a large}} Hawaiian family with multiple synostoses syndrome. Because another autosomal dominant disorder, proximal <b>symphalangism,</b> shares some clinical symptoms with multiple synostoses syndrome and {{has been linked to}} markers at loci at chromosome 17 q 21 - 22, we tested the hypothesis that multiple synostoses {{syndrome is}} linked to the same chromosomal region. Using polymorphic markers from the proximal <b>symphalangism</b> interval, we conducted linkage analysis and showed that the multiple synostoses–syndrome phenotype is linked to the same chromosomal region. A maximum LOD score of 3. 98 at recombination fraction of. 00 was achieved for the marker at locus D 17 S 787. Further genetic analysis identified individuals with recombinant genotypes, allowing localization of the disease gene within the interval D 17 S 931 –D 17 S 792, a 16 -cM region. These data provide evidence that multiple synostoses syndrome and proximal <b>symphalangism</b> may be allelic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Although {{fixation}} of the stapes {{is usually}} progressive and secondary to otosclerosis, it may present congenitally, with other skeletal manifestations, as an autosomal dominant syndrome—such as proximal <b>symphalangism</b> (SYM 1) or multiple-synostoses syndrome (SYNS 1), {{both of which}} are caused by mutations in NOG, the gene encoding noggin. We describe a family that was ascertained to have nonsyndromic otosclerosis but was subsequently found to have a congenital stapes ankylosis syndrome that included hyperopia, a hemicylindrical nose, broad thumbs and great toes, and other minor skeletal anomalies but lacked <b>symphalangism.</b> A heterozygous nonsense NOG mutation—c. 328 C→T (Q 110 X), predicted to truncate {{the latter half of the}} protein—was identified, and a heterozygous insertion in NOG—c. 252 - 253 insC, in which the frameshift is predicted to result in 96 novel amino acids before premature truncation—was identified in a previously described second family with a similar phenotype. In contrast to most NOG mutations that have been reported in kindreds with SYM 1 and SYNS 1, the mutations observed in these families with stapes ankylosis without <b>symphalangism</b> are predicted to disrupt the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. These clinical and molecular findings suggest that (1) a broader range of conductive hearing-loss phenotypes are associated with NOG mutations than had previously been recognized, (2) patients with sporadic or familial nonsyndromic otosclerosis should be evaluated for mild features of this syndrome, and (3) NOG alterations should be considered in conductive hearing loss with subtle clinical and skeletal features, even in the absence of <b>symphalangism...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Symphalangism</b> {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} difference {{characterized by}} ankylosis of interphalangeal (IP) joints of the fingers and toes. In adults, there were several attempts to restore the stiff joints into mobile ones, but these treatment options resulted in poor outcomes {{and could not be}} applied to growing children. Here, we report our experiences on surgical treatment for children who had <b>symphalangism</b> of the hand. Methods: We treated 36 joints in 17 children with <b>symphalangism</b> of the hand using dorsal capsulotomy and collateral ligament release. The diagnoses were based on history, physical examination, and simple radiographs. Affected fingers were classified according to our grading system. Simple compressive dressing was applied using Coban after surgery. Passive range of motion (ROM) exercise was started on day one or 2 postoperative, {{with the help of a}} hand therapist and patients ’ parents. The patients were prescribed passive ROM exercises for at least 2 hours a day over a period of 6 months. Results: A single surgeon operated on 30 proximal IP joints, 3 distal IP joints, and 3 IP joints of the thumb. Twenty six joints were classifi ed as grade I, and 10 as grade II. The ROM of affected joints, which was 7. 8 ± 8. 1 (mean ± SD) degrees preoperatively, increased to 46. 8 ± 18. 6 degrees at fi nal follow-up. The final ROM was significantly better in grade I joints, especially when the children had operations at ages 24 months or younger.

40|$|The phenotypes of the {{patients}} {{may be explained by}} haploinsufficiency of the genes deleted at 17 q 23. 2. One of the genes deleted from this region is COIL. Deletion of exon 2 - 7 of COIL led to reduced viability in homozygous mice (5). The mouse knockout model has shown that full-length coilin is essential for proper formation and/or maintenance of CBs and recruitment of snRNP and SMN complex proteins to CBs (5). If Cajal Bodies, key organelles involved in RNA processing in general, are in significantly lower numbers, main molecules necessary for RNA processing may be absent or reduced, resulting in alterations in RNA-splicing and – transcription. The reduction of CBs in {{the patients}} suggests that haploinsufficiency of COIL could have phenotypic consequences. The limb defects (<b>symphalangism,</b> syndactyly) are consistent with the deletion of NOG, mutations of which are associated with <b>symphalangism</b> (3).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{report on}} 2 {{families}} with proximal <b>symphalangism</b> syndrome and 2 new NOG gene mutations and {{to report on}} the outcomes of exploratory tympanotomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 6 patients, one of which underwent an exploratory tympanotomy, were examined from 2 families. INTERVENTION: Exploratory tympanotomy in 1 patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical and otologic histories and postoperative hearing outcomes. RESULTS: In the patient that was operated upon, the preoperative air conduction hearing threshold of 55 dB was reduced to 41 dB with a residual air bone gap of 21 dB. Furthermore, deoxyribonucleic acid analysis revealed 2 different mutations: a heterozygous nonsense mutation in the NOG gene, c. 391 C>T (p. Gln 131 X), and a frameshift mutation in the NOG gene (NOG, c. 304 del (p. Ala 102 fs)). CONCLUSION: NOG gene mutations, which lead to aberrant noggin protein function, give rise to a large spectrum of clinical findings and different <b>symphalangism</b> syndromes.

We applied a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel approach comprising all 2877 genes currently known to be causative for one or more Mendelian diseases combined with the phenotype based computational tool PhenIX (Phenotypic Interpretation of eXomes).

40|$|The NOG gene encodes noggin, a {{secreted}} polypeptide that {{is important}} for regulating multiple signaling pathways during human development, particularly in cartilage and bone. The hallmark of NOG ‐related syndromes is proximal <b>symphalangism,</b> defined by abnormal fusion of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet. Many additional features secondary to NOG mutations are commonly but inconsistently observed, including a characteristic facies with a hemicylindrical nose, congenital conductive hearing loss due to stapes fixation, and hyperopia. The variable clinical presentations led to the designation of five different autosomal dominant syndromes, all subsequently found to have resulted from NOG mutations. These include (1) proximal symphalangism; (2) multiple synostoses syndrome 1; (3) stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs and toes; (4) tarsal‐carpal coalition syndrome; and (5) brachydactyly type B 2.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{clinical and}} radiologic features, results of ear surgery, and genetic analysis in three families with Teunissen-Cremers syndrome. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. BACKGROUND: The NOG gene encodes the protein noggin, which has antagonist action in osteogenesis. Malformation of bones and joints {{may result from}} defects in noggin. Teunissen-Cremers syndrome is caused by mutations in the NOG gene. Two mutations in this gene were reported previously. The proximal symphalangism-hearing impairment syndrome, also caused by mutations in the NOG gene, is characterized by proximal <b>symphalangism,</b> conductive hearing loss, and occasionally synostoses. METHODS: We examined nine affected members of three Dutch families. Reconstructive middle ear surgery was performed in five patients (nine ears), and we sequenced the NOG gene in these families. RESULTS: Affected members had conductive hearing impairment, hyperopia, and broad thumbs and first toes with brachytelephalangia. Surgery manifested stapes ankylosis with additional incudal fixation frequently in the fossa incudis. Air-bone gaps decreased to less than 10 dB in six ears. Genetic analysis revealed three new mutations in the NOG gene. CONCLUSION: The Teunissen-Cremers syndrome is an entity in its clinical presentation, distinct from other syndromes with proximal <b>symphalangism</b> and hearing impairment. So far, in five families with Teunissen-Cremers syndrome, four truncating mutations and one amino acid substitution {{were found in the}} NOG gene. The majority of other mutations found in this gene are missense mutations, which might result in some residual protein activity. Reconstructive middle ear surgery is an option for treatment...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{describe}} 2 mutations in growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF 5) that alter receptor-binding affinities. They cause brachydactyly type A 2 (L 441 P) and <b>symphalangism</b> (R 438 L), conditions previously associated with mutations in the GDF 5 receptor {{bone morphogenetic protein}} receptor type 1 b (BMPR 1 B) and the BMP antagonist NOGGIN, respectively. We expressed the mutant proteins in limb bud micromass culture and treated ATDC 5 and C 2 C 12 cells with recombinant GDF 5. Our {{results indicated that the}} L 441 P mutant is almost inactive. The R 438 L mutant, in contrast, showed increased biological activity when compared with WT GDF 5. Biosensor interaction analyses revealed loss of binding to BMPR 1 A and BMPR 1 B ectodomains for the L 441 P mutant, whereas the R 438 L mutant showed normal binding to BMPR 1 B but increased binding to BMPR 1 A, the receptor normally activated by BMP 2. The binding to NOGGIN was normal for both mutants. Thus, the brachydactyly type A 2 phenotype (L 441 P) is caused by inhibition of the ligand-receptor interaction, whereas the <b>symphalangism</b> phenotype (R 438 L) is caused by a loss of receptor-binding specificity, resulting in a gain of function by the acquisition of BMP 2 -like properties. The presented experiments have identified some of the main determinants of GDF 5 receptor-binding specificity in vivo and open new prospects for generating antagonists and superagonists of GDF 5...|$|E

We report the case of a 24 -year-old woman with symptomatic bilateral talonavicular coalitions and previously unreported associated anomalies (nail hypoplasia and metatarsus primus elevatus) and review the relevant literature. The patient underwent surgery (calcaneocuboid joint distraction arthrodesis and a proximal plantar flexion osteotomy with a dorsal open wedge of the first metatarsal).

40|$|Multiple-synostosis {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive <b>symphalangism,</b> carpal/tarsal fusions, deafness, and mild facial dysmorphism. Heterozygosity for functional null mutations in the NOGGIN gene {{has been shown}} to be responsible for the disorder. However, in a cohort of six probands with multiple-synostosis syndrome, only one was found to be heterozygous for a NOGGIN mutation (W 205 X). Linkage studies involving the four-generation family of one of the mutation-negative patients excluded the NOGGIN locus, providing genetic evidence of locus heterogeneity. In this family, polymorphic markers flanking the GDF 5 locus were found to cosegregate with the disease, and sequence analysis demonstrated that affected individuals in the family were heterozygous for a novel missense mutation that predicts an R 438 L substitution in the GDF 5 protein. Unlike mutations that lead to haploinsufficiency for GDF 5 and produce brachydactyly C, the protein encoded by the multiple-synostosis–syndrome allele was secreted as a mature GDF 5 dimer. These data establish locus heterogeneity in multiple-synostosis syndrome and demonstrate that the disorder can result from mutations in either the NOGGIN or the GDF 5 gene...|$|E

In Tgfbr 2 PRX- 1 KO mice, the loss of TGF-β responsiveness resulted {{in the absence of}} interphalangeal joints. The Tgfbr 2 Prx 1 KO joint phenotype is similar to that in patients with <b>symphalangism</b> (SYM 1 -OMIM 185800). By generating a Tgfbr 2 –green fluorescent protein–β–GEO–bacterial artificial chromosome β-galactosidase reporter transgenic mouse and by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, we determined that Tgfbr 2 is highly and specifically expressed in developing joints. We demonstrated that in Tgfbr 2 PRX- 1 KO mice, the failure of joint interzone development resulted from an aberrant persistence of differentiated chondrocytes and failure of Jagged- 1 expression. We found that TGF-β receptor II signaling regulates Noggin, Wnt 9 a, and growth and differentiation factor- 5 joint morphogenic gene expressions. In Tgfbr 2 PRX- 1 KO growth plates adjacent to interphalangeal joints, Indian hedgehog expression is increased, whereas Collagen 10 expression decreased.

Although congenital constriction band syndrome is a well-known congenital condition, the development mechanism of this anomaly has not been clarified fully. There are many intrinsic and extrinsic theories regarding the etiology of this rare syndrome. Generally accepted mechanism is the process that consists of the early amniotic rupture leading to formation of mesodermal fibrous strands which constrict and amputate distal portions of limbs. It is characterized by syndactyly, hypoplasia, brachydactyly, <b>symphalangism,</b> symbrachydactyly, club foot, cleft lip, cleft palate, and cranial defects. The lesion can involve skin only or goes to deeper structure up to bone, which can lead to gangrene of foot or autoamputation. The treatment should be tailored to the individual patient.

40|$|Secreted noggin protein regulates bone {{morphogenetic}} protein {{activity during}} development. In mice, a complete loss of noggin protein leads to multiple malformations including joint fusion, whereas mice heterozygous for Nog loss-of-function mutations are normal. In humans, heterozygous NOG missense mutations {{have been found in}} patients with two autosomal dominant disorders of joint development, multiple synostosis syndrome (SYNS 1) and a milder disorder proximal <b>symphalangism</b> (SYM 1). This study investigated the effect of one SYNS 1 and two SYM 1 disease-causing missense mutations on the structure and function of noggin. The SYNS 1 mutation abolished, and the SYM 1 mutations reduced, the secretion of functional noggin dimers in transiently transfected COS- 7 cells. Coexpression of mutant noggin with wild-type noggin, to resemble the heterozygous state, did not interfere with wild-type noggin secretion. These data indicate that the human disease-causing mutations are hypomorphic alleles that reduce secretion of functional dimeric noggin. Therefore, we conclude that noggin has both species-specific and joint-specific dosage-dependent roles during joint formation. Surprisingly, in contrast to the COS- 7 cell studies, the SYNS 1 mutant was able to form dimers in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This finding indicates that there also exist species-specific differences in the ability to process mutant noggin polypeptides...|$|E
40|$|Brachydactyly type B (BDB) is {{characterized}} by terminal deficiency of fingers and toes, which is caused by heterozygous truncating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor 2 (ROR 2) {{in the majority of}} patients. In a subset of ROR 2 -negative patients with BDB, clinically defined by the additional occurrence of proximal <b>symphalangism</b> and carpal synostosis, we identified six different point mutations (P 35 A, P 35 S, A 36 P, E 48 K, R 167 G, and P 187 S) in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist NOGGIN (NOG). In contrast to previously described loss-of-function mutations in NOG, which are known to cause a range of conditions associated with abnormal joint formation but without BDB, the newly identified BDB mutations do not indicate a major loss of function, as suggested by calculation of free-binding energy of the modeled NOG-GDF 5 complex and functional analysis of the micromass culture system. Rather, they presumably alter NOG’s ability to bind to BMPs and growth-differentiation factors (GDFs) in a subtle way, thus disturbing the intricate balance of BMP signaling. The combined features observed in this phenotypic subtype of BDB argue for a functional connection between BMP and ROR 2 signaling and support previous findings of a modulating effect of ROR 2 on the BMP-receptor pathway through the formation of a heteromeric complex of the receptors at the cell surface...|$|E
40|$|Deletions {{involving}} 17 q 21 -q 24 {{have been}} identified previously to result in two clinically recognizable contiguous gene deletion syndromes: 17 q 21. 31 and 17 q 23. 1 -q 23. 2 microdeletion syndromes. Although deletions involving 17 q 22 {{have been reported in}} the literature, only four of the eight patients reported were identified by array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) or flourescent in situ hybridization. Here, we describe five new patients with 1. 8 - 2. 5 -Mb microdeletions involving 17 q 22 identified by array-CGH. We also present one patient with a large karyotypically visible deletion involving 17 q 22, fine-mapped to ~ 8. 2 Mb using array-CGH. We show that the commonly deleted region in our patients spans 0. 24 Mb and two genes; NOG and C 17 ORF 67. The function of C 17 ORF 67 is not known, whereas Noggin, the product of NOG, is essential for correct joint development. In common with the 17 q 22 patients reported previously, the disease phenotype of our patients includes intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conductive hearing loss, visual impairment, low set ears, facial dysmorphology and limb anomalies. All patients displayed NOG-related bone and joint features, including <b>symphalangism</b> and facial dysmorphology. We conclude that these common clinical features indicate a novel clinically recognizable, 17 q 22 contiguous microdeletion syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Heterozygous {{missense}} {{mutations in}} the serine-threonine kinase receptor BMPR 1 B result typically in brachydactyly type A 2 (BDA 2), whereas mutations in the corresponding ligand GDF 5 cause brachydactyly type C (BDC). Mutations in the GDF inhibitor Noggin (NOG) or activating mutations in GDF 5 cause proximal <b>symphalangism</b> (SYM 1). Here, we describe a novel mutation in BMPR 1 B (R 486 Q) that {{is associated with}} either BDA 2 or a BDC/SYM 1 -like phenotype. Functional investigations of the R 486 Q mutation were performed and compared with the previously reported BDA 2 -causing mutation R 486 W and WT BMPR 1 B. Overexpression of the mutant receptors in chicken micromass cultures resulted in a strong inhibition of chondrogenesis with the R 486 Q mutant, showing a stronger effect than the R 486 W mutant. To investigate the consequences of the BMPR 1 B mutations on the intracellular signal transduction, we used stably transfected C 2 C 12 cells and measured the activity of SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways. SMAD activation after stimulation with GDF 5 was suppressed in both mutants. Alkaline phosphatase induction showed an almost complete loss of activation by both mutants. Our data extend the previously known mutational and phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in BMPR 1 B. Disturbances of NOG-GDF 5 -BMPR 1 B signaling cascade can result in similar clinical manifestations depending on the quantitative effect and mode of action of the specific mutations within the same functional pathway...|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{differentiation}} factor 5 (GDF 5), {{a member of}} the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, is essential for cartilage, bone, and joint formation. Antagonists such as noggin counteract BMP signaling by covering the ligand's BMP type I (BMPRI) and type II (BMPRII, ActRII, ActRIIB) interaction sites. The mutation GDF 5 -S 94 N is located within the BMPRII interaction site, the so-called knuckle epitope, and was identified in patients suffering from multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS). SYNS is characterized by progressive <b>symphalangism,</b> carpal/tarsal fusions, deafness and mild facial dysmorphism. Here we present a novel molecular mechanism of a GDF 5 mutation affecting chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. GDF 5 -S 94 N exhibits impaired binding to BMPRII causing alleviated Smad and non-Smad signaling and reduced chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC 5 [*]cells. Surprisingly, chondrogenesis in mouse micromass cultures was strongly enhanced by GDF 5 -S 94 N. By using quantitative techniques (SPR, reporter gene assay, ALP assay, qPCR), we uncovered that this gain of function is caused by strongly reduced affinity of GDF 5 -S 94 N to the BMP/GDF antagonist noggin and the consequential lack of noggin inhibition. Thus, since noggin is upregulated during chondrogenic differentiation, GDF 5 -S 94 N exceeds the GDF 5 action, which results in the phenotypic outcome of SYNS. The detailed molecular characterization of GDF 5 -S 94 N as a noggin-resistant growth factor illustrates the potential of GDF 5 mutants in applications with defined therapeutical needs...|$|E
