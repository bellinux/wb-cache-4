40|$|The {{differential}} {{equations of motion}} and the associated boundary conditions for the slip-flow regime of fluid mechanics are derived {{from the point of}} view of the kinetic theory of non-uniform gases. The slip-flow regime comprises the flow of gases whose molecular mean free path is smaller than but not negligible relative to the macroscopic dimension characterizing the gas flow. A systematic review is presented of the methods of Hilbert and Burnett for obtaining a successive approximation solution to the Boltzmann integro-differential equation. The complete second approximation to the molecular velocity distribution function is calculated for the molecular model of Maxwell. This molecular distribution function is employed for the derivation of the macroscopic {{differential equations}} of motion and the associated boundary conditions. It is shown that the same number of boundary conditions are required for <b>slip</b> <b>flows</b> as for gas-dynamical flows, although the differential equations of motion for <b>slip</b> <b>flows</b> are of higher order than those of continuum gas-dynamics. Expressions for the second approximations to the slip velocity and temperature jump are obtained. The general equations obtained are applied to three specific problems: the propagation of sound waves in rarefied gases, high-speed Couette flow of a rarefied gas, and slip-flow between concentric cylinders in relative rotary motion. It is found that the rarefaction of a gas increases the damping of sound waves, whereas the propagation speed differs from the ordinary adiabatic sound velocity by less than two percent. The Couette flow solution indicates that the slippage of gas and the temperature discontinuity at a solid boundary may reduce the gas-dynamical friction coefficient and heat transfer, respectively, by ten percent under approximate conditions. When applied to the flight of aircraft through the rarefied atmosphere, the theory presented is applicable to an altitude range from 100, 000 to 300, 000 feet. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{developing}} {{heat transfer}} in laminar, hydrodynamically fully developed <b>slip</b> <b>flow</b> in a channel with a constant wall temperature. <b>Slip</b> <b>flow</b> {{is a good}} approximation when the Knudsen number, {{the ratio of the}} molecular mean free path to the channel width, is less than approximately 0. 1. Our analysis includes the effects of viscous dissipation, flow work, and axial heat conduction. A series solution is used to solve for the temperature distribution and provide predictions for the Nusselt number. It is found that inclusion of axial conduction increases both the non-dimensional temperature and the Nusselt number at a given location. The effect of <b>slip</b> <b>flow</b> is to increase the non-dimensional temperature and decrease the Nusselt number at a given location. The effects of viscous dissipation and flow work are more complex, and can either increase or decrease the non-dimensional temperature and the Nusselt number at various points {{along the length of the}} channel.

ICEO flows occur when a bulk electric field polarizes a metal object to induce double layer formation, then drives electroosmotic flow. A microfabricated array of metal-dielectric Janus micropillars breaks the symmetry of ICEO flow, so that an AC electric field applied across the array drives ICEO flow {{along the length of}} the pump. When pumping against an external lo ad, a pressure gradient forms along the pump length. The design was analyzed theoretically with the reciprocal theorem.

The Navier-Stokes equations have been solved {{in conjunction with}} Maxwell slip conditions for modeling flow field associated with <b>slip</b> <b>flow</b> regime. The wall roughness is simulated with triangular microelements distributed on wall surfaces to {{study the effects of}} roughness on fluid flow. Various Mach and Knudsen numbers are used to investigate the effects of rarefaction as well as compressibility. It is found that rarefaction has more significant effect on flow field in microchannels with higher relative roughness. It is also found that compressibility has more significant effects on Poiseuille number when relative roughness increases. In addition, similar to incompressible models the increase in average fRe is more significant at low Knudsen number flows but the increase of Poiseuille number duo to relative roughness is sharper for compressible models.

We investigate the nonlinear flow physics in the near-wall regions using a new power-law (PL) wall-scaling approach. This PL model incorporates Knudsen layer effects in near-wall regions by {{taking into account the}} boundary limiting effects on the molecular free paths. We also report new direct simulation Monte Carlo results covering a wide range of Knudsen numbers and accommodation coefficients, and for various outer-to-inner cylinder radius ratios. Our simulation data are compared with both the classical <b>slip</b> <b>flow</b> theory and the PL model, and we find that non-equilibrium effects are not only dependent on Knudsen number and accommodation coefficient but are also significantly affected by the surface curvature. The relative merits and limitations of both theoretical models are explored with respect to rarefaction and curvature effects.
