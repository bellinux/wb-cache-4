40|$|Through SPICE simulation, {{different}} piezoelectric harvester interface circuits {{are demonstrated}} and compared. In synchronized switch harvesting on inductor interface, the inductor’s quality factors {{are very important}} on calculating the harvested power so that the power from SSHIs depending on the inductor’s Q is calculated. Especially, parallel SSHI shows the optimal output voltage to harvest the maximum power varies according to the Q severely. Switch triggering offset and <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> duration are very interest in calculating the power in SSHI. So, the simulations {{of the effect of}} these factors on SSHI’s power are performed. It is conformed that switch triggering offset has more impact on the s-SSHI than p-SSHI. The switch on-time duration is more important in case of the p-SSHI. p-SSHI shows when the on-time duration becomes more than 1. 3 times or less than 0. 7 times of exact duration time, the harvested power gets zero. s-SSHI reveals the characteristics that when less than 1. 5 times exact on-time duration, the harvested power varies significantly with the on-time duration, however larger than 1. 5 times exact on-time duration has scarcely influenced on the harvested power...|$|E

40|$|Building {{energy-efficient}} {{systems is}} one of the principal challenges in wireless sensor networks. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), a technique to reduce energy consumption by varying the CPU frequency on the fly, has been widely used in other settings to accomplish this goal. In this paper, we show that changing the CPU frequency can affect timekeeping functionality of some sensor platforms. This phenomenon can cause an unacceptable loss of time synchronization in networks that require tight synchrony over extended periods, thus preventing all existing DVS techniques from being applied. We present a method for reducing energy consumption in sensor networks via DVS, while minimizing the impact of CPU frequency <b>switching</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> synchronization. The system is implemented and evaluated on a network of 11 Imote 2 sensors mounted on a truss bridge and running a high-fidelity continuous structural health monitoring application. Experimental measurements confirm that the algorithm significantly reduces network energy consumption over the same network that does not use DVS, while requiring significantly fewer re-synchronization actions than a classic DVS algorithm. unpublishedis peer reviewe...|$|R

The driving field is applied parallel to the easy axis and is continuously swept from a positive to a negative value. In addition, a small constant perpendicular bias field is present. It is shown that while the driving field switches the moment in a conventional way, the perpendicular field creates an admixture of the precessional (ballistic) switching that speeds up the switching process. Precessional contribution produces a non-monotonic dependence of the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the field sweep time with a minimum at a particular sweep time value.
