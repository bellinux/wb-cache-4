The present work analyzes the intervention procedures for the restoration of an area utilized as hydrocarbons deposit in an urbanized site of central Italy and of an area in the South of Italy, interested by a gasoline pollution due to underground storage tanks. Subsoil characteristics and its state of contamination have been preliminary investigated. Contamination has been located in two different layers, the first one extended in the vadose zone, the second one in the saturated zone. Specific interventions for the different delivery of pollution have thus been studied, that is: removal of the superficial contaminated soil; soil venting in the unsaturated zone of the subsoil; water pumping and treatment in the saturated zone. The soil venting system resulted particularly important and complex, therefore the execution of pilot test has been made necessary. The results of the performed pilot test have been analyzed and the relevant parameters in the final plant design for the area restoration have been thus selected...|$|E

In addition, the selection for ideal and feasible method in controlling the disposal of high quantities of MSW at economical costs that can avoid environmental damages are difficult to be decided due to various deliberations {{need to be made}} (Umar et al. 2010). Conventionally, landfilling of solid waste has been the most preferred method for solid waste disposal due to technical feasibility, ease of operation, minimum supervisions and low operation expenditure. In most countries, landfilling is the most acceptable means for eliminating MSW which favors to the technology exploitation and capital cost (Renou et al. 2008).While most of the landfills nowadays equipped with a level three sanitary systems, many developing countries are still struggling to equip state of the art facilities at the landfill. For example, there are 261 landfills in Malaysia whereby more than 80  % of them are being controlled tipping or open dumping practice. This {{is due to the fact}} that it obscures lower cost of operation and maintenance compared to the other established techniques (incineration and advanced landfill system) (Halim et al. 2010 a). Unfortunately, this practice has caused excessive generation of leachate whereby if it is not treated and safely disposed, landfill leachate could be a potential source of surface and ground water contamination, as it may percolate through soils and <b>subsoils,</b> causing <b>pollution</b> to receiving waters (Aziz et al. 2011).|$|R

The Lille city authorities considered locating a purification plant on the site. A number of projects for the industrial, urban or administrative use of the site are in progress. The position of the site in an area of designated as “green belt” {{on the banks of the}} Deûle, the pollution and its highly artificial character make it an important factor in the ecological fragmentation of the regional ‘’’blue infrastructure’’’.|$|R
