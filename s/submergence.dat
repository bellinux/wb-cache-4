5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or <b>submergence.</b> Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E

40|$|The Saeftinge {{salt marsh}} in the Westerschelde estuary (southwestern {{part of the}} Netherlands) {{represents}} {{one of the very few}} tidal brackish marsh ecosystems in Western Europe. From May 1983 to May 1985 the local pollution of this marsh with metals and fluoride was investigated. Samples from soil and vegetation were analysed monthly for cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, manganese, iron, and fluoride. The amount of these substances in the soil appeared to be related to both the percentage of clay particles and organic matter in the soil and to the frequency of tidal <b>submergences.</b> In vegetation, the pollutants clearly showed a seasonal variation. Adherent clay, deposited on the plants during <b>submergences,</b> contributed considerably to the total amount of these elements. Sheep grazing in the marsh were investigated for renal and faecal excretion of these elements, but no relation between these samples and the seasonal variation in vegetation was found. Presumably sheep consumed vegetation selectively, avoiding the more contaminated plants. Regular clinical inspections of the sheep revealed no signs of acute or chronic intoxication. The organs of sheep that died during the investigation showed increased levels of cadmium in the liver and kidney, and iron in the liver, but not enough to cause alarm. Fluoride found in the rib material, although slightly increased, did not indicate fluorosis. In conclusion, contamination with metals and fluoride, as observed in the salt marsh, apparently does not impair the health of locally grazing sheep. This may be due to selective consumption behaviour of the sheep, their stabling during the winter, limited biological availability of the elements studied, and a sheep management adapted to the local circumstances...|$|R

Mean niche overlaps were significantly smaller, and most species had lower niche breadths, on the marsh with more diverse vegetation.

40|$|Discharging heated {{water through}} {{submerged}} vertical round ports {{located at the}} bottom of a receiving water body is a currently used method of waste heat disposal. The prediction of the temperature reduction in the near field of the buoyant jet is a problem of environmental concern. The mechanics of a vertical axisymmetric buoyant jet in shallow water is theoretically and experimentally investigated. Four flow regimes with distinct hydrodynamic properties are discerned in the vicinity of the jet: the buoyant jet region, the surface impingement region, the internal hydraulic jump, and the stratified counterflow region. An analytical framework is formulated for each region. The coupling of the solutions of the four regions yields a prediction of the near field stability as well as the temperature reduction of the buoyant discharge.

40|$|Of {{the energy}} {{dissipation}} {{that takes place}} in violent breaking waves, some is accounted for by work done against the buoyancy of bubbles, and some by work done in generating splashes that may rise to elevations far above the crest. In deep water the probability of encountering air in such conditions varies from almost zero at large <b>submergences</b> to almost unity at high elevations. Between these extremes in regular long-crested waves, there is a two dimensional continuum of time-dependent ensemble-averaged void fractions. A detailed knowledge of this distribution would represent a major contribution {{to a better understanding of}} the process of wave breaking, but largely for practical reasons, little of this information exists. Previous studies of air entrainment beneath breaking waves have made use of a variety of techniques including local conductivity probes (Cox & Shin, 2003; Hoque 2002), global conductivity probes (Lamarre & Melville, 1994), acoustic techniques and laser methods (Hwung & Jih, 1993). Many of these have shortcomings such as large measurement volumes, limited sensitivity at at least one end of the range of void fractions, or probes that are significantly intrusive. This paper describes detailed measurements made with an instrument that detects individual air/water interfaces over extremely small areas at high frequency.

40|$|Purpose of the Study: Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the development of oxygen storage capacity in diving animals, but {{few studies have examined}} the development of oxygen store usage in these animals. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to be air-breathing marine predators which exhibit continuous, long-duration, deep dives in the pelagic Pacific Ocean. Despite several previous attempts to calculate the duration allotted towards diving in an aerobic state, these animals consistently surpass this diving duration and repeatedly exhibit short surface intervals between dives. This information, suggests these animals are dramatically reducing their oxygen consumption (V 02) during diving, compared to the V 02 data used to predict aerobic dive durations. Additionally, little work has been done investigating the development of the "dive response" in marine mammals. This basic, physiological response to breath-holding and submersion allow individuals to achieve a greater reduction in V 02 ??? Information regarding the developmental aspects of this diving response in concert with an understanding on V 02 reductions during a diving state can assist in understanding the energetic demands and processes these animals face. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the role of development on; a) the diving response and b) the ability to reduce V 02 during breath-holds. Procedure: To determine the role of development on both the diving response and VOl during breath-holds, this study investigated V 02 and blood-gas use during voluntary rest-associated apneas and voluntary <b>submergences</b> in 17 weaned northern elephant seal pups.

(1) Concerning the artificial reefs submerged in this sea-front it may be said that although {{there were a lot}} of differences among the materials, measures, scales and the time elapsed since the respective <b>submergences,</b> there was almost no difference among the fish gathering effectiveness. Namely, through the whole reefs the sorts of the fish gathered around the reefs were as mentioned in the following : at the upper layer of the reefs we could observe the fries of Blue sprat Spratelloides japonicus; Saurel Trachurus japonicus; Chiken grunt Parapristipoma trilineatum; and at the middle layer of the reefs such big, sized fishes as Chiken grunt Parapristipoma trilineatum; Red sea bream snapper Chrysophnys major; Stone bream Oplegnathus fasciatus Thick lip bream Plectorhynchus pictus and Flat fish Paralichthys olibaceus could be observed. (2) The trade mark of the 'good reef' might be fixed as in the following, [○a] the fact that the reef should be more than 4 m in its height, [○b] that the concrete blocks should be deposited to form a high hill-like figure, [○c] that the concrete blocks should be submerged to form a sort of congregation consisting of the individual reefs having different constructions. Of these three, the reef having the shape of two-headed-hill was fixed to be the best one, with the excellent capacity to have gathered 2 or 3 tons of Chiken grunt Parapristipoma trilineatum schools around it. 昭和 60 年 7 月 30 日より 7 月 31 日にかけ,吹上浜の南端にあたる加世田市沖合海域において, 6 個所の人工魚礁を潜水観察し,魚礁の形態,埋没,付着生物,蝟集魚について下記のような知見を得た。(1) 研究の対象とした魚礁は,種類,規模,経過年数の異なるものであるが,魚群の蝟集構造は類似したものが多く,全ての魚礁において,キビナゴ,マアジ,イサキの稚魚が魚礁上の広い空間に互いに棲み分けして占位しており,また魚礁周辺には,イサキ,マダイ,イシダイ,コロダイ,ヒラメ等が群棲しているのを認めた。(2) 優れた集魚効果をもつ魚礁としては,頂高が 4 mとかなり高い山型のコンクリートブロック魚礁と構造の異なるコンクリートブロックの集合した魚礁があげられる。中でも 2 山型の形態をもつ魚礁は, 2 ~ 3 トンのイサキを蝟集させており,優れた魚礁効果を発揮している...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the need to}} know the unsteady forces and moments on an underwater vehicle in finite depth water, at small enough <b>submergences</b> for it to be influenced by sea waves. The forces are those due to the waves themselves as well as the radiation forces due to unsteady vehicle motions. Knowledge of these forces and the mass distribution of the vehicle allow solution of the equations of motion at a single frequency. Since the theory is linear, any incident wave field can be decomposed into the sum of many individual single frequency sinusoidal waves. The motions due to each frequency component can then be added together to obtain the total predicted vehicle motions. The wave forces are due to the undisturbed sea wave plus those due to the diffracted wave necessary to satisfy boundary conditions on the vehicle. The long used strip theory for ships, with the inviscid flow approximation, is modified for finite depth and inclusion of lift forces on the vehicle fins. The two dimensional solutions for the forces on each strip are found by a different method than is commonly used for strip theory. This form of the theory is easier to deal with and requires much less computing time than a fully three-dimensional approach. Experiments are conducted and their results are compared with the theory. Excellent agreement is found between the theoretical and experimental wave forces, including the diffracted wave. It is shown that inclusion of the forces on the fins not only improves the theoretical wave forces, but also brings the results of theory for the radiation forces and moments due to vehicle motions much closer to the experimental values that the theory without inclusion of fin lift forces...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide coasts are {{globally}} {{threatened by}} the effects of shore erosion, with increasing consequences from both a social and economic point of view. In recent decades the use of environmentally friendly artificial submerged barriers have been receiving an increasing interest from the research, due to a high biological compatibility associated to shore protection. Among them, Reef BallTM (RB) {{represents one of the}} most commonly used environmentally friendly modules. The latter was originally employed for biological enhancement, and more recently for the shoreline stabilization of high valued sites. To this specific aim, RBs modules can be arranged in rows, according to different configurations, to realize submerged breakwaters even of significant width. However, in spite of the clear environmental benefit deriving from the adoption of similar structures, their application is still affected by large uncertainties in the estimation of the hydraulic characteristics of the wave-barrier interaction. In particular, very limited studies exist providing equations for the prediction of the effectiveness of Reef ball structures, generally focused on very peculiar and uncommon configurations. In order to produce a systematic characterization of the hydraulic properties of these breakwaters, and overcome the abovementioned limitations, a wide experimental campaign consisting in 1, 440 tests has been conducted with irregular waves in the flume of the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering (DICEA) of the University of Naples “Federico II”. In these tests a wide range of <b>submergences,</b> wave attacks and configurations was investigated, in order to analyse the behaviour or RB barriers under breaking and non-breaking waves. To the Author‟s knowledge, this represents the widest experimental investigation on this specific type of submerged barrier. The most relevant aspects related to the wave-barrier interaction have been addressed, namely the wave breaking, the rate of energy dissipation, the wave set-up and the variation in the wave spectrum. In particular, predictive equations have been proposed for the estimation of the transmission coefficients defined both in terms of wave heights and periods. More specifically, the comparison between the DICEA data and literature equations allowed to develop a new conceptual approach for the assessment of the rate of energy dissipation of RB barriers. Furthermore, the analyses performed allowed a better comprehension of the overall hydraulic behaviour of these structures, especially for what concerns breaking occurrence and typological characterization, and RB barrier‟s influence on nearshore circulation...|$|R
