25|$|The New Zealand wrens are endemic and {{restricted}} to the main and offshore islands of New Zealand; {{they have not been}} found on any of the outer islands such as the Chathams or the Kermadec Islands. Prior to the arrival of humans in New Zealand (about 1280 AD), they had a widespread distribution across the North and South Islands and on Stewart Island/Rakiura. The range of the rifleman and bushwren included southern beech forest and podocarp-broadleaf forest, with the range of the bushwren also including coastal forest and scrub, particularly the Stewart Island subspecies. The New Zealand rock wren is specialised for the alpine environment, in areas of low scrub and scree from 900 m up to 2,400 m. Contrary to its other common name (the <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>wren),</b> fossil evidence shows it was more widespread in the past and once lived on the North Island. Lyall's wren was once thought to have been {{restricted to the}} tiny Stephens Island in Cook Strait, but fossil evidence has shown the species was once widespread on both the North and South Islands. The stout-legged wren was similarly found on both islands, but fossils of the long-billed wren have only been found on the South Island. Fossils of the long-billed wren are far less common than those of the other species, in fact, its bones are the rarest fossil finds in New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|Rats {{arrived on}} Big <b>South</b> Cape <b>Island</b> in 1963, accidentally {{introduced}} as they {{escaped from the}} boats of visiting muttonbirders. Only a swift rescue operation by the New Zealand wildlife service (the present day Department of Conservation) saved both species from extinction by the skin of their teeth, while the rats' predation soon condemned to extinction the local populations of the <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> snipe, bush <b>wren</b> and greater short-tailed bat.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand wrens {{evolved in}} the absence of mammals for many {{millions}} of years, and the family was losing the ability to fly. Three species are thought to have lost the power of flight, the stout-legged wren, the long-billed wren, and the Stephens <b>Island</b> <b>wren.</b> The skeletons of these species have massively reduced keels in the sternum, and the flight feathers of the Stephens <b>Island</b> <b>wren</b> also indicate flightlessness. Contemporary accounts of the Stephens <b>Island</b> <b>wrens</b> describe the species as scurrying on the ground rather than flying.|$|R

50|$|The New Zealand {{rock wren}} (Xenicus gilviventris) {{is a small}} New Zealand wren (family Acanthisittidae) endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Its Māori names include pīwauwau ("little {{complaining}} bird"), mātuitui, and tuke ("twitch", after its bobbing motion). Outside New Zealand it is sometimes known as the rockwren or <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>wren</b> to distinguish it from the unrelated rock wren of North America.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand wrens {{are tiny}} birds; the rifleman is the {{smallest}} of New Zealand's birds. Their length ranges from 7 to 10 cm, and their weight from as little as 5-7 g for the rifleman to an estimated 50 g for the extinct stout-legged wren. The <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>wren</b> (and probably the bush wren) weighs between 14 and 22 g, and the extinct long-billed wren weighed around 30 g.|$|E

The plumage {{of males and females}} were alike in the Stephens <b>Island</b> <b>wren</b> and the bush wren; the rock wren shows slight sexual dimorphism in its plumage and differences between the plumage of riflemen are pronounced, with the male having bright green upperparts and the female being duller and browner.|$|R

50|$|The {{relationships}} between the genera and species are poorly understood. The extant genus Acanthisitta has one species, the rifleman, and the other surviving genus, Xenicus, includes the rock wren and the recently extinct bush wren.

The stout-legged wren (genus Pachyplichas) was originally split into two species, but more recent research disputes this. The final genus was Dendroscansor, which had one species, the long-billed wren.|$|R
