2500|$|The Deming Prize is [...] one of {{the highest}} awards on TQM (Total Quality Management) in the world that recognizes both {{individuals}} for their contributions to the field of Total Quality Management (TQM) and businesses that have successfully implemented TQM. [...] It was established in 1951 to honor W. Edwards Deming who contributed greatly to Japan’s proliferation of <b>statistical</b> <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> after World War II. His teachings helped Japan build its foundation by which the level of Japan’s product quality has been recognized as the highest in the world, was originally designed to reward Japanese companies for major advances in quality improvement. Over the years it has grown, under the guidance of the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) to where it is now also available to non-Japanese companies, albeit usually operating in Japan, and also to individuals recognized as having made major contributions to the advancement of quality. The awards ceremony is broadcast every year in Japan on national television.|$|E

One {{of the biggest challenges}} in crowdsourcing is <b>quality</b> <b>control,</b> since high <b>quality</b> results cannot be expected from crowdworkers who are not necessarily very capable or motivated. Several <b>statistical</b> crowdsourcing <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> methods for binary and multinomial questions have been proposed. In this paper, we consider tasks where crowdworkers are asked to arrange multiple items in the correct order. We propose a probabilistic generative model of crowd answers by extending a distance-based order model to incorporate worker ability, and propose an efficient estimation algorithm. Experiments using real crowdsourced datasets show the advantage of the proposed method over a baseline method. ...|$|R
