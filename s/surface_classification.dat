40|$|This paper compares {{two methods}} for {{correcting}} passive or active microwave surface precipitation estimates based on hydrometeors sensed aloft that may evaporate before landing. These corrections were derived using {{two years of}} data from 516 globally distributed rain gauges and passive millimeter-wave Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU) aboard three NOAA satellites (N 15, N 16, and N 18). The first correction reduces rms differences between rain gauges and AMSU annual precipitation accumulations (mm) by a separate factor for each infrared-based <b>surface</b> <b>classification,</b> while the second correction factor uses a 3 - 2 - 1 neural network (NN) trained using both <b>surface</b> <b>classification</b> and annual average relative humidity profiles. Different data were used for training and accuracy evaluation. The NN results agreed with rain gauges better than did <b>surface</b> <b>classification</b> corrections alone. The rms annual accumulation errors relative to the 516 uncorrected rain gauges using AMSU with <b>surface</b> <b>classification</b> and NN corrections were 223 and 209 mm/yr, respectively, compared to 152 mm/yr for GPCP, which incorporates rain gauge data and data from more satellite sensors...|$|E

The resulting retrievals from the U. S. NOAA- 15 and NOAA- 16 operational weather satellites are compared with average annual accumulations (mm yr− 1) for 2006 – 07 observed by 787 rain gauges globally distributed across 11 <b>surface</b> <b>classifications</b> defined using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer infrared spectral images and two classifications defined geographically. Most <b>surface</b> <b>classifications</b> had bias ratios for AMSU/gauges {{that ranged from}} 0. 88 to 1. 59, although higher systematic AMSU overestimates by factors of 2. 4, 3. 1, and 9 were found for grassland, shrubs over bare ground, and pure bare ground, respectively. The retrievals were then empirically corrected using these observed biases for each surface type. Global images of corrected average annual accumulations of rain, snow, and convective and stratiform precipitation are presented for the period 2002 – 07.

40|$|Teichmüller shape {{space is}} a finite {{dimensional}} Riemannian manifold, where each point represents {{a class of}} surfaces, which are conformally equivalent, and a path represents a deformation process from one shape to the other. Two surfaces {{in the real world}} correspond to the same point in the Teichmüller space, only if they can be conformally mapped to each other. Teichmüller shape space can be used for <b>surface</b> <b>classification</b> purpose in shape modeling. This work focuses on the computation of the coordinates of high genus surfaces in the Teichmüller space. The coordinates are called as Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. The main idea is to decompose the surface to pairs of hyperbolic pants. Each pair of pants is a genus zero surface with three boundaries, equipped with hyperbolic metric. Furthermore, all the boundaries are geodesics. Each pair of hyperbolic pants can be uniquely described by the lengths of its boundaries. The way of gluing different pairs of pants can be represented by the twisting angles between two adjacent pairs of pants which share a common boundary. The algorithms are based on Teichmüller space theory in conformal geometry, and they utilize the discrete surface Ricci flow. Most computations are carried out using hyperbolic geometry. The method is automatic, rigorous and efficient. The Teichmüller shape space coordinates can be used for <b>surface</b> <b>classification</b> and indexing.
