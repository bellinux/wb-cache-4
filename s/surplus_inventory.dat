25|$|When {{decision-makers}} {{have determined}} the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they {{turn their attention}} to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. the need to clear <b>surplus</b> <b>inventory)</b> or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed {{in the course of a}} single planning period or across a single year. Typically store managers have the necessary latitude to vary prices on individual lines provided that they operate within the parameters of the overall strategic approach.|$|E

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is {{evaluating}} {{options for}} rendering its <b>surplus</b> <b>inventories</b> of {{highly enriched uranium}} (HEU) incapable of being used to produce nuclear weapons.

Now, by diluting its concentration of the fissile {sup 235 }U isotope in a uranium blending process, the weapons capability of HEU can be eliminated {{in a manner that}} is reversible only through isotope enrichment, and therefore, highly resistant to proliferation. To the extent that can be economically and technically justified, the down-blended uranium product will be made suitable for use as commercial reactor fuel.

40|$|A {{supply chain}} {{consists}} {{of all parties}} involved, directly or indirectly, in fulfilling a customer request or demand. The supply chain not only includes the manufacturers and suppliers,but also transporters, warehouses, retailers, and finally the end consumers themselves. The objective of every supply chain is to maximize the overall value generated. The value a supply chain generates {{is the difference between}} what the final product is worth to the customer and the effort the supply chain expends in filling the customer’s request. An important phenomenon in Supply Chain Management is known as bullwhip effect (BWE), which suggests that the demand variability increases as one moves up a supply chain. Bullwhip effect is an undesirable phenomenon in the supply chain which exacerbates the supply chain performance. The impact of BWE is to increase manufacturing cost, inventory cost, replenishment lead time, transportation cost, labor cost for shipping and receiving, cost for building surplus capacity and holding <b>surplus</b> <b>inventories,</b> and to decrease level of product availability and relationship across the supply chain. Various factors can cause bullwhip effect, one of which is customer demand forecasting. In this study, impact of forecasting methods on the bullwhip effect and mean square error has been considered. The preceding study highlights the effect of forecasting technique, order processing cost and demand pattern on BWE and mean square error (MSE). The BWE and MSE have been evaluated using MATLAB coding.

40|$|The United States (U. S.) has {{identified}} 61. 5 metric tons (MT) of plutonium that is permanently excess {{to use in}} nuclear weapons programs, including 47. 2 MT of weapons-grade plutonium. Except for materials that remain in use for programs outside of national defense, including programs for nuclear-energy development, the <b>surplus</b> <b>inventories</b> will be stored safely by the Department of Energy (DOE) and then transferred to facilities that will prepare the plutonium for permanent disposition. Some items will be disposed as transuranic waste, low-level waste, or spent fuel. The remaining surplus plutonium will be managed through: (1) the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility (FFF), to be constructed at the Savannah River Site (SRS), where the plutonium will be converted to fuel that will be irradiated in civilian power reactors and later disposed to a high-level waste (HLW) repository as spent fuel; (2) the SRS H-Area facilities, by dissolving and transfer to HLW systems, also for disposal to the repository; or (3) alternative immobilization techniques that would provide durable and secure disposal. From {{the beginning of the}} U.

Because many of the items are stored without extensive analyses of their current chemical content, the characterization involves three interacting components: laboratory sample analysis, if available; non-destructive assay data; and rigorous evaluation of records for the processing history for items and inventory groups.
