ENGLISH ABSTRACT: My study aims to {{ascertain}} whether interpersonal <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> {{have a role to}} play in the healthy development of a school as an organisation. My specific focus is on how educators experience these relationships, and how they impact on the educators' commitment to a particular school. My research design consisted of three case studies. I used a semi-structured questionnaire with each case and at a later date had a group discussion. My analysis of the questionnaires' data provided tentative themes for inclusion and further exploration in the group discussion. The combination of two data production phases resulted in the confirmation and expansion of the data. My study shows that various factors impact on interpersonal <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> within a school. These interpersonal <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> have a bearing on the continuance, moral and alienative dimensions of commitment, and impact on staff retention and job performance. They also impact directly on the health of the educators. Thus interpersonal <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> would seem to have an important role to play in the development of healthy schools. I conclude by acknowledging the limitations of this study, and recommending further research...|$|R

30|$|Quality may be {{measured}} in many ways, but commonly a threshold approach is employed which maintains a minimum national standard, based on legislation and linked to licensing criteria. In Australia, the national quality accreditation system, called the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System (QIAS) for long day care centres 1, conducted by the National Childcare Accreditation Council (NCAC), has contributed nationally to raising quality standards by requiring minimum entry standards. Although the QIAS {{does not provide a}} clear definition of quality, there are seven areas to measure before approval is given: (1) <b>staff</b> <b>relationship</b> with children and peers, (2) partnerships with families, (3) programming and evaluation, (4) children’s experiences and learning, (5) protective care and safety, (6) health, nutrition and wellbeing and (7) administration procedures to support quality (NCAC, 2006). In a self-report process, centres must address all seven areas in order to achieve accreditation through QIAS. This has had the effect of improving the quality of long day care centres as participation in this process has achieved an accreditation rate of 92 % (NCAC, 2009).|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the current {{structure}} of the hospital governing board and medical <b>staff</b> <b>relationship</b> does not support and promote quality and patient-centered care. The fundamental flaw in the current structure is the interdependent, yet independent and discordant relationships between hospital governing boards and medical staffs. These relationships are described as cultures and fit into three types of 2 ̆ 2 silos 2 ̆ 2 : organizational (the 2 ̆ 2 structural silo 2 ̆ 2); professional (the 2 ̆ 2 professional silo 2 ̆ 2, including the 2 ̆ 2 culture of blame 2 ̆ 2); and the fragmented quality information silo (the 2 ̆ 2 informational silo 2 ̆ 2). While case law, statutory requirements and regulatory expectations clearly state that governing boards are ultimately responsible for quality of patient care, governing boards delegate these functions to medical staff without having sufficient information to measure and monitor quality. As a result, problems manifest because of these failures of oversight and compliance. Dramatic lapses in quality occur due to overuse, underuse, and misuse of healthcare services. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities from improved quality and patient safety, as a strategic business driver, cannot be seized until the underlying structural flaws are understood and addressed. This article proposes that solutions become apparent when the various health care constituencies are educated about these cultural impacts and when multidisciplinary bodies, with board leadership and direct authority, integrate and consider quality information...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an action {{research}} project {{concerned with the}} effect of a change initiative on primary teachers' behaviour. It involves trying out a change approach and then refining and testing that approach in a consciously conducted change experiment. The study has two investigative strands. Both of these build on previous research into change that I conducted at a school in which I was working in 1986. The 1986 research described difficulties I had in conducting school self evaluation {{and the development of a}} revised approach to change. The product of the 1986 study was a change model. One strand of this study is an investigation into the effectiveness of that model in supporting teachers moving along the path to change. The second investigative strand of the study is concerned with the wider effect of implementing the change model on <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> in primary schools. The phrase 'changing the rules' in the title of the study harks back to an article by Helen Simons (1987) in which she suggests that activities such as self evaluation are 'against the rules of schools as institutions'. One element of this second strand of the study is an investigation into the rules governing <b>staff</b> <b>relationships.</b> It examines whether the closed behaviours that initially undermined the 1986 initiative are more widely prevalent in primary schools. The 1986 change initiative appeared to leave a residual effect of increased openness and collaboration between staff. A further element of this strand of the study is therefore an examination of whether implementing the change model affects <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> in other primary schools. The study examines the extent to which the change model acts to dismantle closed patterns of interaction between staff and replace them with more open ones. During the time that has elapsed between setting out and concluding this research there has been a growing focus on <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> in schools. Reviewing research into school culture Fullan (1991) suggests that "we have not yet made much head way in how to establish collaborative cultures in schools". This study is an investigation into a possible process by which the rules of schools I have known as a teacher, deputy headteacher and headteacher might be changed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Encounters between {{patients}} and medical staff {{are the foundation}} for building the patient–medical <b>staff</b> <b>relationship,</b> which is a keystone of care. We investigated perspectives of patients, caregivers, and medical staff related to greetings in oncology practice. Methods: A total of 186 patients (median age, 62 years) and 104 caregivers (median age, 54 years) visiting the outpatient clinics at the Davidoff Cancer Institute completed a questionnaire about greeting-related preferences. Similar questionnaires were completed by 93 staff members (physicians, nurses, secretaries, and psychosocial team). Results: Overall, patients preferred to be addressed infor-mally (ie, by their given name) during first and subsequent meetings with their physician (59 % and 75 % of patients, re-spectively). However, most physicians (79 %) addressed pa-tients more formally (using surname or full name). Overall, 53 % of patients wanted the physician to shake their hand. Physi-cians reported shaking hands with their patients at the begin-ning (46 %) or end (71 %) of the first meeting. Most patients (76 %) wanted physicians to formally introduce themselves (by their full name) and mention their academic degree (65 %). For other oncology professionals, a majority of patients (63 %) preferred an informal introduction (by given name only). No major differences were observed {{between patients}} ’ and care-givers ’ perspectives. Conclusion: This survey provides insights that may help on-cology professionals in building relationships with their patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{research}} {{studies have found}} that the better the quality of practice environments in hospitals, the better the outcomes for nurses and patients. Practice environment may influence nurses' ability to individualize care but the detailed relationship between individualized care and the professional practice environment has not been investigated widely. Some evidence exists about the association of practice environments with the level of individualization of nursing care, but this evidence is based on single national studies. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether nurses' views of their professional practice environment associate with their views of the level of care individualization in seven countries. DESIGN: This study had an international, multisite, prospective, cross-sectional, exploratory survey design. SETTINGS: The study involved acute orthopedic and trauma surgical inpatient wards (n= 91) in acute care hospitals (n= 34) in seven countries, Cyprus, Finland, Greece, the State of Kansas, USA, Portugal, Sweden, and Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Nurses (n= 1163), registered or licensed practical, working in direct patient care, in orthopedic and trauma inpatient units in acute care hospitals in seven countries participated in the study. METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires, including two instruments, the Revised Professional Practice Environment and the Individualized Care Scale-Nurse (Individualized Care Scale-Nurse A and B) were used for data collection. Data were analyzed statistically using descriptive statistics, simultaneous multiple regression analysis, and generalized linear model. RESULTS: Two regression models were applied to assess the predictive validity of the Revised Professional Practice Environment on the Individualized Care Scale-Nurse-A and B. The results showed that elements of the professional practice environment were associated with care individualization. Internal work motivation, cultural sensitivity, control over practice, teamwork, and <b>staff</b> <b>relationship</b> with physicians were predictors of support (Individualized Care Scale-A) for and the delivery (Individualized Care Scale-B) of individualized care. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that environment aspect could explain variations in care individualization. These findings support the assertion that individualized care needs to be understood in a broader context than the immediate nurse-patient relationship and that careful development of the care environment may be an effective way to improve care quality and outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} social capital on market power has been an {{interesting}} topic since the early 2000. The mainstream literature evaluates mainly {{on the impact of}} physical capital on the market power, whereas the new developed literature focuses also on the social capital in analyzing market power. In this present study, a comprehensive analysis on market power is based on two important determinants, entrepreneurial orientation and social capital. Entrepreneurship orientation is expected to contribute positively and significantly on market power. The same positive significant effect is also expected from social capital to market power. Using the sample of small and medium enterprises in East Java, this present study analyzes comprehensively the impact {{of social capital}} on market power. The analysis is performed on both quantitative data and qualitative data. The quantitative method includes reliability test, validity test, explanatory factor analysis of Kaiser-Meyer Olkin’s and Bartlett’s, and regression analysis. The qualitative method is based on an interpretative approach on interview, storytelling, narrative, and coding. The quantitative analysis finds out four important findings. Firstly, the data used in the analysis is reliable and uni-dimension, with 13 items of questions represent market power, 28 items of questions represent social capital, and 24 items of questions represent entrepreneurial orientation. Secondly, validity test confirms that the constructed dataset is valid to be used to perform factor analysis. Thirdly, the factor analysis shows that each latent variable has at least two items that forming specific patterns within the variable. Fourthly, the regression analysis indicates that sharing goal, relationship with suppliers, and relationship with distributors are three key factors of social capital that significant effects on market power The qualitative analysis finds five important points. Firstly, price reduction plays pivotal role in retail products with cross elasticity. Secondly, there is interdependence among firms on price strategy.

Background: Limited data are available regarding the quality of pain care in the hospitalized patient. This is particularly valid for data that allow for comparison of pain outcomes from one hospital to another. Such data are critical for numerous reasons, including allowing patients and policy-makers to make data-driven decisions, and to guide hospitals {{in their efforts to}} improve pain care. The Hospital Quality Alliance was recently created by federal policy makers and private organizations in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services to conduct patient surveys to evaluate their experience including pain control during their hospitalization. Methods: In March 2008, the results of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey was released for review for health care providers and researchers. This survey includes a battery of questions for patients upon discharge from the hospital including pain-related questions and patient satisfaction that provide valuable data regarding pain care nationwide. This study will review the results from the pain questions from this available data set and evaluate the performance of these hospitals in pain care in relationship to patient satisfaction. Furthermore, this analysis will be providing valuable information on how hospital size, geographic location and practice setting {{may play a role in}} pain care in US hospitals. Results: The data indicates that 63 % of patients gave a high rating of global satisfaction for their care, and that an additional 26 % of patients felt that they had a moderate level of global satisfaction with the global quality of their care. When correlated to satisfaction with pain control, the relationship with global satisfaction and &ldquo;always&rdquo; receiving good pain control was highly correlated (r &gt; 0. 84). In respect to the other HCAHPS components, we found that the patient and health care <b>staff</b> <b>relationship</b> with the patient is also highly correlated with pain relief (r &gt; 0. 85). The patients&rsquo; reported level of pain relief was significantly different based upon hospital ownership, with government owned hospitals receiving the highest pain relief, followed by nonprofit hospitals, and lastly proprietary hospitals. Hospital care acuity also had an impact on the patient&rsquo;s {{perception of}} their pain care; patients cared for in acute care hospitals had lower levels of satisfaction than critical access hospitals. Conclusions: The results of this study are a representation of the experiences of patients in US hospitals with regard to pain care specifically and the need for improved methods of treating and evaluating pain care. This study provides the evidence needed for hospitals to make pain care a priority in to achieve patient satisfaction throughout the duration of their hospitalization. Furthermore, future research should be developed to make strategies for institutions and policy-makers to improve and optimize patient satisfaction with pain care.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore and {{describe}} the diversity in residential care and treatment for young people in Sweden on the individual level, the interactional level and the contextual level. This thesis consists of five papers based on two studies. Papers I and II use data from a survey of residential care for young persons in Sweden. Papers III, IV and V are based on qualitative data from interviews with staff and residents in a single treatment home. In Paper I, different residential settings were compared according {{to the problems of}} the youths in care, the mean length of stay, staff characteristics and aspects of the care and treatment provided. In Paper II the aim was to identify different approaches to treatment and investigate whether these approaches were related to characteristics in the home, the staff and type of care. In Paper III the aim was to examine whether there are personal approaches to treatment among careworkers. In Paper IV the adolescents’ experiences of living in the treatment home were explored. The intention in Paper V was to describe how careworkers and young persons have perceived their relationships with each other. According to the results reported in Paper I, different settings in residential care are related to differences in the care and treatment delivered. Institutions run by the public sector have better educated staff and a higher staff-resident ratio than privately run institutions. Despite this, they were found to be more restrictive in their intake and had youths with fewer problems, especially delinquency and other antisocial behaviours. There were indications that the longer time in care was related more to the setting per se than {{to the needs of the}} young persons. In Paper II the diversity of residential care became evident when the homes described the care they give in their own words. Despite this diversity it was possible to identify five different approaches to care and treatment that different homes agreed with to different extents. These approaches were found to be related to the variety within residential care. In Paper III six different intentions in the care delivered could be identified. The distribution of each careworker’s statements created a pattern that illustrated the careworker’s general treatment perceptions. This pattern made it possible to study and compare different careworkers’ perceptions of treatment which indicated that each careworker had a rather unique and stable personal approach to treatment. In Paper IV interviews with the six young persons conducted two or three years after they had left the institution, revealed that living in the same institution during the same time period does not mean sharing the same experiences. Paper V illustrates how interactions between the young person’s needs, his/her former experiences of relationships, the climate in the youth group and the psychological availability of the careworkers could influence the young person’s need of support as well as experiences of support. In conclusion, diversity in residential care was found on multiple levels: on the individual level, the interactional level and on contextual levels such as settings and approaches to treatment. It was also found that some of these differences, for example careworkers’ perception of treatment and institutions’ approaches to treatment, are not only possible to describe but also to “measure”.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationships}} and resultant meanings {{that people have}} for the place of Jenolan Caves, the most visited cave tourist site in Australia. The {{aim of the research}} project was to: further our understanding of the social dimensions of caves tourism in order to comment on issues and practices related to sustainability. The question was approached from a constructionist perspective, which assumes that the world of human perception is not real in an absolute sense but is made up and shaped by cultural and linguistic constructs; it is a constructing of knowledge about reality not constructing reality itself. The findings are based on interviews with staff, visitors and other people who regularly associate with the place of Jenolan Caves. The highlight, and perhaps the most exciting finding, was the rich depth of meaning that Jenolan is given by a broad range of people. Staff and visitors articulated a sense of passion, care and physical engagement. The obvious emotion of place reflects the embodied nature of place experience, other facets of which include the active and sensual ways we interact, and make sense of places we visit. Although sight dominates the experience the sound, touch and smell in a cave are also essential ingredients of the experience. It was clear that emotion is a response we have to place; emotion is also central in the construction of Jenolan as a tourism place. In particular passion and enthusiasm oscillates between visitors and staff, creating a connection between the two and becoming a central facet of Jenolan. Emotions relating to place are also negative and there was a clear tension for many people in close association with Jenolan between protecting place and selling or using place. Two dominant discourses that people draw on to make sense of Jenolan are stewardship and commodification, these are ways of making sense of Jenolan that have different primary goals but in practice are woven together. The tension exists as a very real, expressed frustration, disillusionment, and at times anger for those that work at Jenolan. It is time this tension is acknowledged, {{if for no other reason}} than it will inevitably have an impact on the interdependent relationships that exist between staff, visitors and others. That is, a satisfactory visitor experience is vulnerable to negative changes in <b>staff</b> <b>relationship</b> to place. Within the managing organisation, and across a portion of the relevant disciplines, the embodied nature of place experience and interdependence between peoples and place is not fully recognised. It is not fully articulated within the Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust, and in likelihood is not articulated in other protected area agencies. The implications of these findings for the ongoing sustainability of protected area tourist sites, such as Jenolan Caves, is that discourses and approaches are required that open the management system to the sensual, emotional, and interdependent nature of place. A systematic monitoring approach of Visitor Impact Management has been adopted by Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust. On reflection the aim of such an approach is to enable the organisation to identify when strategies need to be altered, that is to learn. The findings indicate that much about the visitor experience is emotional and relates to discourses or ways of seeing that aren’t fully articulated in the organisation. The findings also indicate strong links between place interpretations of visitors, staff, the organisation and others. It is possible that frameworks such as Visitor Impact Management, which examine a component of place meaning in a systematic way, will facilitate solutions to many visitor related issues, but when the issues relate to tacit processes in the organisation or arise from unfamiliar discourses will not be recognised and/or dealt with. Visitor Impact Management located in the broader context of organisational learning may provide a process that opens the organisation to the full depth of place meaning, and provide tools for engaging with a broader variety of meaning-making discourses. Qualitative methodology was adopted to answer these explorative questions. Specifically ethnographic methods of data collection were used: interviews, observations, and document analysis. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 79 staff and locals, and 140 visitors.

40|$|Background: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in childcare centers that covered three states {{in the northern part of}} Malaysia. Thus, the Quality Improvements and Accreditation System (QIAS) instrument was used for this purpose. This is reflected in the seven (7) proportion quality areas in the QIAS, which are; <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> with children and peers; partnerships with families; programming and evaluation; children’s experiences and learning; protective care and safety; health, nutrition and well being; and managing to support quality. Objective: The objective of this paper is to disseminate findings and share best practices of early childcare operators, providers, principals, and teachers that handled children from birth to 6 years. It aimed to identify the level of quality management practices in childcare centers in Malaysia. Results: Data collected through the questionnaire depict a slightly different picture where the childcare providers and teachers reported that their practices were moderate in terms of <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> with children and peers, partnerships with families, programming and evaluation, children’s experiences and learning, and managing to support quality except protective care and safety which was high. Conclusion: This QIAS instrument is able to serve as a guidelines to the childcare center on what is needed and required to be look into and take into consideration in order to ensure the quality of childcare centers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of family, peer and academic <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> {{on the experience of}} students during the initial transition period into a tertiary bridging program at a regional university to determine how these relationships were associated with the students’ sense of academic commitment and identity, self-efficacy and study behaviours. Participants comprised a sample of 299 students from two semester cohorts, including 150 aged 24 years or below. A custom questionnaire was developed that measured a number of study behaviours, the quality of the supportive nature of peer, family and <b>staff</b> <b>relationships,</b> academic selfefficacy and academic identity. The dominant factor in the experience of the program for young females was found to be the quality of the supportive relationships available from all sources, with staff support being the dominant influence on their sense of academic identity and self-efficacy, while supportive peers were found to be associated with improved academic behaviours. Relationships were found to have a much lower association with academic identity and self-efficacy for young males. Supportive relationships were strongly associated with improved academic identity and academic self-efficacy in older participants, particularly for older male participants where family support strongly associated with their development of emotional commitment and identity. The study supports the use of different approaches based upon gender and age for the induction of students into a tertiary bridging program...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to review and to validate the nursing diagnosis Noncompliance in people with hypertension, basing on the assumption that when promoting the validation of a nursing diagnosis, the nurse will have concrete data to help the individual adequate follow up therapy. Currently, the diagnosis Noncompliance features six defining characteristics and 28 related factors, divided into individual, related to care plan health, the network and the health system. After an integrative literature review, developed from the databases CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, Cochrane Library and the CAPES Thesis Database, using the descriptors "nursing diagnosis", "patient compliance" and "treatment refusal" and their corresponding in Portuguese and Spanish, in addition to descriptors uncontrolled "therapeutic adherence" and "adherence to treatmentâ, the elements of diagnosis were reviewed and had their constituent/operational definitions developed (stage A). Subsequently, these definitions were evaluated for 29 experts in nursing terminology and/or therapeutic adherence (stage B-phase 1), using the methodological procedure of Ferhingâs Validation Model (1987) and the adequacy of these definitions was also evaluated (stage B-phase 2) by 26 experts. The validation at this stage produced the following results: change in the diagnosis definition of some defining characteristics and related factors, exclusion of some those elements and creating new components of the diagnosis. Thereafter, the proposed new diagnosis features and factors have been clinically validated on 128 patients with hypertension treated by Primary Health of the County of Crato (stage C). For this stage, the data were collected by the researcher and submitted to two experts with clinical and nursing diagnosis experience. After clinical validation, diagnosis Noncompliance now has six defining characteristics: Two main characteristics (Inadequate management of non-medication treatment and Behavior indicative of failure in adhesion); No secondary feature; Four characteristics of little relevance (Difficulty in meeting decisions agreed with the health staff, Inadequate management of drug treatment, Evidence of exacerbation of hypertension and Evidence of development of complications). The factors listed were all rated as very relevant in clinical practice, although the content validation have listed all of them as principal. The factors were distributed as follows: Individual (Loss in personal skills, Insufficient knowledge to the sequence of drug treatment regimen and non-medication treatment, Individual values and beliefs related to health/disease process, Cultural influences); Related to the support network (Lack of support from significant persons); Relating to the treatment (Drug treatment regimen complexity, Financial cost of treatment, Duration of continuous treatment, Adverse effects of treatment) and related system and team of health (Failed coverage of the health system; Ability insufficient education of health professionals, Patient-health <b>staff</b> <b>relationship</b> impaired). It was considered that this study provided direction for the efficient use of clinical indicators evaluated, contributing to the improvement of nursing diagnosis Noncompliance and yours constituents. Itâs concluded that the Nursing must take ownership of their technology, aiming to develop and broaden their use, contributing to the improvement of care...|$|E
40|$|Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP), catheter-related {{blood stream}} infection (CRBSI) and pressure ulcers (PU) are well recognized complications in intensive care units (ICUs). Many of these are preventable but can also complicate patient recovery, prolong length of stay, increase costs, morbidity and mortality. In Malaysia, the majority of studies investigating VAP and CRBSI in Malaysia have focussed on identifying risk factors, diagnostic criteria and treatment of ICU-related complications. Further, {{in spite of the}} burden of PU there are limited studies undertaken in Malaysia and few of these have been nurse-led. Importantly, to date there has been limited investigation of the efficacy and effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives and the contextual issues impacting on clinical practice improvement in Malaysia. In spite of the increasing emphasis on quality assurance in Malaysian ICUs there has been a limited focus on nurse-specific interventions and the majority of projects have been initiated by physicians. This study has evaluated the utility of a nurse-led action research project to drive clinical practice improvement in the ICU and is significant in demonstrating the capacity of nurses to critique and control their practice. The project conducted for this thesis was called the Improving health outcomes by preveNting intensiVe care related infEction in Malaysia intenSive care uniT - INVEST study. The INVEST Study as reported in this thesis has been undertaken using an action research approach to improve the uptake of evidence-based strategies to prevent infection in the ICU in the Malaysian cultural context. The aims of this thesis were to identify best practices, evaluate the current nursing practice in prevention of VAP, CRBSI and PU in ICU patients in a single Malaysian ICU, and evaluate the impact of the evidence-based interventions to improve patient outcomes. The specific and research objectives of this study were to: 1. Identify best practice interventions for preventing VAP, CRBSI and PU in the ICU. 2. Document the current rates of VAP, CRBSI and PU in an ICU in Malaysia. 3. Implement an action research intervention to collaboratively develop and implement strategies for improvement 4. Assess the impact of the intervention on clinical outcomes, staff dynamics, work place culture and sustainability of practice change An action research approach was used in this study to involve and empower nurses and drive practice change. A literature review identified that many action research studies conducted in the ICU were mainly most focused on process measures and not outcomes. In this study the data were collected in three phases following the action research cycles which comprised of a period of planning, acting, observation, reflecting and re-planningIn Phase I of the thesis current best practice interventions for the prevention of VAP, CRBSI and PU in ICU are described. A literature search was conducted to identify evidence-based practices (EBP) that were recommended by bodies to improve the prevention of VAP, CRBSI and PU. A core set of nursing activities was identified in preventing the complications of VAP, CRBSI and PU. These were hand washing, hygiene care, positioning of patient, elevation of the head of bed and providing adequate nutrition. Pre- intervention data collection consisted of an environmental scan, including interview with the key stakeholders, patient profiling and a nurse survey. Twenty-one cases of ICU complications were identified in 18 of the 91 patients (19. 8 %) admitted in December 2009. Of the patients, three developed two complications - PU and VAP (two patients) or CRBSI (one patient). The findings indicated that this ICU had a high case load due to the high ICU bed demand. Patients needing ICU care were being nursed in general wards due to the unavailability of ICU beds. Nurses reported a good knowledge of prevention strategies with a mean score of 124. 84 ±SD 14. 66 and reported a high level of positive regard for their professional practice environment {{based on the results of}} Revised Professional Practice Environment (RPPE). Three components had mean scores of ≥ 3 and five 55 %. The nurses reported a positive regard for their practice environment in the pre- and post-intervention groups. The mean scores for each component were comparable for both the pre- and post-intervention groups except for Internal Work Motivation, Control Over Practice and <b>Staff</b> <b>Relationship</b> With Physician. The highest mean scores within the eight components for the post-intervention group were for Internal Work Motivation (M 3. 13; SD 0. 27), Relationship With Physician (M 3. 04; SD 0. 33) and Cultural Sensitivity (M 3. 01; SD 0. 23). The three lowest were for Handling Disagreement and Conflict (2. 80; SD 0. 20), Control Over Practice (2. 71; SD 0. 34) and Teamwork (2. 48; SD 0. 31). There was a reduction in overall complications from 19. 8 % to 8. 7 %. Few nurses in the focus group were optimistic that at least some changes had taken place, and positively improving their knowledge on assessment of patients and some of their common practices in the ICU. The challenge, which they were presently facing was the implementation of hospital information system because most of them were not knowledgeable in information technology. The main outcome of this study was that there was a reduction in number of patients with PU from 16 to 6 in pre and post intervention groups. This reduction of PU was statistically significant (χ[superscript] 2 = 8. 14, df= 1, p= 0. 04). In conclusion whether there was a real improvement in patient care provided due to the interventions given was not able to be determined due to methodological considerations and inability to control for confounders. These data underscore the importance of considering cultural factors, both organisational and societal in quality improvement initiatives and empowering nurses for practice change. A risk management system which acknowledges competing demands in dynamic, real world environments is important to consider in future quality improvement studies. The series of studies presented in this thesis have contributed to understanding of factors influencing implementation and sustainability of quality improvement initiatives in a Malaysia ICU. Information acquired from the thesis will be useful information for further improvement targeting education, services, research, policy and future quality improvement project plans in Malaysia...|$|E
30|$|Third, {{substantial}} United States research (Early et al., 2007; Mashburn et al., 2008) {{confirms the}} importance of process quality as having greater impact than structural quality on children’s overall development. However, in the QIAS only two quality areas (i.e., <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> with children and peers & children’s experiences and learning) out of seven are focused on actual day-to-day experiences between teachers and children. Yet the quality areas are weighted equally, so proportionally, the QIAS provides significantly less emphasis on process quality than structural quality. Furthermore, with QIAS there are insufficient mechanisms for assessing the quality of pedagogy, so process quality is further diminished.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} good quality care at the end of life (EOL) for hospice-enrolled residents in assisted living facilities (ALFs).  Design and Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was used to obtain detailed descriptions of EOL care provided by ALF medication aides, caregivers, nurses, and hospice nurses in urban and rural settings. A semistructured interview guide facilitated interviews where 38 participants described specific examples of care that “went well. ” Results: Findings indicated that the quality and nature of resident–staff and assisted living–hospice <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> are critical in promoting good care at EOL for ALF residents on hospice. Length of the resident's stay in the facility and how well staff knew the resident were associated with the quality of the resident–staff relationship. Respectful collaboration, clear communication, use of complementary knowledge and skills of staff, and shared expectations about the care were associated with positive <b>staff</b> <b>relationships.</b> Also important was ALF administrator support for residents’ dying in place with hospice services.  Implications: ALFs choosing to support residents dying in their facility will benefit from developing systems of care that promote resident–staff relationships and optimize communication and collaboration among ALF care providers and with hospice staff. Hospice programs should design their services to support ALF staff as well as patients and families. Now needed are development and testing of models of care by hospice and ALF to support the care needs of ALF residents at EOL...|$|R

The study attempted to identify features of early childhood settings in which <b>relationships</b> among <b>staff</b> were working well and settings in which they were not. The major themes emerging from a series of interviews of teachers (N= 12) were goal consensus and power sharing in decision making. Successful kindergartens, in which harmonious <b>staff</b> <b>relationships</b> developed, involved all staff in developing philosophical agreement and clarifying roles. Unsuccessful kindergartens, in which staff problems culminated in resignations, evidenced conflict between experienced and inexperienced teachers about teacher roles. Successful kindergartens worked through consensus and hegotiation, while unsuccessful kindergartens worked through the authority of the head teacher or the majority view.
