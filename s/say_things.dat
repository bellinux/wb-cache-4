5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or <b>say</b> <b>things,</b> when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to <b>say</b> <b>things</b> that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Australian actress Simone McAullay {{was cast}} as local hotelkeeper Becca Fisher, with whom Mark Latimer has an adulterous affair. Chibnall had long envisioned Becca as an Australian, {{which made her}} an {{outsider}} in the Broadchurch community. He also relied on the common assumption that Australians often seem bolder than most British, which gave the character license to <b>say</b> <b>things</b> others might not. McAullay received the first two scripts from her agent, and a short written sketch of the Dorset setting. She videotaped an audition {{at her home in}} Sydney, and sent it to Chibnall.|$|E
25|$|She then {{appeared}} in the fourth series along with judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and new judge, Dannii Minogue. However, on The Paul O'Grady Show, aired on 23 October 2007, Osbourne confirmed she would return on the next episode and stated that {{it is part of}} her personality to <b>say</b> <b>things</b> {{in the heat of the}} moment and not to contrive anything that she says. Two weeks into the live shows, a number of happy slapping videos of Emily Nakanda {{appeared in}} the media, apparently showing her beating another teenaged girl. On 17 November, Alisha Bennett was voted out of the competition, leaving Osbourne with no acts halfway through the competition.|$|E

500|$|Starr's {{idiosyncratic}} {{turns of}} phrase, or Ringoisms as they became known, {{such as a}} hard day's night and tomorrow never knows, were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: [...] "Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would <b>say</b> <b>things</b> slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... {{they were sort of}} magic". As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line [...] "darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there" [...] from [...] "Eleanor Rigby".|$|E

500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot <b>say</b> <b>things</b> like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really like that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E

He shot {{a commercial for}} Rock the Vote and, along with his sister, visited the University of Southern California {{to encourage students to}} vote during the 2004 U.S. election. He also campaigned for Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. He has said, however, that [...] "it frustrates me when actors talk politics; I'm political and I make choices in my movies that I think are political. I try and <b>say</b> <b>things</b> with what I do. Rightly or wrongly, young actors have all the power." [...] In an interview for Rendition, he remarked that [...] "it's a sad time when actors are politicians and politicians are actors".|$|E
500|$|Bono began each concert as The Fly and {{continued}} to play the character {{for most of the}} first half of the concert. In contrast to his earnest self of the 1980s, as The Fly, Bono strutted around the stage with [...] "swagger and style", exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star. He adopted the mindset that he was [...] "licensed to be an egomaniac". He often stayed in character away from the tour stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels. He said, [...] "That rather cracked character could <b>say</b> <b>things</b> that I couldn't", and that it offered him a greater freedom of speech.|$|E

Donna had no one to turn to and buried her love in the music scene and Ty, who became her focus for love and acceptance. Donna is driven by a fierce need for approval and acceptance, which makes her try too hard. Robbie revealed that she shares some of Donna's characteristics. She said [...] "'s fiery and outgoing and I'm a bit like that. Sometimes I can be too loud and <b>say</b> <b>things</b> when I shouldn't. But I don't stalk people. Other than that, we're kind of similar." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage {{performances}} were {{heavily influenced by}} orality. Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it [...] "better to <b>say</b> <b>things</b> as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth". After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre—inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes—could be developed. Allah jang Palsoe {{was intended to be}} the first published stage play in this new tradition.|$|E

500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and <b>say</b> <b>things.</b> That's how I am in real life. If I wanna know something I just ask. Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics. Pitchfork Medias Carrie Battan said that [...] "Do You..." [...] is [...] "not so much about being in love as about a shared love of vices." ...|$|E
500|$|When it was renewed for {{a second}} season, Veronica Mars became the lowest-rated show in network history to be renewed and the only UPN drama from the 2004-05 {{television}} season to be renewed. Starting in the second season, Veronica Mars was moved to Wednesday nights, placing it in direct competition with ABC's popular Lost. Rob Thomas said that, [...] "I wish the juggernaut that is Lost wasn't our direct competition." [...] At the same time, Veronica Mars was placed after UPN's America's Next Top Model. On {{the date of the}} airing of this episode, Bell and Thomas talked to The New York Times, where Thomas commented, [...] "We let Veronica <b>say</b> <b>things</b> that, if you get all day to think about it, would be the perfect retort." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would <b>say</b> <b>things</b> slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E
