60|$|Rome was at {{war with}} the city of Gabii, and as the city was not to be subdued by force, Tarquin tried treachery. His eldest son, Sextus Tarquinius, fled to Gabii, {{complaining}} of ill-usage of his father, and showing marks of a severe scourging. The Gabians believed him, and he was soon so much trusted by them as to have the whole command of the army and manage everything in the city. Then he sent a messenger to his father to ask what he was to do next. Tarquin was walking through a cornfield. He made no answer in words, but with a <b>switch</b> <b>cut</b> off the heads of all the poppies and taller stalks of corn, and bade the messenger tell Sextus what he had seen. Sextus understood, and contrived to get all the chief men of Gabii exiled or put to death, and without them the city fell an easy prey to the Romans.|$|E

50|$|Introduced in 2010, the amp {{featured}} Hand-wired turret board construction (against cheaper PCB construction), Birch-ply cabinets featuring solid bracing and {{a natural}} high frequency diffuser (versus MDF cabinets and no high frequency diffuser); All-tube design (different from the Custom series tube pre/power amp but solid-state rectifier); ECC83/12AX7 preamp tubes (×3) EL84 power tube quartet; (AC30 models); EL84 Duet (AC15 models); GZ34 rectifier (AC30 models); EZ81 rectifier (AC15 models); came factory-fitted with matched Ruby Tubes to provide extended dynamic range; maintained the traditional VOX two-channel design (Top Boost and Normal. High and Low inputs for each channel); the Normal channel features an additional BRIGHT switch; The top boost channel features a HOT/COOL switch to achieve even more gain. A Master Volume/BYPASS switch completely bypasses the Master Volume section allowing incredible levels of gain and sustain to be achieved. OP mode <b>switch</b> <b>cut</b> the amp's Output Power level in half (30 > 15 on the AC30, 15 > 7.5 on the AC15) allowing {{higher levels of}} saturation to be achieved at lower volumes). A Vintage fawn-colored vinyl covering, reminiscent of the 1960 classic AC30 and was available with either Celestion Alnico Blue or Celestion G12M Greenback speakers. A VFS1 footswitch controls the Top Boost channel's HOT/COOL switch was also included. The Heritage series 50th anniversary models incorporate the classic EF86 pre-amp tube, which although subject to failure in the late '50s had been re-introduced and improved. The classic EF86 pre-amp tube is remarkable for its high gain and for the notable harmonic overtones it produces and feeds to the power tubes when driven into distortion, providing the creamy distinctive VOX sound of the early hand made amplifiers produced by Jennings of Dartford. Clapton, Cream, Pink Floyd and Queen are ambassadors {{to the success of}} the early AC30s. The Heritage series 50th anniversary model stands alone as either the AC15 or AC30 with this distinct circuitry not found in the current VOX line-up.|$|E

50|$|Electric trams use various {{devices to}} collect power from {{overhead}} lines. The most common device found {{today is the}} pantograph, while some older systems use trolley poles or bow collectors. Ground-level power supply has become a recent innovation. Another new technology uses supercapacitors; when an insulator at a track <b>switch</b> <b>cuts</b> off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large capacitor to drive the tram past {{the gap in the}} power feed.

50|$|Throttling {{a running}} engine back to reduce revs was {{possible}} by closing off the fuel valve to the required position while re-adjusting the fuel/air mixture to suit. This process was also tricky, so that throttling back, especially when landing, was often accomplished by intermittently cutting the ignition using the blip <b>switch.</b> <b>Cutting</b> cylinders using ignition switches had the drawback of letting fuel continue {{to pass through}} the engine, oiling up the spark plugs and making smooth restarting problematic. Also, the raw oil-fuel mix could collect in the cowling. As this could cause a serious fire when the switch was released, it became common practice for part or all of the bottom of the basically circular cowling on most rotary engines to be cut away, or fitted with drainage slots.|$|R

40|$|A {{double-stranded}} DNA cut {{has been}} observed in the mating type (MAT) locus of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in cultures undergoing homothallic cassette <b>switching.</b> <b>Cutting</b> is observed in exponentially growing cells of genotype HO HMLα MATα HMRα or HO HMLa MATa HMRa, which switch continuously, but not in a/α HO/HO diploid strains, in which homothallic switching {{is known to be}} shut off. Stationary phase cultures do not exhibit the cut. Although this site-specific cut occurs in a sequence (Z 1) common to the silent HML and HMR cassettes and to MAT, only the Z 1 sequence at the MAT locus is cut. The cut at MAT occurs {{in the absence of the}} HML and HMR donor cassettes, suggesting that cutting initiates the switching process. An assay for switching on hybrid plasmids containing mata - cassettes has been devised, and deletion mapping has shown that the cut site is required for efficient switching. Thus a double-stranded cut at the MAT locus appears to initiate cassette transposition-substitution and defines MAT as the recipient in this process. © 1982...|$|R

30|$|When a DC fault occurs, from (6), {{the voltage}} in the current-limiting {{inductor}} suddenly changes. The peak {{value of the}} voltage {{is related to the}} length of the fault cable and the zero-crossing time. Thus, it can be realized through detecting sudden changes in the voltage to determine the fault time and the current zero-crossing time. The sequences of actions of the DC circuit breaker based on this method are as follows: 1) Initially, an off-line relationship database between the sudden change in the voltage and the current zero-crossing time is established. 2) Secondly, the sudden change in the voltage in the current-limiting inductor is detected; determining whether a fault has occurred in the external cables. 3) The corresponding zero-crossing time is then obtained, according to the relationship database. 4) Then the breaking delay time through the zero-crossing time is obtained by subtracting the times consumed by the detection devices and switches. 5) The given time is then delayed, causing the circuit breaker to operate. 6) Finally, the solid state circuit breakers interrupt the current and the auxiliary <b>switch</b> <b>cuts</b> off the fault cable.|$|R

50|$|The {{two primary}} health risks from heaters are {{the risk of}} fire {{and the risk of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning. The latter risk applies to gas and kerosene heaters but not electric heaters. The risk of fire from heaters may be mitigated by low surface temperatures (as found on oil-filled convective heaters), or by <b>switches</b> that <b>cut</b> power in the event of the device inadvertently being tipped over (often found in the bases of halogen heaters), or by thermal cut-out switches. Natural Stone Heaters do not pose a fire or carbon monoxide poisoning risk, and can be a safer alternative. However, the surface temperatures of the stone heaters can be considerable, though they may not cause an instant burn as the heat transfer is slow. For that reason they are usually mounted high on walls or ceilings, away from the reach of infants.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{equipment}} design features can {{have a profound effect on}} the working life of a frying oil, and consequently on secure/safe operation of the industrial deep-frying at high temperatures. The design aspects of the cooker should eliminate known factors of heat degradation/oxidation in the frying oil while maintaining outputs of products of consistent quality. For instance, the pro-oxidant catalyst copper or brass valves/fittings must not be employed. Continuous removal of debris/sediment and the maintenance of uniform oil temperatures leads to the development of FFAs at a lower rate, better taste, colour and appearance of the product. Security thermostats are fitted to each heating element in many modern, small-scale catering fryers. These are designed to trip out if the primary thermostat fails to function. Also the current isolation <b>switch</b> <b>cuts</b> off the electrical supply if the element head is not placed correctly in the fryer. In both catering and industrial frying operations, smoke haze can be a problem. The volatile break-down products such as FFAs, etc. formed in the oil being heated at high temperatures give rise to smoke, which if not controlled can enhance fire hazards due to their lower flash point. The smoke point is of most benefit in assessing the quality of a frying oil, since it is mainly the FFAs produced in the frying operation which contribute to the smoke haze. Commercial frying oils as well as the entire frying installation including cooker design, must meet strict quality and safety requirements. These features become extremely important, especially in the industrial flash frying operation when the frying oil is heated to a higher temperature of 200 °G. High oil quality and high smoke/flash point frying oils are essential characteristics of the flash frying operation. These days, two important features namely carbon dioxide blanketing system and a waste air cleaning system have become standard design items for secure and environmental friendly operation of multi-purpose industrial fryers. This paper will highlight various safety and design features of many modern, industrial frying operations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cut polytope Pn is the {{convex hull}} of the {{incidence}} vectors of all cuts of the complete graph Kn on n nodes. An even cut is a cut of even cardinality.

The vertex sets of both polytopes Pn and EvPn come from the cycle sets of some binary matroids; a more general example is the even T-cut polytope. We study the facial structure of EvPn and of the closely related (via <b>switching)</b> odd <b>cut</b> polytope. We give the description of their symmetry groups, show that all facets of Pn can be zero-lifted to EvPm for m⩾n+ 5 and also exhibit two classes of facet inducing valid inequalities of EvPn.

40|$|A load-balanced {{two-stage}} switch is scalable and {{can provide}} close to 100 % throughput. Its major {{problem is that}} packets can be mis-sequenced when they arrive at output ports. In a recent work [16], the packet mis-sequencing problem is elegantly solved by a feedback-based two-stage switch architecture. In this paper, we extend the feedback-based switch architecture from two-stage to three-stage to further cut down packet delay. The idea is to map the heavy flows to experience less middle-stage port delay using the switch fabric in the third stage. We show that the resulting three-stage architecture also ensures in-order packet delivery and close to 100 % throughput. To identity heavy flows, a simple and practical traffic matrix estimation algorithm is also proposed. As compared with the original feedback-based two-stage switch architecture, the three-stage <b>switch</b> can <b>cut</b> down the delay performance by as large as 43. 4 % for a 32 x 32 switch under a hot-spot traffic pattern with input load at p= 0. 95.
