40|$|The {{temporal}} {{fluctuations in}} global {{mean surface temperature}} {{is an example of}} a geophysical quantity which can be described using the notions of long-range persistence and scale invariance/scaling, but this description has suffered from lack of a generally accepted physical explanation. Processes with these statistical signatures can arise from non-linear effects, for instance through cascade-like energy transfer in turbulent fluids, but they can also be produced by linear models with scale-invariant impulse-response functions. This paper demonstrates that on time scales from months to centuries, the scale-invariant impulse-response function of global surface temperature can be explained from simple linear multi-box energy balance models. This explanation describes both the scale invariance of the internal variability and the lack of a characteristic time scale of the response to external forcings. With parameters estimated from observational data, the climate response is approximately scaling in these models, even if the response function is not chosen to be scaling a priori. It is also demonstrated that the differences in scaling exponents for temperatures over land and for sea-surface temperatures can be reproduced by a version of the multi-box energy balance model with two distinct <b>surface</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{instability}} of the thermohaline circulation has been widely observed in numerical ocean models, theoretical advances have been hindered by the nonlinearity of heat and salt transports, a circulation governed by lateral temperature, and salinity gradients. Because {{the instability}} occurs initially in polar waters through the formation of haloclines and the halt of convection, any explanatory model must {{have at least a}} surface and a deep layer. The model proposed here (two <b>surface</b> <b>boxes</b> above a deep one) reduces to a 2 degrees-of-freedom dynamical system when convection is active and 3 degrees when it is interrupted. The instability that is induced by a negative freshwater perturbation in polar waters has three stages. The first stage is a rapid 5 -yr adjustment to a transient thermal attractor that results from an approximate balance between heat advection and air–sea heat fluxes. The second stage is a slow evolution that self-organizes near this attractor, which preconditions the instability, as it can be shown that the circulation becomes more sensitive to changes in salinity gradients than in temperature gradients. The slow O(100 yr) growth of salinity in the subtropics is the critical precursor of the instability {{while at the same time}} the subpolar salinity rises against the initial perturbation to stabilize the system by increasing the overturning and restoring convection. When the overturning becomes smaller than the value at the unstable fixed point, the third stage occurs, which is when the subpolar salinity decreases at last on a fast O(10 yr) time scale, precipitating the fall of the overturning. During the last two stages of the instability, the horizontal thermal gradient increases, but its stabilizing effect is just barely unable to prevent the outcome. The return to stability occurs frequently through a regime of multidecadal oscillations with intermittent convection. The hypothesis of mixed boundary conditions has been relaxed by coupling the ocean box model to an atmospheric energy balance model to show that the coupling increases the stability of the oceanic circulation; however, the precursors of the instability are unchanged...|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a higher alkalinity content in the ocean, a set of model experiments was conducted with the same range of high latitude <b>surface</b> <b>box</b> temperatures and four-times the present atmospheric pCO 2 (Fig.  19). In the late Albian, the deep-sea temperature was estimated to have been ~[*] 17  °C in the equatorial Pacific (Huber et al. 2002) and pCO 2 was suggested to vary between approximately two and five times more than present-day atmospheric pCO 2 (Bice et al. 2006). In such a case, the required alkalinity inventory to maintain the level of saturation depth (deep than 2000  m) at the interglacial condition is greater than 1.2 times (Fig.  19). In any case, the model results indicate that under high pCO 2 during the mid-Cretaceous, an increase in the oceanic inventory of alkalinity is likely necessary to preserve any carbonate on the seafloor (Fig. 2; Table 1). Otherwise, the entire ocean may be undersaturated with respect to CaCO 3.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{introduce}} a four-box interhemispheric {{model of the}} meridional overturning circulation. A single box represents high latitudes in each hemisphere, and in contrast to earlier interhemispheric box models, low latitudes are represented by two boxes—a <b>surface</b> <b>box</b> and a deep box—separated by a thermocline in which a balance is assumed between vertical advection and vertical diffusion. The behavior {{of the system is}} analyzed with two different closure assumptions for how the low-latitude upwelling depends on the density contrast between the surface and deep low-latitude boxes. The first is based on the conventional assumption that the diffusivity is a constant, and the second {{on the assumption that the}} energy input to the mixing is constant. There are three different stable equilibrium states that are closely analogous to the three found by Bryan in a single-basin interhemispheric ocean general circulation model. One is quasi-symmetric with downwelling in high latitudes of both hemispheres, and two are asymmetric solutions, with downwelling confined to high latitudes in one or the other of the two hemispheres. The quasi-symmetric solution becomes linearly unstable for strong global hydrological forcing, while the two asymmetric solutions do not. The qualitative nature of the solutions is generally similar for both the closure assumptions, in contrast to the solutions in hemispheric models. In particular, all the stable states can be destabilized by finite amplitude perturbations in the salinity or the hydrological forcing, and transitions are possible between any two states. For example, if the system is in an asymmetric state, and the moisture flux into the high-latitude region of downwelling is slowly increased, for both closure assumptions the high-latitude downwelling decreases until a critical forcing is reached where the system switches to the asymmetric state with downwelling in the opposite hemisphere. By contrast, in hemispheric models with the energy constraint, the downwelling increases and there is no loss of stability...|$|R
