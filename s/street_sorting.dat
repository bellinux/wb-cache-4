50|$|Henry Kelly {{was born}} to Charles Kelly of Dublin and Jane (née McGarry) of Manchester. He was left the oldest of 10 {{children}} after his father died in 1904. He was educated at St Patrick's School and Xaverian College, both in Manchester. After moving to King Street in Moston he was employed as a sorting clerk at the Newton <b>Street</b> <b>sorting</b> office and trained with the 'Manchester Royal Engineers territorial Regiment'. On 5 September 1914, aged 27, he enlisted into the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders as a Private. He transferred to the Manchester Regiment and became a Lance Corporal and two weeks later a Sergeant Major. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 12 May 1915 into the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding Regiment). On 29 October 1918 {{he was awarded the}} Victoria Cross and after being presented with his VC ribbon, by the corps commander on 11 September he was made a Temporary Lieutenant.|$|E

50|$|FridayThe event {{kicks off}} on the {{afternoon}} of the second Friday in July. A section of Main Street in Wayne closes to traffic, allowing for a <b>street</b> fair of <b>sorts,</b> called Henoween. Food stands, craft vendors, and kids' games are set up along the block. Activities that take place include the World's Largest Chicken Dance, put on by Wayne State College's cheerleading squad; the Cement Chicken Auction; a hot wing eating contest; a fireworks show put on by the Wayne Jaycees; and a teen dance.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} its façades facing the street {{incorporates}} engaged Ionic half-columns, fashioned from blocks of stone, which forecast {{those at the}} Villa Sarego at Santa Sofia. A thick web of openings transforms the loggia onto the <b>street</b> into a <b>sort</b> of diaphragm transparent to the light. The entire edifice seems to be strapped by continuous bands of stone, from the plinth of engaged columns to the entablature, {{right up to the}} band corresponding to the upper frieze, where the small unframed windows of the granary open.|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to describe all the parts and circumstances of this fair exactly; the shops are placed in rows like streets, whereof one is called Cheapside; and here, as in several other <b>streets,</b> are all <b>sorts</b> of trades, who sell by retail, and who come principally from London with their goods; scarce any trades are omitted--goldsmiths, toyshops, brasiers, turners, milliners, haberdashers, hatters, mercers, drapers, pewterers, china- warehouses, and in a word all trades that can be named in London; with coffee-houses, taverns, brandy-shops, and eating-houses, innumerable, and all in tents, and booths, as above.|$|R
5000|$|Sultan al-Ghuri, Egypt's last {{important}} Mamluk sultan (1501-1516), {{modified the}} layout of the whole district through a major campaign of demolition and new construction. In addition to building his own religious and funerary complex and a large wikala (mentioned above, and still well-preserved today), he demolished the original khan built by al-Khalili and rebuilt it in 1511 as a commercial complex with monumental gates and a grid of regular parallel and perpendicular <b>streets.</b> This <b>sort</b> of complex resembled other examples of a qaysariyya (also bedestan in Turkish), a central bazaar where the most precious goods were sold and which often had roofed streets and was protected by locked gates at night. It's possible that this was done in imitation of similar commercial complexes in major Ottoman cities, {{at a time when the}} Ottoman Empire was the main rival of the Egyptian Mamluk state and when Turkish merchants were probably increasingly important in Cairo.|$|R
50|$|Four years later, Stonie {{returns to}} Ramsay Street {{to stay with}} Toadie. Stonie reveals he is now married to a woman named Chantelle (Claire Chitham), but he {{mentions}} they are now separated. It becomes apparent that he is smoking marijuana. Whilst smoking, he throws the butt over the fence to Number 30 and Frazer Yeats (Ben Lawson) discovers it and immediately assumes Toadie is the one smoking it. After smelling smoke again, Frazer looks over the fence and spots Stonie smoking. After a mishap where Charlie Hoyland accidentally discovers the dope, Stonie then comes clean to Toadie and Charlie's mother, Steph and explains he is depressed because he and Chantelle were trying for a baby {{and they are not}} having much luck. Chantelle comes to Ramsay <b>Street</b> to <b>sort</b> her husband out. Stonie announces he is giving up marijuana. However, just as he is about to throw the rest in the bin, he holds onto it. Chantelle gives him an ultimatum: her or the marijuana. Stonie chooses her and throws out the marijuana, and they return to Port Keats.|$|R
5000|$|At the time, a {{mail sorter}} could be {{expected}} to sort mail into one of about two dozen [...] "pigeon holes", small bins that collected all of the mail being delivered to a particular mail route. The sorter had to memorize addresses and the routes that served them, reading the address off a letter and placing it into the correct pigeon hole. In a small town each pigeon hole could represent the mail carried by a single deliveryman, and each sorter could remember the <b>streets</b> and <b>sort</b> mail for any of these routes. But for mail that was being delivered across larger areas, the sorting had to be broken into a hierarchy. A receiving station in Alberta routing a letter to Ontario would sort it into the Ontario stack. The mail would then be received in Ontario and sorted at a distribution center to stacks for city or towns. If the city was large enough, it might have to be sorted several more times before it reached an individual carrier.|$|R
50|$|The video {{takes place}} in one only sequence, {{featuring}} singer and pianist Isaac Slade walking through a destroyed suburban <b>street</b> after some <b>sort</b> of accident or attack. While Isaac walks through the street, people run and police officers and soldiers try to save others in the ruins. The video ends with Isaac finding a woman (played by Jaime King) who was obviously looking for him. The video ends with the two and {{everyone else in the}} neighborhood looking to the distant Los Angeles cityscape before it completely explodes. The set used {{in the aftermath of the}} plane crash scene from Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds was also used to film this clip, located at Universal Studios in Hollywood.|$|R
60|$|Clearly {{our arrival}} was {{expected}} and excited interest, for people were gathered in knots about {{the street to}} watch us pass; also at {{the windows of the}} houses and even on their flat roofs. At the top of the long <b>street</b> was a <b>sort</b> of market place, crossing which, accompanied by a curious crowd who made remarks about us that we could not understand, we reached a gate in an inner wall. Here we were challenged, but at a word from Simbri it opened, and we passed through to find ourselves in gardens. Following a road or drive, we came to a large, rambling house or palace, surmounted by high towers and very solidly built of stone in a heavy, bastard Egyptian style.|$|R
60|$|In my wanderings about London from West to East {{and back}} again (I was very idle then) the two little rooms in Fenchurch <b>Street</b> were a <b>sort</b> of resting-place where my spirit, hankering after the sea, could feel itself nearer to the ships, the men, {{and the life of}} its choice--nearer there than on any other spot of the solid earth. This resting-place used to be, at about five o'clock in the afternoon, full of men and tobacco smoke, but Captain Froud had the smaller room to himself and there he granted private interviews, whose {{principal}} motive was to render service. Thus, one murky November afternoon he beckoned me in with a crooked finger and that peculiar glance above his spectacles which is perhaps my strongest physical recollection of the man.|$|R
40|$|The phrase ‘I {{know that}} I know nothing’ {{came to my}} mind when we all met in Dhaka for the Critical Writing Ensembles. 1 I {{understood}} that I {{had a lot to}} learn from this wonderful, colourful, crowded city. On my way to the hotel, I saw many people on the <b>streets,</b> all <b>sorts</b> of cars, rickshaws, businesses. I saw exquisite displays of fruits in pyramid forms. I saw illuminated shops filled with sparkling lamps and lights. I saw gracefully written letters, which I couldn’t decipher, contrasting with well-known advertisements. Nice people stared at me. A small young woman {{who was in charge of}} cleaning the bathroom of the exhibition spaces wanted to take a photo with me. I felt like a white elephant. I saw interesting exhibitions in the city, met old friends, and made new ones. As colleagues, we talked a lot about what decolonisation in the arts, in art history, and in curating might be. We saw all sorts of existing power relations, old ones and new ones, local ones and depressingly global ones. I felt somewhat insecure about how to write about a society I don’t know; describing mere impressions can be totally misleading. As Ananya Roy argues, it is necessary to transform the ways in which the cities of the global South are studied and represented...|$|R
40|$|The huge {{popularity}} of new media platforms and social media {{is a phenomenon}} specific for the transitions of contemporary culture. The growing interest {{in these kinds of}} communication is visible also in the area of visual culture, especially in the context of photography. This paper makes an attempt of a critical inquiry in the dependency between the mentioned platforms, including Instagram for example, and the transformation of current patterns of media descriptions of reality. A significant part of that discussion is the field of the so called <b>street</b> photography. This <b>sort</b> of documentary photography had gained paradoxically thanks to Instagram a new dimension of articulation {{and is one of the}} most popular forms of expressing one’s way of perceiving every day life. This and other phenomena of modern media delivers further evidence for the thesis that is stating a creative and dynamic character of transformation of global culture...|$|R
50|$|The building’s balcony {{was likely}} in place {{through the first}} quarter of the 20th century, and is a {{reminder}} of a once-common architectural feature on Fifth Street that has completely disappeared from the district. The 1895 Sanborn Insurance Company map of the area shows that at least 13 buildings along the 600 and 700 blocks of Fifth <b>Street</b> had some <b>sort</b> of balcony, porch, or awning that overhung Fifth Street. This scene may have been captured by German-born artist Bernhard Gutmann (1869-1936), who, in 1895, sketched what he called “Negro Street” in Lynchburg. This image shows more than half a dozen two- or two-and-a-half-story buildings with steeply-pitched side-gable roofs, end chimneys, narrow two- and three-bay facades, and shallow two-story covered porches. While not definitively a sketch of Fifth Street, it is highly likely that Gutmann was depicting a streetscape along the 600 or 700 block of the corridor.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the entry}} of the new local {{government}} headed by Xavier Trias in 2011, the proposal of connecting Trambaix and Trambesòs through Avinguda Diagonal was dismissed, though it has been agreed to reactivate the linkage project with the Generalitat. The current mayor is committed to connecting the two tram systems through different streets {{in the district of}} Eixample and objects to the construction of a tram line through Diagonal. One of the new proposed routes would mostly pass through Provença <b>Street,</b> creating a <b>sort</b> of [...] "shuttle tram" [...] for tourists between Sagrada Família and La Pedrera, while the other one would mostly pass through Gran Via. However, there is no date for the start of construction and it is intended to prioritize the new orthogonal express bus network which will perform a similar function as all of the new projected new routes for the tram in the city centre.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{sound of}} carts and 'orses there was, and {{a sound of}} cabs and omnibuses, and {{then a lot of}} whistling, shrill {{whistles}}, whistles that froze 'is marrer. And directly the whistles began things begun to show, people in the streets 'urrying, people in the 'ouses and shops busying themselves, moty cars in the <b>streets,</b> a <b>sort</b> of moonlight in all the lamps and winders. People, I say, Teddy, but they wasn't people. They was the ghosts of them that was overtook, the ghosts of them that used to crowd those streets. And they went past 'im and through 'im and never 'eeded 'im, went by like fogs and vapours, Teddy. And sometimes they was cheerful and sometimes they was 'orrible, 'orrible beyond words. And once 'e come to a place called Piccadilly, Teddy, and there was lights blazing like daylight and ladies and gentlemen in splendid clo'es crowding the pavement, and taxicabs follering along the road. And as 'e looked, they all went evil--evil in the face, Teddy. And it seemed to 'im SUDDENLY THEY SAW 'IM, and the women began to look at 'im and say things to 'im--'orrible--wicked things. One come very near 'im, Teddy, right up to 'im, and looked into 'is face--close. And she 'adn't got a face to look with, only a painted skull, and then 'e see; they was all painted skulls.

6000|$|The [...] "curiosities" [...] of the {{earthquake}} were simply endless. Gentlemen and ladies who were sick, or were taking a siesta, or had dissipated till a late hour and were making up lost sleep, thronged into the public <b>streets</b> in all <b>sorts</b> of queer apparel, and some without any at all. One {{woman who had been}} washing a naked child, ran down the street holding it by the ankles {{as if it were a}} dressed turkey. Prominent citizens who were supposed to keep the Sabbath strictly, rushed out of saloons in their shirt-sleeves, with billiard cues in their hands. Dozens of men with necks swathed in napkins, rushed from barber-shops, lathered to the eyes or with one cheek clean shaved and the other still bearing a hairy stubble. Horses broke from stables, and a frightened dog rushed up a short attic ladder and out on to a roof, and when his scare was over had not the nerve to go down again the same way he had gone up.|$|R
60|$|If you {{ask that}} {{convenient}} fiction, the Man in the <b>Street,</b> what <b>sort</b> of plant a cactus is, {{he will probably}} tell you it is all leaf and no stem, {{and each of the}} leaves grows out of the last one. Whenever we set up the Man in the Street, however, you must have noticed we do it in order to knock him down again like a nine-pin next moment: and this particular instance is no exception to the rule; for the truth is that a cactus is practically all stem and no leaves, what looks like a leaf being really a branch sticking out at an angle. The true leaves, if there are any, are reduced to mere spines or prickles on the surface, while the branches, in the prickly-pear and many of the ornamental hot-house cactuses, are flattened out like a leaf to perform foliar functions. In most plants, to put it simply, the leaves are the mouths and stomachs of the organism; their thin and flattened blades are spread out horizontally in a wide expanse, covered with tiny throats and lips which suck in carbonic acid from the surrounding air, and disintegrate it in their own cells under the influence of sunlight. In the prickly pears, on the contrary, it is the flattened stem and branches which undertake this essential operation {{in the life of the}} plant--the sucking-in of carbon and giving-out of oxygen, which is to the vegetable exactly what the eating and digesting of food is to the animal organism. In their old age, however, the stems of the prickly pear display their true character by becoming woody in texture and losing their articulated leaf-like appearance.|$|R
50|$|Located at {{the southwestern}} end of Minato, the {{neighborhood}} of Shirokanedai lies between Ebisu, Kamiōsaki and Higashigotanda on the west, Takanawa on the east, and Shirokane on the north. Shopping amenities and apartment buildings are densely spread along Meguro-dori, Gaien Nishi-dori and Sakurada-dori; however, most in Shirokanedai are quiet residential areas. Shirokanedai remains abundant in natural green space, for historically Shirokanedai-cho was home to the former imperial estate called Shirokane Goryochi (now the Institute for Nature Study and the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum are located) and several national {{institutions such as the}} former Institute of Public Health and the former Institute of Infectious Diseases (now the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo). Later, Shirokanedai came to be considered {{as one of the most}} upmarket residential areas in Tokyo, and women resident there — stereotypically wealthy, idle and fashion-conscious — are jocularly referred to as shiroganeeze (シロガネーゼ), an imitation of Milanese for residents of Milan. The most famous street in this area is Gaien Nishi-dori, popularly known as Platinum <b>Street</b> (Purachina-dori), a <b>sort</b> of local equivalent of the prestigious Via Montenapoleone in Milan. The restaurants in this street are very popular for wedding ceremonies.|$|R
6000|$|But though (like the {{man without}} memory in the novel) we walk the <b>streets</b> with a <b>sort</b> of half-witted admiration, still it is admiration. It is admiration in English {{and not only}} admiration in Latin. The wonder has a {{positive}} element of praise. This is the next milestone to be definitely marked on our road through fairyland. I shall speak in the next chapter about optimists and pessimists in their intellectual aspect, so far as they have one. Here I am only trying to describe the enormous emotions which cannot be described. And the strongest emotion was that life was as precious as it was puzzling. It was an ecstasy {{because it was an}} adventure; it was an adventure because it was an opportunity. The goodness of the fairy tale was not affected by the fact that there might be more dragons than princesses; it was good to be in a fairy tale. The test of all happiness is gratitude; and I felt grateful, though I hardly knew to whom. Children are grateful when Santa Claus puts in their stockings gifts of toys or sweets. Could I not be grateful to Santa Claus when he put in my stockings the gift of two miraculous legs? We thank people for birthday presents of cigars and slippers. Can I thank no one for the birthday present of birth? ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the things}} of the world, he had fences, and looked at some people through palings and even over the broken bottles {{on the tops of}} walls; and I think he was the loser by this, as well as they. But then I think all fences are bad, and that God has made enough {{differences}} between men; we need not trouble ourselves to multiply them. Even behind his fences, however, Holmes had a heart kind for the outsiders, and I do not believe any one came into personal relations with him who did not experience this kindness. In that long and delightful talk I had with him on my return from Venice (I can praise the talk because it was mainly his), we spoke of the status of domestics in the Old World, and how fraternal the relation of high and low was in Italy, while in England, between master and man, it seemed without acknowledgment of their common humanity. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I always felt as if English servants expected to be trampled on; but I can't do that. If they want to be trampled on, they must get some one else." [...] He thought that our American way was infinitely better; and I believe that in spite of the fences there was always an instinctive impulse with him to get upon common ground with his fellow- man. I used to notice in the neighborhood cabman who served our block on Beacon <b>Street</b> a <b>sort</b> of affectionate reverence for the Autocrat, which could have come from nothing but the kindly terms between them; if you went to him when he was engaged to Doctor Holmes, he told you so with a sort of implication in his manner that the thought of anything else for the time was profanation. The good fellow who took him his drives about the Beverly and Manchester shores seemed to be quite in the joke of the doctor's humor, and within the bounds of his personal modesty and his functional dignity permitted himself a smile at the doctor's sallies, when you stood talking with him, or listening to him at the carriage- side.|$|R
40|$|Where do you live? If home {{is where}} the heart is, where does the mind live? What makes a {{community}} of minds? When do {{you feel as if}} you belong? The exponential growth of the Internet as a home for the mind has opened up the possibility of virtual communities, complete with front porches and main <b>streets</b> of a <b>sort.</b> Wholly constructed by their inhabitants, these virtual communities offer socially constructed knowledge without face-to-face contact or physical constraints. They are as stable as the ideas generated and as safe as the reciprocal respect of the participants (Davis, 1997). How do you become an active netizen? What can you offer this community? How can you expect to benefit? Use of the Internet has grown exponentially in the last five years and is expected to continue to grow with the advent of &quot;set top boxes &quot; for televisions and cable access. Radio stations, the local hairdresser and schools are &quot;on line. &quot; If you have not joined this virtual community, you may be feeling left out, or behind the times.

5000|$|What is now Rainier Beach {{neighborhood}} has been inhabited {{since the end}} of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BC - 10,000 years ago). The Xacuabš (hah-chu-ahbsh, Lake People or People of the Large Lake) were related to, but distinct from, the Dkhw'Duw'Absh, People of the Inside, tribe of the Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish Nations. Both are now (c. mid-1850s) of the Duwamish tribe. The Xacuabš village of tleelh-chus (little island) was, appropriately, on an island at the southwest shore of what is now called Lake Washington, at their trail through a valley that led to the villages of the Dkhw'Duw'Absh on salt water at Elliott Bay and the estuarial Duwamish River. [...] The Duwamish were dispossessed with the Treaty of Point Elliott of 1855. The trail became the route for driving livestock to the town of Seattle (1870s), the valley was renamed Rainier Valley, the island was renamed Young's Island (1883), then Pritchard Island (1900), the trail became the route of the Seattle and Rainier Beach Railway (1894), then the Seattle, Renton and Southern; the route became that of Rainier Avenue S (1937), the main road to Renton and on over Snoqualmie Pass until the then-innovative floating bridge of 1940 was opened at the nearby Mount Baker neighborhood.An electric trolley line came to Rainier Valley in 1891, to Columbia City; to Renton in 1896. Residential development began in earnest. An early sharp operator (beginning in 1896), Clarence Dayton Hillman, namesake of the nearby Hillman City neighborhood, designated Rainier Beach as the Atlantic City residential development (1905) after the New Jersey resort. He included a park area on the cove, built a pier, bath house, boat house, picnic facilities - and sold the land to multiple buyers when he got around to platting the properties snapped up by eager buyers attracted by the adjacent amenities, as well as allowing multiple street naming rights. The tangled <b>street</b> names were <b>sorted</b> out, the property was eventually returned to park purposes (c. 1912) and the park name has stuck. (Hillman was eventually caught and nominally convicted.) The interurban railway remained until 1936, when it was torn up to make way for automobiles.|$|R
