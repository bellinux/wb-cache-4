25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{as an early}} {{advocate}} of dietary prevention of cancer, Lane met medical opposition, resigned from British Medical Association, and founded the New Health Society, the first organisation practicing <b>social</b> <b>medicine.</b> Through newspapers and lectures, sometimes drawing large crowds, Lane promoted whole foods, fruits and vegetables, sunshine and exercise: his plan to foster health and longevity via three bowel movements daily. Tracing diverse diseases to modern civilization, he called for farmland's return to the people.|$|E
25|$|After 1924, abandoning {{his private}} medical {{practice}} {{as well as}} surgery, Lane's public devotion was <b>social</b> <b>medicine</b> and public education on dietary and lifestyle subversion of constipation and promotion of general wellbeing, his New Health. Of diverse interests, Lane traveled frequently, often visiting America, while gaining friends and colleagues internationally. Among his associates and acquaintances were Alexis Carrel, John Benjamin Murphy, Elie Metchnikoff, Sir James Mackenzie, William Worrall Mayo and sons William James Mayo and Charles Horace Mayo of Mayo Clinic fame.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} study is offered as a six-year program.

25|$|In September 1914, Arbore {{was honored}} by the PSDR's festive {{assembly}} honoring the 50th anniversary of the First International. In parallel, he gave external support to unionizing efforts, being notably an honored guest at the Romanian Journalists' Union festivities of May 1912, where he mainly spoke about Bessarabia. His first-born daughter, who had by then made her first contributions to <b>social</b> <b>medicine,</b> became directly involved with the PSDR and the România Muncitoare club, and, also in 1912, {{was elected to the}} PSDR Executive Committee.

25|$|Michael Shepherd {{was born}} on 30 July 1923 in Cardiff of a Jewish family with its roots in Odessa and Poland. He {{attended}} Cardiff High School and pursued his medical studies at the Medical School of Oxford University and the Radcliffe Infirmary. He was there influenced by the teaching of John Ryle, Professor of <b>Social</b> <b>Medicine.</b> Whilst under his tutorage, Shepherd was asked to visit a patient {{in her own home}} in Cowley in order to learn about the socio-medical significance of cardiac invalidism. Through such examples, Shepherd discerned the potential value to psychiatry of systematic research into the social causes of mental disorder. After qualifying he went on to complete his house appointments, and also his National Service in the Royal Air Force.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Lane began advocating cancer {{prevention}} through diet, thereby drew conflict with British Medical Association, and resigned {{from it in}} 1924, renouncing his lucrative private medical and surgical practice, 10 000 pounds a year. In 1925, Lane founded New Health Society, the first organized body for <b>social</b> <b>medicine,</b> which German pathologist and statesman Rudolf Virchow had pioneered in late 19th century to undo disease's sociopolitical causes. The term New Health largely referred to nonsurgical healthcare against constipation. Advertising forbidden of physicians, to avert accusation and disciplining by General Medical Council, Lane had his name deleted from the Medical Register. Lane then promoted his views on healthful diet and lifestyle, including greater intake of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, return to farm land, ample sunlight exposure and physical exercise, and nutritional yeast for B vitamins—Lane's plan to foster defecation thrice daily, cancer prevention, general health, and longevity. Meanwhile, colectomy for constipation was abandoned amid low success rates but high complication rates.|$|E

Of lowly origins, he benefited from the meritocratic program instituted by Moldavia's government in the 1830s, {{and went on to}} study law at the University of Vienna, with hopes of becoming a political economist. After graduating, he changed his professional path, and trained in medicine at the University of Paris. Recognized for pioneering contributions in cardiology, pediatrics, obstetrics and balneotherapy, he was also an early speaker for public health and <b>social</b> <b>medicine,</b> as well as an educational theorist and textbook author.

2500|$|Allende {{attended}} {{high school}} at the Liceo Eduardo de la Barra in Valparaíso. As a teenager, his main intellectual and political influence came from the shoe-maker Juan De Marchi, an Italian-born anarchist.

2500|$|The {{graduate}} degree of MBBS {{is divided into}} 3 professionals, with each professional ending with a professional exam conducted by the university (a single university may have up to dozens of medical colleges offering various graduate/post-graduate/post-doctoral degrees). After clearing this the student moves into the next professional. Each professional exam consists of a theory exam and a practical exam conducted {{not only by the}} same college but also external examiners. The exams are tough and many students are unable to clear them, thereby prolonging their degree time. The first professional is for 1 year and includes preclinical subjects, anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. The second professional is for 1 and a half year and has subjects pathology, pharmacology, microbiology (including immunology) and forensic medicine. Clinical exposure starts in the second professional. The third professional is divided into two parts. Part 1 consists of ophthalmology, ENT, and PSM (preventive and <b>social</b> <b>medicine)</b> and part 2 consists of general-medicine, general surgery [...] and pediatrics and gynaecology and obstetrics [...] This is followed by one-year of compulsory internship (rotatory house-surgeonship). After internship, the degree of MBBS is awarded by the respective university. Some states have made rural service compulsory for {{a certain period of time}} after MBBS.|$|E
2500|$|The Hospital Financing Law (1972) {{secured the}} supply of {{hospitals}} and reduced the cost of hospital care, [...] "defined the financing of hospital investment as a public responsibility, single states to issue plans for hospital development, {{and the federal government}} to bear the cost of hospital investment covered in the plans, rates for hospital care thus based on running costs alone, hospitals to ensure that public subsidies together with insurance fund payments for patients cover total costs". The Benefit Improvement Law (1973) made entitlement to hospital care legally binding (entitlements already enjoyed in practice), abolished time limits for hospital care, introduced entitlement to household assistance under specific conditions, and also introduced entitlement to leave of absence from work and cash benefits {{in the event of a}} child's illness. In 1971, to encourage the growth of registered family holiday centres, the Federal Government granted subsidies for the building and appointing of 28 of these centres at a total cost of 8 million DM. Free preliminary investigations were introduced for 2.5 million children up until the age of 4 for the early detection and correction of developmental disorders, and health research was expanded. Federal grants were increased, especially for the Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg, while a Federal Institute for Sport Science was set up, together with the Institute for <b>Social</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Epidemiology in Berlin. In addition, funding for new rehabilitation facilities was increased.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{epidemiologist}} Thomas McKeown {{had shown}} that treatment by streptomycin {{reduced the number of}} deaths since it was introduced (1948-71) by 51 per cent.... However, he also showed that the mortality from TB in England and Wales had already declined by 90 to 95% before streptomycin and BCG-vaccination were widely available, and that the contribution of antibiotics to the decline of mortality from TB was actually very small: ...for the total period since cause of death was first recorded (1848–71) the reduction was 3.2 per cent. These figures have since been confirmed for all western countries (see for example the decline in TB mortality in the USA) and for all then known infectious diseases. McKeown explained the decline in mortality from infectious diseases by an improved standard of living, particularly by better nutrition, and by better hygiene, and less by medical intervention. [...] McKeown, who is considered as the father of <b>social</b> <b>medicine,</b> has advocated for many years, that with drugs and vaccines we may win the battle but will lose the war against Diseases of Poverty. Thereto, efforts and resources should be primarily directed toward improving the standard of living of people in low resource countries, and toward improving their environment by providing clean water, sanitation, better housing, education, safety and justice, and access to medical care. [...] Particularly the work of Noble laureates Robert W. Fogel (1993) [...] and Angus Deaton (2015) have greatly contributed to the recent reappreciation of the McKeown thesis. A negative confirmation of the McKeown thesis was that increased pressure on wages by IMF loans to post-communist Eastern European were strongly associated with a rise in TB incidence, prevalence and mortality.|$|E
