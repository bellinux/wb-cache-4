She arrived at Plymouth in April 1798 and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> In August, the Navy renamed her HMS Insolent, {{but did not}} refit her until February to April 1801. On 24 April Lieutenant Burians, a veteran officer, {{commissioned}} her.|$|E
25|$|Renard {{arrived in}} Plymouth on 12 January 1799. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for six months, finally {{undergoing}} fitting between July 1799 and January 1800. While undergoing fitting {{she may have}} received additional cannons and extensive upperworks to hold them. There is some question though whether she in fact received the additional armament and upperworks (see below). Commander Peter Spicer commissioned Renard in August 1799 for the Channel.|$|E
2500|$|The Navy {{paid her}} off in April 1793 and placed her in {{ordinary}} at Portsmouth. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> until she sank at her moorings in 1801. The Navy refloated her. Then the [...] "Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy" [...] offered [...] "Cockatrice Cutter, 181 Tons, Copper-bottomed, lying at Portsmouth", {{for sale on}} 9 September 1802.|$|E
60|$|And <b>there</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat,</b> and <b>there</b> he <b>sat,</b> alone, {{opposite}} to her, {{on the back}} desk, {{looking up at her}} with his furtive eyes every minute.|$|R

60|$|He {{turned toward}} her with sudden fierceness. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> {{wringing}} her hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> dipping and {{painting}} and dipping again, with never {{a word for}} me--standing patiently and humbly behind her.|$|E
60|$|He emptied {{his pockets}} {{into her lap}} as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> She {{made no effort to}} pick up the shower of gold and silver.|$|E
60|$|Benita wheeled round {{upon the}} stone on which <b>she</b> <b>sat,</b> and <b>there,</b> {{standing}} amidst the bushes {{a little way}} from {{the foot of the}} wall, was Jacob Meyer. Their eyes met; hers were full of defiance, and his of conscious power.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down promptly. <b>There</b> was {{a little}} murmur of voices. My guests {{gathered}} round me. I drew a long breath and continued on my mendacious career.|$|R
60|$|Elfride {{wished it}} could be a longer time ago that <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with Stephen as her lover, and agreed to be his wife. The {{significant}} closeness of that time to the present was another item to add to the list of passionate fears which were chronic with her now.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened her}} lips and closed them again, {{struggled}} to speak and failed. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> breathing quickly, but silent. The power of speech had gone.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had left}} her, Lady Casterley {{sat down in a}} little low chair--long <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> by the empty hearth, till the daylight, was all gone.|$|E
60|$|Rob {{thought she}} was yery {{handsome}} as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with her {{eyes fixed on the}} horizon, while these rebellious thoughts found utterance in her quivering, passionate voice.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt that}} <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{a very long}} while, though the clock showed that {{scarcely}} an hour had passed, when at last there was a rattle of wheels and a trampling of hoofs outside. The great door opened, and after {{that there was an}} apparently interminable silence, until Hetty's maid came in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{any woman}} with any sense {{would take to}} Miss Mariner. If I told you how near I came to {{spilling}} the sauce-boat accidentally over that old fossil's head, you'd be surprised, Ellen. <b>She</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> brooding like an old eagle. If you ask my opinion, Miss Mariner's a long sight too good for her precious son!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> still <b>there,</b> {{crouching}} {{between the}} rocks, {{for more than}} two hours before the sound of the machine finally ceased. Another hour passed in absolute silence. She ventured to flash her pocket searchlight upon the dial of her watch and found it was nearly four o'clock. Dawn would come, presently, and then her situation would be more precarious than ever.|$|R
60|$|Oliver {{stirred the}} fire. Drawing her chair close to it, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> {{for a little}} time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.|$|E
60|$|There was no answer; <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{upon the}} fallen masonry, {{gazing at the}} ruins round her, {{motionless}} and white as a marble goddess, forgotten in her desecrated fane.|$|E
60|$|The {{grandeur}} of the storm awed, and stilled Helen's emotion. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> watching the lightning, listening to the peals of thunder, and thrilling with the wonder of the situation.|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> transfixed. <b>There</b> they lay--the soft-featured Nee-Koo; the gnarled old face of Gnob; Makamuk, {{grinning}} {{at her with}} his lifted upper lip; and lastly, Nossabok, his eyelid, up to its old trick, drooped on his girlish cheek in a suggestive wink. There they lay, the firelight flashing upon and playing over them, and from each of them a widening circle dyed the snow to scarlet.|$|R
60|$|When {{they entered}} their room, Ida {{sat down in}} a chair by the fire without {{removing}} her things; and when Bradley came in from the hall <b>she</b> still <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> her eyes shaded by her hat, her chin resting on her palm, her gloves in her lap. He knew her too well to interrupt her, and took a seat near her, waiting for her to speak.|$|R
60|$|Marguerite {{had listened}} to this terrible {{narrative}} dry-eyed and silent. Now <b>she</b> still <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> hardly conscious {{of what went on}} around her--of Suzanne's tears, that fell unceasingly upon her fingers--of Sir Andrew, who had sunk into a chair, and buried his head in his hands. She was hardly conscious that she lived; the universe seemed to have stood still before this awful, monstrous cataclysm.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> so {{long without}} saying a word that he found himself obliged to renew his suit. 'Of course, Mrs. Bolton, I am aware how very little you know of me.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> quietly, {{absolutely}} {{content to}} lie still and gaze {{out at the}} sea. Presently Grant {{came out with a}} note, which Deane silently opened. It was dated from The Cottage, Rakney.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! now he {{has been}} promoted!' said the Darning-needle. 'I remain here; I am too fine. But that is my pride, which {{is a sign of}} respectability!' And <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> very proudly, {{thinking}} lofty thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if I am, it must {{of course}} finally come out. But I {{can go for}} a long time." [...] Milly spoke with her eyes again on her painted sister's--almost as if under their suggestion. <b>She</b> still <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> before Kate, yet not without a light in her face. [...] "That {{will be one of}} my advantages. I think I could die without its being noticed." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lowder faced a moment, in her massive way, what Sir Luke Strett thought. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> back <b>there,</b> {{her knees}} apart, {{not unlike a}} picturesque ear-ringed matron at a market-stall; while her friend, before her, dropped their items, tossed the {{separate}} truths of the matter one by one, into her capacious apron. [...] "But is that all he came to you for--to tell you she must be happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne's horizons {{had closed}} in {{since the night}} <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> after coming home from Queen's; but if the path set before her feet was to be narrow she knew that flowers of quiet {{happiness}} would bloom along it. The joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship were to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her ideal world of dreams. And {{there was always the}} bend in the road! ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the hall}} door she {{reflected}} {{for a moment}} again, {{and went into the}} garden; directing her steps to a rustic bench and table placed {{out of sight of the}} house among the trees. In past times she had often sat there, with Mrs. Vanstone on one side, with Norah on the other, with Magdalen and the dogs romping on the grass. Alone <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> now--the will and the letter which she dared not trust out of her own possession, laid on the table--her head bowed over them; her face hidden in her hands. Alone <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and tried to rouse her sinking courage.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> looking lovelier than he {{had ever}} before seen her. Cyril's glance caught hers. They didn't need to speak. He saw at once in her eye that Elma at least knew instinctively he was innocent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> it {{came into}} her head. That 's reason enough for her. I have {{imagined}} she wishes me well, as they say here--though she has never distinguished me {{in such a way}} as that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the white}} morning-room which served for her boudoir Mrs. Pendyce sat with an opened letter in her lap. It was her {{practice}} {{to sit there}} on Sunday mornings for an hour {{before she went to}} her room adjoining to put on her hat for church. It was her pleasure during that hour to do nothing but sit at the window, open if the weather permitted, and look over the home paddock and the squat spire of the village church rising among a group of elms. It is not known what she thought about at those times, unless of the countless Sunday mornings <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with {{her hands in her lap}} waiting to be roused at 10.45 by the Squire's entrance and his [...] "Now, my dear, you'll be late!" [...] <b>She</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> till her hair, once dark-brown, was turning grey; she would sit there until it was white. One day she would sit there no longer, and, as likely as not, Mr. Pendyce, still well preserved, would enter and say, [...] "Now, my dear, you'll be late!" [...] having for the moment forgotten.|$|R
60|$|The {{impression}} of the whole scene {{was that of a}} spot where no human foot had left its print for many preceding days,--probably not since Phoebe's departure,--for she saw a side-comb of her own under the table of the arbor, where it must have fallen on the last afternoon when <b>she</b> and Clifford <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
60|$|She did not answer. <b>She</b> merely <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> {{as though}} <b>she</b> were overwhelmed, {{and the tears}} flowed down her cheeks. It {{would have been easier}} to bear if she had reproached him. He had thought her temper would get the better of her, and he was {{prepared}} for that. At {{the back of his mind}} was a feeling that a real quarrel, in which each said to the other cruel things, would in some way be a justification of his behaviour. The time passed. At last he grew frightened by her silent crying; he went into his bed-room and got a glass of water; he leaned over her.|$|R
