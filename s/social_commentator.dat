5|$|The {{second floor}} has a {{matching}} , with windows of equal value {{to those on}} the first floor below. The very latest innovation, sash windows, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and attic storey used the more old-fashioned mullioned and transomed windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of Coleshill House in Berkshire. The contemporary <b>social</b> <b>commentator</b> of the day Roger North lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), {{as one of the most}} important inventions of his day.|$|E
5|$|Novelist and <b>social</b> <b>commentator</b> Walter Besant {{proposed}} a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This {{coincided with a}} project by the philanthropist businessman, Edmund Hay Currie {{to use the money}} from the winding up of the 'Beaumont Trust', together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing an eclectic mix of populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold for classes in 1892, and by 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London was introduced. In 1931, the building was destroyed by fire, but the Draper's Company, major donors to the original scheme, invested more to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary's College in December 1934. A new 'People's Palace' was constructed, in 1937, by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, in St Helen's Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.|$|E

25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>commentator</b> Mike Davis {{pointed to}} the growing {{economic}} disparity in Los Angeles in the {{years leading up to}} the riots caused by corporate restructuring and government deregulation, with inner-city residents bearing the brunt of these changes.

To Davis and other writers, the tensions witnessed between African-Americans and Korean-Americans during the unrest was {{as much to do with}} the economic competition forced on the two groups by wider market forces as with either cultural misunderstandings or blacks angered about the killing of Latasha Harlins.|$|E
25|$|Because of his Scottish nationalism, and {{criticism}} of the Labour Party's timidity and lack of socialist zeal, Graham has been effectively written out of Labour Party history, and the belief has been circulated that after his electoral defeat in 1892, he retired from politics until the late 1920s. This is entirely incorrect; in fact, between 1905 and 1914, Graham, while retaining the position of elder statesman, <b>social</b> <b>commentator,</b> and renowned world-traveller, became more militant, involving himself in many left wing causes and protests. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} he joined the hard-left British Socialist Party, and he was an associate of anarchists and a political assasin. Graham was also a vociferous anti-imperialist at the height of British jingoism, a high-profile supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and Home Rule for Ireland and India.|$|E
25|$|The structuralist mode of {{reasoning}} {{has been applied}} in a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, psychology, literary criticism, economics and architecture. The most prominent thinkers associated with structuralism include Claude Lévi-Strauss, linguist Roman Jakobson, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed to be the heir apparent to existentialism. However, by the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from {{a new wave of}} predominantly French intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault, the philosopher and <b>social</b> <b>commentator</b> Jacques Derrida, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, and the literary critic Roland Barthes. Though elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as post-structuralists. In the 1970s, structuralism was criticized for its rigidity and ahistoricism. Despite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Lacan, continue to assert an influence on continental philosophy and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of structuralism.|$|E

Political theorist Stefan Hirsch condemned the buildings as [...] "bandages covering the sky, stifling our breath".

Artist Howard Cook's engravings critiqued the oppressive character of the new skyscrapers as they loomed over the traditional city.
