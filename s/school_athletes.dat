500|$|Second-impact syndrome, {{in which}} the brain swells dangerously after a minor blow, may occur in very rare cases. The {{condition}} may develop in people who receive a second blow days or weeks after an initial concussion, before its symptoms have gone away. [...] No one is certain of {{the cause of this}} often fatal complication, but it is commonly thought that the swelling occurs because the brain's arterioles lose the ability to regulate their diameter, causing a loss of control over cerebral blood flow. As the brain swells, intracranial pressure rapidly rises. The brain can herniate, and the brain stem can fail within five minutes. Except in boxing, all cases have occurred in athletes under age20. [...] Due to the very small number of documented cases, the diagnosis is controversial, and doubt exists about its validity. A 2010 Pediatrics review article stated that there is debate whether the brain swelling is due to two separate hits or to just one hit, but in either case, catastrophic football head injuries are three times more likely in high <b>school</b> <b>athletes</b> than in college athletes.|$|E
