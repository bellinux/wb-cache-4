We developed cost-saving and solvent-free nanoemulsions. Formulated with a low-energy method, these nanoemulsions can find application {{in the delivery of}} controlled amounts of drugs into the beverage of breeding animals (such as poultry, cattle, pigs) or be used for the controlled release of injectable poorly water-soluble drugs.

40|$|Constantly {{increasing}} {{consumption of}} drugs {{leads to the}} increase of the concentration of residues in various environmental compartments. For this reason the drug residues are nowadays classified as significant environmental contaminants. The drug residues enter the soil along with the application of sewage sludge either as a fertilizer or during fertilizing by animal excrements excreted after drug administration, eventually by direct contamination from treated grazing animals. The presence of these substances in soil has got {{negative impact on the}} sensitive soil ecosystem. The diploma thesis aims to evaluation of possible soil contamination with selected drugs through ecotoxicity tests. For this purpose sulfonamide chemotherapeutic agents, which are often used in veterinary medicine, were chosen, specifically sulfamethoxazole and <b>sulfamethazin.</b> Eartworms (Lumbricus) were selected as suitable test representative soil organism. In the experimantal part of this work the avoidance test according to ISO 17512 - 1 and modified bioaccumulation test according to OECD 317 methodology were performed. Bioaccumulation substances in oligochaetes, for which the artificial soil was prepared according to OECD 207 methodology, which was subsequently contaminated with above specified drugs. Although according to the results of determination of these substances there is no significant bioaccumulation in eartwormsâ€˜ tissue, these organisms are very responsive to the presence of contaminants in the soil environment. This is evident from the results of avoidance tests...|$|E
