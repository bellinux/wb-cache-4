These uncertainty condition factors that come from <b>stakeholder</b> can be identified into three parts: <b>stakeholder</b> impact, <b>stakeholder</b> engagement, and <b>stakeholder</b> psychological empowerment. It was hypothesized that project success are influenced by <b>stakeholder</b> impact, <b>stakeholder</b> engagement, and <b>stakeholder</b> psychological empowerment.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{association}} between <b>stakeholder</b> culture, <b>stakeholder</b> salience and firm response to <b>stakeholder</b> demands, based on the <b>stakeholder</b> culture framework. Design/methodology/approach – The study was conducted in a field setting involving 292 midlevel managers who completed measures of <b>stakeholder</b> culture and <b>stakeholder</b> engagement activities (SEAs) in their organizations. Findings – Results show that managers in organizations with different <b>stakeholder</b> cultures differentially ascribe and weigh the three attributes of power, legitimacy, and urgency when determining <b>stakeholder</b> salience. In addition, <b>stakeholder</b> culture is also associated with how managers respond to <b>stakeholder</b> issues in terms of SEAs. Research limitations/implications – Findings of the study justify the need to extend the <b>stakeholder</b> salience theory beyond the values of senior managers to include organization-level factors. This study is largely exploratory and the relationships that have been observed are associational in character. Practical implications – Results show that both ascription of <b>stakeholder</b> salience and the nature of SEAs are associated with <b>stakeholder</b> culture prevalent in an organization. This implies that managers may face constraints in managing <b>stakeholder</b> relationships, regardless of their personal values and beliefs, and may have to make deliberate efforts to modify the culture. Originality/value – Despite the fact that researchers have been urged to examine how organization level phenomena guide managerial thinking and decision making with respect to <b>stakeholder</b> relationships, empirical research on the topic is lacking. This study contributes to the emerging research on firm-level perspective on <b>stakeholder</b> management...|$|R

5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark.

These reductions have taken many <b>stakeholders,</b> including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some <b>stakeholders</b> still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>stakeholder</b> {{management}} {{has long been}} acknowledged {{as a means of}} increasing the propensity for successful delivery of construction projects, the full benefits of <b>stakeholder</b> management have yet to be tapped. Previous research efforts indicate lack of comprehensive <b>stakeholder</b> management process since the existing frameworks in construction either focussed on a particular construction stage or failed to incorporate important considerations such as the impact of procurement routes, internal <b>stakeholder</b> collaboration, responsibility for <b>stakeholder</b> management and project life cycle. This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for <b>stakeholder</b> management in construction projects in order to enable the industry tap the full benefits of <b>stakeholder</b> management. In order to achieve this aim, previous work on <b>stakeholder</b> management is reviewed. The current practice of <b>stakeholder</b> management within the construction industry, the effects of procurement routes and contract forms on <b>stakeholder</b> management process, the relationship among the critical success factors for <b>stakeholder</b> management in construction projects are investigated using an industry survey among construction professionals practicing within the United Kingdom. Data collected is analysed using a combination of qualitative approach and appropriate statistical techniques including structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the current practice of <b>stakeholder</b> management in construction projects, effects of procurement routes and contract conditions on <b>stakeholder</b> management process, and the interrelationships among the critical success factors for <b>stakeholder</b> management in construction projects. Based on a combination of the findings from literature review and data analyses, a life cycle based framework for <b>stakeholder</b> management in construction projects is developed using Integrated Defiinition 0 (IDEF 0) modelling. The framework is validated by practising industry professionals and is identified as a comprehensive guide to construction industry practitioners for carrying out <b>stakeholder</b> management in construction projects...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{extensive}} {{body of literature}} on sustainable tourism (ST), its successful implementation is an emerging and important theme. The lack of or ineffective <b>stakeholder</b> participation is a major obstacle to ST realisation {{and there is little}} clarity as to how best to resolve this problem. This paper presents the findings of a purposive UK-based case study that evaluated <b>stakeholder</b> involvement in the implementation of ST. Using over fifty stakeholders' accounts drawn from eight primary <b>stakeholder</b> groups, a ‘multi-stakeholder involvement management’ (MSIM) framework was developed. The MSIM framework consists of three strategic levels: attraction, integration and management of <b>stakeholder</b> involvement. Six stages are embedded within the three levels: scene-setting, recognition of <b>stakeholder</b> involvement capacity, <b>stakeholder</b> relationship management, pursuit of achievable objectives, influencing implementation capacity and monitoring <b>stakeholder</b> involvement. These are supported by the overarching notion of ‘hand-holding’ and key actions [e. g. managing <b>stakeholder</b> adaptability] that enhance <b>stakeholder</b> involvement in ST...|$|R

The proposed approach includes two major components: (1) <b>stakeholder</b> concern extraction, and (2) <b>stakeholder</b> concern classification. This paper focuses on presenting the proposed methodology and experimental results for <b>stakeholder</b> concern extraction, which extracts the words and phrases that describe <b>stakeholder</b> concerns from <b>stakeholder</b> comments on large-scale highway projects. In developing the proposed <b>stakeholder</b> concern extraction methodology, several supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms were tested and evaluated, {{and the effect of}} using a predefined name list as feature was also investigated.

For a stadium development to contribute positively to {{the area in which}} it is built and maximize the benefits for a range of <b>stakeholder</b> groups, it is important that a <b>stakeholder</b> management strategy is implemented consisting of two key components: <b>stakeholder</b> engagement and <b>stakeholder</b> participation. This article presents a case study of the <b>stakeholder</b> management strategy implemented by Arsenal Football Club during the development of the Emirates Stadium. Based primarily on the analysis of documentary secondary data supported by a small number of semi-structured interviews, the case study uses the theoretical literature on <b>stakeholder</b> management as a framework. It evaluates {{the extent to which the}} football club considered the needs and interests of different <b>stakeholder</b> groups during the development of the Emirates Stadium. Case study analysis shows that the <b>stakeholder</b> management strategy consisted of resident consultations, a communications strategy, a Stadium Liaison Committee, a Stadium Management Plan, and supporter consultations. The case study concludes by emphasizing that the <b>stakeholder</b> management strategy implemented by the football club, while clearly demonstrating evidence of <b>stakeholder</b> engagement, did not extend further with little opportunity for <b>stakeholder</b> participation and a lack of opportunities for involvement in decision-making processes...|$|R

On the backdrop of Arnstein’s (1969) citizenship participation model and reasons for <b>Stakeholder</b> Engagement framework, the paper argues that <b>Stakeholder</b> Engagement is attainable and measurable.
