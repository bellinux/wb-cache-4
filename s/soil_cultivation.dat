[...] Agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through <b>soil</b> <b>cultivation,</b> {{the use of}} nitrogen fertilisers, and animal waste handling. These activities stimulate naturally-occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil can be challenging to measure as they vary markedly over time and space, {{and the majority of}} a year's emissions may occur when conditions are favorable during [...] "hot moments" [...] and/or at favorable locations known as [...] "hotspots".|$|E

30|$|Enhancing soil {{infiltration}} {{would increase}} both its water-retention capacity and its organic matter content. In {{the soil and}} agricultural sciences, infiltration improvement usually involves cultivation to soften the surface <b>soils.</b> However, <b>cultivation</b> can dry the soils, and heavy rainfall can wash away organic-rich surface layers (Osawa et al.

We conclude that Cross cutting to 10 cm could reduce the amount of rhizomes, but that the effect is variable. We also conclude that the cross cutting do not improve the effect of mowing.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate the effect of soiling time on the yield and feeding value of forage rice. Using high yielding variety, Saikai 203 bred in Kyushu National Agriculture research Center, the growth of field population and the ingredient of harvested plants were analyzed. Cutting at the later stage of growing period increased dry matter yield of the soiling plants, but that of the ratoon was decreased. The total dry matter yield in any soiling plot was decreased compared with that in the control plot. However, the digestibility and nitrogrn content rate of harvested plants in the soiling plots were higher than thosein the control plot. Therefore, it seems that the <b>soiling</b> <b>cultivation</b> of the forage rice is available for the improvement of the feeding values...|$|R

Aggregates in such soils readily dissolve during subsequent rains, causing the soil to settle and become dense and hard, requiring further tillage.|$|E
