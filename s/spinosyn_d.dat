5000|$|Spinosad {{is a novel}} mode-of-action {{insecticide}} {{derived from}} a family of natural products obtained by fermentation of S. spinosa. Spinosyns occur in over 20 natural forms, and over 200 synthetic forms (spinosoids) have been produced in the lab. [...] Spinosad contains a mix of two spinosoids, spinosyn A, the major component, and <b>spinosyn</b> <b>D</b> (the minor component), in a roughly 17:3 ratio.|$|E
50|$|Spinosyn A {{does not}} appear to {{interact}} directly with known insecticidal-relevant target sites, but rather acts via a novel mechanism. Spinosyn A resembles a GABA antagonist and is comparable to the effect of Avermectin on insect neurons. Spinosyn A is highly active against neonate larvae of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, and is slightly more biologically active than <b>spinosyn</b> <b>D.</b> In general, spinosyns possessing a methyl group at C6 (spinosyn D-related analogs) tend to be more active and less affected by changes {{in the rest of the}} molecule. Spinosyn A is slow to penetrate to the internal fluids of larvae; it is also poorly metabolized once it enters the insect. The apparent lack of spinosyn A metabolism may contribute to its high level of activity, and may compensate for the slow rate of penetration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The spinosyns are a novel {{family of}} fermentation-derived natural {{products}} that exhibit potent insecticidal activities. Spinosad, a naturally-occurring mixture of spinosyn A and <b>spinosyn</b> <b>D,</b> has successfully established its utility for crop protective {{applications in the}} agrochemical field. Potential applications of this unique chemical family of macrolides also have been investigated {{in the field of}} animal health. Applications for the control of blowfly strike and lice on sheep have now been commercially developed and registered in Australia and potential applications for the control of ectoparasites on cattle are being studied...|$|E
40|$|Saccharopolyspora spinosa is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{that produces}} spinosad, a well-known biodegradable insecticide {{that is used}} for agricultural pest control and has an excellent environmental and mammalian toxicological profile. Here, we present the first draft genome sequence of the type strain Saccharopolyspora spinosa NRRL 18395, which consists of 22 scaffolds. Saccharopolyspora spinosa belongs to the genus Saccharo-polyspora, originally isolated from a soil sample collected from the Caribbean islands in 1982 (12). S. spinosa is the only bac-terium that secretes spinosad, a natural pesticide consisting of spinosyn A and <b>spinosyn</b> <b>D</b> that kills most pests and has no toxic effect on humans (3, 14, 15). Spinosad is produced by Dow AgroSciences, which won the Presidential Green Chem-istry Challenge Award for Designing Greener Chemicals in 1999, and is classified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency as an environmentally and toxicologically reduced risk material...|$|E
