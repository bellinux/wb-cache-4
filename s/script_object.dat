Hence, {{for the sake of}} simplicity we will present a less-detailed overview of our solution. In short, in our case the registration and manipulation of the PIDs boiled down to exchanging Java <b>Script</b> <b>Object</b> Notation (JSON) [20] representations of a PID handle via the HTTP protocol. An example of a handle in JSON format is illustrated in the upper part of Figure 6. The particular challenge is to integrate this message exchange with the Representational State Transfer (REST)-based service [21] API of EPIC within iRODS. We have written a Python-based client software to interact with the EPIC service.|$|E

The Erlang application model lets multiple components — each with its own supervisors and workers — run within the same virtual machine instance, even if they’re independently developed, all of which simplifies the integration of different datastores, code generators, parsers, and other subsystems required for Web applications.

30|$|In remote {{healthcare}} {{long term}} monitoring operations, based on Body Area Networks (BAN), demand {{low energy consumption}} due to limited memory, processing and battery resources [34]. These systems also demand communication and data interoperability among sensor devices [35]. Recently a propriety protocol ANT+ provides these low energy consumption features; and strengthens the goals of IoT through the interoperability of devices based on Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) mechanisms, which employs use case specific device profile standards [34, 36]. Device interoperability, low energy and miniaturisation features allow the building of large ecosystems, hence enable millions of vendor devices to get integrated and interoperated. IoT ecosystems want general storage mechanisms having structural flexibility to accept different data formats arriving from millions of sensory objects [37]. The non-relational or NoSQL databases are schema-free [2]; and allow storage of different data formats without prior structural declarations [34, 37]. However for the storage we need to investigate the NoSQL models to design and develop [8, 22]; besides flexibly preserving the big data timestamped characteristics for the massive real-time data flow during acquisition processes [24]. Although all NoSQL databases have unique advantages, but document-oriented storage, as MongoDB provides, is considered robust for handling multiple structural information to support IoT goals [38]. This rejects the relational structural storage and favours Java <b>Script</b> <b>Object</b> Notations (JSON) documents to support dynamic schemas; hence provide integration to different data types besides scalability features [39, 40].|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Computing and Information SciencesDoina CarageaThere {{are many}} formats in which digital {{information}} {{is stored in}} order to share and re-use it by different applications. The web can hardly be called old and already there is huge research going on {{to come up with}} better formats and strategies to share information. Ten years ago formats such as XML, CSV were the primary data interchange formats. And these formats were huge improvements over SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). It’s no secret that in last few years there has been a huge transformation in the world of data interchange. More lightweight, bandwidth-non-intensive JSON has taken over traditional formats such as XML and CSV. BigData is the next big thing in computer sciences and JSON has emerged as a key player in BigData database technologies. JSON is the preferred format for web-centric, “NoSQL” databases. These databases are intended to accommodate massive scalability and designed to store data which does not follow any columnar or relational model. Almost all modern programming languages support object oriented concepts, and most of the entity modeling is done in the form of objects. JSON stands for Java <b>Script</b> <b>object</b> notation and as the name suggests this object oriented nature helps modeling entities very naturally. And hence the exchange of data between the application logic and database is seamless. The aim of this report is to develop two similar applications, one with traditional SQL as the backend, and the other with a JSON supporting MongoDB. I am going to build real life functionalities and test the performance of various queries. I will also discuss other aspects of databases such as building a Full Text Index (FTI) and search optimization. Finally I will plot graphs to study the trend in execution time of insertion, deletion, joins and co- relational queries with and without indexes for SQL database, and compare them with the execution trend of MongoDB queries...|$|E
