METHOD: Cross-sectional study conducted between 2009 and 2012 on 4811 participants (2567 women, 58 ± 11 years) living in Lausanne, Switzerland. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of participants diagnosed with overweight/obesity reported a <b>slimming</b> <b>diet.</b> <b>Slimming</b> <b>diet</b> was associated with diagnosis of hypertension: Odds ratio and (95 % confidence interval) : 0. 61 (0. 40 - 0. 93); older age [0. 84 (0. 58 - 1. 21), 0. 79 (0. 53 - 1. 18) and 0. 47 (0. 27 - 0. 81) for [50 - 60 [, [60 - 70 [and [70 + years, respectively]; female gender [1. 84 (1. 36 - 2. 48) ] and diagnosis of diabetes [2. 16 (1. 13 - 4. 12) ]. Only 8 % of participants diagnosed with hypertension reported a low-salt diet. Low-salt diet was associated with antihypertensive drug treatment [2. 17 (1. 28 - 3. 68) ] and diagnosis of diabetes [2. 72 (1. 26 - 5. 86) ].

The aim of our research was to analyze nutritional behaviors {{for the assessment of}} the risk of orthorexia. The authors developed a questionnaire in which 981  respondents participated and used it as a research method. Both men and women ate mostly 4 – 5  meals per day (46. 30 % women versus 34. 74 % men); however, more men than women ate 1 – 2  meals daily (18. 95 % men versus 7. 9 % women). Both place of birth and field of study did not differ {{in terms of the number}} of meals. Moreover, it was observed that the number of meals per day was correlated with the declared time spent on planning a diet. People who ate over 3 meals per day more often indicates that they spent > 3 h per day on planning their diet in comparison with people who ate only 1 – 2 meals. Only 17. 6 % of the respondents declared that they most often ate meals in a company of someone, whereas 45. 3 % indicated that there was no rule. The remaining 37. 1 % of the respondents most often consumed their meals alone. Almost twice as many men as women never paid attention to the qualitative composition of nutrition. Women followed a <b>slimming</b> <b>diet</b> more often than men (20. 3 % versus 5. 8 %) and this indicated > 4 attempts of losing weight.

The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the effect of obesity on both serum leptin and its soluble receptor and to evaluate the effect of consumption of a special food formula combined with a restricted diet for obesity management. Thirty-two obese women volunteered to test a natural food formula in combination with a balanced hypo caloric-diet (both supply 900 - 1000 Kcal day - 1) shared in a short term study, which lasted for four weeks. The formula was composed of whole sweet potato and carrot which were reduced to a flour form in 2 : 1 ratio and consumed as a pudding (20 g flour + 100 mL boiled skimmed milk) for daily breakfast. Sweet potatoes and carrots are considered as a good source of dietary fibers, complex carbohydrates, antioxidants and phytochemicals. Subjects were divided into twenty-two obese women (group 1) with mean age (41. 8 ± 2. 91 years) and body mass index (34. 87 ± 1. 21), who followed the diet plus the pudding mixture; while ten obese women as a control (group 2) had a mean age of (43. 4 ± 2. 28) and a body mass index of (36. 57 ± 1. 31); who only followed the same diet. Relevant anthropometric measurements together with some biochemical parameters were determined before, after two and four weeks from the start of the regimen. Results showed although both groups lost weight comparably, group 1 (p< 0. 01,- 3. 55 %), group 2 (p< 0. 01,- 2. 01 %), yet there were differences between them regarding serum leptin where in group 1 it was significantly decreased (p< 0. 01, - 29. 77 %), with a concurrent increase in the serum soluble leptin receptor (p< 0. 05, + 15. 99 %); in contrast to decreased levels of both leptin (- 3. 33 %) and soluble leptin receptor (p< 0. 001, - 5. 05 %) in group 2.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} a 2512 kJ (600 kcal) daily energy deficit diet (ED) with a 6279 kJ (1500 kcal) generalized low-calorie diet (GLC) over a 24 week period (12 weeks weight loss plus 12 weeks weight maintenance). (2) To {{determine if the}} inclusion of lean red meat {{at least five times}} per week as part of a <b>slimming</b> <b>diet</b> is compatible with weight loss in comparison with a diet that excludes lean red meat. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Large petrochemical work-site. PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred and twenty-two men aged between 18 and 55 y. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. INTERVENTION: Eligible volunteers were randomized to one of the four diet=meat combinations (ED meat, ED no meat, GLC meat, GLC no meat). One-third of subjects in each diet/meat combination were randomized to an initial control period prior to receiving dietary advice. All subjects attended for review every 2 weeks during the weight loss period. For the 12 week structured weight maintenance phase, individualized energy prescriptions were re-calculated for the ED group as 1. 4 (activity factor) x basal metabolic rate. Healthy eating advice was reviewed with subjects in the GLC group. All subjects were contacted by electronic mail at 2 week intervals and anthropometric and dietary information requested. RESULTS: No difference was evident between diet groups in mean weight loss at 12 weeks (4. 3 (s. d. 3. 4) kg ED group vs 5. 0 (s. d. 3. 5) kg GLC group, P= 0. 34). Mean weight loss was closer to the intended weight loss in the 2512 kJ (600 kcal) ED group. The dropout rate was also lower than the GLC group. The inclusion of lean red meat in the diet on at least five occasions per week did not impair weight loss. Mean weight gain following 12 weeks weight maintenance was þ 1. 1 (s. d. 1. 8) kg, P< 0. 0001. No differences were found between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the individualized 2512 kJ (600 kcal) ED approach was no more effective in terms of weight loss than the 6279 kJ (1500 kcal) GLC approach. However the ED approach might be considered preferable as compliance was better with this less demanding prescription. In terms of weight loss the elimination of red meat from the diet is unnecessary. The weight maintenance intervention was designed as a low-input approach, however weight regain was significant and weight maintenance strategies require further development...|$|E

MÉTODO: Foram avaliados 391 estudantes aferindo-se: consumo de alimentos, hábitos alimentares, características antropométricas dos pais e atividade física. O IMC foi a variável dependente utilizada na regressão linear multivariada. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de sobrepeso foi 23, 9 % para meninos e 7, 2 % para meninas. Fazer dieta para emagrecer foi 7 vezes mais freqüente entre meninas do que entre meninos com sobrepeso. Nos meninos, idade, uso de dieta, omissão de desjejum, horas de televisão/"vídeo-game" e obesidade {{familiar}} apresentaram associação positiva e significante com IMC. Nas meninas, associaram-se positivamente: uso de dieta, omissão de desjejum e obesidade familiar e negativamente idade da menarca. A correlação do IMC com medidas antropométricas foi maior que 0, 7. CONCLUSÕES: Um padrão estético de magreza parece predominar entre meninas e elas o atingem com hábitos e consumo alimentar inadequados. INTRODUCTION: Obesity {{during adolescence}} {{is considered a}} strong predictor of adult obesity. The present study assessed the overweight/obesity prevalence and associated factors in middle class adolescents of a school {{in the city of}} Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and evaluated the correlation between body mass index with anthropometric measures of fatness. METHOD: The analysis covered 391 students aged from 15 to 17 years. Adolescents had their weight, height, skinfold thickness and upper arm circumference measured at school. A food frequency questionnaire (list of 79 items) and a questionnaire including food habits, parents anthropometric characteristics, physical activity and other factors associated with obesity were filled out by the adolescents at school. RESULTS: The proportion of overweight individuals among boys (Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than the 90 th percentile of the Brazilian population) was 23. 9 %, whereas the prevalence among girls was 7. 2 %. The fact of being on a <b>slimming</b> <b>diet</b> was a relevant factor for the prediction of BMI and was 7 times more frequent among girls than among boys. Among boys, being on a diet, absence of breakfast, and family body appearance were positively associated with BMI. Among girls these variables were also significantly associated, whereas age at menarche was negatively associated with BMI. Hours of watching TV/video/ video-game was associated with BMI only among boys. The correlation coefficient between BMI and measures of fatness varied from 0. 7 to 0. 9 for boys, and from 0. 8 to 0. 90 for girls.

40|$|About 12 % of {{the adult}} Dutch {{population}} is obese (Quetelet Index > or = 30 kg/m 2). The prevalence has roughly doubled over the past 20 years. Obesity is strongly associated {{with a number of}} chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, increased healthcare costs and a loss of productivity. Obesity is always the result of a mismatch between energy intake and energy expenditure.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that the formation of reactive metabolites of drugs is associated with drug toxicity. Similarly, there are accumulating data suggesting {{the role of the}} formation of reactive metabolites/intermediates hydrolase. On the other hand, some herbal/dietary constituents were shown to form reactive intermediates capable Life Sciences 74 (2004) 935 – 968 of irreversibly inhibiting various CYPs. The resultant metabolites lead to CYP inactivation by chemical modification of the heme, the apoprotein, or both as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the apoprotein. Some examples include bergamottin, a furanocoumarin of grapefruit juice; capsaicin from chili peppers; glabridin, an isoflavan from licorice root; isothiocyanates found in all cruciferous vegetables; oleuropeinthrough bioactivation in herbal toxicity and carcinogenicity. It has been hypothesized that the resultant reactive metabolites following herbal bioactivation covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, leading to toxicity via multiple mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, oncogene activation, and hypersensitivity reactions. This is exemplified by aristolochic acids present in Aristolochia spp, undergoing reduction of the nitro group by hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP 1 A 1 / 2) or peroxidases in extrahepatic tissues to reactive cyclic nitrenium ion. The latter was capable of reacting with DNA and proteins, resulting in activation of H-ras oncogene, gene mutation and finally carcinogenesis.

40|$|Previous {{studies had}} {{suggested}} that periods of low energy intake evoke compensatory adaptations in energy metabolism, which retard weight loss, and promote weight regain when energy intake returns to normal. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether a <b>slimming</b> (low-energy) <b>diet</b> based on alternating energy intake could counteract this decrease in energy requirement. The persistance of the reduction of energy metabolism was studied 1 month and approximately 1 year after weight reduction. The effects of three <b>slimming</b> <b>diets</b> were compared pairwise in three separate studies. To this end, a cross-over design was used (fig. 2). Two alternating diets (diet AB/ 100 : one day solely bread, water. coffee and tea, the other day providing 100 % (normal diet) the daily energy need and diet A 50 / 100 : one day providing 50 % of the daily energy need, the other day 100 %) and one continuous diet (C 50 : providing 50 % of daily energy need every day) were prescribed or supplied. Ten women participated in each study. First each subject lived on a weight-maintenance diet (S 100) for 8 days, then two periods of low energy intake, of 4 weeks each, followed immediately afterwards. Energy balances were determined during the final 8 days of each diet period. The 24 hour energy expenditure was measured in a respiration chamber for 2 or 3 successive days. The activity pattern in the respiration chamber was standardized. Dopplermeters and actometers were used to record physical activity. Follow-up measurements of energy balance were made on ten subjects 1 month after slimming and on eight subjects energy balance was determined approximately 1 year after <b>slimming.</b> Weight-maintenance <b>diets,</b> adjusted for weight loss, were supplied during the follow-up measurement periods. Over the first 4 weeks of slimming body weights decreased by averages of 5. 8 kg (C 50), 4. 5 kg (AB/ 100) and 3. 9 kg (A 50 / 100). The average weight losses over 8 weeks were 6. 9 to 9. 0 kg. After 8 weeks at a low energy intake 24 hour energy expenditure had declined by 12 - 15 %. This decline was partly (50 %) {{accounted for by the}} reductions in body weight and partly (30 %) by reduced dietary induced thermogenesis. The remaining part (20 %) of the decline was probably due to the reduced cost and amount of physical activity which was indicated by Dopplermeter counts and actometer counts. Sleeping energy expenditure also decreased during slimming by 6 - 13 %, but this was no more than could be expected from weight loss. Weight reduction by alternating (low with normal) low energy intakes resulted in a reduction of energy expenditure which, when weight loss and energy intake were taken into account, was similar to the reduction by continuous low energy intake, thus alternating low energy intake did not prevent energy expenditure rates from declining. Subjects participating in the follow-up studies maintained their reduced body weights successfully. Their 24 hour energy expenditure rates in the follow-up studies were still below the rates measured before slimming. When body weight and energy intake were taken into account, both the 24 hour energy expenditure values and the sleeping energy expenditure values were the same before slimming, and 1 month or 1 year after slimming. The changes of energy metabolism were determined by alterations in body weight and energy intake and probably in physical activity as well. It remains to be investigated whether other adaptive mechanisms are evoked when energy intake is restricted more severely or for longer periods. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that obesity is {{inversely}} associated with one’s occupation category, and women from working-class backgrounds are more widely affected. The aim {{of this paper is to}} increase our understanding of the methods working-class women use to implement <b>slimming</b> <b>diets.</b> It uses the results of a qualitative investigation (observations and interviews) conducted among women who participated in a Food Education Programme in the north of France, the region where obesity is most widespread. We illustrate that the women interviewed use three types of techniques (physical, dietary or culinary) in order to lose weight, revealing three different ways of envisaging weight-loss – interventions upon the body (including weight-loss surgery) without any modification of food intake / severely restricting food intake / adapting culinary practices. These differences reflect the effects of class belonging and the subdivisions of that class, combined with the effects of social trajectories. More generally it should be highlighted how some of our interviewees go through a predictable order of different techniques in parallel with their social trajectory. Conceptions of dieting and its implementation can be understood in light of the somatic cultures particular to each subdivision, which reproduce internally the more general differences dividing social groups concerning disease, health and eating habits. Social and family trajectories tend to reinforce these differences, especially when the social mobility of daughters acts as inverse socialisation when they encourage their mothers to adopt their own standards for body weight. As opposed to Great Britain (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs eg) there is in France an important debate among policy makers to know whether one should target messages at particular groups, but for the moment nothing has been decided in this way.

40|$|Background: The dietary {{content of}} advice in men’s {{lifestyle}} magazines {{has not been}} closely scrutinised. Methods: We carried out an analysis of such content in all 2009 issues (n[*]=[*] 11) of Men’s Health (MH) focusing on muscularity, leanness and weight control. Results: Promotion of a mesomorphic body image underpinned advice to affect muscle building and control weight. Diet advice was underpinned by a strong pseudo-scientific discourse, with citation of expert sources widely used to legitimise the information. Frequently multiple dietary components were advocated within one article e. g. fat, omega- 3 fatty acids, thiamine, zinc and high-glycaemic index foods. Furthermore advice would cover numerous nutritional effects, e. g. strengthening bones, reducing stress and boosting testosterone, with little contextualisation. The emphasis on attainment of a mesomorphic body image permitted promotion of <b>slimming</b> <b>diets.</b> Advice to increase calorie and protein intake to augment muscle mass was frequent (183 and 262 references, respectively). Such an anabolic diet was advised in various ways, including consumption of traditional protein foods (217 references) and sports foods (107 references), thereby replicating muscle magazines’ support for nutritional supplements. Although advice to increase consumption of red meat was common (52 references), fish and non-flesh sources of protein (eggs, nuts & pulses, and soy products) together exceeded red meat in number of recommendations (206 references). Advice widely asserted micronutrients and phytochemicals from plant food (161 references) as being important in muscle building. This emphasis diverges from stereotypical gender-based food consumption patterns. Dietary advice for control of body weight largely replicated that of muscularity, with strong endorsement to consume fruits and vegetables (59 references), diets rich in nuts and pulses and fish (66 references), as well as specific micronutrients and phytochemicals (62 references). Notably there was emphasis on fat-burning, good fats and consumption of single foods, with relatively little mention of dietary restriction. Conclusions: Despite {{the widespread use of}} scientific information to endorse dietary advice, the content, format and scientific basis of dietary content of MH leaves much to be desired.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} four pillars {{in the popular}} discourse about food 1) sophistication, 2) thinness, 3) purity, and 4) cosmopolitanism. The collective emergence of these four pillars in mainstream U.

I show that the four pillars are neither a unified gestalt nor a new phenomenon. Instead, they represent conflicting and competing ideals that were also mainstream preoccupations between 1880 and 1920. At {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, gourmet cooking, <b>slimming</b> <b>diets,</b> natural and “Pure Foods,” and international cuisines first became popular in the U. S. primarily among urban middle-class women, who served as national taste leaders.

My central argument is that rather than representing a true enlightenment, the food revolution serves as a compensatory form of class mobility for the American middle class during periods of income stagnation and high inequality. Food has been used to define social classes since the emergence of capitalism, but aspirational eating, or the use of food as a means of performing and embodying the “good life” is a quintessentially middle-class practice that emerged in Anglo-American culture in the eighteenth century. Its changing manifestations reflect the shifting nature of middle-class status anxieties. Since the 1980 s, as middle class has struggled to maintain their material advantages over the lower classes, the cultural capital represented by food has become a central technology of creating class distinctions and one of the primary ways that many Americans have of aspiring to the “good life. ...|$|R

Chan has a {{teaching}} certificate in piano; as she was not very good academically, her mother suggested she take up an instrument when she was 11 years old. She used her skills in piano to earn a living part-time as a piano teacher during her college years. Chan has had weight issue her entire life; this was due to uncontrollable excessive eating.

40|$|It is now {{well-known}} {{that the}} plasmatic levels of beta-endorphin (B-Ep) in subjects suffering from hyperphagie obesity during childhood, adolescence and adult age, {{are higher than}} those of normal weight standard-wright. The causes are still unknown. In obese subjects, there is also a dissociation between plasmatic levels of B-Ep and of ACTH, in spite of the common origin of Proopiomelanocortin (POMC). On the basis of these observations we studied the plasmatic levels of B-Ep, ACTH and cortisol, basal and after DXM, before and after the reduction of body weight. With the aim of evaluating pharmacological interference, the obese subjects were treated with diet alone or diet associated with an anorectic and serotoninergic drug (fenfluramin). The results have shown that after <b>slimming,</b> obtained with <b>diet</b> alone or {{with the help of the}} serotoninergic drug, the hyperendorphinemia persists both in basal conditions and after the DXM test. The verification of such behaviour in some psychiatric diseases supports our assumption of a link between hyperendorphinemia, behaviour alterations, hyperphagy and obesity...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the effects of {{exposure}} to slim images and diet-related products in commercials on actual food intake in relation to dietary restraint. Design: An experimental design was used, in which food intake was measured in 124 female students who watched either a sad or a neutral movie on television, which was interrupted by either commercials featuring <b>slim</b> models and <b>diet</b> products, or neutral commercials. Subsequently, participants filled out questionnaires on dietary restraint and any tendency toward overeating. Main outcome variable: Intake of snack food while watching television. Results: It was found that highly restrained students exposed to commercials with slim models and diet-related products ate less food, whereas less restrained eaters ate slightly more after seeing these commercials. Conclusion: The findings suggest that restrained eaters confronted with <b>diet</b> products and <b>slim</b> images when watching television will be reminded of their restricted eating behavior and eat less. The present study provides support for the reinhibition theory of slim media images...|$|R
5000|$|The {{campaign}} has been criticized {{on the grounds that}} Unilever also produces Fair and Lovely, a skin-lightening product marketed at dark-skinned women in several countries. It was also widely noted that Unilever brand Lynx's advertising campaign would seemingly contradict the sentiment of the Campaign for Real Beauty. [...] Moreover, Unilever owns Axe hygiene products, which are marketed to men using overtly sexualized women, and <b>Slim</b> Fast <b>diet</b> bars. Writing for Forbes, Will Burns called such criticism [...] "totally irrelevant". [...] He explained: [...] "No one thinks of Dove as a Unilever brand, for starters (nor should Dove) ... But more to the point, does Dove’s idea mean teen boys don’t still want to smell good for the ladies? Or that people who are overweight don’t want to lose a few pounds? These are different brands solving problems for completely different audiences." [...] The criticism has also been justified from others that state their concerns that the images that Dove portrays in their ads are supposed to be unedited and [...] "real"; however, there have been comments made stating they have been photoshopped to smooth the appearance of the women's skin, hide wrinkles and blemishes, fix stray hairs, etc. Photo retoucher Pascal Dangin, who works for Box Studios in New York, told The New Yorker he made edits to the photos, “Do you know how much retouching was on that?” he asked. “But it was great to do, a challenge, to keep everyone’s skin and faces showing the mileage but not looking unattractive.” The women who are targeted by these ads have mixed reviews as well. Some women were turned off that Dove was in essence telling them they knew the insecurities they felt and what all women felt. Social networking sites such as Facebook became an outlet for women to express their praise and criticism.|$|R
40|$|Our diploma thesis {{concentrates}} on the description of excessive weight and obesity, the methods used to estimate the level of nourishment, prevalence and factors leading to obesity. We have also listed the physiological and energy needs of our body. The most frequent ways of <b>slimming</b> down and <b>dieting</b> programs were also discussed, paying {{special attention to the}} Slim-Fit program practiced in the spa Šmarješke Toplice. In the empiric part of the thesis we analyzed the most common reasons why people return to join the Slim-Fit program. The research sample included 19 participants from Belgium and Netherlands who enrolled the slimming down program at least twice. We were interested in the main reasons why people enter the program for the first time, reasons for re-entering the program, as well as considering the main tips, given during the dieting program. The participants were also asked to list their ideas or suggest potential changes of the program. We obtained all necessary data for the research by means of a questionnaire. The results showed that the questioned participants took part in the program following their wish to keep stable weight and return to enjoy and stay in good condition during the program. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} — not chronologically, but sociologically — {{the transition}} from the age of asceticism, which advises one to eat like a bird in order to perfect the soul, to the modern age, in which the diet society is highlighted. It asserts that this ambivalent and conflictive situation between soul and body creates a collective regime in which the human being is embodied and the body becomes nothing. The body, being beyond all means of liberation, turns into both an unending capital and an abysmal swamp of modernity. Under this regime, the Self reflects upon itself and categorises the body as either skinny or fat. Besides, the exhibitive industrialised visualisation of the Self is unexpectedly blinding. Here, the body disappears {{as much as it is}} highlighted. The new style-life formula, which reduces bliss and salvation to the gym, <b>slimming</b> pills and <b>diet</b> programmes, incessantly guides the masses through the medical sciences and, in particular, the media. Every tendency towards achieving absolute beauty and happiness is reborn from its own ashes as a new form of dissatisfaction and leads to endless searching. Through the Mexican film Malos Hábitos (2007), this paper focuses on the dichotomies between physical and spiritual existence, the individual and the social body, hunger and gluttony, mirror and appearance, and desire and dissatisfaction. In this respect, it implicitly offers a critical stance of secular discourses focusing around the concepts of the body and freedom that have often been debated in recent years in Turkey...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis called: Influence of Mass-media on Physical Appearance {{of people}} in the Ústí Regionq is focused on {{importance}} of physical appearance of (post) modern individual and increasing influence of media in the society. Theoretical part concentrates on subject of media, commercial advertising and physical appearance, and provides basic information on target area (The Ústí Region) which represents basic database for target population. Collection of primary data was carried out by quantitative research. Then, secondary data analysis: content analysis of documents, and interrogation method: questionnaire technique, were used. Content analysis of documents draws from literary sources, Internet documents, magazines and memoirs. The questionnaire was anonymous; it comprised of combination of in total 27 open a closed questions. Introductory questions were focused on general information on a respondent, following ones concentrated on influence of media (advertising, Internet, TV, etc.) on physical appearance {{of people in}} the Ústí Region. The objective of thesis was to find out if younger age categories were more influenced by advertising (media) at perception of their own look, mainly when they used products (creams, <b>slimming</b> products, <b>diets,</b> [...] .) or services (manicure, hairstyling, fitness, [...] .) supporting better physical appearance, than higher age groups. Hypothesis of the work: Influence of mass-media on physical appearance {{of people in the}} Ústí Region falls with age, assumed that younger age categories were more influenced by media than higher ones. The research, however, showed that majority of respondents was convinced that at examining their own appearance they were not influenced by media. It was, nevertheless, found out that the age category most influenced by commercial advertising (media) was just the category of respondents between 18 th to 29 th year of age. Most respondents state that they do not examine their appearance comparing themselves with celebrities in media and do not use make-ups and aids or products improving their look under influence of commercials or media. During processing of the results it became clear that {{there was a significant difference}} between men and women in being influenced by commercial advertising, or in using various make-ups or services improving their look. Since the thesis was not focused on research from respondents point of view, this kind of division is not part of its outcomes. The influence of media on physical appearance of people is interesting not only from sex, but also from age point of view, because current advertisement has, to a certain degree, impact on perception of physical appearance of respondents in different age categories...|$|R
