40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to examine if there are functional differences between the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and the abductor digit minimi (ADM) muscles during different muscle contractions, namely dynamic and static contractions of the index and little finger abductions. It was also examined whether these functional differences occur at the cortical level. The motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and force curves, during the muscle contractions, were simultaneously recorded. Rest motor thresholds (RMTs) and active motor thresholds (AMTs), during dynamic and static contractions, were determined in the two muscles. In all trials, the background EMGs (B. EMGs) were kept {{at the same level}} in each muscle. Results showed that the target matching errors of dynamic contractions were statistically smaller in the FDI muscle than those in the ADM. In the FDI muscle, the AMT during dynamic contractions was significantly lower than during static ones and the MEPs elicited by TMS were larger during dynamic contractions than those during static ones. However, such results were not found in the ADM muscle. In order to investigate whether the differences were caused by the excitability changes that occurred in the cortical level, the responses elicited by <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulations</b> were recorded using the same procedures as the experiment of TMS. Responses to subcortical stim-ulations during dynamic contractions were similar to those during static ones in either muscle. It is concluded that there are differences in the task-dependent MEP facilitations between the FDI and ADM muscles. And the differences are due to the functional demanded excitability changes accompanied by the cortical acti-vation.

40|$|Objectives: Recent anatomical-functional {{studies have}} {{transformed}} {{our understanding of}} cerebral motor control away from a hierarchical structure and toward parallel and interconnected specialized circuits. Subcortical electrical stimulation during awake surgery provides {{a unique opportunity to}} identify white matter tracts involved in motor control. For the first time, this study reports the findings on motor modulatory responses evoked by <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> and investigates the cortico-subcortical connectivity of cerebral motor control. Experimental design: Twenty-one selected patients were operated while awake for frontal, insular, and parietal diffuse low-grade gliomas. Subcortical electrostimulation mapping was used to search for interference with voluntary movements. The corresponding stimulation sites were localized on brain schemas using the anterior and posterior commissures method. Principal observations: Subcortical negative motor responses were evoked in 20 / 21 patients, whereas acceleration of voluntary movements and positive motor responses were observed in three and five patients, respectively. The majority of the stimulation sites were detected rostral of the corticospinal tract near the vertical anterior-commissural line, and additional sites were seen in the frontal and parietal white matter. Conclusions: The diverse interferences with motor function resulting in inhibition and acceleration imply a modulatory influence of the detected fiber network. The <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> sites were distributed veil-like, anterior to the primary motor fibers, suggesting descending pathways originating from premotor areas known for negative motor response characteristics. Further stimulation sites in the parietal white matter {{as well as in the}} anterior arm of the internal capsule indicate a large-scale fronto-parietal motor control network.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Left visual neglect is a {{frequent}} and dramatic consequence of right hemisphere lesions. Diagnosis is important because behavioural and pharmacological treatments are available. Furthermore, neglect raises important issues concerning the brain mechanisms of consciousness, perception and attention. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent behavioural findings and new techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, direct cortical and <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> during brain surgery, and diffusion tensor imaging tractography, have provided evidence relevant to the debate concerning the functional mechanisms and the anatomical bases of neglect. SUMMARY: Several component deficits appear to interact in producing different forms of neglect. Rather than lesions at single cortical levels, dysfunction of large-scale brain networks, often induced by white matter disconnection, may constitute the crucial antecedent of neglect signs...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the brainstem motor system on cerebral motor areas may {{play an important role}} in motor control in health and disease. A new approach to investigate this interaction in man is combining acoustic stimulation activating the startle system with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex. However, it is unclear whether the inhibition of TMS responses following acoustic stimulation occurs at the level of the motor cortex through reticulo-cortical projections or subcortically, perhaps through reticulo-spinal projections. We compared the {{influence of}} acoustic stimulation on motor effects elicited by TMS over motor cortical areas to those evoked with <b>subcortical</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> (SES) through depth electrodes in five patients treated with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. SES bypasses the motor cortex, demonstrating any interaction with acoustic stimuli at the subcortical level. EMG was recorded from the contralateral biceps brachii muscle. Acoustic stimulation was delivered binaurally through headphones and used as a conditioning stimulus at an interstimulus interval of 50 ms. When TMS was used as the test stimulus, the area and amplitude of the conditioned motor response was significantly inhibited (area: 57. 5 +/- 12. 9 %, amplitude: 47. 9 +/- 7. 4 %, as percentage of unconditioned response) whereas facilitation occurred with SES (area: 110. 1 +/- 4. 3 %, amplitude: 116. 9 +/- 6. 9 %). We conclude that a startle-evoked activation of reticulo-cortical projections transiently inhibits the motor cortex...|$|R
40|$|Wernicke’s area was, {{for a long}} time, {{considered}} a non-removable area and patients affected by low-grade gliomas (LGGs) or high-grade gliomas (HGGs) in this region were considered inoperable. Several studies have demonstrated a large functional reshaping of language networks in patients affected by gliomas or acute stroke involving Wernicke’s terri- tories, and the complete resection of this region invaded by LGG has recently been reported. We report our experience in the removal of Wernicke’s territories invaded by gliomas. Four patients underwent awake surgery, with neuropsychological and neurophysiological monitoring and direct cortico- <b>subcortical</b> bipolar <b>stimulation,</b> for resection of LGG (one case) and HGGs (three cases) invading Wernicke’s territories. Resec- tion rates were evaluated by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) perfusion for LGG and HGGs, respectively. HGGs were totally resected and LGG was partially resected (67 %), according to functional limits. No patients reported neurological deficit. The patient affected by LGG underwent postoperative chemotherapy. Two of the patients harbouring HGGs died 21 and 23 months after surgery and postoperative adjuvant treatment, respectively. The third one is still alive and progression-free 21 months after surgery. Awake surgery is a reliable and effective technique for resection of gliomas invading Wernicke’s territories without postoperative permanent deficit. LGGs in this region can safely be removed, according to the functional subcortical boundaries, allowing postoperative adjuvant treatment, functional reshaping and multi-step surgery. HGGs, instead, can be completely re- moved without deficits and sometimes beyond the contrast enhancement area, allowing the best possible oncological prog- nosis for the patients...|$|R
40|$|The discovery, {{development}} and use of genetic rodent models of absence epilepsy have led to a new theory about the origin of absence seizures, which has gained impact within the international epilepsy community. A focal zone has been identified in the perioral region of the somatosensory cortex in WAG/Rij and GAERS, the two most commonly used and best characterized genetic absence models. From here the seizure spreads quickly over the cortex and to the thalamus. Network analyses reveal unique dynamics in cortico-thalamic, thalamo-cortical and intrathalamic network. Activity in the cortex start to lead activity in the thalamus already 2 s before SWD onset, this leading role persists throughout the seizure when other cortical and thalamic regions consistently lag behind this focal site. After the first 500 - 1000 ms of SWD onset, the thalamus and cortex form a complex oscillatory network, with feedforward and feedback control of various cortico-thalamic, thalamo-cortical and intrathalamic relations and spreading directions. Pharmacologic, neurophysiologic, and molecular studies confirm the existence of a highly excitable focal cortical zone. This finding has led to the identification of various new disease-related mechanisms in cortex and thalamus involved in the pathogenesis of absence seizures. The availability of fertile, otherwise healthy, and genuinely epileptic animals has also led to studies of gene-environment interactions and of the interaction of different seizure types. It has also led to the discovery that absence epilepsy is comorbid with various psychopathologies. The issue of comorbidities is gaining interest since it has become clear that not only depression, but also schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, occur more often in epilepsy patients than in the nonepileptic population. In models with two different seizure types such as amygdala kindled or audiogenic sensitive WAG/Rij's or GAERS, the interaction of various seizure types has been studied. Understanding this interaction is important given that many patients have mixed symptoms which are often difficult to treat. Experimental treatment options were explored such as various forms of electrical <b>stimulation,</b> including <b>subcortical</b> deep brain <b>stimulation</b> and new antiabsence drugs and mechanisms were explored. Antiepileptogenesis might be feasible in the genetic models, although its mechanisms remain unclear. Finally, the usage of the genetic animal models has been instrumental to the changed concepts regarding whether generalized epilepsies do really exist...|$|R
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the accuracy of}} magnetic resonance tractograpghy (MRT) in localizing the cortical spinal tract (CST) close to brain tumours by using intraoperative electric <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Methods: Nine patients with intraaxial brain tumours underwent neurosurgery. Planning was based on analysis of the course of streamlines compatible with the CST. After tumour removal, intraoperative MRT was reacquired. Sites at various distance from the CST were repeatedly stimulated to assess whether registered motor evoked potential (MEP) could be elicited. All patients were assessed clinically both pre- and postoperatively. Results: The motor function was preserved in all patients. In all patients intraoperative MRT demonstrated shift of the bundle position caused by the surgical procedure. The distance between the estimated intraoperative CST and the point of elicited MEP was 1 cm or less in all nine patients. At distances greater than 2 cm, no patient reported positive MEP. Conclusion: Intraoperative MRT is a reliable technique for localization of CST. In all patients MEP were elicited by direct subcortical electrical stimulation at a distance below 1 cm from the CST as represented by MRT. Brain shifting might impact this evaluation since CST position may change during surgery {{in the range of}} 8 mm...|$|E
40|$|The {{fixed points}} of the human {{cerebral}} motor area were stimulated electrically by square waves {{and the effects of}} altering parameters upon motor response were studied. 1) Under constant frequency of stimulation longer duration required a lower threshold. It was shown also by <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> but the threshold was higher than that by cortical stimulation. 2) Under constant frequency of stimulation, changing of stimulating duration produced no altering of motor response at all. 3) Under constant duration of stimulation, low frequency produced a movement of distal joint but higher frequency produced proximal joint. 4) At the low frequencies, the responses followed the rate of stmulation; at higher frequencies smooth movements occurred; at very high frequencies quick jerky movements were observed. 5) At high frequencies, higher threshold produced also a motor response of proximal joint. From this fact it is regarded that the altering of motor response is not influenced by liminal voltage. From above mentioned the mechanism of altering effects upon motor responses caused by changing of stimulating frequencies is easily cleared. The reasons are due to the intricating arrangement of representations in motor cortex and the differences of threshold in every center depend upon number of cells, which are required for the motor response...|$|E
40|$|Background: To date, few {{parameters}} {{have been}} found that can aid in patient selection and surgical strategy for eloquent area gliomas. Aims: The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze preoperative and intraoperative factors that can predict functional outcome and extent of resection in eloquent area tumors. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 patients harboring supratentorial gliomas in eloquent areas undergoing awake surgery. The analysis considered clinical, neuroradiologic (morphologic), intraoperative, and postoperative factors. End-points were extent of resection (EOR) as well as functional short- and long-term outcome. Postoperatively, MRI objectively established the EOR. x 2 analyses were used to evaluate parameters that could be predictive. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the best combination to predict binary positive outcomes. Results: In 90 % of the cases, <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> was positive in the margins of the surgical cavity. Postoperatively, 51 % of the patients deteriorated but 90 % of the patients regained their preoperative neurological score. Factors negatively affecting EOR were volume, degree of subcortical infiltration, and presence of paresis (P, 0. 01). Sharp margins and cystic components were more amenable to gross total resection (P, 0. 01). Contrast enhancement (P, 0. 02), higher grade (P, 0. 01), paresis (P, 0. 01), and residual tumor in the cortex (P, 0. 02) negatively affected long-term functional outcomes...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study, which {{aimed to}} confirm or {{invalidate}} the somatotopic organization of the supplementary motor area (SMA), correlates the pattern of clinical symptoms observed after SMA removal with the extent of resection. METHODS: Eleven patients with medial precentral glioma underwent partial or complete tumoral resection of the SMA. Seven patients underwent preoperative {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} that incorporated speech and motor tasks. During the operation, the primary motor and speech areas and pathways (in the dominant side) were identified by use of intraoperative direct cortical or <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation,</b> and these areas were respected. RESULTS: SMA resection resulted in motor deficits, language deficits, or both; the deficits were always regressive, and they corresponded to the SMA syndrome. The topography and severity of these deficits were correlated to the extent of the SMA resection. The location of the deficit corresponded to SMA somatotopy: the representations of the lower limb, the upper limb, the face, and language (in the left-dominant SMA) were located from posterior to anterior. This somatotopy was also observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: Correlation between clinical patterns of deficit and the extent of SMA resection, guided by means of pre- and intraoperative functional methods, provides strong arguments in favor of somatotopy in this area. This knowledge should allow clinicians to base preoperative predictions of the pattern of postsurgical deficit and recovery on the planned resection, thus allowing them to inform patients accurately before the procedure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cortical and {{subcortical}} neurophysiological mapping techniques {{based on}} the original Penfield's work are still widely used nowadays. Yet this bipolar 60 Hz technique has some drawbacks related {{to the risk of}} intraoperative seizures, the limited feasibility in young children and the fact that, due to stimulation parameters, continuous MEP monitoring cannot be done. We reviewed our 6 -year experience of combined cortical and subcortical mapping, and muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEP) monitoring during surgery in 121 brain lesions involving motor areas, using a high frequency monopolar short train of stimuli technique. Materials and methods: The somatosensory evoked potential phase reversal technique was used to identify the central sulcus. We used direct cortical stimulation to identify cortical motor areas and <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> to follow subcortical white matter motor tracts during tumor removal. This was done by using short trains of 5 to 7 monopolar square-wave stimuli of 500 μs duration, interstimulus interval of 4 ms, repetition of 1 - 2 Hz, and intensity up to 20 mA; motor responses were recorded from needle electrodes inserted in controlateral muscles. During tumor removal, continuous mMEP monitoring was performed from a strip cortical electrode and/or transcranially. Motor outcome was assessed on admission, at discharge from hospital and, in a subset of patients, at a 4 -month follow-up, using the Medical Research Council scale. We used association in two-way tables with chi-square test of significance and α = 0. 05, as well as the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect correlations between neurophysiological and outcome-related variables. Results: The monitorability rate for different neurophysiological techniques ranged between 90 and 97 %. At discharge from hospital, 18 % of patients improved their motor grade when compared to pre-operatively, 61 % remained unchanged, 18 % presented with a 1 -grade worsening and 6 % with more than 1 grade worsening. Most of these deficits recovered over time. In the subgroup of 39 patients with a 4 -month follow-up, none presented with a worsening of more than 1 grade and all, except 2, had a good motor function (grade 4 or 5). Lower <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> thresholds correlated with an aggravated post-operative outcome (p-value = 0. 04). Patients who presented at the end of surgery a more than 75 % drop in MEP amplitude had a significantly higher incidence of post-operative motor deficit at discharge from hospital (p-value = 0. 008). However, these two prognostic variables were not related (p-value > 0. 05). Conclusion: Muscle MEP amplitude mostly correlates with post-operative outcome in brain surgery but criteria for MEP interpretation are far less established than for spinal cord surgery, and this may account for some discrepancy between intraoperative findings and post-operative outcome. Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting that MEP monitoring adds to the established value of cortical and subcortical mapping, ultimately offering a better chance to identify an impending injury to the motor system. Our experience confirms that the use of intraoperative neurophysiological techniques minimizes the risk of permanent severe neurological deficits when operating in critical areas, ultimately encouraging a more aggressive surgical removal even in these locations...|$|E
40|$|Biceps brachii motor evoked {{potentials}} (MEPs) from cortical stimulation {{are influenced}} by arm posture. We used <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> of corticospinal axons to determine whether this postural effect is spinal in origin. While seated at rest, 12 subjects assumed several static arm postures, which varied in upper-arm (shoulder flexed, shoulder abducted, arm hanging to side) and forearm orientation (pronated, neutral, supinated). Transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral motor cortex elicited MEPs in resting biceps and triceps brachii, and electrical stimulation of corticospinal tract axons at the cervicomedullary junction elicited cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEPs). MEPs and CMEPs were normalized to the maximal compound muscle action potential (M max). Responses in biceps were influenced by upper-arm and forearm orientation. For upper-arm orientation, biceps CMEPs were 68 % smaller (P = 0. 001), and biceps MEPs 31 % smaller (P = 0. 012), with the arm hanging to the side compared with when the shoulder was flexed. For forearm orientation, both biceps CMEPs and MEPs were 34 % smaller (both P < 0. 046) in pronation compared with supination. Responses in triceps were influenced by upper-arm, but not forearm, orientation. Triceps CMEPs were 46 % smaller (P = 0. 007) with the arm hanging to the side compared with when the shoulder was flexed. Triceps MEPs and biceps and triceps MEP/CMEP ratios were unaffected by arm posture. The novel finding is that arm posture-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability in humans are largely spinal in origin. An interplay of multiple reflex inputs to motoneurons likely explains the results...|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} spatial {{patterns}} of cortical activation observed with EEG, MEG and fMRI might arise from spontaneous self-organisation of interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We examine the dynamical {{behavior of a}} mean-field cortical model that includes chemical and electrical (gap-junction) synapses, focusing on two limiting cases: the “slow-soma” limit with slow voltage feedback from soma to dendrite, and the “fast-soma” limit in which the feedback action of soma voltage onto dendrite reversal potentials is instantaneous. For slow soma-dendrite feedback, we find a low-frequency (1 Hz) dynamic Hopf instability, and a stationary Turing instability that catalyzes formation of patterned distributions of cortical firing-rate activity with pattern wavelength 2 cm. Turing instability can only be triggered when gap-junction diffusion between inhibitory neurons is strong, but patterning is destroyed if the tonic level of subcortical excitation is raised sufficiently. Interaction between the Hopf and Turing instabilities may describe the non-cognitive background or “default” state of the brain, as observed by BOLD imaging. In the fast-soma limit, the model predicts a high-frequency Hopf (35 Hz) instability, and a traveling-wave gamma-band instability that manifests as a 2 -D standing-wave pattern oscillating in place at 30 Hz. Small levels of inhibitory diffusion enhance and broaden {{the definition of the}} gamma antinodal regions by suppressing higher-frequency spatial modes, but gamma emergence is not contingent on the presence of inhibitory gap junctions; higher levels of diffusion suppress gamma activity. Fast-soma instabilities are enhanced by increased <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Prompt soma-dendrite feedback may be an essential component of the genesis and large-scale cortical synchrony of gamma activity observed at the point of cognition...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During {{the removal}} of brain lesions {{involving}} motor areas {{it is critical to}} localize and preserve motor tracts subcortically. With this aim, either subcortical mapping using 60 Hz Penfield's technique or continuous motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring using the monopolar short train technique has been reported, but their combined use remains anecdotal. We report our experience in 160 patients where both MEP monitoring and cortical/subcortical mapping were used to preserve motor function intraoperatively. METHODS: In the past 7 years we performed intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in 160 patients operated on for brain tumors, the majority being high grade gliomas. After opening the dura, to identify cortical motor areas we routinely used: 1) the somatosensory evoked potential phase reversal technique; 2) direct cortical stimulation (DCS) with a short train of 5 to 7 monopolar square-wave stimuli of 0. 5 ms duration, ISI 4. 1, at 1 - 2 Hz and intensity up to 20 mA. Then, to monitor motor pathways during tumor removal, MEPs were recorded from controlateral limb muscles after either DCS from a strip electrode (105 cases) and/or transcranial electrical stimulation (145 cases). When approaching tumor borders, MEP monitoring was combined with periodical direct <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> (DSS) (64 cases) to localize cortico-spinal tracts and guide resection. RESULTS: Two neurophysiological parameters were associated to some degree of post-operative neurological worsening: First, a significant drop (> 75 %) in transcranial MEP amplitude at the end of surgery; second, a DSS thresholds lower than 3 - 4 mA. However these two warning signs were not significantly related. CONCLUSION: Our neurophysiological warning criteria are similar to those reported by other authors. However we proved that these criteria do not necessarily identify the same patients. Furthermore, a negative subcortical mapping may encourage tumor removal when MEPs are stable. Vice versa, since injury to the motor pathways may be vascular rather than mechanical, MEP monitoring may identify reversible vascular derangements not recognizable by mapping techniques only. We therefore suggest the combined use of continuous MEP monitoring and periodical subcortical mapping to minimize risks...|$|E
40|$|Object. Several {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that the gross-total resection (GTR) of malignant brain tumors has a significant influence on patient survival. Frequently, however, GTR cannot be achieved because the borders between healthy brain and diseased tissue are blurred in the infiltration zones of malignant brain tumors. Especially in eloquent cortical areas, resection is frequently stopped before total removal is achieved to avoid causing neurological deficits. Interestingly, 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) {{has been shown to}} help visualize tumor tissue intraoperatively and, thus, can significantly improve the possibility of achieving GTR of primary malignant brain tumors. The aim {{of this study was to}} go one step further and evaluate the utility and limitations of fluorescence-guided resections of primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent cortical areas in combination with intraoperative monitoring based on multimodal functional imaging data. Methods. Eighteen patients with primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent areas were included in this prospective study. Preoperative neuroradiological examinations included MR imaging with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), functional MR, and diffusion tensor imaging sequences to visualize functional areas and fiber tracts. Imaging data were analyzed offline, loaded into a neuronavigational system, and used intraoperatively during resections. All patients received 5 -ALA 6 hours before surgery. Fluorescence-guided tumor resections were combined with intraoperative monitoring and cortical as well as <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> to localize functional areas and fiber tracts during surgery. Results. Twenty-five procedures were performed in 18 consecutive patients. In 24 % of all surgeries, resection was stopped because a functional area or cortical tract was identified in the resection area or because motor evoked potential amplitudes were reduced in an area where fluorescent tumor cells were still seen intraoperatively. Gross-total resection could be achieved in 16 (64 %) of the surgeries with preservation of all functional areas and fiber tracts. In 2 patients presurgical hemiparesis became accentuated postoperatively, and 1 of these patients also suffered from a new homonymous hemianopia following a second resection. Conclusions. The authors' first results show that tumor resections with 5 -ALA in combination with intraoperative cortical stimulation have the advantages of both methods and, thus, provide additional safety for the neurosurgeon during resections of primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent areas. Nonetheless, more cases and additional studies are necessary to further prove the advantages of this multimodal strategy...|$|E
40|$|Although {{advances}} in diffusion tensor imaging have {{enabled us to}} better study the anatomy of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), its function remains poorly understood. Recently, {{it was suggested that}} the subcortical network subserving the language semantics could be constituted, in parallel with the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, by the left ILF, joining the posterior occipitotemporal regions to the temporal pole, then relayed by the uncinate fasciculus connecting the anterior temporal pole to the frontobasal areas. Nevertheless, this hypothesis was solely based on neurofunctional imaging, allowing a cortical mapping but with no anatomofunctional information regarding the white matter. Here, we report a series of 12 patients operated on under local anaesthesia for a cerebral low-grade glioma located within the left temporal lobe. Before and during resection, we used the method of intraoperative direct electrostimulation, enabling us to perform accurate and reliable anatomofunctional correlations both at cortical and subcortical levels. In order to map the ILF. Using postoperative MRI, we correlated these functional findings with the anatomical locations of the sites where language disturbances were elicited by stimulations, both at cortical and subcortical levels. Our goal was to study the potential existence of parallel and distributed language networks crossing the left dominant temporal lobe, subserved by distinct subcortical pathways [...] namely the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus and the ILF. Intraoperative stimulation of the anterior and middle temporal cortex elicited anomia in four patients. At the subcortical level, semantic paraphasia were induced in seven patients during stimulation of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and phonological paraphasia was generated in seven patients by stimulating the arcuate fasciculus. Interestingly, <b>subcortical</b> <b>stimulation</b> never elicited any language disturbances when performed {{at the level of the}} ILF. In addition, following a transient postoperative language deficit, all patients recovered, despite the resection of at least one part of the ILF, as confirmed by control MRI. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the "semantic ventral stream" could be constituted by at least two parallel pathways within the left dominant temporal lobe: (i) a direct pathway, the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, that connects the posterior temporal areas and the orbitofrontal region, crucial for language semantic processing, since it elicits semantic paraphasia when stimulated; (ii) and also possibly an indirect pathway subserved by the ILF, not indispensable for language, since it can be compensated both during stimulation and after resection...|$|E
