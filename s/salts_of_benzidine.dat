In these products benzidine and the benzidine related amines o-anisidine, 2, 4 -toluenediamine, 4, 4 '-diaminodifenylmethane, 3, 3 '-dichlorobenzidine en o-toluidine were found. Basically, the risk assessment consists of both {{a comparison of the}} (estimated) level of aromatic amines which, during the period in which products are used, enters the body and the acceptable limits, as set for the chronic exposure to these amines. The following aspects were taken into account in the risk assessment: 1) the chance that products contain azo dyes and amines, 2) the frequency with which products are used, 3) the fraction of products which comes into contact with the skin, 4) the level of amines in products, 5) the migration of azo dyes and amines from products, 6) the absorption of azo dyes and amines through the skin and 7) the acceptable limits as set for the chronic exposure to aromatic amines. The "Negligible Risk Level"-NRL (life-long exposure leading to one extra case of cancer in one million exposed persons) and the "Maximal Permissible Risk Level - MPRL (lifelong exposure leading to one extra case of cancer in ten thousand exposed persons) were taken for these last limits.

The single-crystal conductivity measurements show that monomerized or π-dimerized radicals (BZ. +, TMB. +, and TPB. +) are nonconductive, whereas the π-stacked radical (DATP. +) is conductive. A conduction mechanism between chains through π stacks is proposed...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that blood shows {{considerable}} peroxidase-like enzymatic activity and therefore in the presence of hydrogen peroxide will give highly coloured products with certain substrates and, in particular, with amines such as benzidine. The carcinogenic nature <b>of</b> <b>benzidine,</b> however, dictates a search for a satisfactory alternative substrate such as phenolphthalein which is believed to be non-carcinogenic. This study, designed to ascertain the relative merits <b>of</b> using <b>benzidine</b> and phenolphthalein as reagents in indicator tests for blood, centers primarily on the sensitivity, stability and specificity of the two substrates. Despite the fact that the three-stage phenolphthalein presumptive test for blood appears to be somewhat less sensitive than the conventional benzidine test, results indicate that it has several advantages in terms of specificity and stability. Results also indicate that the enzyme peroxidase, which is widely distributed in plants, does not contribute to false positive results in the three-stage phenolphthalein indicator test for bloodstains.
