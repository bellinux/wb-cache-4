According to the FCC, approximately 7 percent of all U.S. mobile <b>subscribers</b> were <b>served</b> by resellers, including MVNOs, and analysts find that the 15.1 million wireless <b>subscribers</b> <b>served</b> by resellers {{by the end of}} 2006 has increased by 1.6 million over the previous year.|$|R

30|$|There {{are some}} other metrics that address the RAN performance. The metrics here {{evaluate}} the global attained service provision given a consumed power. This level of service provision can be measured as proposed by ETSI for GSM networks [20, 24], whether {{in terms of the}} ratio of <b>subscribers</b> <b>served</b> or the covered area to site power consumption. The ratio of number of <b>subscribers</b> <b>served</b> during the peak traffic hour to site power consumption is used for urban environments, whereas the ratio of area coverage attained to site area consumption is used for rural areas. In [13, 21], they propose to use as metric the consumed power per area unit (W/m 2). According to [21], in order to avoid misinterpretations it is important to fix the coverage area for having then a point of reference for comparisons.|$|R
5000|$|For each <b>serving</b> <b>exchange</b> {{involved}} in providing end user access lines, a virtual path is provisioned to a BT ATM switch on BT's core network.

One or more Digital Subscriber Line Digital Multiplexers at the <b>serving</b> <b>exchange</b> combine the traffic from the end user access lines for delivery to the ATM switch.|$|R
50|$|Where VDSL or VDSL2 is used {{to deliver}} a service, {{competing}} SLU operators at the same site must adhere to tie cable length limitations to prevent interference. Other restrictions are in force to prevent interference with ADSL or ADSL2+ frequencies on the local loop from the <b>serving</b> <b>exchange.</b> In the UK the incumbent telco aggregation cabinets are known as Primary Connection Points (PCPs) and each one is assigned a CAL (Cabinet Assigned Loss) value based on its distance from the <b>serving</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 {{customers}} served from 16 dial offices. Sunset had 68,000 <b>subscribers</b> <b>served</b> from nine manual offices. Home's operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn't convert the dial offices to manual as it had in the past. Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a dial and trunk lines to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.|$|R

In particular, according to [21], the number of LTE-A <b>subscribers</b> <b>served</b> by one operator in this fictitious scenario was predicted to be, at most, 55, 000 by the third year. That is to say, a population density of 275 people per km 2 is considered.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Wireless {{multicasting}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important for efficient distribution of streaming media and location-aware services to mobile and hand-held devices, network management, and software updates over cellular (UMTS-LTE) and indoor/outdoor wireless networks (e. g., 802. 11 / 16). Multicast beamforming was recently proposed {{as a means of}} exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to boost spectral efficiency and meet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Infeasibility is a key issue in this context, due to power or mutual interference limitations. We therefore consider the joint multicast beamforming and admission control problem for one or more co-channel multicast groups, with the objective of maximizing the number of <b>subscribers</b> <b>served</b> and minimizing the power required to serve them. The problem is NP-hard even for an isolated multicast group and no admission control; but drawin...|$|R

For the special case of an isolated multicast, Lozano proposed a particularly simple adaptive algorithm for implementation in UMTS-LTE. We identify strengths and drawbacks of Lozano's algorithm, and propose two simple but worthwhile improvements. All algorithms are carefully tested on publicly available indoor/outdoor measured channel data...|$|R
