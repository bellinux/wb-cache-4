[...] "Such want of truth, such ungoverned tongues and tempers, such godlessness altogether! It is only <b>surface-work,</b> taming the {{children}} at school, while they have such homes; and their parents, {{even if they do}} come where they might learn better, are always liable to be upset, as they call it--turned out of their places in church, and they will not run the chance." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of the nanomechanical phenomena experienced by nanoparticle-conjugated biomolecules. A thermodynamic framework is developed {{to describe the}} binding of thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) to thrombin when the TBA is conjugated to nanorods. Binding results in nanorod aggregation (viz. directed self-assembly), which is detectable by absorption spectroscopy. The analysis introduces the energy of aggregation, separating it into TBA–thrombin recognition and <b>surface-work</b> contributions. Consequently, it is demonstrated that self-assembly {{is driven by the}} interplay of surface work and thrombin-TBA recognition. It is shown that the work at the surface is about − 10 kJ mol− 1 [mol superscript - 1] and results from the accumulation of in-plane molecular forces of pN magnitude and with a lifetime of < 1 s, which arises from TBA nanoscale rearrangements fuelled by thrombin-directed nanorod aggregation. The obtained surface work can map aggregation regimes as a function of different nanoparticle surface conditions. Also, the thermodynamic treatment can be used to obtain quantitative information on surface effects impacting biomolecules on nanoparticle surfaces. MIT-IQS Exchange Progra...|$|E
