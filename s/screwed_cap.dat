40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine {{closures}} provide {{many benefits}} in maintenance of wine quality over time, however acceptance of their use by purchasers has varied. This work first investigates how factors like age, gender, income and education affect {{the decision to}} purchase <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines {{and to what extent}} these factors impact consumer decisions to bring <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine to various social settings. The results of a questionnaire pooling attitudes and behaviors of wine purchasers (n= 319) indicate that factors such as age, wine knowledge, income and gender influence a consumer’s decision to purchase <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine. Education and income positively impact the acceptance of <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines and the likelihood of purchasing them. Age has a negative effect on acceptance of <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines in social situations. Gender was found to not be significant in regards to likelihood of <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine purchase generally, however men tended to view <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines as more acceptable in more social situations than women...|$|R

50|$|Compared to cork, <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> {{reduce the}} wine faults of {{oxidation}} and of cork taint, {{although it is}} possible to find TCA contamination in a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> bottle. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> are generally perceived as easier to open. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> have a much lower failure rate than cork, and in theory will allow a wine to reach the customer in perfect condition, with a minimum of bottle variation. However, cork has a centuries-old tradition behind it, and there are also concerns about the impact of <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> on the aging of those few wines that require decades to be at their best. Some argue that the slow ingress of oxygen plays a vital role in aging a wine, while others argue that this amount is almost zero in a sound cork and that any admitted oxygen is harmful.|$|R

40|$|In {{the wine}} closure {{industry}} cork remains the dominant bottle sealing technology with a {{market share of}} around 90 per cent. Our research analyses the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine seal's development and original introduction within Australia in the 1970 s. It identifies the fundamental reasons for its initial commercial failure. The Australian wine industry {{played a leading role}} in recognizing the commercial potential of a French prototype <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. Local piloting and testing occurred followed by a market launch. Unfortunately for <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> change agents, the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal was largely a failure. Rogers' (1995) innovation diffusion model identifies several underlying factors responsible for the customer's rejection of the new <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. In particular, these were the failure to effectively demonstrate the relative advantage of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal to consumers and to address the complexity and incompatibility of the seal with established user traditions. The industry was therefore unable to achieve a 'critical mass' of adoption. The additional application of Moore's (2001) adaptation of the technology adoption life cycle model reveals that the failure of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> was also attributable to a lack of an effective industry marketing strategy that would overcome this identifiable consumer resistance. In particular, it lacked a strategy to manage the transition dynamics between the early and mainstream markets. We conclude that a theoretically informed {{understanding of the nature of}} the innovation and thus the adoption hurdles would have significantly aided the diffusion of this innovation...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> or [...] "Stelvin caps" [...] are {{closures}} {{made only}} from aluminium material that threads onto the bottleneck. They are the predominant closure used by Austrian, Australian and New Zealand wineries. This {{can be attributed}} {{in part to the}} New Zealand <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> initiative which promotes the use of <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> instead of cork. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> form a tighter seal and can keep out oxygen for a longer time than cork. These benefits aid in maintaining the wine's overall quality and aging potential. Michel Laroche of Domaine Laroche noted that this played a role in his decision to adopt screwcaps. [...] "Extensive quality tests show convincing results: apart from protecting against cork taint, screwcaps are also beneficial in the aging of wine, particularly preserving the aromatic freshness." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> {{met with}} {{customer}} resistance in Australia and New Zealand, and were phased {{out in the}} early 1980s, only to be reintroduced gradually in the 1990s. Since reintroduction, ever-increasing numbers of winemakers are using the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> within Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, adoption went from 1% in 2001 to 70% in 2004. <b>Screw</b> <b>cap</b> adoption in fine wines in Australia has proceeded in fits and starts. In July 2000, a group of Clare Valley Riesling producers, led by Jeffrey Grosset bottled {{a portion of their}} wines in <b>screw</b> <b>cap,</b> and earlier that year PlumpJack Winery announced it would bottle half its production of US$130 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon in screwcap.

50|$|Zork is an {{alternative}} wine closure for still wines, that seals like a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> and pops like a cork, created by an Australian company of the same name. The closure has three parts: an outer cap providing a tamper-evident clamp that locks onto the band of a standard cork mouth bottle; an inner metal foil which provides an oxygen barrier similar to a <b>screw</b> <b>cap,</b> and an inner plunger which creates the ‘pop’ on extraction and reseals after use. Introduced in 2010, {{it is the first}} on-bottle, resealable closure for sparkling wines.|$|R

50|$|Improvements in cork and {{winemaking}} methodology {{continue to}} strive {{to lower the}} incidence, but the media attention given to cork taint has created a controversy in the winemaking community, with traditional cork growers {{on one side and}} the makers of newer synthetic closures and <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> on the other. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> and synthetic corks, however, are thought be prone to another aroma taint: sulphidisation. This may arise from the reduced oxygen supply which concentrates sulphurous smells arising from wines with universal preservatives, however it is more likely that these wines contain excessive/imbalanced amounts of sulphite based preservatives to begin with.|$|R

50|$|A <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> is a metal <b>cap</b> that <b>screws</b> onto threads on {{the neck}} of a bottle, {{generally}} with a metal skirt down the neck to resemble the traditional wine capsule ("foil").

Its use as an alternative wine closure is gaining increasing support as an alternative to cork for sealing wine bottles.
