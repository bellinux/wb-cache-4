The data utilized in this study was retrieved from the archived data from a five-year longitudinal research project targeting Spanish-speaking students with limited English language proficiency at elementary level. All the participants in the treatment groups received the <b>structured</b> language <b>instruction</b> from the entry of kindergarten to the end of third grade with multiple instructional components. In order to compare the oral proficiency of students in two different treatment conditions, 64 third grade students were randomly selected from the transitional bilingual education program. Among the 64 participants, 32 received enhanced English instruction and the other 32 received only typical ESL instruction. The enhanced instruction the participants received in the year of third grade included story reading, retelling, content area integration, direct vocabulary instruction, higher-order thinking skills and ESL strategies. All the participants in treatment and control groups received curriculum-based vocabulary measure and standardized assessment. The first research question focused on the oral fluency based on the curriculum-based vocabulary knowledge. The findings suggested significant impact of time and treatment, and also a significant interaction effect between these two variables, indicating that the intervention had a significant effect on the students? oral proficiency based on the curriculum-based measurement and the effect was more evident in the posttest. The second and third research question focused on students? vocabulary knowledge and listening comprehension on the measure of standardized assessment after receiving repeated story reading and explicit vocabulary instruction. The results showed the treatment group outperformed the control group in the aspects of vocabulary knowledge and listening comprehension.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that in the Netherlands, as in other countries, a majority of students do not attain the desired level of writing skills {{at the end of}} elementary school. Time devoted to writing is limited, and only a minority of schools succeed in effectively teaching writing. An improvement in the way writing is taught in elementary school is clearly required. In order to identify effective instructional practices a meta-analysis was conducted of writing intervention studies aimed at grade 4 to 6 in a regular school setting. Average effect sizes were calculated for 10 intervention categories: strategy instruction, text <b>structure</b> <b>instruction,</b> pre-writing activities, peer assistance, grammar instruction, feedback, evaluation, process approach, goal setting, and revision. Five of these categories yielded statistically significant results. Pairwise comparison of these categories revealed that goal setting (ES = 2. 03) is the most effective intervention to improve students’ writing performance, followed by strategy instruction (ES =. 96), text <b>structure</b> <b>instruction</b> (ES =. 76), peer assistance (ES =. 59), and feedback (ES =. 88) respectively.

40|$|This six-month {{intervention}} study focusing on ninth-grade struggling readers had three goals: {{to determine the}} overall literacy growth of adolescent struggling readers when engaged in a task-through-text instructional framework situated within specially designed discourse communities, to determine the effectiveness of text <b>structure</b> <b>instruction,</b> and to track intrinsic motivational changes related to reading. 	Small discourse communities were designed {{for the purpose of}} apprenticing students into literate high school culture. Within the discourse communities, students engaged in challenging tasks in appropriate text to increase academic literacy. Most students began the intervention reading below a second-grade level. Students who were receiving special education, second language, and no services participated in the study. Using the task-in-text discourse community framework, students in six small reading classes received daily intervention given by the researcher. This study also used low-level expository text with four characteristics: links to interest and prior knowledge, sufficient density of ideas, clear rhetorical patterns, and clear signaling devices. 	When compared with the control group, at post- testing, students receiving intervention showed a statistically significant difference in overall literacy growth as well as in their ability to use and transfer knowledge of text structure. A within-groups counterbalanced design showed that students who received text <b>structure</b> <b>instruction</b> first scored statistically significantly better on a summarization task even after they were no longer receiving text <b>structure</b> <b>instruction.</b> Students in the instruction group completed a self-reported questionnaire about motivation for reading. Statistically significant increases in reading efficacy and reading challenge were observed indicating that students increased both their personal beliefs about reading as well as their willingness to take risks as readers. 	Results indicate that adolescents who are reading at very low levels can increase their literacy abilities rapidly under the right learning conditions and when given appropriate texts. Further, instruction in text structure assisted students with both comprehension and content knowledge acquisition. Finally, students in the instruction group increased their motivation for reading. Outcomes in literacy growth, text structure, and motivation, all support future research concerning pedagogically sound methods for providing reading intervention to adolescent struggling readers...|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigates {{an area of}} language learning that has captivated and divided educators and researchers for decades: the role of phonics and word study in beginning reading instruction. This inquiry focuses on how first and second grade teachers construct phonics and word <b>structure</b> <b>instruction</b> in a school district committed to a holistic approach to literacy learning and instruction that {{meets the needs of}} its diverse student body. Caught up in the conversation surrounding the use of phonics in beginning reading instruction, the district is seeking a deeper awareness of the multiple factors that determine the degree to which teachers address phonic and word structure elements in their classrooms. Six teachers, two from each of the district 2 ̆ 7 s three elementary schools, were identified as participants in the study. Data were collected over a nine month period during the 1995 – 1996 school year and included: classroom observation; fieldnotes; quasi-formal and informal interviews of teachers, district administrators, and reading specialists; audiotaped interviews and classroom literacy events; district documents; and informal conversations with various school personnel. Situated within a social constructivist paradigm the data were examined through three conceptual frameworks: the social, curricular, and instructional contexts through which the teachers constructed phonics instruction and word structure study as their students worked and played with words. Within these contexts teachers varied from skills-based to meaning-based in their construction of phonics and word <b>structure</b> <b>instruction,</b> often employing {{a combination of the two}} approaches. Veteran teachers were strongly committed to explicit, rule-based language instruction that aids in the development of metalinguistic skills and familiarizes students with the alphabetic principle, Teachers recently graduated from university programs that emphasize a whole language approach often lack a strong knowledge base in phonics, word structure, and the alphabetic principle. Implications for teaching and research focus on how teachers learn, staff and professional development, beginning teacher induction programs, preservice and graduate teacher education, curriculum development, and reflective practice. ...|$|E
