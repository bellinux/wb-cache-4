40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of leadership for effective safety management {{has been the}} focus of research attention in industry for a few years. However, safety leadership in relation to safety climate has rarely been examined. This study has investigated the relationship between safety leadership and safety climate in the context of coal mine. Self-administered questionnaires that included a safety leadership scale and a safety climate scale were used to collect data in three coal mines in China. The number of returned valid questionnaires was 450, and the response rate was 88. 2 %. Exploratory factor analysis identified three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership and four dimensions <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate. The structural equation modeling results suggest that the active management <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects <b>safety</b> training <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate, the <b>safety</b> motivation <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects the safety commitment and the <b>safety</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate, and the <b>safety</b> monitor <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects the <b>safety</b> awareness <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate. The study findings also reveal positive associations among safety climate. The results of the statistical analysis indicated that coal mine leaders would do well to develop a strategy to change their leadership styles by which they improve the safety climates...|$|R
