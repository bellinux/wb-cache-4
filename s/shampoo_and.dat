25|$|Zoey (Miles?): A baby {{orangutan}} who {{was brought}} into the Miles' family after being rejected by her mother.

She once swallowed an entire bottle of <b>shampoo</b> <b>and</b> became seriously dehydrated, which caused Molly to rush her to a hospital in order to keep her from dying.

Naval cooks also came, many of them from the Sylhet Division of the Bengal Presidency in British India (now in Bangladesh). One of the most famous early Asian immigrants to England was the Bengali Muslim entrepreneur Sake Dean Mahomet, a captain of the East India Company who in 1810 founded London's first Indian restaurant, the Hindoostanee Coffee House.

25|$|Zoey came to {{live with}} the Mileses shortly after she was born. Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild.

Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of <b>shampoo</b> <b>and</b> has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no matter how much trouble she causes.|$|E

To relieve themselves latrine pits were dug, as portable toilets were rare in the Red Army. Soldiers frequently slept outdoors, even during the winter. Food was usually abysmal and often in short supply, especially in 1941 and 1942. The frontoviks detested the rear service troops who did not face the dangers of combat as krysa (rats). The frontovik lived on a diet of black rye bread; canned meats like fish and tushonka (stewed pork); shchi (cabbage soup) and kasha (porridge).”. Kasha and shchi were so common that a popular slogan in the Red Army was “shchi ee kasha, pisha nasha” (“schchi and kasha, that's our fare.”). Chai (hot sugared tea) was an extremely popular beverage together with beer and vodka. Makhorka, a type of cheap tobacco roiled in handmade cigarettes was the standard cigarette.|$|E
