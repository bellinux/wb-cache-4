This was despite the fact that vendors at the event had encouraged the homeless to attend and take free <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> their <b>merchandise.</b> In 2005, police assembled an undercover taskforce to crackdown on panhandling in the downtown Little Rock area, arresting 41 people. 72% of the homeless report ever being arrested.|$|R
