The territory of Serbia is characterized by a large number of border regions with different features and potentials. The Drina area, with its very specific physical social, economic and historic features and above all, with natural resources and potentials, asks for a creative methodology to enable adequate spatial integration of this crossborder region. The paper is elaborating the idea of forming a crossborder region as indispensable for the future, compared with <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> up to date.

The spatial and environmental planning should play the {{key role in}} coordination and integration of different planning grounds in achieving the sustainable regional development. The paper discusses the spatial planning capacity to offer the integral view of the sustainable territorial development. The brief review of tendencies in new spatial planning and regional policy has been given. The {{focus is on the}} concept of balanced polycentric development of European Union. The guiding principles of spatial planning in regard of planning system reform in European countries have been pointed out. The changes in paradigm of regional policy, and the tasks of European regional spatial planning have been discussed. In Serbia problems occur in regard with the lack of coordinating sectoral planning with spatial and environmental planning. Partly the problem lies in the legal grounds, namely in non codification of laws and unregulated horizontal and vertical coordination at all levels of governance. The possibilities for the implementation of spatial planning principles and concepts of European Union sustainable territorial and regional development have been analized on the case of three regional spatial plans of eastern and southeastern regions in Serbia. The dissadvantages in implementing the strategic environmental impact assessment as an instrument for coordination and integration of <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> with spatial and environmental planning have been analized.

40|$|Water {{management}} in Serbia has been mostly {{operating in a}} framework of public companies and institutions focused on strictly sectorial and technical expertise on hydraulic engineering, environmental protection and navigable traffic engineering within the highly autonomous legislative framework. On the cross-point of spatial planning and water management {{there is a growing}} debate on the important discourses of the policy domains. Seeing rivers as an “accommodated” generator of opportunities is a statement which is opposing the traditional consideration of strict separation of water from the land. Spatial planning as a framework for regulating the land use has an important function in integrating the water management and landscape more closely. In Serbian spatial planning practice there is growing practice of area-specific development planning (reflected through the Spatial plans for the special-purpose areas) which are considered to accommodate new ideas on spatiality better than the traditional, <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> documents. The question is placed as to how these practices could direct new spatial arrangements of integrative collaborative spatial planning and not just merely reflect the framework of the existing planning order. This paper seeks the potential and actual role of spatial planning in addressing challenges related to particular river environments on the Tisa and the Danube rivers. The research is based on the analysis of two Spatial plans for the special-purpose areas which are still in conceptual phase - The Cultural landscape of Bač and Multifunctional ecological corridor of the Tisa river...|$|E

40|$|With some {{exceptions}} during the time, {{the increase of}} urban waste has een considered as a controversial topic of public interest and removed from many disciplines or fields of knowledge. For a period of time, the is- sue of urban waste management has been neglected by spatial planning be- cause it has been considered as marginal {{with respect to the}} disciplinary contents, while it has been delegated (or relegated) to the <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> of environment. Indeed, “the landscape of waste” has been removed from collective interest until the European Landscape Convention, the document that recognizes as part of landscape not only excellent areas, but also areas of everyday life and degraded areas. In Italy, even if the national law on waste management replaces the waste disposal system with the paradigm based on the so called “ 4 R” strategy, many sectorial plans remain obsolete and are disconnected from territorial planning, whereas European policy stresses the need to overcome previous approaches and build a society founded on recycle. The contemporary debate focuses on the “piano territo- riale di coordinamento” (spatial plan), which should harmonize at the vast scale the several sectorial plans of environment and the various landscape aspects. Although spatial and urban planning seems to recover the waste management issue, many aspects remain controversial. Among these, the instrument of Localization Suitability Analysis (as foreseen by sectorial plans on waste management) not always interrelates with urban and spatial planning within a coherent framework of landscape protection, including urban scale; while planning deficiency favors infiltration of mafia within the management of urban waste.

40|$|An {{exploration}} of the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in Burk-ina Faso illustrates the difficulties of <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> for improved natural resource management. Tracing the history of development planning and {{the background of the}} preparation of environmental action plans in numerous African countries leads to an assessment of the results and impact of the NEAP in Burkina Faso. It is argued that the NEAP has played only a marginal role in tackling the environmental problems of the country. The lack ofparticipation in preparation, institutional confusion, and insufficient analysis of the main causes of environmental degradation as well as the failure to identify costs and benefits of specific resource management improvements are amongst shortcom-ings of the plan. The article concludes that to encourage more investment in better resource management, this will require greater integration of environ-mental concerns in economic policy making. In the aftermath of the work of the Brundtland Commission (World Commission for Environment and Development, 1987) and the &dquo;Rio&dquo; Conference on Environment and Development, which culminated in the adoption of the &dquo;Agenda 21 &dquo; strategy (Umted Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 1992), there has been a tremendous upsurge in concern about sustainable development. The environment has become an increasing priority in policy making in both industrialised and developing countries. This has included the preparation of action plans for environmental management. In some countries where fragile agro-ecological conditions combined with low standards of living present significant development chal-lenges-such as those in Sahelian West Africa-the design of sustainable development strategies is particularly important in that improved man-agement of natural resources is fundamental to economic growth.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{discussion}} on vulnerability and adaptation in urban areas, {{there is limited}} research on how smaller towns and cities in Small Island Developing States are being affected by and responding to climate change impacts. This study uses fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), field visits and semi-structured interviews with 40 stakeholders across 6 different stakeholder groups in the Nadi River Basin, Fiji Islands to identify, analyse and deconstruct climate change vulnerability and adaptation options to manage increasing flood risks. The research evidence suggests that vulnerability to floods in the basin {{is on the rise}} due to a complex mesh of three intersecting factors. Firstly, non-climatic pressures such as development, drainage, social change, agriculture, tourism growth and deforestation combine, juxtapose and interact in a rather unique way with global climate variability (interdependent systems) to increase the stress on the river and coastal ecosystems. Secondly, the most vulnerable or at-risk populations like the farmers, squatter households and in particular women within the community have weak coping capacity due to a combination of demographic and social characteristics. Thirdly, vulnerability is on the rise due to climate factors as well as the flurry of unplanned development, redevelopment and degradation of catchment resources. The research findings have implications for adaptation policies. In particular, the basin stakeholders should integrate climate change within <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> processes, actively engage the vulnerable groups, promote knowledge, awareness and social learning, and invest in adaptive management across all levels of decision-making. Structural policy changes to land-use planning and insurance financing schemes are also necessary to address growing risks.

40|$|The forested {{landscape}} holds multiple socio-cultural, ecological, {{and economic}} {{values that are}} interlinked and dependent on each other. Policy makers, scientists, and practitioners increasingly emphasise {{the need for new}} governance procedures that consider multifunctional forest values and support decision making concerning trade-offs between them. At the same time, the diverse range of actors who own and use these values on local, national, and global levels must be considered. This thesis explores how scenario analysis can strengthen participatory aspects in forest governance by engaging local forest actors in interviews and discussions concerning sustainable futures of their forest landscape and community in Vilhelmina municipality, Sweden. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, three explorative (possible) scenarios and one normative (desirable) scenario are developed in participatory workshops, and presented as narratives and models of ecosystem services assessment. The thesis includes four scientific papers - three discuss the performance and usability of scenario methods and one discusses the need and opportunities for implementing a landscape perspective in forest planning. By exploring innovative participatory methods and incorporating integrated landscape planning, the <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> tradition can be developed into new collaborative governance procedures across interests, sectors, levels, and scientific disciplines and create coherent policies and management practices. The Model Forest concept is a useful example of a local collaborative arena where different actors can meet and discuss their common landscape. Scenario analysis is a suitable and creative tool as it provides information about potential and desired futures, enhances understanding for complexity, and facilitates discussion of planning options in a transdisciplinary manner. Scenario analysis can strengthen the local competence of action and help people define their needs and how these needs could be met. The diversity of knowledge and experiences among actors should be seen as a resource for creating new ideas and solutions. The balance between an increased participatory involvement in planning and research processes and the conditions for creating a successful high-quality process must be carefully considered when choosing methods...|$|E

According to the <b>Sectorial</b> <b>Planning</b> Department of the Public Works and Transport Ministry (MOPT), it is {{estimated}} that in Costa Rica there are 26, 966 km of unpaved road network commonly, in comparison with 9, 142 km that are paved (either concrete or asphalt). By making a comparison in network length, the extension of this network significant, which means that it requires important proportions of materials for its conservation, reason why material optimization with alternate aggregates sources as the recycled materials, can help to optimize the use of virgin aggregate and in return saving maintenance costs. The durability of surface exposed roads depends on the physical and mechanical properties of the material, so {{there is a need to}} assess the condition of the material to conduct a proper pavement structure design. However, when this is not done, accelerated deterioration of the surface can be found, with the aggravating consequence that the granular material is usually the highest cost item within an exposed pavement road project. In Costa Rica, even though solutions have been accomplished by the intervention of such routes by placing Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) result from the milling activity of asphalt layers in periodic maintenance projects, the use of this material has had compromised results since the design of thickness and placement have been made by empirical means without previous design. In this sense, this project evaluates the properties of RAP in the laboratory to determine its feasibility as a substitute and / or complement to virgin granular material layers for exposed base pavements. The evaluation of the physical-mechanical RAP properties in the laboratory was accomplished as well as the comparison between such properties and sources of virgin granular material commonly used on unpaved roads, which allowed to conclude that the RAP material and mixtures can be used as substitutes for virgin granular material for use in gravel roads. In addition, based on the determination of material properties, it was observed that there are significant differences in physic-mechanical properties among sources of RAP, giving the variability among the different sources...|$|E

The assessment of natural landscapes and their suitability for human occupation is key to ensure optimal resource use. The criteria for establishing land-use potentials {{vary according to the}} type of activity concerned. For example, in determining the most suitable areas for growing grapes in Cuyo, Argentina, Valpreda (2005) focused on topography, soil quality and water availability, whereas in their study on the oil-producing region of northern Chiapas, Mexico, Bollo et al. (2010) applied markedly different criteria. Soil components and their variability were key to the multi-purpose study of Ovalles and Núñez (1994), while morphometric criteria have been used by Bocco et al. (2010) on farming; for cattle raising, Travieso-Bello et al. (2013) added soil quality and moisture, similar to Rodríguez-Gallego, et al. (2012). In the state of Oaxaca, scientific studies on the feasibility of human activity in different natural landscapes are yet to be undertaken. This study assesses the natural landscapes and resources of the Río Grande drainage basin aimed at establishing optimal locations for agriculture, livestock farming, forestry, wildlife conservation and their combinations. Following the FAO studies (1976, 1993), geomorphological and morphoclimatic systems have been considered as landscape units for analysis. The methodology was adapted from the following studies: The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (Ouyang, 2002); an estimate of soil pH based on Landsat imagery (López-Granados et al., 2005); a calculation of potential livestock carrying capacity (LCC) (Semarnat, 2003; Vergara and Ortiz-Espinoza, 2010); and a land use and vegetation cover analysis for forestry  suitability and the potential distribution of two cat species (Lynx rufus and Panthera onca) (Chávez y Ceballos, 2006; Medellín-Legorreta and Bárcenas, 2009; Semarnat 2010; Semarnat-Conanp, 2010). Our analysis shows that 15. 6 % of the total area (152 km²) has optimal conditions for agriculture; 12. 5 % (122 km²) for livestock farming; 6. 5 % (64 km²) for conservational agricultural activities; 11 % (108 km²) for conservational livestock production; 11. 7 % (114 km²) for conservational forestry activities; and 167 km² (17. 1 %) for conservation alone. Finally, 25. 6 % of the territory (250 km²) is suitable (but not optimal) for agriculture, conservational livestock activities and conservation. This methodology based on physicalgeographical landscapes allows to identify vocational land-use patterns across the Río Grande drainage basin as a means to optimize the management of the various economic activities. The identification and evaluation of productive and conservation potentials in the various geomorphologic and morphoclimatic systems of the river basin were governed by two basic geographic principles: spatial analysis of physical and geographic constraints with a holistic approach, and the mapping of natural resources as inputs for territorial analysis and the development of optimal management strategies. Both principles allowed the establishment of <b>sectorial</b> <b>planning</b> under the magnifying glass of natural aptitude and optimum land use.

Both anthropic and natural risks are dealt with in the emergency planning, but risk information derive from very diverse sources, with different levels of detail - from the risk assessment of major risk plants to the representation of risks provided by <b>sectorial</b> <b>plans,</b> each one focused on a single type of risk (i. e. flood, seismic, fire…).

This lack of linkage between the procedures for Emergency and for Land Use Planning makes the emergency management less effective towards the achievement of a real safety of territories, as proved by recent disastrous events in the European territory. In order to solve these critical issues, the paper aims at providing hints on how to achieve a different approach both in land use and emergency planning, conceiving risk assessment as part of an integrated process composed by many important and interrelated phases, not only postdisaster emergency, but also structural interventions for the long- term prevention...|$|R

40|$|Asphodelus bento-rainhae P. Silva is a {{plant species}} {{belonging}} {{to the order of}} Liliales. This endemic plant occurs in central Portugal in an area of only 700 hectare on the northern slopes of the Serra da Gardunha (Fundão, Portugal). It is mainly present in north to northeast facing slopes and found in deep soils and open areas, where it is found at higher densities. It occurs along the edges of oak (Quercus robur and Quercus pyrenaica) and chestnut (Castanea sativa) forests, often reaching the herbaceous edges of these woods. Sometimes, it survives in pine forests of Pinus pinaster, mixed woods and slopes or roadsides and in lower abundances in scrubby vegetation. This species survival is threatened by forest fires and the conversion of woodland into cherry orchards, and the fruit growers’ extensive use of herbicides. The tree plantations, as well as urban sprawl, have decreased the extent and quality of its habitat. It is also confronted with invasive plants, such as Acacia dealbata. The mapping of the A. bento-rainhae habitat suitability index results on the integration of a set of biophysical factors using the ArcGIS 10. 3 software, based on the <b>Sectorial</b> <b>Plan</b> for Natura 2000 Network and other literature concerning the species ecology. The data used included bioclimatic, soil and topographic variables, based on a digital terrain model (DTM).

40|$|The {{small rural}} {{communities}} in Australia’s tropical savanna landscapes {{depend upon the}} region’s natural resources for income and employment. Historically primary industries – including mining, grazing and, {{in the case of}} coastal communities, fishing – have been the pillars of economic activity in those regions. More recently, tourism has emerged as an additional nature-based industry, which offers new development and employment opportunities for populations in remote regions. Net benefits from tourism accrue from the balance of economic, social and environmental interactions of tourists with a destination. This paper presents a model of tourism impact in the Carpentaria shire of North West Queensland. A methodology is developed for tracking and quantifying social, economic and environmental impacts. Data from an in-progress research project are presented and analysed to test the hypothesis that community benefits could be improved without an increase in visitor numbers, by changing the composition of visitors to the region. Interpretations are offered as to how both, <b>sectorial</b> and regional <b>planning</b> and management can effect improved community benefits from tourism...|$|R

The knowledge basis, built on cartography, statistical data, port master <b>plans,</b> <b>sectorial</b> researches, required important efforts in terms of integration and homogenisation. The method's development is basing on a survey extended to the Mediterranean basin, progressively identifying a sample of ports by additive selection criteria, including geographical location, layout's morphology, traffic typologies, consistent data availability. A set of indicators characterising ports' performances allows benchmarking and matching to derive useful design and operational feedback. The achieved results include homogeneous indicators for dimensions, equipment and performances, useful for design and planning purposes, operational check, identification of bottlenecks and project needs. The extension of the sample (39 study cases in the Mediterranean basin) entrusts the values of results. Interesting maps and thematic analysis deals with wharfs' extension vs. sea depth and basin surface, length of route, docks' density, ships turnover rate, productivity index, docks utilisation, approaching time. Moreover, the global operational capacity and the related present utilisation rate was calculated taking into account internal routes' network, compatibility among routes, manoeuvring times, distribution of traffic by route...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho realiza uma análise sobre as relações estabelecidas entre educação e desenvolvimento no âmbito oficial, compreendendo o período entre o mandato do Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira e o último governo militar. Utilizamos como fontes primárias, principalmente, os planos globais e setoriais de educação elaborados à época em questão. Após a criação da CEPAL, em 1948, presenciamos o rompimento com a tese das vantagens comparativas, que atribuía aos países periféricos o papel de exportadores de matéria-prima e importadores de produtos manufaturados. Desse modo, intensificou-se a busca de meios para promover a industrialização do mundo subdesenvolvido, considerando-se prioritária a intervenção do Estado na economia pela utilização do mecanismo do planejamento, a fim de administrar e dinamizar a alocação de recursos escassos. No cenário da Guerra Fria, que opunha o Ocidente cristão ao comunismo ateu, a ideologia do desenvolvimento foi largamente disseminada. A partir de 1955, os teóricos do ISEB reforçaram as bases de sustentação da doutrina desenvolvimentista no Brasil, pretendendo acelerar a expansão econômica do país. A industrialização brasileira foi efetuada, em grande parte, por intermédio da transferência de tecnologias poupadoras de mão-de-obra e de um aumento do endividamento externo. Valorizavam-se os investimentos em capital físico em detrimento às políticas sociais, uma vez que estas eram tidas como excessivamente dispendiosas. Divulgava-se a idéia de que, no futuro, os benefícios da prosperidade atingiriam a população de forma geral. Entretanto, as políticas econômicas adotadas implicaram em um processo crescente de concentração de renda. Para justificá-lo, incorporou-se, gradativamente, aos planos de governo o discurso do valor econômico da educação para o desenvolvimento, no que se refere à formação de recursos humanos devidamente capacitados para lidar com novas tecnologias; dessa forma, os indivíduos contribuiriam para atingir os ?objetivos nacionais? estipulados nesses documentos e, ao mesmo tempo, adquiririam mobilidade social, ou seja, os mais talentosos poderiam {{ascender}} socialmente. Assim, o mito da ?escola redentora? legitimou a exclusão social gerada no seio do sistema capitalista, ao ocultar a baixa capacidade da estrutura produtiva existente para absorver trabalhadores qualificadosThe actual work {{raises an}} analysis about the settled relationships between education and development concerning the official ambit and it embraces the period which goes from President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira?s mandate {{to the last}} Military Government. Global and <b>sectorial</b> <b>plans</b> of education elaborated at the focused time were chiefly used as primary resources for the accomplishment of this work. After CEPAL creation, in 1948, there was a rupture with the thesis of the comparative advantages, which used to attach to the peripherical countries both the roles of raw material exporters and manufactured products importers as well. It was intensified the search of means to promote the industrialization of the underdeveloped countries. The Government interference was considered a priority in order to administrate and dynamize the destination of the narrow cash resources. The developing ideology was widespread {{at the time of}} the cold war, when the christian West was opposed to the atheist communistic world. From 1955 on, the ISEB theoreticians strengthened the bases of the maintenance of the doctrine of development in Brazil, in order to accelerate the economical expansion of the country. The Brazilian industrialization was performed in its majority through the transference of manual work economical technogies and through a raise of the external debt. The investments on material installations were increased and, on the other hand, it was attributed a minor level to the social politics because they were too much expensive. It was widespread the idea that in the future, prosperity benefits would reach the population in a general way. However the adopted economical politics caused a growing process of concentration of profits To justify these profits, it was, gradually, linked up to the government plans the speech of the value of the education for the development of the country, concerning the capacitation of human resources, who could be able to deal with the new technologies. Through this path, the subjects would contribute to reach the ?national aims?, which were stipulated on those documents and, at the same time, they would acquire social mobility, or else, the most talented ones would be able to rise in the social scale. Thus the ?redeemer school? myth legimated the social exclusion which grew within the nucleus of the capitalist system, the same system that hid the low capacity of the available structure that was supposed to absorb those qualified worker...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{talks about}} {{relationships}} between energy and urban planning, and so it’s {{a collection of}} theories and practices (mostly of them in progress) about local energy managment and instruments of urban planning. The treatment about “energy and settlements”, i. e. connections between energy systems and morphological and functional aspects of settlement, {{is essential to the}} sustainability goal, above all after the gradual process of administrative devolution, that has permitted possible conditions for energy and urban planning and in particular attentions to “conscientious” territorial development. According to that and because of lack in research and specific testing on it, this thesis wants to give a contribution to the study about opportunities of energy in urban planning, in term of physical and functional city’s transformation. The research, in particular, deals with different implications and meanings of energy in urban planning and so reviews various declinations of “energy and settlement” frame, focusing on Italian planning instruments because they represent a startup to change territorial transformation process and (partially) to define “Piano Energetico Urbano”, my own expression that synthesizes the particular process of energy integration (or just an approach) in the ordinary planning process. In particular, in the first part, the thesis talks about general connections between energy aspects and the territorial planning, emphasizing the gap and the unexpressed potentialities of two matters that don’t collide, to focus on the city, a common object of intervention. The second part of the thesis rebuilds the disciplinary background: it analyses the specific Anglophone literature, i. e. “urban sprawl vs. compact city” debate and the settlement and behavioural alternative model ones (New Urbanism, Smart Growth, Car Free Cities, Low Carbon Cities, Post Carbon Cities and Transitions Towns), and finally environmental and energy community politics, programmes and initiatives, that are the first promoter of stakeholders energy interest. The third part draws characteristics of the energy plan, first of all the main regulatory and methodological reference, Ln. 10 / 91, that has introduced the urban and energy plan (Piano Energetico Comunale, PEC) and the regional one (Piano Energetico Regionale, PER). After the analysis of some selected experiences (most of all from Emilia Romagna, because it has a specific regional energy and planning regulation), the thesis underlines how, through sustainability settlement and development strategies against energy and urban complexity, <b>sectorial</b> energy <b>planning</b> is under restyling. As conclusion, there is a general and explanatory frame about best practices, thanks to, it’s possible to define some up- and-coming themes of Piano Energetico Urbano, such as: territorial and conformable dimension (dimensione conforme), territorial partitions, directions of sectorial cancellations, and public and private relationships in energy and planning transformation process...|$|R
40|$|Lolium rigidum is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and damaging grass weed of winter cereals in Spain. L. rigidum infestations are frequently treated with herbicides and, consequently, populations have evolved resistance. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the extent and frequency of herbicide resistance in L. rigidum populations in Spain to the selective herbicides chlortoluron, diclofop-methyl and chlorsulfuron, commonly used for its control in-crop, and to glyphosate. The response to these herbicides was evaluated on 123 accessions surveyed randomly across cereal cropping areas of the regions of Castile and León, Catalonia and Andalusia. The fresh weight and the frequency of undamaged plants were calculated for each accession and herbicide. At the regional level, higher frequencies of accessions displaying resistance occurred in Catalonia, an intensively cropped region with a greater herbicide selection pressure. Of concern is that in this region the 60 % of the accessions displayed some level of resistance to the ALS-inhibiting herbicide chlorsulfuron. The 6. 9 % of the accessions found in Castile and León with some resistance to glyphosate could also indicate an incipient problem of resistance to this herbicide. For the other herbicides and regions the majority of the accessions remained susceptible. The possible mechanisms of herbicide resistance development in L. rigidum accessions (target-site versus non-target-site resistance) and their variation among regions was discussed. This study can be used to generate herbicide resistance-management schemes for farmers, based upon the herbicide the site and the potential for resistance development. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{the past}} thirty years, a series of plans have been {{developed}} by successive Brazilian governments in a continuing effort to maximize the nation's resources for economic and social growth. This planning history has been quantitatively rich but qualitatively poor. The disjunction has stimulated Professor Mello e Souza to address himself {{to the problem of}} national planning and to offer some criticisms of Brazilian planning experience. Though political instability has obviously been a factor promoting discontinuity, his criticisms are aimed at the attitudes and strategic concepts which have sought to link planning to national goals and administration. He criticizes the fascination with techniques and plans to the exclusion of proper diagnosis of the socio-political reality, developing instruments to coordinate and carry out objectives, and creating an administrative structure centralized enough to make national decisions and decentralized enough to perform on the basis of those decisions. Thus, fixed, quantified objectives abound while the problem of functioning mechanisms for the coordinated, rational use of resources has been left unattended. Although his interest and criticism are focused on the process and experience of national planning, he recognized variation in the level and results of Brazilian planning. National plans have failed due to faulty conception of the function of <b>planning.</b> <b>Sectorial</b> <b>plans,</b> save in the sector of the petroleum industry under government responsibility, ha e not succeeded in overcoming the problems of formulation and execution thereby repeating old technical errors. Planning for the private sector has a somewhat brighter history due to the use of Grupos Executivos which has enabled the planning process to transcend the formalism and tradition-bound attitudes of the regular bureaucracy. Regional planning offers two relatively successful experiences, Sudene and the strategy of the regionally oriented autarchy. Thus, planning history in Brazil is not entirely black but a certain shade of grey. The major part of the article, however, is devoted to a descriptive analysis of the national planning experience. The plans included in this analysis are: The Works and Equipment Plan (POE); The Health, Food, Transportation and Energy Plan (Salte); The Program of Goals; The Trienal Plan of Economic and Social Development; and the Plan of Governmental Economic Action (Paeg). Using these five plans for his historical experience the author sets out a series of errors of formulation and execution by which he analyzes that experience. With respect to formulation, he speaks of a lack of elaboration of programs and projects, of coordination among diverse goals, and of provision of qualified staff and techniques. He mentions the absence of the definition of resources necessary to the financing of the plan and the inadequate quantification of sectorial and national goals {{due to the lack of}} reliable statistical information. Finally, he notes the failure to coordinate the annual budget with the multi-year plans. He sees the problems of execution as beginning in the absence of coordination between the various sectors of the public administration, the failure to develop an operative system of decentralization, the absence of any system of financial and fiscal control over execution, the difficulties imposed by the system of public accounting, and the absence of an adequate program of allocation for the liberation of resources. He ends by pointing to the failure to develop and use an integrated system of political economic tools in a mode compatible with the objective of the plans. The body of the article analyzes national planning experience in Brazil using these lists of errors as rough model of criticism. Several conclusions emerge from this analysis with regard to planning in Brazil and in developing countries, in general. Plans have generally been of little avail in Brazil because of the lack of a continuous, bureaucratized (in the Weberian sense) planning organization set in an instrumentally suitable administrative structure and based on thorough diagnoses of socio-economic conditions and problems. Plans have become the justification for planning. Planning has come to be conceived as a rational method of orienting the process of decisions through the establishment of a precise and quantified relation between means and ends. But this conception has led to a planning history rimmed with frustration, and failure, because of its rigidity in the face of flexible and changing reality. Rather, he suggests a conception of planning which understands it "as a rational process of formulating decisions about the policy, economy, and society whose only demand is that of managing the instrumentarium in a harmonious and integrated form in order to reach explicit, but not quantified ends". He calls this "planning without plans": the establishment of broad-scale tendencies through diagnosis whose implementation is carried out through an adjustable, coherent instrumentarium of political-economic tools. Administration according to a plan of multiple, integrated goals is a sound procedure if the nation's administrative machinery contains the technical development needed to control the multiple variables linked to any situation of socio-economic change. Brazil does not possess this level of refinement and any strategy of planning relevant to its problems must recognize this. The reforms which have been attempted fail to make this recognition as is true of the conception of planning informing the Brazilian experience. Therefore, unworkable plans, ill-diagnosed with little or no supportive instrumentarium or flexibility have been Brazil's legacy. This legacy seems likely to continue until the conception of planning comes to live in the reality of Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Dams {{that store}} water for electricity, irrigation, {{domestic}} water supply or flood control {{have been constructed}} {{for thousands of years}} worldwide. In too many cases, an unacceptable and often unnecessary price has been paid by watershed inhabitants to secure dam benefits, especially in social and environmental terms. The Fincha'a multipurpose dam in western Ethiopia has caused major land use changes, relocated people against their will and induced excessive population pressure in the upper watershed. Following the creation of this dam crop and livestock production have been shifted to steep and fragile parts of the watershed. Lack of agricultural intensification and soil and water conservation (SWC), poor family planning and land tenure insecurity are pressing socio-economic problems leading to impoverishment of the watershed inhabitants. Increased erosion rates and sediment yields reduce the economic life of the dam. Farmers are well aware of erosion problems but they lack confidence in the positive effect on crop yield of recommended SWC measures. The high labour requirement, loss of cropland, land tenure insecurity and the lack of immediate benefits has negatively affected SWC adoption. Integrated watershed management (IWM) has emerged as alternative to the centrally and <b>sectorial</b> approaches in <b>planning</b> dams. The focal point of any dam development programme, using IWM, is the combination of improving the livelihood of the watershed inhabitants and the sustenance of the resource base. For subsistence farmers it is mainly the production in the current season that guarantees the mere survival of their families. Therefore, IWM should be accompanied by c reation of multi-stakeholders platforms and integration of soft and hard system methodologies for creating an environment where science and knowledge help people to develop a diversity of locally appropriate resource management solutions. IWM can effectively address the social, environmental and economic problems during the planning of new dams in Ethiopia...|$|R
