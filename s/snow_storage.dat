In large scale applications underground and <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> {{are the most likely}} alternatives. In an underground storage the winter cold is heat exchanged from the air and loaded into the bedrock or an aquifer by one or more bore holes. In a <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> frozen water (snow and/or ice) is saved in some kind of storage (pile, pit, cavern etc.). The cold is utilized by pumping melt water to the cooling object, directly in a district cooling system or indirect by a heat exchanger. The lukewarm melt water is then pumped back to the snow where it gets cooled and mixed with new melt water. Snow cooling works as a single cold source but can also be used for peak cooling since there is no relevant cooling limit. In Sweden there is one snow cooling plant in Sundsvall, built and owned by the county. The cooling load in Sundsvall is about 2000 kW (570 tons of refrigeration) and 1500 MWh/year.|$|E

The observed increase of <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in 1. 3 – 1. 5 times in the direction south-north is connected, apparently. The difference in the five-day appearance of snow cover maximum is related to differences in regional winter air temperature. Throughout the snow depth and <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in spruce are smaller than in deciduous forest – in the ratio of 0. 81 in south area and 0. 93 in north area; in spruce the large part of solid precipitation is intercepted by the crowns pine trees. Snow stratigraphy at south areas has four layers, six layers at the north area are more variable in snow density and <b>snow</b> <b>storage.</b> Perhaps, gravitational conversion is more noticeable due to larger snow depth. Snow density and <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> at the open areas are more heterogeneous than in the forest. This is due to sharp fluctuations in air temperature, wind transport and compaction of snow, evaporation from the snow surface.

40|$|Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) {{applications}} have slowly {{gained acceptance}} on the Swedish energy market. Two UTES concepts are successfully implemented; the ATES (aquifer storage) and the BTES (borehole storage) systems. Also <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in pits or caverns {{has reached a}} commercial status. The number of ATES has steadily grown to 40 large-scale plants {{at the end of}} 2002. The systems are usually designed for cold storage in district cooling application, but industrial process cooling is also common. The economical potential in terms of straight payback time is usually very favourable. However, there is still a certain risk for operational problems that might jeopardize the calculated profit. Well clogging problems and system control remain as R&D issues to be solved. From a legislation point of view any ATES application needs a permit. The process of obtaining a permit has become complex and time-consuming since a new act on environmental assessment was put into effect in 1999. BTES systems are normally used in smaller applications. At the end of 2002 there were more than 200 installations comprising more than 10 boreholes. The majority of these are applied for space cooling of commercial or institutional buildings and for process cooling within the telecommunication sector. From a technical point of view, BTES are much simpler to construct and operate than ATES. Furthermore, they can be applied in almost any kind of geology. Another advantage compared to ATES is that the permitting procedure is much simpler.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the physical processes {{as part of}} the Land-Surface Scheme (LSS) in the Rossby Centre Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RCA 3). The LSS is a tiled scheme with the three main tiles with respect to temperature: forest, open land, and snow. The open land tile is divided into a vegetated and a bare soil part for latent heat flux calculations. The individual fluxes of heat and momentum from these tiles are weighted in order to obtain grid-averaged values at the lowest atmospheric model level according to the fractional areas of the tiles. The forest tile is internally divided into three sub-tiles: forest canopy, forest floor soil, and snow on forest floor. All together this gives three to five different surface energy balances depending on if snow is present or not. The soil is divided into five layers with respect to temperature, with a no-flux boundary condition at three meters depth, and into two layers with respect to soil moisture, with a maximum depth of just above 2. 2 meters. Runoff generated {{at the bottom of the}} deep soil layer may be used as input to a routing scheme.

Snow on the Austre Lovénbreen (a small alpine type glacier in Spitsbergen – 4, 6 km 2) has been well studied since 2007 thanks to a good measurement network and numerous field campaigns. It has been possible to estimate the runoff coming from the glacier itself. However, the glacier covers only 43 % of the Austre Lovén catchment. Of the remaining 57 %, 23 % are constituted by the moraine area, and 34 % are the surrounding slopes, which are also important <b>snow</b> <b>storages.</b> This paper focusing on slopes aims at better understanding snow cover dynamics in the slopes (sun exposition, aspect, altitude, roughness, steepness [...] .) using Lidar data.

Combining this data with density measurements in several sampling points in the slopes also gave the possibility of estimating the snow water equivalence (SWE) of the snow cover. The objective is here to qualify and quantify the spatial and temporal variabilities of snow cover in the slopes. Different slope configurations were investigated with the Lidar for that purpose. The main results show that most of the snow cover is located in the lowest, less steep, parts of the slopes. Moreover, snow cover densities are usually higher in the surrounding slopes than the ones recorded on the glacier.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Forests {{strongly}} {{influence the}} amount and duration mountain <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> because forest cover modifies both snow accumulation and ablation processes. Quantifying and predicting forest effects on snow processes and <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> is critical for understanding the effects of forest change on <b>snow</b> <b>storage,</b> and subsequent impacts on downstream water resources. However, both the magnitude and direction of forest modifications of individual snow processes vary with climate, topography, and forest characteristics. Accurate prediction of the net effects of forest change on mountain <b>snow</b> <b>storage,</b> particularly in a warming climate, depends on accurately representing the spatiotemporal variability of forest-snow interactions. With a goal to better understand forest-snow processes in the maritime snow zone, we collected snow observations over four winters within diverse forest types in western Washington, USA. We utilize these new observations to quantify forest effects on snow duration, {{as well as to}} assess the robustness of remote methods to observe snow-covered area within a forest. We find that mean snow duration is 8 days longer in forest gaps than in forested plots, but that snow duration in thinned forest and dense forest are indistinguishable at the 1600 m 2 plot-scale. We additionally show that time-lapse cameras and spatially distributed ground temperature sensors are both robust methods for observing snow duration, and make suggestions about the optimal spatial density of snow observations within forests. The entire four-year dataset and related metadata are extensively described, and are now publicly available for potential use in numerous modeling applications. To expand our focus on forest-snow interactions to the Pacific Northwest, USA, regional-scale, we collaborate with other research institutions and engage citizen scientists. Regional synthesis and analysis of snow depth and duration at 12 out of 14 paired open-forest locations show that differential snow duration ranges from synchronous, to snow lasting up to 13 weeks longer in the open. The differences in snow duration are attributed to forest effects on snow accumulation, with larger differences between snow accumulation rates than between ablation rates in the open and forested sites through the duration of the forest snowpack. In 2 out of the 14 locations, differential snow duration is 2 - 5 weeks longer in the forest. These 2 sites are subject to hourly average wind speeds ranging up to 8 and 17 m s- 1. Therefore, longer snow duration in the forest likely results from a combination of enhanced deposition of snow and reduced snow loss from canopy interception in the forested sites. These findings suggest that a regional framework to understand forest effects on <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in the maritime to maritime-continental transitional climate across the Pacific Northwest must account for high interception efficiencies in warmer climates as well a high winds due to topographic exposure and climate. Lastly, we assess the influence of forest structural characteristics on <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in western Washington by linking lidar-derived forest canopy metrics to snow depth and snow duration. By using a matrix decomposition method to collapse the variance of spatially distributed observations of snow depth onto a few dominant modes, we show that the top two modes represent forest effects on snow accumulation and ablation, respectively. Furthermore, gridded metrics of canopy cover and height that quantify the canopy directly overhead, rather than to the south, correlate equally strongly (r 2 of up to 0. 74) with the spatial coefficients that scale both of these modes. This finding suggests that the role of forests in shading the snowpack from sunlight is diminished at this site. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of physiographic predictors of snow duration across a range of elevations and years quantifies the important role of canopy characteristics in controlling snow duration. At the study site in western Washington, the binary simplification of considering forested versus open locations is supported by evidence for a stepped response, in which snow duration shifts from longer to shorter around values of 60 - 70 % canopy cover. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that forest effects on snow accumulation dominate the overall influence of forest on <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in the Pacific Northwest, USA, resulting in larger magnitude and longer duration <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in canopy gaps, except in locations subject to high wind speeds...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA spatial {{probability}} {{distribution of the}} variables in a parametric snow depletion curve (SDC) is tailored to the assimilation of satellite snow cover data into a gridded hydrological model. The assimilation is based on Bayes' theorem, in which the proposed distribution represents the a priori information about the SDC variables. From the prior gridded maps of <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> and accumulated melt depth, the elevation gradients and the degree-day factor are separated out, creating elevation-normalised surfaces of <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> and degree-day sum. Because the small-scale variability linked to elevation is removed, these surfaces can be described by prior distribution models with a strong spatial dependency structure.

In this research, assessment {{of the value of}} MODIS snow cover data in the hydrological modeling process is the main objective. Nine MOPEX catchments in the continental US are studied in this research and for each catchment three types of models are used: (1) a basic, lumped 3 -box version of the HBV model, (2) a lumped version with snow reservoir, and (3) a semi-distributed formulation of HBV with snow reservoir. MODIS snow cover maps are used for assessing and improving the model snow component. In the models with snow reservoir, <b>snow</b> water <b>storage</b> is reduced to its binary information content: snow/no snow (i. e. 1 or 0), which is then directly linked with spatial pattern in MODIS snow cover data without the need for further assumptions, such as snow densities; the coincidence of <b>snow</b> water <b>storage</b> in the model and observed MODIS snow cover is used as additional calibration/evaluation metric to condition and test the realism of the respective models. In this research, daily meteorological and hydrological data (precipitation, evaporation, discharge, temperature) and maximum eight-day MODIS snow cover maps for the study catchments are used. In calibration, in each time step, the modelled maximum binary 8 -day snow reservoir value is compared with MODIS snow cover data for the respective model or its sub-units (in the semi-distributed formulation). Model 03 is semi-distributed, by discretizing each study catchment into individual 200 m elevation bands. The results show a large difference of model performance in the catchments with various climates. It is shown that MODIS snow cover data can be valuable to assess the degree to which spatial snow accumulation and ablation dynamics are represented in models, thereby increasing model realism, while not necessarily improving the calibrated performance of models.

Winter climatic and snowfall data were collected from a weather station on Horse Mountain and from available historical sources. Snow cover characteristics were sampled in two drainage basins on Horse Mountain using the Mount Rose snow sampler and other instruments, including a calorimeter to determine snow quality. The results obtained from historical climatic information strongly suggest that snow cover was adequate to permit at least two months of skiing during all but five seasons in the last 22 years on Horse Mountain. During the study period, an average snow depth of 30 inches and water equivalent of 13 inches, with an average snow quality of 93 percent, provided suitable snow conditions for skiing during 56 percent of the time from December through May. A total of 2, 380 skier days were recorded on the site during the study period. Elevation, exposure and slope steepness {{played a major role in}} affecting snowfall accumulation and retention on north slopes of Horse Mountain. Random sampling from points located on the ground with aerial photographs provided an acceptable method of determining average snow depth and water equivalent within study basins throughout the winter. From the variability found in this study, a sample size of 24 points would provide an estimate of snow depth and water equivalent in basins within 10 percent at a confidence level of 90 percent.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{relative}} importance of low flow indicators for the River Rhine and to identify their appropriate temporal lag and resolution. This is done in the context of low flow forecasting with lead times of 14 and 90 days. First, the Rhine basin is subdivided into seven sub-basins. By considering the dominant processes in the sub-basins, five low flow indicators were selected: precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> and lake storage. Correlation analysis was then carried out to determine the relationship between observed low flows and preselected indicators with varying lags (days) and temporal resolutions (from 1 day to 7 months). The results show that the most important low flow indicators in the Alpine sub-basins for forecasts with a lead time of 14 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, and lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution. In the other sub-basins groundwater levels with a small lag and temporal resolution are important in addition to potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution. The picture is slightly different for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days. The <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in the Alpine sub-basins and the precipitation in the other sub-basins also become relevant for low flows. Consequently, the most important low flow indicators in the Alpine sub-basins for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution and <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> with a small lag and large temporal resolution. The resultant correlation maps provide appropriate lags and temporal resolutions for indicators to forecast low flows in the River Rhine with different lead times...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> {{for cooling}} {{applications}} {{is an ancient}} technique now being revived {{in different parts of}} the world. From June 2000 the first Swedish large-scale snow cooling plant provides for comfort cooling at the hospital in Sundsvall. The snow is thermally insulated by a 0. 2 m layer of wood chips and stored in a shallow pit (140 ´ 60 m) of watertight asphalt, with a capacity for 60, 000 m 3 (40, 000 tons) of snow. Meltwater from the <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> is cleaned and pumped to the hospital, and after cooling the heated meltwater is re-circulated to the <b>snow</b> <b>storage.</b> During the first summer the hospital required 655 MWh of cooling with a maximum cooling power of 1, 366 kW. Approximately 93 % of the cooling demand was attained by 19, 000 m 3 of snow, the rest by a cooling machine. The main part (75 %) of the snow was natural while the rest was produced with snowguns. The running COP of the snow cooling system was 10. 5 while the corresponding value of the chiller was 2. 2. When material depreciation was included, based on lifetimes and energy input, the total COP became 8. 6 for the snow cooling system and 2. 2 for the chiller. The operation of the plant experienced only minor problems. Urban snow is polluted and the meltwater quality in the snow cooling plant was such that further treatment had to be considered, in particular concerning non-biodegradable compounds, phosphorus, and lead. The <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> technique enables analysis and treatment of the meltwater. Without thermal insulation and cold extraction a 30, 000 m 3 snow pile in Sundsvall would be gone by mid-June. With 0. 2 m of wood chips covering the snow the melting is reduced considerably. In this case 75 % of the snow remains and can be utilised for cooling. In a laboratory experiment it was found that with a 0. 08 m layer of wood chips the natural melt rate was reduced by approximately 85 %. The thermal insulation qualities of wood chips on snow and ice depend on both evaporative cooling and heat resistance of the wood chips. Approximately 3 % of the melt water was evaporated, which corresponds to 20 % of the total heat transfer. The absorbtivity of light, which was 0. 5 - 0. 6 in fresh wood chips, is important for the thermal insulation qualities. Since the absorbtivity increases and water transport functions of wood chips might deteriorate by time it is of interest to study the impact of ageing. As water freezes in an open system, some water is evaporated. This mass loss is typically 2. 5 - 3 % of the mass of ice and accumulates to large quantities with repeated freezing and thawing. It should therefore be included in <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> modelling since the snow is stored during a period when repeated melting and re-freezing occur. The total construction cost of the Sundsvall plant was about 1. 3 MEUR with a running cost of 15. 3 EUR MWh- 1 (total 0. 01 MEUR) during the first year of operation. In a more recent study it was concluded that the construction cost could be considerably reduced. Estimated pay back time is about three years for a new project with the same conditions as the Sundsvall Hospital system, decreasing with increased cooling power and size. The expected lifetime of a <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> plant is about 40 years. The snow/ice cooling plant has a great technical potential in industrial, agricultural, and comfort cooling applications in large parts of the world. By replacing cooling machines the use of cooling media is reduced. These are often flammable, poisonous and/or environmental hazardous. A snow cooling plant means not only saving of money and energy but also environmental benefits. Godkänd; 2001; 20070313 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of water content in seasonal snow {{can be helpful}} for water resource management. In this study, a distributed temperature index snow model based on temperature and precipitation as forcing data, is used to estimate <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> in the Jollie catchment approximately 20 km east of the main divide of the central Southern Alps, New Zealand. The main objective is to apply a frequently used assimilation method, the ensemble Kalman square root filter, to assimilate remotely sensed snow covered area into the model and evaluate the impacts of this approach on simulations of snow water equivalent. A 250 m resolution remotely sensed data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), specifically tuned to the study location was used. Temperature and precipitation were given on a 0. 055 latitude/longitude grid. Precipitation was perturbed as input into the model, generating 100 ensemble members, which represented model error. Only observations of snow covered area that had less that 25 % cloud cover classification {{were used in the}} assimilation precess. The error in the snow covered area observations was assumed to be 0. 1 and grow linearly with cloud cover fraction up to 1 for a totally cloud covered pixel. As the model was not calibrated, two withholding experiments were conducted, in which observations withheld from the assimilation process were compared to the results. Two model states were updated in the assimilation, the total snow accumulation state variable and the total snow melt state variable. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the model underestimates <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> at the end of winter and/or does not detect snow fall events during the ablation period. The assimilation method only affected simulated snow covered area and <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> during the ablation period. That corresponded to higher correlation between modelled snow cover area and the updated state variables. Withholding experiments show good agreement between observations and simulated snow covered area. This study successfully applied the ensemble Kalman square root filter and showed its applicability for New Zealand conditions...|$|E
40|$|Calibration of {{large-scale}} groundwater models is difficult {{due to a}} general lack of groundwater head measurements. The calibration becomes even more complex if the basin covers several countries with different observation systems and different base maps, or if calibration must be done in developing countries with poor data availability. In this study, we present and discuss a novel approach for calibrating a large-scale groundwater model using various satellite remote sensing products without using groundwater head data. The study area is the combined Rhine-Meuse basin located in Western Europe and covering a total area of around 200. 000 km 2. For this basin an extensive groundwater head database is available. However, calibration of the groundwater model was carried out using only remote sensing products while the head data were solely used for model validation. The groundwater model itself uses as input only global datasets so that the modeling procedure is portable to other areas on the globe including data poor environments such as developing countries. Our hydrological model consists of two parts: (1) the land surface model, which conceptualizes the upper first meter of the unsaturated zone soil layer; and (2) the MODFLOW-based groundwater model simulating the saturated horizontal flow in the deeper layer. Both model parts together simulate the dynamic interaction between surface water and groundwater bodies, and between the unsaturated soil and the saturated groundwater zone. We ran the model for the period 1960 to 2008. Calibration is carried out by adjusting aquifer characteristics and soil physical parameters determining flow in the unsaturated zone. State variables used in calibration is the unsaturated zone/soil moisture storage and total terrestrial water storage. Two promising remote sensing products are considered: for soil moisture the European Remote Sensing (ERS) scatterometer derived Soil Water Index (SWI) products and for total basin-average water storage the GRACE monthly gravity field solutions. Time series of ERS-SWI are available from 1992 onwards. GRACE data are available from 2002 to 2008. The time series are used because our previous studies showed a strong correlation between timeseries of remote sensing products and timeseries of groundwater head measurements. We used the time series of GRACE to constrain anomalies of total basin water storage including groundwater, unsaturated zone/soil moisture, canopy, surface water, and <b>snow</b> <b>storages.</b> Finally, the resulting groundwater head of the calibrated model is verified to available groundwater head measurement data. Results are very promising and suggest {{that it is possible to}} calibrate and constrain large-scale groundwater models using satellite remote sensing derived products. Comparing uncalibrated and calibrated model simulations with observed groundwater head data, we conclude that important model improvements can be made by integrating models with remote sensing products, particularly for areas with shallow water tables. We argue that, in the absence of groundwater head measurement data, satellite remote sensing products are useful products for calibrating groundwater model...|$|R
40|$|The spatio-temporal {{variability}} {{of the mountain}} snow cover determines the avalanche danger, <b>snow</b> water <b>storage,</b> permafrost distribution and the local distribution of fauna and flora. Using {{a new type of}} terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), which is particularly suited for measurements of snow covered surfaces, snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt rates have been monitored in a high alpine catchment during an ablation period. This allowed {{for the first time to}} get a high resolution (2. 5 m cell size) picture of spatial variability and its temporal development. A very high variability in which maximum snow depths between 0 – 9 m at the end of the accumulation season was found. This variability decreased during the ablation phase, although the dominant snow deposition features remained intact. The spatial patterns of calculated SWE were found to be similar to snow depth. Average daily melt rate was between 15 mm/d at the beginning of the ablation period and 30 mm/d at the end. The spatial variation of melt rates increased during the ablation rate and could not be explained in a simple manner by geographical or meteorological parameters, which suggests significant lateral energy fluxes contributing to observed melt. It could be qualitatively shown that the effect of the lateral energy transport must increase as the fraction of snow free surfaces increases during the ablation period...|$|R
40|$|In western North America, <b>snow</b> {{provides}} crucial <b>storage</b> {{of winter}} precipitation, effectively transferring {{water from the}} relatively wet winter season to the typically dry summers. Manual and telemetered measurements of spring snow-pack, corroborated by a physically based hydrologic model, are examined here for climate-driven fluctuations and trends {{during the period of}} 1916 – 2002. Much of the mountain West has experienced declines in spring snowpack, especially since midcentury, despite increases in winter precipitation in many places. Analysis and modeling show that climatic trends are the dominant factor, not changes in land use, forest canopy, or other factors. The largest decreases have occurred where winter temperatures are mild, especially in the Cascade Mountains and northern California. In most mountain ranges, relative declines grow from minimal at ridgetop to substantial at snow line. Taken together, these results emphasize that the West's snow resources are already declining as earth's climate warms...|$|R
40|$|Snow {{cover is}} a key {{component}} of the Earth’s energy balance and a key storage mechanism for water. In many areas of the world, people rely on snowmelt runoff for their water resources. It is essential that the extent and water content of seasonal snow cover be determined to a degree of accuracy concomitant with the instrumentation available. The ability to characterize <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> more accurately at the drainage basin scale is crucial for improved water resource management. Global patterns of <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> are also key components to the understanding of global change.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the possibility to integrate, in terms of energy, the future Nya Studenternas IP and Uppsala University Hospital. The focus is on integration of thermal energy solutions. To cover the cooling demand a seasonal <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> {{and the use of}} cooling machines is studied. For the heat demand a joint heat storage is investigated which is heated partly with the excess heat from cooling machines. The environmental impact in terms of CO 2 emissions is investigated. A conclusion drawn from the project is that the use of district heating and cooling of Nya Studenternas IP and the Uppsala University Hospital could be reduced in several ways by integrating the energy systems of the two facilities. For instance, with the support of a seasonal <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> and cooling machines for cooling, and heat obtained from the cooling machines for heating, the emissions of CO 2 could be reduced with 36 % based on a Nordic electricity mixture.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} a seldom seen {{interest}} for cross-country skiing. However, the winters are getting warmer, which causes lack of snow and hence a shortened skiing season. In order {{to solve this problem}} the company Lindbäcks Bygg plans to construct a ski tunnel at Lindbäcksstadion close to Piteå. At the request of this company, this master thesis aims to investigate different methods for an energy efficient supply of the tunnel’s snow demand. The main part of this project has considered design of systems for snow production and <b>snow</b> <b>storage.</b> Four different alternatives for the supply of snow to the tunnel have been investigated: outdoor storage and production of artificial <b>snow,</b> <b>storage</b> of natural snow and production of snow directly inside the ski tunnel or an external facility. These methods have been compared regarding energy consumption, costs and operation-related environmental impact in the terms of greenhouse gas emissions. It was found that the energy consumption was significantly higher for indoor than outdoor snow production, mainly because of the energy required for removal of the heat emitted when the water supplied to the snow gun changes phase into ice. The energy demand for storage and production of artificial snow was determined to 8. 5 MWh, which is equivalent to the demand for storage and transport of natural snow. The corresponding values for snow production inside the ski tunnel and the external production facility were calculated to 1. 5 and 1. 1 GWh respectively. From an economic perspective, outdoor snow production is also preferable. The highest investment cost is to be found for the external production facility. The operating costs are however higher for snow production inside the ski tunnel and notably lower for the two <b>snow</b> <b>storage</b> alternatives. The environmental impact related to operation is very low for all the alternatives, provided that the electricity demand is supplied by renewable sources. The highest greenhouse gas emissions are related to the transport and storage of natural snow. This alternative is also associated with high climate dependency and uncertainties regarding the snow quality, and is thus not appropriate to realize. Outdoor production and storage of snow is most favourable in regard to energy consumption, costs and environmental impact and is therefore the alternative that is primarily recommended for implementation at Lindbäcksstadion. If there are very high requirements on the snow quality, the snow should instead be produced in a controlled environment, preferably inside an external production facility.

40|$|Due to {{a continual}} {{increase}} in the demand for water {{as well as an}} ongoing regional drought, there is an imminent need to monitor and forecast water resources in the Western United States. In particular, water resources in the IntermountainWest rely heavily on <b>snow</b> water <b>storage.</b> Thus, the need to improve seasonal forecasts of snowpack and considering new techniques would allow water resources to be more effectively managed throughout the entire water-year. Many available models used in forecasting snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements require delicate calibrations. In contrast to the physical SWE models most commonly used for forecasting, we offer a statistical model. We present a data-based statistical model that characterizes seasonal snow water equivalent in terms of a nested time-series, with the large scale focusing on the inter-annual periodicity of dominant signals and the small scale accommodating seasonal noise and autocorrelation. This model provides a framework for independently estimating the temporal dynamics of SWE for the various snow telemetry (SNOTEL) sites. We use SNOTEL data from ten stations in Utah over 34 water-years to implement and validate this model. This dissertation has three main goals: (i) developing a new statistical model to forecast SWE; (ii) bridging existing R packages into a new R package to visualize and explore spatial and spatio-temporal SWE data; and (iii) applying the newly developed R package to SWE data from Utah SNOTEL sites and the Upper Sheep Creek site in Idaho as case studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{temperate}} regions, evaporation {{of water}} intercepted by the vegetation represents {{an important part}} of the evapotranspiration. A review of interception evaporation studies showed that knowledge about interception evaporation processes is limited and progress is hampered by technical difficulties. Existing snow and rain interception measurement methods were reviewed and evaluated with criteria that were established for the ideal method for interception evaporation process studies. No existing methods fulfil all criteria. Two new load-cell based devices for process studies are tested, one weighing-cut-tree technique for snow interception and a technique based on weighing of both net and gross precipitation (with new type of wind-shield) for rain interception. By comparing measured (weighed) and calculated (combination method with different ways to calculate the aerodynamic resistance) evaporation rates for wet intercepted snow it was shown that the most important factors for calculating the evaporation were the relative humidity, the aerodynamic resistance, the wind speed and the intercepted mass. Calculations of evaporation of intercepted snow with a water budget method showed an average evaporation of 0. 24 mm/hour and a maximum evaporation of 3. 9 mm/ 7 hours when <b>snow</b> canopy <b>storage</b> was measured with a gamma-ray attenuation system and throughfall with plastic-sheet net-rainfall gauges.

40|$|We {{present a}} global water cycle reanalysis that merges water balance {{estimates}} {{derived from the}} Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, satellite water level altimetry and off-line estimates from several hydrological models. Error estimates for the sequential data assimilation scheme were derived from available uncertainty information and the triple collocation technique. Errors in four GRACE storage products were estimated to be 11 – 12 mm over land areas, while errors in monthly storage changes derived from five global hydrological models were estimated to be 17 – 28 mm. Prior and posterior water storage estimates were evaluated against independent observations of river water level and discharge, <b>snow</b> water <b>storage</b> and glacier mass loss. Data assimilation improved or maintained agreement overall, although results varied regionally. Uncertainties were greatest in regions where glacier mass loss and subsurface storage decline are both plausible but poorly constrained. We calculated a global water budget for 2003 – 2012. The main changes were {{a net loss of}} polar ice caps (− 342 Gt yr − 1) and mountain glaciers (− 230 Gt yr − 1), with an additional decrease in seasonal snowpack (− 18 Gt yr − 1). Storage increased due to new impoundments (+ 16 Gt yr − 1), but this was compensated by decreases in other surface water bodies (− 10 Gt yr − 1). If the effect of groundwater depletion (− 92 Gt yr − 1) is considered separately, subsurface water storage increased by + 202 Gt yr − 1 due particularly to increased wetness in northern temperate regions and in the seasonally wet tropics of South America and southern Africa.
