25|$|Austin Trevor debuted {{the role}} of Poirot on screen in the 1931 British film Alibi. The film {{was based on the}} stage play. Trevor reprised {{the role of}} Poirot twice, in Black Coffee and Lord Edgware Dies. Trevor <b>said</b> <b>once</b> that he was {{probably}} cast as Poirot simply because he could do a French accent. Leslie S. Hiscott directed the first two films, with Henry Edwards taking over for the third.|$|E
25|$|In late August 1956, the French Admiral Pierre Barjot {{suggested}} that Port <b>Said</b> <b>once</b> again be made the main target, which lessened {{the number of}} troops needed and thus reduced the interval between sending forces to the eastern Mediterranean and the invasion. Beaufre was strongly opposed to the change, warning that Barjot's modification of merely capturing the Canal zone made for an ambiguous goal, and that the lack of a clear goal was dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Miyagawa’s {{works are}} known for their themes of {{exploring}} memory and finding identity. She <b>said</b> <b>once</b> in an interview, “I believe everything we know about ourselves is entirely based on memory—history, science, art, religion are all constructs of human memory.” Her plays are often written in fluid time and space, rather than in a traditional linear timeline. Many of her works draw from Japanese literature and art forms for inspiration and also employ characters that are ghosts. Her works have explored a variety of issues, such as the interactions between Eastern and Western cultures, feminism, drug addiction, and the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|Until 1969, therefore, the Confiteor was spoken (not sung) {{twice at}} the {{beginning}} of Mass, after the recitation of Psalm 42/43, once by the priest and once by the server(s) or by the deacon and subdeacon. It was also <b>said,</b> <b>once</b> only (not by the priest), before Communion was distributed to the faithful, until Pope John XXIII in his 1960 Code of Rubrics had it omitted when Communion was distributed within Mass. As the Tridentine Missal did not envisage any distribution of Communion to the faithful within Mass, it was the rite of giving Communion to the faithful outside of Mass that was used even within Mass.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 2016, the New York Times {{reported}} that American {{officials said the}} White House had quietly broadened the president’s authority {{for the use of}} force in Somalia by allowing airstrikes to protect American and African troops as they combat fighters from al-Shabaab. About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. SEAL Team 6 has been heavily involved in many of these operations. American military officials <b>said</b> <b>once</b> ground operations are complete, American troops working with Somali forces often interrogate prisoners at temporary screening facilities, including one in Puntland, before the detainees are transferred to more permanent Somali-run prisons. The Pentagon has only acknowledged a small fraction of these operations, announcing 13 ground raids and airstrikes so far in 2016 (3 of which took place in September) — up from 5 in 2015; according to data compiled by New America (a Washington Think tank) the strikes have killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants. At a former Russian fighter jet base in Baledogle, U.S. Marines and private contractors are working to build up a Somali military unit designed to combat Al-Shabaab throughout the country.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} Jerry-centered episode arose {{when the}} writers decided one of the {{characters}} would get mugged. Muharrar said, [...] "Once we thought about it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it seemed like it was time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur <b>said</b> <b>once</b> it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] that Jerry was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E

500|$|In late 1964, Aubrey {{approached}} Stanton with a proposal. Claiming he had investors lined-up {{and ready}} to buy the company, Aubrey <b>said</b> <b>once</b> in control, they would fire Paley, install Stanton as chairman, and promote Aubrey to Stanton's post, CBS corporate president. This {{did not come to}} pass, but Aubrey's contempt for Paley knew no bounds, Aubrey even showing his disregard for Paley in public. The Internal Revenue Service filing a tax lien against Aubrey for $38,047.93 was another irritant for Paley. Aubrey also seemed to have lost his touch, the early ratings for the 1964–65 season showing the new shows that fall were flops. Aubrey panicked, noted Life, and [...] "by that time Paley had made his decision to fire Aubrey, though he had yet found no plausible excuse." ...|$|E
500|$|The protagonists are {{examined}} {{not only as}} individuals, but also by how they connect to people in their lives, {{such as in the}} conflicting love and failed relationships between man and woman; mother and daughter. [...] For example, critic Elizabeth Brown-Guillory notes of the story [...] "Never Marry a Mexican": [...] "Cisneros portrays the mother as a destructive emotional force, alienating and condemning her daughter to repeating her own mother’s destructive powers." [...] This unsuccessful relationship between daughter and mother also affects {{the ways in which the}} women relate to men, as the mother is left at fault for any problematic situations with the daughter's male companions. For example, the daughter Clemencia remembers: [...] "Never marry a Mexican, my ma <b>said</b> <b>once</b> and always. She said this because of my father. ... I’ll [...] never marry. Not any man." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Araya stated {{uncertainty}} {{about the future of}} the band, and that he could not see himself continuing the career at a later age. He <b>said</b> <b>once</b> the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band would sit down and discuss its future. King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering a split: [...] "We're talking of going in the studio next February [...] and getting the next record out so if we do things in a timely manner I don't see there's any reason why we can't have more than one album out." [...] Slayer, along with Trivium, Mastodon, and Amon Amarth teamed up for a European tour titled 'The Unholy Alliance: Chapter III', throughout October and November 2008. Slayer headlined the second Mayhem Festival in the summer of 2009. Slayer along with Megadeth also co-headlined Canadian Carnage, the first time they performed together in more than 15 years when they co-headlined four shows in Canada in late June 2009 with openers Machine Head and Suicide Silence.|$|E

500|$|Guitarist Neil Westfall {{said in a}} 2010 {{interview}} with Alter the Press!: [...] "We've written a few jams, we're always constantly writing, like I think we wrote some parts the other day." [...] Westfall also <b>said</b> <b>once</b> the band return home from touring, they were [...] "going to drop everything and start writing and doing pre-production full time." [...] At this point, the band had ten songs and were trying to condense them into five, then planning to write five more. Westfall said the band completed the final [...] "few songs when we were back home with Tom (Denney) and Chad (Gilbert)." [...] On the pace of writing, McKinnon said: [...] "It seems like a really fast thing that has happened but we've been constantly working on it the entire time." [...] On the songs themselves, he said: [...] "the pop-punk stuff has a darker edge to it. I wrote it like that, it's still pop-punk but with a darker edge". The album was influenced by Finch's What It Is to Burn (2002). The album [...] "came together song by song" [...] as McKinnon mentioned, with the band coming up with 15–16 song ideas. McKinnon stated in an {{interview with}} Rocksound that there's songs [...] "that didn't make this record that we're saving." [...] There is a track on the album that was previously written for Homesick.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said this}} episode {{highlighted}} how the show excelts as portraying small town {{life in a}} comedic way without ridiculing small towns. Fowler said the Twilight jokes felt a bit stale, but he praised Aziz Ansari's performances and moments highlighting the supporting characters, like jokes {{at the expense of}} character Jerry Gergich and Ben's developing respect for Pawnee. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said the series, and [...] "Time Capsule" [...] in particular, accurately captures the details and flavors of the local governments and the public in small towns, even if they exaggerate them. Porter praised the pairing of Chris and Andy and said the two conflicting character personalities worked well together. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said he did not feel Will Forte's character was well integrated {{with the rest of the}} cast and that he dragged down the first episode of the series. However, Sepinwall <b>said</b> <b>once</b> Forte removed himself from Leslie's office, the episode had a [...] "terrific second half", and that the public hearing in particular displayed the strengths of the show. Joel Keller of TV Squad had the opposite view of Alan Sepinwall and felt Forte's character was the most interesting part of the episode, whereas the second half felt [...] "dragged down" [...] and less funny. Keller wrote, [...] "It just lasted a scene too long; we get it, the people in Pawnee are loopy." [...] Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said Parks and Recreation is [...] "at its best when its illustrating small-town life in America" [...] and that the public hearing meetings did so brilliantly. Sundermann praised Rob Lowe's performance and said the new additions of the Chris and Ben characters was [...] "exactly what the show needed to push itself to another level of silliness".|$|E

With Egyptian air defences thus weakened, Israeli Air Force squadrons proceeded to attack Egyptian positions throughout the sector.

2500|$|... "Frevo" [...] {{was born}} from the {{confluence}} of European and Afro-Brazilian cultures, as probably did all the other musical genres consolidated in Brazil. Historians from Pernambuco say that, before the term appeared in Recife's 'Jornal Pequeno', it was already heard and danced in a symbiosis of polkas, 'modinhas', 'dobrados' e 'maxixes' e 'jogos pastoris' (stick and rope formations) along the streets of Pernambuco's capital. The early music bands (civilian or military) [...] helped to give the sound the defining character {{that has come to}} be known as Frevo, a musical mass defined by the brasses. Frevo conductor Guerra Peixe <b>said</b> <b>once</b> that [...] "it is the only popular genre that does not admit the 'play-by-ear composer'. He was referring to the technical hardship of this kind of music, and stressing the role of conductors who led the 'frevistical' troupes.|$|E
2500|$|Bahá'u'lláh wrote three {{obligatory}} prayers — the short, {{the medium}} {{and the long}} — and Bahá'ís are free to choose to {{say one of the}} three each day.

The long prayer can be said {{at any time in the}} day. The medium and long prayers also include movements and gestures during the prayers, which are themselves obligatory except when a person is physically incapable of performing them. Shoghi Effendi has written that the motions and gestures are symbolic and are used to help maintain concentration during the prayers. Furthermore, the obligatory prayer is to be preceded by ablutions, the cleaning of the hands and face, and one has to face the Qiblih, which is the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh.|$|E
