40|$|Decentralized slot {{synchronization}} protocols inspired {{from nature}} have recently gained considerable interest. By adjusting the internal time reference of a node {{in response to}} the detected timing of a received <b>synchronization</b> <b>word,</b> and by following simple rules, synchronization emerges from an initially completely uncoordinated situation.

The transmission is organized in frames, and each frame is preceded by a synchronization preamble with known repetitive parts.

40|$|Proposed {{modifications}} of an offset-quadri-phase-shift keying (offset-QPSK) {{transmitter and receiver}} would {{reduce the amount of}} signal processing that must be done in the receiver to resolve the QPSK fourfold phase ambiguity. Resolution of the phase ambiguity is necessary in order to synchronize, with the received carrier signal, the signal generated by a local oscillator in a carrier-tracking loop in the receiver. Without resolution of the fourfold phase ambiguity, the loop could lock to any of four possible phase points, only one of which has the proper phase relationship with the carrier. The proposal applies, more specifically, to an offset-QPSK receiver that contains a carrier-tracking loop like that shown in Figure 1. This carrier-tracking loop does not resolve or reduce the phase ambiguity. A carrier-tracking loop of a different design optimized for the reception of offset QPSK could reduce the phase ambiguity from fourfold to twofold, but would be more complex. Alternatively, one could resolve the fourfold phase ambiguity by use of differential coding in the transmitter, at a cost of reduced power efficiency. The proposed modifications would make it possible to reduce the fourfold phase ambiguity to twofold, with no loss in power efficiency and only relatively simple additional signal-processing steps in the transmitter and receiver. The twofold phase ambiguity would then be resolved by use of a unique <b>synchronization</b> <b>word,</b> as is commonly done in binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). Although the mathematical and signal-processing principles underlying the modifications are too complex to explain in detail here, the modifications themselves would be relatively simple and are best described with the help of simple block diagrams (see Figure 2). In the transmitter, one would add a unit that would periodically invert bits going into the QPSK modulator; in the receiver, one would add a unit that would effect different but corresponding inversions of bits coming out of the QPSK demodulator. The net effect of all the inversions would be that depending on which lock point the carrier-tracking loop had selected, all the output bits would be either inverted or non-inverted together; hence, the ambiguity would be reduced from fourfold to twofold, as desired...|$|E
30|$|As a last item, we {{consider}} timing synchronization in networks. When the timing {{in the different}} cells of a cellular network is aligned to a common reference instant, the throughput is increased as compared to an asynchronous network. This slot synchronization {{can be obtained by}} using the global positioning system (GPS) to acquire a reference clock, or to use the backbone connection. Both methods have drawbacks: the first method needs a GPS receiver at each basestation, and the second one does not provide sufficiently accuracy. The paper by Tyrrell and Auer describes a decentralized solution to obtain slot synchronization, a solution that is based on synchronization in biological systems. In this method, two <b>synchronization</b> <b>words</b> are used to synchronize: one transmitted by the basestations, and one transmitted by the user stations, and each group helps the other to synchronize. Even when the basestations are located hundreds of kilometers apart, introducing large propagation delays, the decentralized slot synchronizer is able to obtain a timing accuracy of a fraction of the propagation delay.|$|R
30|$|The present article {{develops}} a decentralized interbase station slot synchronization algorithm suitable for cellular mobile communication systems. The proposed cellular firefly synchronization (CelFSync) algorithm {{is derived from}} the theory of pulse-coupled oscillators, common to describe synchronization phenomena in biological systems, such as the spontaneous synchronization of fireflies. In order to maintain synchronization among base stations (BSs), even when there is no direct link between adjacent BSs, some selected user terminals (UTs) participate in the network synchronization process. Synchronization emerges by exchanging two distinct <b>synchronization</b> <b>words,</b> one transmitted by BSs and the other by active UTs, without any a priori assumption on the initial timing misalignments of BSs and UTs. In large-scale networks with inter-BS site distances up to a few kilometers, propagation delays severely affect the attainable timing accuracy of CelFSync. We show that by an appropriate combination of CelFSync with the timing advance procedure, which aligns uplink transmission of UTs to arrive simultaneously at the BS, a timing accuracy within a fraction of the inter-BS propagation delay is retained.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} cellular firefly synchronization (CelFSync) algorithm adapts the PCO {{model to}} account for constraints of cellular networks. CelFSync operates over-the-air, in a decentralized manner; no constraints are imposed {{on the availability of}} an external timing reference. As BSs and UTs typically transmit on successive downlink and uplink frames, two groups need to be distinguished; the BS group transmitting on the downlink and the UT group transmitting on the uplink. To facilitate the formation of two groups, two <b>synchronization</b> <b>words</b> are specified, one associated to BSs and the other to UTs. UTs transmit an uplink sync word based on their internal timing reference, which is received by BSs to update their own timing; in return UTs adjust their timing reference upon reception of downlink sync words from neighboring BSs. Thus, unlike [2], no separate frequency band is required as sync words are transmitted in-band with data. Moreover direct communication among BSs is not mandatory as synchronization is performed by hopping over UTs. As the downlink sync word is mandatory for conventional cellular systems to align the timing of UTs with the BS, the only overhead for inter-BS synchronization is the insertion of the uplink sync word. Thanks to the proposed strategy, the network is able to synchronize starting from an arbitrary misalignment, and propagation delays only affect the achieved accuracy but do not compromise the convergence to synchrony.|$|R

We assume a Gaussian channel, antipodal signalling and coherent detection, where soft values are provided to the frame synchronizer.

When the data distribution is unknown, we design a simple and effective test based on the Generalized LRT (GLRT). We also analyze the performance of the commonly used correlation metric, both in the ”hard ” and ”soft ” version. We show that synchronization by correlation can be greatly improved by the LRT and GLRT metrics, and also that, among correlation based tests, sometimes hard correlation is better than soft correlation. The obtained closed form expressions allow the derivation of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the LRT and GLRT synchronizers, showing a remarkable gain with respect to synchronization based on correlation metric.
