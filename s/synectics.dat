40|$|The Understanding of Abstract Concept of Islamic Teachings on Children Through a <b>Synectic</b> Approach and Analogic Cues in the Quran. The {{weakness}} of learning outcomes {{in understanding the}} concept of abstract {{has resulted in the}} spread of negative daily behavior.

40|$|It {{seems that}} Seneca is {{inclined}} to interpret the enquiry into causality developed by the Academics in a ‘syncretistic’ manner. Accordingly, he acknowledges {{the importance of the}} analytical moment when it is concerned with describing the various aspects that pertain to the realisation of the cause-effect relationship. Seneca proposes a solution which might constitute a new point of departure: one must learn to distinguish between causa efficiens and causae supervenientes. Seneca wishes to assert that what is supervenient is, as such, ‘other’ than the nature of the entity and the <b>synectic</b> cause, Thus, even though the supervenient cause may be conceived by the entity itself (e. g. by the artist), the supervenient cause is in fact external and is not immediately that which is in itself the cause of an effect.

The application phase of this research was accomplished during 2009 - 2010 academic year in a 7 th grade science and technology education class through the second unit: ?force and motion?. The participants were 43 seventh grade students in a public school in Bagcilar-Istanbul in Turkey. Primary data sources were observations and document analysis, and secondary data sources were the records from the interviews conducted with students. In addition to those, quantitative data were gathered from the projects students created. Data analysis included the processing and coding of the data, and content analysis and interpretation of the primary data. Data analysis indicated that in the end of the research process students were able to see new particularities about the concepts they studied that they did not realize in the beginning of the study. Second, results indicated that students went beyond a cursory look at the objects and began to analyze the objects deeply and efficiently in the end of the study.

5000|$|SIT {{deals with}} two main areas of creativity: Ideation of new ideas, and problem solving.In the 1970s, {{researchers}} {{from the field of}} Cognitive Psychology established a quantitative yardstick for measuring creativity: the creative person was defined as someone with a large flow of ideas. [...] A high rate of ideas per unit of time was considered an indication of creativity. This approach led to a series of methods for developing creativity {{based on the assumption that}} a quantitative increase of ideas will necessarily bring about a qualitative improvement. Such widely known methods as brainstorming, <b>Synectics,</b> random stimulation and lateral thinking (identified with Edward de Bono) can be traced to this approach. More recent studies reveal the appearance of a different approach. These studies show that the main difficulty faced by problem solvers is not generating a large quantity of ideas but coming up with original ones. The former parallel drawn between quantity and quality appears to no longer hold true. It was discovered that a large flow of ideas does not necessarily lead to the creation of original ones and further, that the very occupation with ordinary ideas may actually hamper creativity and innovative thought. [...] These discoveries have prompted a new approach which holds that original and interesting results stem from organized thinking and structured processes rather than the random generation of ideas. One of the characteristics of organized thinking is a state of “low stimuli”, unencumbered by a large quantity of ideas. In this approach, originality replaces quantity as a dominant criterion.This organized or structured approach to idea generation is the starting point for Systematic Inventive Thinking.|$|E
