5|$|In March 2013, La Brugeoise subway {{carriages}} {{were replaced}} by new Chinese 200 Series rolling stock, just 11 months prior to their 100-year anniversary on the line. The original rolling <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> since been maintained, some in exhibition and some being converted to 1500v to run tourist services on the line. During the festivities of the 100-year anniversary of the underground on 1 December 2013, many restored La Brugeoise trains circulated Line A {{and there was a}} symphonic orchestra at Plaza de Mayo station as well as free rides for the entire city in order to mark the event. Throughout the week that followed, there were also numerous displays and events across the different lines of the Underground.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{there have been}} moves towards greater {{modernisation}} and standardisation, with large purchases of new rolling stock from companies like Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand rolling stock, which {{the government of the}} City of Buenos Aires claims are temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern rolling stock. Such <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars are set to arrive while 232 are receiving refurbishment, bringing {{the average age of the}} fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.|$|E
5|$|No rolling <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> been {{completely}} scrapped since service began, with the oldest C151 trains operating since {{the inauguration of}} the MRT System in 1987. Older trains have been renewed over the years under refurbishment schemes to enhance their lifespan {{as well as to}} adhere to updated safety and usability codes. Refurbished and new trains sport sleeker designs, improved passenger information systems, more grab poles, wider seats, more space near the doors, spaces for wheelchairs and CCTV cameras. As a trial run, luggage racks were installed on the C751B trains to serve travellers on the Changi Airport branch line. The scheme was withdrawn in June 2002 and the luggage racks removed.|$|E

5|$|Poole {{merges with}} several other towns to form the South East Dorset {{conurbation}} which has a combined population of over 465,000, forming one of the South Coast's major urban areas. In the 2011 census {{the population of the}} borough of Poole was 147,645, an increase from 138,288 in 2001. The town has a built-up area of , giving an approximate population density of 2,128 residents per square kilometre (5,532 per sq mi) in 60,512 dwellings. The population has grown steadily since the 1960s, inward migration has accounted for most of the town's growth and a significant part of this has been for retirement. Housing <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> increased by over 100% in the past 40 years from 30,000 in 1961 to approximately 62,700 in 2004. Compared to the rest of England and Wales, Poole has an above average number of residents aged 65+ (20.3%), but this is less than the Dorset average of 22.2%. The largest proportion of the population (24.8%) is between the ages of 45 to 64, slightly above the national average of 23.8%. Population projections have predicted a continual growth; a population of 151,481 is estimated by 2016.|$|E

Meanwhile, he reads the {{newspaper}} in hope that his <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> gone up, but it has in fact fallen in value. The next day, Kramer (Michael Richards) tells Jerry that his <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> fallen again. Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson, the man who gave the stock tip in the first place, but no one can find him. George rings him back and tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital. While visiting the dry cleaner, Jerry tells George that he wants to sell his stock, but George insists that the tip is good and they should keep the stock. Eventually, George says he will go and visit Wilkinson {{to find out what they}} should do, despite the fact that George does not know him personally.|$|E
25|$|The area, {{which was}} settled by Europeans in the 19th century {{and used as}} pasture, made a slow {{transition}} to a residential suburb which was complete by the mid 20th century.

Dulwich's close location to the Adelaide city centre, grand old houses and leafy tree-lined streets make it an attractive and sought-after suburb.|$|E

25|$|In early November 2012, Groupon {{reported}} they had missed their third quarter revenue estimates, posting a revenue of $586.6 million while estimates were at $591 million. This caused Groupon's stocks {{to fall to}} as low as $2.93/share early in the trading day. Groupon has said to have lost 80% of its value since its initial public offering over one year ago. The <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> since rebounded and was trading around $8 in Q1 2015 before plunging as low as $2.15 in early 2016.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} days of bushmen's carnivals the local {{committees}} owned their own buckjumpers (broncos) which were agisted by local graziers. Local residents also supplemented these mobs with rogue buckjumpers that were difficult to ride. The cattle, bullocks, steers and calves were and still are owned by local graziers that lend them for the campdrafting and rodeo events. Nowadays stock contractors supply both associations with buckjumpers, bulls, dogging steers and calves for the roping events. Contract <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> produced a more uniform range of bucking stock which are also quieter to handle.|$|E

25|$|In a 2000 {{review article}} of twentieth century Finnish architecture, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Edelmann, arts {{critic of the}} French {{newspaper}} Le Monde, suggested that Finland has more great architects {{of the status of}} Alvar Aalto in proportion to the population than {{any other country in the}} world. Finland's most significant architectural achievements are related to modern architecture, mostly because the current building <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> less than 20% that dates back to before 1955, which relates significantly to the reconstruction following World War II and the process of urbanisation which only gathered pace after the war.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{low-cost}} units tend to {{be older}} than the housing stock in general. For example, in 1995, 68% of the affordable rental housing stock was constructed before 1970 and another 21% were built before 1980. A considerable share of the older affordable rental <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> {{been removed from the}} market since 1995, but many of the remaining units are in older buildings. Due for example to differences in building standards, technical development and historical maintenance, the older building stock is generally of worse quality than newer buildings. Deficits include cold down draft, poor insulation and inefficient windows and appliances.|$|E
