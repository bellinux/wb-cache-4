5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with {{a greater emphasis on}} the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E

5|$|Either Ælfric or his {{predecessor}} Sigeric {{wrote a letter}} to Wulfsige, Bishop of Sherborne about the duties of bishops to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> laity did not despoil churches. The letter also urged Wulfsige to exhort the laity to strive for justice in their dealings with others, help widows and orphans, not fight, as well as other moral precepts. Ælfric also ordered the composition of the first Life of Dunstan, a hagiography, or saint's life, of Dunstan, a predecessor as Archbishop of Canterbury. He also acted as a royal judge, once being ordered by King Æthelred to adjudicate a case between thegns, or local noblemen.|$|E
5|$|In early 1948, Nick Shoemaker, Wiescamp's senior {{stallion}} and Skipper W's sire, {{died in a}} freak accident {{while in}} his paddock, by slipping on some ice and breaking his neck against a fence. This meant that Skipper W's show career was cut short so that he could replace his sire as the main breeding stallion. During his entire career, Skipper W never was bred to any mare that was not owned by Wiescamp. Wiescamp wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mares that he bred his stallions to were the best possible matches for the particular stallion. From the time of Nick Shoemaker's death until Skipper W's own death, the horse remained Wiescamp's senior stallion.|$|E

Filming started in June 1991. Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on Rockefeller Center. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used. Burton wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> penguins felt comfortable. Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used; over 50% of their property was occupied by Gotham City sets.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E

5|$|The art {{department}} made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2035 underground {{world would}} only use pre-1996 technology {{as a means}} to depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate is}} {{strongly}} reminiscent of Romanesque architecture, mainly due to alterations {{made to the}} house and grounds by Davenport.

5|$|The {{general area}} of the {{composition}} of the early Upanishads is considered as northern India.

Scholars are reasonably <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of Kuru-Panchala and Kosala-Videha together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these. This region covers modern Bihar, Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, eastern Rajasthan, and northern Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
