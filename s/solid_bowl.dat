Speiser, [...] "on the subject of {{creation}} biblical tradition aligned itself with the traditional tenets of Babylonian science." [...] The opening words of Genesis 1, [...] "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", sum up the author(s) belief that Yahweh, the god of Israel, was solely responsible for creation and had no rivals. Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit penetrated all things and gave them unity. [...] Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and identified Jesus with the creative word: [...] "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" [...] (...) [...] When the Jews came into contact with Greek thought it led to a major reinterpretation of the underlying cosmology of the Genesis narrative. The biblical authors conceived the cosmos as a flat disc-shaped earth in the centre, an underworld for the dead below, and heaven above. Below the earth were the [...] "waters of chaos", the cosmic sea, home to mythic monsters defeated and slain by God; in Exodus 20:4, God warns against making an image [...] "of anything that is in the waters under the earth". There were also waters above the earth, and so the raqia (firmament), a <b>solid</b> <b>bowl,</b> was necessary to keep them from flooding the world. During the Hellenistic period this was largely replaced by a more [...] "scientific" [...] model as imagined by Greek philosophers, according to which the earth was a sphere at the centre of concentric shells of celestial spheres containing the sun, moon, stars and planets.|$|E
50|$|A <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> {{centrifuge}} {{is a type}} of centrifuge {{that uses}} the principle of sedimentation. A centrifuge is used to separate a mixture that consists of two substances with different densities by using the centrifugal force resulting from continuous rotation. It is normally used to separate solid-liquid, liquid-liquid, and solid-solid mixtures. <b>Solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuges are widely used in various industrial applications, such as wastewater treatment, coal manufacturing, and polymer manufacturing. One advantage of <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuges for industrial uses is the simplicity of installation compared to other types of centrifuge. There are three design types of <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuge, which are conical, cylindrical, and conical-cylindrical.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>bowl</b> {{centrifuge}} {{designs are}} divided into three different types based on the <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> shapes, which are conical, cylindrical, and cylindrical-conical. The choice of the centrifuge design in a particular industry {{is determined by the}} characteristics of the slurry and solids.|$|E

2500|$|The {{world of}} the Ascension is a three-part {{universe}} with the heavens above, a flat earth centered on Jerusalem in the middle, and the underworld below. Heaven was separated from the earth by the firmament, the visible sky, a <b>solid</b> inverted <b>bowl</b> where God's throne sat [...] "on the vaulted roof of earth."(Isaiah 40:22). Humans looking up from earth saw the floor of heaven, made of clear blue lapis-lazuli (Exodus 24:9-10), as was God's throne (Ezekiel 1:26).|$|R
5000|$|In the Old Testament {{the word}} shamayim {{represented}} both the sky/atmosphere, and the dwelling place of God. The raqia or firmament - the visible sky - was a <b>solid</b> inverted <b>bowl</b> over the earth, coloured blue from the heavenly ocean above it. Rain, snow, wind and hail {{were kept in}} storehouses outside the raqia, which had [...] "windows" [...] to allow them in - the waters for Noah's flood entered when the [...] "windows of heaven" [...] were opened. Heaven extended down to and was coterminous with (i.e. it touched) the farthest edges of the earth (e.g. Deuteronomy 4:32); humans looking up from earth saw the floor of heaven, which was made of clear blue lapis-lazuli (Exodus 24:9-10), as was God's throne (Ezekiel 1:26).|$|R
5000|$|The Biblical authors {{pictured the}} earth as a flat disk {{floating}} in water, with the heavens above and the underworld below. The raqiya (firmament), a <b>solid</b> inverted <b>bowl</b> above the earth, coloured blue by the cosmic ocean, kept the waters above the earth from flooding the world. From about 300 BCE a newer Greek model largely replaced {{the idea of a}} three-tiered cosmos; the newer view saw {{the earth as}} a sphere at the centre of a set of seven concentric heavens, one for each visible planet plus the sun and moon, with the realm of God in an eighth and highest heaven, but although several Jewish works from this period have multiple heavens, as do some New Testament works, none has exactly the formal Greek system.|$|R

50|$|Both conical plate {{centrifuge}} and tubular bowl centrifuge can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the advantage of conical plate centrifuge over tubular bowl centrifuge is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate but recovery of <b>solids</b> in tubular <b>bowl</b> is difficult and there is limited solid capacity. As the liquid discharge in conical plate centrifuge is under high pressure, this eliminates foaming but foaming is present in tubular bowl centrifuges unless special skimming or centripetal pumps are used. Tubular bowl centrifuges are easier to clean and good sludge dewatering as compared to conical plate centrifuge.|$|R

50|$|The {{post-treatment}} of {{the waste}} stream produced by the <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuge diverse depending on the industrial application. Since different industries have different feed for the centrifuge system, the waste stream will be different as well, and thus require different post treatments. Below are some examples {{of the waste}} stream production and its necessary post treatment in various applications in the industry.|$|E
50|$|A typical conical-cylindrical <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> {{centrifuge}} design {{contains a}} rotating bowl unit {{connected to a}} conveyor with a gear system. The gear system allows the rotating bowl and the conveyor to rotate at different speeds {{but in the same}} direction. Commonly, the conveyor operates at the speed between 1900 and 2400 rotation per minute, while the bowl unit operates at 100 rotation per minute higher.|$|E
5000|$|Chamber bowl {{is another}} {{competitive}} process {{due to its}} ability to process feed with low solid contents also effective classification of solids. Chamber bowl separators are <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuges with cylindrical inserts with increasing in diameter to form multiple chambers. They are used to separate solids in low contents from liquid and long retention time in the centrifuge makes the separated solids very compact state.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the mystique}} of {{materials}} and process is a constant dilemma to the inexperienced industrial designer. A sketch is made, geometry is created and the young designer asks, “How can this design be manufactured? ” “What process do I use to create this shape? ” The intent {{of this paper is}} to discuss my thesis research at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The development of the Mixing Bowl Methodology was to create an interactive object-based learning experience that could transform resin-forming principles into a learning environment. Constructivist methodologies are applied through an interactive primer with the intent of teaching materials and processes for the entry-level design student. Mixing Bowl Methodology interprets three different mixing bowl aesthetics, which corresponds to resin forming theory, featuring a range of molding configurations, from simple to complex. There are three bowls representing three market aesthetics; highend, mid-range and low-end design forms. The mixing bowls were created using parametric <b>solids</b> modeling. Each <b>bowl</b> type will have a corresponding story discussing design aesthetics and geometric theory as it relates to the molding process.

5|$|England captain Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat despite the dull light; Trent Bridge had {{reputation}} for being favourable to batsmen, and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938, four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658, before Stan McCabe of Australia made 232 runs himself. The first innings set {{the pattern of the}} series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather, and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton {{had to deal with the}} contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall—with a low, somewhat round-arm action—and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the point of delivery. In the first two overs, the Australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed as though the hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a <b>solid</b> start. Lindwall <b>bowled</b> the first ball of the match at a moderate pace, and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Gradually, the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace. Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and pads as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>bowl</b> {{centrifuge}} {{is used in}} {{the manufacture}} of polymer to recover acetates from polymer slurry. The conical beach is used for internal washing for acetates recovery improvement. Previously, the centrifuge only consists of single lead conveyor, and then improved using double lead conveyor in order to increase the capacity. Furthermore, the extra double lead conveyor with minimized pitch is used to improve the acetate yield.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{established}} a broad line of centrifugal and filtration equipment for liquid/solids separation in 1932. The significant development was the patented {{design of the}} first planetary gear unit applied to centrifugal equipment. This patent was issued in June, 1934 and formed {{the foundation for the}} design utilized in the BIRD <b>Solid</b> <b>Bowl</b> and Screen Bowl Centrifuges and {{paved the way for the}} development and application of decanter centrifuges into the process industry.|$|E
50|$|In water treatment, the wanted {{product is}} the clean water, while the waste is the sludge {{containing}} dissolved organic and inorganic materials, fibrous matter, and extracellular polymer (ECP). The sludge is commonly discarded down the sewer or to landfill. Occasionally, the sludge {{is used in}} the production of bricks and concrete, in agriculture as a soil additive, or for land reclamation. In this application, <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuge is used as the final step of the water treatment sludge before disposal in order to reduce landfill charges and transport costs.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} aspects {{that can be}} {{improved}} from the current <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuges {{in order to increase}} its performance and reliability. To allow more control and simpler operation, support systems such as feed equipment, chemical dosing facility and better transfer pumps were designed and added. Moreover, the operating parameters can be adjusted to optimize the sludge dewatering process. It relies on rotational force in order to throw the solids out and for the sludge to stick to the outer all surfaces. The use of a metal screen or some suitable filtering material can also be added to achieve better solids dryness.|$|E
50|$|In 1953 Flottweg {{expanded}} its {{into a business}} sector: the production of liquid-solid separation machines. The first product was the Flottweg Decanter, a <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> decanter centrifuge; the first model, DECANTER Z1, was sold to BASF. Further development lead to a higher speed and more efficient decanter in 1964. In 1966 an adjustable impeller for decanter was added, which allowed the operator to optimise the pond depth while the decanter was operating; this was useful in the extraction of olive oil. After further development, Flottweg sold a 3-phase decanter for olive oil in Spain in 1971. In 1977 Flottweg began to manufacture belt filter presses.|$|E
50|$|During the {{industrial}} process of wastewater treatment, huge quantity of sludge is produced. The sludge {{needs to be}} disposed of or having further treatment. One of the treatment methods available is thickening the sludge by using <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuges. While prior sludge have the concentration around 0.5-1 % of dry solid, after the thickening process, it will contain up to 5-6% of dry solids. This process reduces the waste of active sludge volume by more than 80% as well as minimizing the sludge amount for digestion by 30-40%. Furthermore, less disposal sludge also lowers the cost of polymer and improves the characteristics of dewatering.|$|E
50|$|With {{the help}} of helical screw conveyor, <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> {{centrifuges}} separate two substances with different densities by the centrifugal force formed under fast rotation. Feed slurry enters the conveyor and is delivered into the rotating bowl through discharge ports. There is a slight speed difference between the rotation of conveyor and bowl, causing the solids to convey from the stationary zone where the wastewater is introduced to the bowl wall. By centrifugal force, the collected solids moves along the bowl wall, {{out of the pool}} and up the dewatering beach located at the tapered end of the bowl. At last the solids separated go to solid discharge while the liquids go to liquid discharge. The clarified liquid flows through the conveyor in the opposite direction through adjustable overflow parts.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear grade {{ammonium}} diuranate (ADU) and UO powders were produced on a pilot plant scale by the continuous single-stage precipitation of ADU with ammonium hydroxide, dewatering with a rotary drum vacuum filter or a <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> centrifuge, and batch-tray drying and calcination-reduction to UO powder. Precipitation at 50 ºC and pH {{values in the}} range 7. 2 to 8. 0 produced ADU materials which could be converted to UO powder by calcination and reduction at temperatures of 600 to 730 ºC, and fabricated into sintered pellets with densities of 10. 37 to 10. 77 g cm- 3. The lower the pH of precipitation the lower was the reduction temperature required to achieve a specified pellet density. Precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 80 ºC and with ammonia gas at 50 ºC offered no advantages over precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 50 ºC. The UO 2 powders and sintered pellets produced from ADU powders precipitated by the three methods were similar. Precipitation at pH 7. 5 and 50 ºC is recommended since a reasonably filterable precipitate can be produced reproducibly without a need for stringent control, and considerable flexibility {{is available in the}} subsequent production of a sinterable UO 2 powder.

40|$|THE HIGH {{moisture}} content of mill mud (typically 75 – 80 % for Australian factories) results in high transportation {{costs for the}} redistribution of mud onto cane farms. The high transportation cost relative to the nutrient value of the mill mud results in many milling companies subsidising {{the cost of this}} recycle to ensure a wide distribution across the cane supply area. An average mill would generate about 100 000 t of mud (at 75 % moisture) in a crushing season. The development of mud processing facilities that will produce a low moisture mud that can be effectively incorporated into cane land with existing or modified spreading equipment will improve the cost efficiency of mud redistribution to farms; provide an economical fertiliser alternative to more farms in the supply area; and reduce the potential for adverse environmental impacts from farms. A research investigation assessing <b>solid</b> <b>bowl</b> decanter centrifuges to produce low moisture mud with low residual pol was undertaken and the results compared to the performance of existing rotary vacuum filters in factory trials.
