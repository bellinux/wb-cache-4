50|$|Shore {{power or}} shore supply is the {{provision}} of shoreside electrical power to a <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> while its main and auxiliary engines are shut down. While the term denotes shore as opposed to off-shore, it is sometimes applied to aircraft or land-based vehicles (such as campers, heavy trucks with sleeping compartments and tour buses), which may plug into grid power when parked for idle reduction.|$|E
50|$|Cold ironing, or shore connection, {{shore-to-ship}} power (SSP) or alternative {{maritime power}} (AMP), {{is the process}} of providing shoreside electrical power to a <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off. Cold ironing permits emergency equipment, refrigeration, cooling, heating, lighting and other equipment to receive continuous electrical power while the ship loads or unloads its cargo. Shorepower is a general term to describe supply of electric power to ships, small craft, aircraft and road vehicles while stationary.|$|E
40|$|Breaking {{away from}} the {{traditional}} approach of the marine industry, that of passive (in-built) ship safety, RINA with assistance from the SSRC has recently developed and launched the first ever notation focused on operational issues (active ship safety); it has been tested on a ship of Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL). This Class Notation aims at assessing the effectiveness of crew functionality by comparing the evacuation performance of a ship in several specific scenarios (IMO scenarios, scenarios pertaining to social events, <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> and owner specific scenarios to reflect real emergencies) with and without crew assistance. This new concept makes evacuation analysis much more relevant, offering real “means ” for enhancing passenger evacuation performance as well as incentivizing passenger ship owners to improve emergency procedures. This paper describes the concept and development of this groundbreaking approach, pertaining to the integration of all major crew functionalities within evacuation analysis (such as controlling spaces, searching cabins, and re-routing) and presents and discusses its implementation on a modern cruise ship, leading to conclusions and recommendations on the way forward. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} to estimate the emissions of <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> based on their actual fuel consumption and the fuel quality. Accurate estimates of emissions from <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> demand reliable knowledge of the fuel consumption while <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> and associated fuel characteristics. However, assured information about energy use and fuel consumption of seagoing <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> is scarce. Proper estimation of <b>ship</b> emissions <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> is crucial for understanding the impact of shipping emissions on air quality and health in harbour cities {{as well as for}} a proper evaluation of the impact of abatement measures such as shore-side electricity and/or restrictions of sulphur content for shipping fuels to be used in ports. Therefore, a survey of energy consumption and fuel use on board of 89 seagoing ships was made in close cooperation with the Port of Rotterdam. Rotterdam is the major port of Europe ensuring that the results will have relevance for the larger European domain. On board of the <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth,</b> a questionnaire was filled in by the chief engineer of that particular ship, assisted by two former mechanical <b>shipping</b> engineers employed <b>at</b> our organization. Survey results as well as the emission estimations are compared to the (scarce) information that is available and expert judgements in recent studies.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{international}} trade and maritime operation have played an increasingly significant role in providing international cargo and passenger transportation. Consequently, seaports over the world are suffering from the problem of fuel consumption and exhaust gases coming from ships during their stopover in harbors. <b>Ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> generate electricity by means of their auxiliary engines, and emit air pollutants and noise. As a result, ports become an important and growing source of pollution and can create significant risks for the health of nearby communities. Costs involved in the shore-side power program can vary widely among ports. In this paper economic and environmental analysis related to ships and shore-side power have been studied Additionally, the practicability, costs and benefits of switching from onboard ship auxiliary engines to shore-side power connection for a ro/ro <b>ship</b> while <b>berthed</b> <b>at</b> Civitavecchia port have been investigated...|$|R

40|$|High-voltage shore {{connection}} (HVSC) is a technical solution to supply <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> {{in an economic}} way while reducing air pollution in city ports. When multiple megawatt-HVSC installations are to be exercised, electric power has to be delivered to the port from a primary high-voltage (HV) line at voltages higher than 100 kV. In this case, large earth fault currents can arise on the HV side, flowing through the port earthing system and the bonded ship hulls. Due to these faults, possible dangerous voltage gradients in sea water around the bonded ship hulls may occur. This phenomenon is pointed out and investigated in this paper to identify possible safety issues in some given scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Emissions from <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> {{played an}} {{important}} role in the exposure of atmospheric pollutants to high density population in port areas, but these emissions were not understood very well. In this study, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particle emissions from 20 container <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> were sampled and analyzed during the fuel switch period at Jingtang Port in Hebei Province, China. VOCs and particles were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and the Single Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SPAMS), respectively. VOCs analysis showed that alkanes and aromatics, especially benzene, toluene and heavier compounds e. g. n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, dominated the total identified species. Secondary organic aerosol yields and ozone forming potential were 0. 017  ±  0. 007  g SOA/g VOCs and 2. 63  ±  0. 37  g O 3 /g VOCs, respectively. Both positive and negative ion mass spectra from individual ship were derived and intensity of specific ions could be quantified. Results showed that element carbon (35. 74  %), element carbon-organic carbon mixture (33. 95  %) and Na-rich particles (21. 12  %) were major classes with a total number ratio of 90. 7  %. Particles from ship auxiliary engines were in a size range of 0. 2 to 2. 5  μm, with a peak occurring at around 0. 4  μm. The issue of vanadium as tracer element was discussed that V was not a proper tracer when using low sulfur content diesel oil. The average percentage of sulfate particles from shipping emissions before and after switching to marine diesel oil were 23. 82  % and 23. 61  % respectively.

40|$|The colloquial term `cold-ironing&# 039; {{refers to}} the shore power {{connection}} when a <b>ship</b> is <b>at</b> <b>berth.</b> Even though, cold-ironing is not new to the shipping industry only recently it received more attention, mainly due to strict emission regulations. When a ship receives shore power, its emissions can be eliminated and thus cold-ironing is becoming a popular service sought by <b>ships</b> that <b>berth</b> <b>at</b> emission controlled ports. Generally, the shore power connection is available only <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> and thus emissions from the ships that are anchored {{in and around the}} port is still a significant issue.

40|$|This work is {{intended}} {{to assess the impact}} on local air quality due to atmospheric emissions from port area activities for a new port in project in theMediterranean Sea. The sources of air pollutants in the harbour area are auxiliary engines used by <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berth</b> during loading/offloading operations. A fleet activity-basedmethodology is first applied to evaluate annual pollutant emissions (NOX, SOX, PM, CO and VOC) based on vessel traffic data, ships tonnage and in-port hotelling time for loading/offloading operations. The 3 -dimensional Calpuff transport and dispersion model is then applied for the subsequent assessment of the ground level spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants for both long-termand short-term averaging times. Compliance with current air quality standards in the port area is finally evaluated and indications for port operation are provided.

40|$|Existing studies {{indicate}} that marine pollution control in the ports of developing economies is marred {{by a lack of}} administrative control and inadequate provision of waste reception facilities. In Nigeria ports, ship generated waste control services and provision of waste reception facilities are outsourced to private companies with no requirement for an activity audit. Apart from the port authority, other government agencies are also involved in pollution monitoring and control. Hence, functions are duplicated and effective regulation is arguably weakened by conflicts of interest. A scientific based integrated model is therefore proposed to address the managerial problem posed in the control of marine pollution in Nigerian ports. In this paper, we conduct a physico-chemical and microbiological analysis of samples of ships’ wastewater to determine the status of marine pollution in the port environment. The samples were collected from randomly selected <b>ships</b> <b>at</b> <b>berths</b> in seaport locations.
