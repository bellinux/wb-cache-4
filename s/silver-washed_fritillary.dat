5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
500|$|... present include adder (Vipera berus), {{grass snake}} (Natrix natrix), slowworm (Angula fragilis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, {{including}} the grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), raven (Corvus corax) and the European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). The Quantocks are {{also an important}} site for red deer (Cervus elaphus). Invertebrates of note include the <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Argynnis paphia), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: Thymalus limbatus, Orchesia undulata and Rhinosimus ruficollis.|$|E
2500|$|Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types—caused by the {{underlying}} Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels—the site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and [...] hazel—for which reason the site was listed as an SSSI—and its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and orpine (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset. Adjacent to the edge of the site is an extensive poultry farm, containing approximately 100,000 birds.|$|E

50|$|The <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{butterfly}} is deep orange {{with black}} {{spots on the}} upperside of its wings, and has a wingspan of 54-70 mm, with the male being smaller and paler than the female. The underside is green, and, unlike other fritillaries, has silver streaks instead of silver spots, hence the name silver-washed. The caterpillar is black brown with two yellow lines along its back and long reddish-brown spines.|$|E
50|$|Long Lye is a {{traditionally}} managed neutral grassland {{of a type}} which was once characteristic of lowland Britain but has now become increasingly rare due to agricultural intensification. Mature broadleaved woodland and wet flush communities add considerable diversity to this site. Fifteen species of butterfly have been recorded here. They include the <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis paphia), of which the valenzia form has been found, purple hairstreak (Quercusia quercus) and marbled white (Melanargia galathea).|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of sites in Britain at which the Red Data Book {{hoverfly}} Chalcosyrphus eunotus has been found. A wide range of butterflies occurs here, including <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> and white admiral. A number of bat species have also been recorded at the site including the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus), noctule (Nyctalus noctula), Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros).|$|E
50|$|Twinhills Woods and Meadows {{comprise}} {{a complex of}} ancient, semi-natural woodland, neutral and calcareous grassland with associated mature hedges and areas of shrub growth.

50|$|A {{dilapidated}} cottage {{has been}} restored as a bat house.Bats include brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros).Other animals include Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus).Birds include common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), European green woodpecker (Picus viridis), <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis paphia), song thrush (Turdus philomelos) and white-throated dipper (Cinclus cinclus).The comma (Polygonia c-album) and common brimstone (Gonepteryx rhamni) butterflies may be seen.|$|E
50|$|This site {{consists}} of a nationally rare type of neutral grassland together with adjoining areas of scrub and ancient woodland. The Whitevine meadow is unusual in being {{one of only three}} British localities where the grass Gaudinia fragilis is a prominent and established component of the sward. The scrub provides nest sites for several species of bird, including nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos). Clearings within the scrub support a mixed flora with saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), yellow-wort (Blackstonia perfoliata) and autumn gentian (Gentianella amarella). These sheltered glades provide favourable climatic conditions for butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea) and <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis paphia).|$|E
50|$|Grafton Wood is {{the centre}} of the only colony of the brown {{hairstreak}} butterflies in the Midlands. Laight Rough is also important for other butterflies such as white admiral, white-letter hairstreak and the <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary.</b> In 2009 the Bat Conservation Trust launched a detail study of 10 counties in England to determine the range of the Bechstein's bat and in 2010 a lactating female Bechstein's was discovered in Grafton Wood suggesting that there was a breeding colony in the wood or close by. The People's Trust for Endangered Species are funding further research work. In October 2014 it was reported that the scarce Brandt's bat has also been found at the 300-year-old woodland.|$|E
50|$|The various habitats, {{together}} with {{the wide range of}} slopes and aspects, provide ideal conditionsfor a rich fauna. Amphibians such as the palmate newt (Triturus helveticus), common frog (Ranatemporaris), and common toad (Bufo bufo) are represented in the damper environments. Reptilespresent include adder (Vipera berus), grass snake (Natrix natrix), slowworm (Angula fragilis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, including the grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), raven (Corvus corax) and the European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). The Quantocks are also an important site for red deer (Cervus elaphus). Invertebrates of note include the <b>silver-washed</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Argynnis paphia), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: Thymalus limbatus, Orchesia undulata and Rhinosimus ruficollis.|$|E
