40|$|SUMMARY Haptoglobin (Hp) {{groups were}} {{investigated}} in 81 patients with motor neuron disease. A significant excess of heterozygotes was observed, accentuated among males {{and in the}} <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> subgroup. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} a possible influence of Hp in the immunological response. Motor neuron disease is a progressive disorder of the upper and lower motor neurons. Affected individuals become severely disabled and many die within a few years. Most cases are sporadic but 5 - 10 % occur in a familial pattern suggesting autosomal dominant in-heritance. 1 A slight male overrepresentation is often observed. Three clinical varieties are recognised, de-pending on involvement of upper or lower motor neu-rons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shows signs of upper and lower motor neuron disorder, whereas progressive bulbar paralysis (PBP) and <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA) show only lower motor neuron signs. With time the symptomatologies of these variants often merge and in late stages of the disease subgroups are difficult to distinguish. The cause and pathogenesis of motor neuron dis-ease are unknown and various aetiologies, such as viral, immunological, genetic and environmental, have been proposed. 2 3 On the island of Guam, with a focus of high incidence for motor neuron disease, ex-tensive investigations of genetic markers have been performed without finding any striking associ-ations. 46 Apart from histocompatibility antigens genetic markers have not, to our knowledge, pre-viously been investigated in cases of motor neuron disease outside the high incidence areas. 7 Haptoglobin (Hp), the major haemoglobin-binding serum protein, is an acute phase reactant with various properties of unknown biological significance.

40|$|Increased {{weakness}} during cold (cold paresis) {{was reported}} in single cases of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). This was unexpected because demyelination is a feature of MMN and symptoms of demyelination improve, rather than worsen, in cold. It was hypothesized that cold paresis in MMN does not reflect demyelination only, but may indicate the existence of inflammatory nerve lesions with permanently depolarized axons that only just conduct at normal temperature, but fail at lower temperatures. We investigated symptoms of cold paresis in 50 MMN patients, 48 chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients, 35 <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA) patients, and 25 chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy patients. We also investigated symptoms of increased weakness during warmth (heat paresis). Cold paresis was reported more often than heat paresis. Cold paresis was most frequently reported in MMN. Multivariate analysis indicated that MMN patients had a 4 - to 6 -fold higher risk of reporting cold paresis than CIDP or PSMA patients. Because cold paresis is not consistent with demyelination, the lesions in MMN may involve other mechanisms than demyelination only. In conclusion, symptoms of cold paresis are common in peripheral nervous system disorders, particularly in MMN. This supports the above-described hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Multifocal motor {{neuropathy}} (MMN) {{and chronic}} inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are immune-mediated neuropathies. Despite treatment being available, patients suffer from disabling weakness of {{arm and leg}} muscles and fatigue. Pathogenesis of MMN and CIDP is unclear, but the development of conduction block plays an important role. Conduction block may originate from demyelination, Na-channel damage at the node of Ranvier, and permanently changed resting membrane potential. Better understanding of underlying mechanisms is needed {{in the search for}} new targets for therapy. Two observations may point to specific mechanisms of conduction block. Cold paresis is suggested by complaints of increased weakness in cold and was only reported in single cases of MMN. Activity-dependent weakness, an abnormal increase in weakness during activity, was described in selected MMN and CIDP patients. The objective of this thesis is to further explore cold paresis and activity-dependent weakness in MMN and CIDP. Cold paresis was attributed to conduction block arising in axons affected by inflammation with permanently depolarized axons that just conduct at normal temperature, but fail to conduct at lower temperatures. We showed that MMN patients experience cold paresis more often than patients with other peripheral nervous system disorders including CIDP and <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA). This supports a specific underlying mechanism in MMN, as was previously proposed. When cold paresis was objectively assessed by muscle force testing, muscle force in MMN did not decrease following cooling. This may, however, be compatible with cold paresis as normal controls showed an increase in force. As similar effects of cooling were found in MMN and PSMA, cold paresis may be related to reinnervated muscle fibers. Nerve excitability studies suggested hyperpolarization in MMN and changes following cooling similar to normal subjects in MMN and CIDP. Taken together, our findings do not clearly support the hypothesis of conduction block arising in depolarizing inflammatory nerve lesions in MMN. Activity-dependent weakness was ascribed to increased activity of the electrogenic Na/K pump causing axonal hyperpolarization, leading to conduction block in already injured demyelinated axons. We showed that MMN and CIDP patients report activity-dependent weakness more frequently than normal subjects. The fact that this was also true for patients with sporadic <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA) suggests that other mechanisms, not related to demyelination cause activity-dependent weakness. Muscle strength testing during isometric maximal voluntary contraction showed that activity-dependent weakness was more prominent in MMN than in PSMA and normal controls. Activity-dependent conduction block could, however, not be demonstrated in any of 353 nerve segments in MMN and was found in only 1 out of 285 nerve segments in CIDP. Muscle contraction did induce an increase in segmental duration prolongation in segments with signs of demyelination. Taken together, our findings suggest that activity-dependent weakness in MMN is common, but it does not result from overt activity-dependent conduction block. Alternatively, it may result from temporal dispersion of nerve action potentials, impulse blocking at distal axonal motor branch points, or impulse blocking in muscle fiber...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the genetic basis of hereditary lower motor neuron disease (LMND) and the recognition of multifocal motor neuropathy as a distinct clinical entity necessitate a new classification of LMND. To this end, we studied the clinical and electrophysiological features of 49 patients with sporadic adult-onset LMND in a cross-sectional study. Disease duration was more than 4 years to exclude the majority of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Based on the pattern of weakness, we identified three groups: 13 patients with generalized weakness (group 1); eight patients with symmetrical, distal muscle weakness (group 2); and 28 patients with non-generalized asymmetrical weakness of the arms in most patients (group 3). Group 3 could be subdivided into patients with weakness in predominantly the distal (group 3 a) or the proximal (group 3 b) muscle groups, both with disease progression to adjacent spinal cord segments. Distinctive features of group 1 were an older age at onset, more severe weakness and muscle atrophy, lower reflexes, greater functional impairment, more widespread abnormalities on concentric needle EMG, respiratory insufficiency and serum M-protein. In groups 2 and 3, concentric needle EMG findings also suggested a more widespread disease process. Retrospectively, the prognosis of sporadic adult-onset LMND appears to be favourable, because clinical abnormalities were still confined to one limb in most patients after a median disease duration of 12 years. We propose to classify the patients in the different subgroups as slowly <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 1), distal spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 2), segmental distal spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 3 a) and segmental proximal spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 3 b).

Patients Thirty-seven consecutive patients newly diagnosed (onset of weakness < 4 years) with <b>progressive</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> enrolled between 1998 and 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease progression was measured at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months by the Medical Research Council sum score, number of affected limb regions, and the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score.

To further delineate the phenotypes within the motoneuron disease spectrum, this controlled study assessed the upper- and extra-motoneuron white matter involvement in cohorts of patients with motoneuron disease phenotypes shortly after diagnosis by comparing diffusion tensor imaging data of the different cohorts to those of healthy controls and directly between the motoneuron disease phenotypes (n = 12 for each cohort). Furthermore, we acquired follow-up data 6 months later to evaluate fractional anisotropy changes over time. Combined use of diffusion tensor tractography of the corticospinal tract and whole-brain voxel-based analysis allowed for comparison of the sensitivity of these techniques to detect white matter involvement in motoneuron disease. The voxel-based analysis demonstrated varying extents of white matter involvement in different phenotypes of motoneuron disease, albeit in quite similar anatomical locations. In general, fractional anisotropy reductions were modest in <b>progressive</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> and most extensive in primary lateral sclerosis. The most extensive patterns of fractional anisotropy reduction were observed over time in the voxel-based analysis, indicating progressive extra-motor white matter degeneration in limb- and bulbar onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in <b>progressive</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The observation of both upper motor and extra-motoneuron involvement in all phenotypes of motoneuron disease shortly after diagnosis suggests that these {{are all part of}} a single spectrum of multisystem neurodegenerative disease.
