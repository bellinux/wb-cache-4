State-of-the-art multiparameter equations of state are used to describe the thermodynamic properties of siloxanes and to compute the value of the fundamental derivative of gasdynamics ?, whose negative sign is the herald of nonclassical gasdynamics. Siloxane fluids starting from D 6 and cyclic siloxanes of greater complexity, and MD 3 M and linear siloxanes of greater complexity are predicted to exhibit a thermodynamic region in which ? is negative and hence nonclassical wavefields are admissible.

40|$|Abstract. Liquid flow {{propelled}} by capillary forces {{is one of}} the most important transport mechanisms in porous environments. It is governed by a fascinating interplay of interfacial, viscous drag as well as gravitational forces which liquids encounter upon invasion into geometries with often complex topologies, such as capillary networks of trees or interconnected fractures in soils and ice. Whereas a detailed understanding of this phenomenon has been achieved on macroscopic scales, its phenomenology is poorly explored on the meso- and nanoscale, where predictions regarding its dynamics are hampered due to a possible break-down of continuum hydrodynamics and conflicting reports with respect to the conservation of the fluidity and capillarity of liquids upon spatial confinement. Here, we present fundamentals, concepts and an experimental, gravimetric study on the capillarity-driven invasion dynamics of liquids in networks of pores a few nanometers across in monolithic, nanoporous silica glass (porous Vycor). A variation of the complexity of the building blocks of the liquids investigated (water, chain-like n-alkanes, <b>silicon</b> <b>oils</b> and rod-like liquid crystals) along with a variation of the humidity and the temperature upon spontaneous imbibition allows us t...|$|R

The spray evolution is analyzed with respect to characteristic macroscopic spray parameters such as spray cone angle, penetration length and integrated spray volume. It is found that the influence of fuel properties is reduced with increasing ambient density. An empirical correlation for the macroscopic cone angle as a function of Reynolds number and density ratio is derived and it is found that for non-evaporative ambient conditions mixture formation is mainly driven by density and viscosity.

40|$|In {{this work}} cold model {{experiments}} {{in combination with}} Comsol modeling {{have been carried out}} to investigate the possibilities of a new method for industrial inline measurements of slag viscosities. The method aims at measuring the mass of the drag force as a sphere is dragged upwards in a liquid. The sphere was connected to a balance that was elevated at constant velocity. The liquids used were <b>silicon</b> <b>oils</b> of two different viscosities; 0. 1 Pa*s and 0. 5 Pa*s. A computer logged the mass from which the viscosity was calculated. Comsol modeling was used to show approximately at which time the drag force is constant, and to investigate the wall effect. The importance of laminar flow is discussed. The results show that the method is more suitable for liquids of higher viscosities. The reason is that the drag force is one order of magnitude lower than the other forces in the system. Since the drag force is directly proportional to the viscosity, it becomes larger with higher viscosity. The Comsol model shows that the drag force becomes constant in a few seconds from start of the movement. Comsol gives approximately the same values for the drag force as can be calculated by hand. The viscosities calculated from the experimental data are between two and five times too large for the higher viscosity tested, and between two and ten times too large for the lower viscosity tested. There is a wall effect for the two containers used in the experiments that can be seen both experimentally and by Comsol.

40|$|In {{the course}} of eruptive {{activity}} of Asama Volcano in 1973, successive eruptions occurred during the period 16 to 18 February. Implosion earthquakes associated with the eruptive activity were examined by the present author, who presented a model for mechanism of the successive eruptions. A liquid film of magma in the model {{plays an important role}} in a discussion on energetics of dynamical process inside a volcanic conduit to interpret earthquake magnitudes of the implosion earthquakes. However, there is little information available for the film thickness of viscous liquid in the model. From this point of view, one of the most basic experiments was carried out to learn this information and to examine the validity of the model. In the present experiment, several kinds of <b>silicon</b> <b>oils,</b> whose viscosities are 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 cs, were used on the basis of a parameter Nf which supports the application of the experimental results to the volcanological model.

In the experimental results, the ratio of the film thickness of viscous liquid to the inner radius of pipe was found to range from 0. 2 to 0. 35 (or 0. 1 to 0. 18 to the inner diameter). Therefore, the model would be further confirmed from the present experiment.

Mixing efficiency of such systems is greatly influenced by the property of the two phases, most of the fluids used by the industry show Non-Newtonian behavior. This work is concerned with the application of static mixers to form biphasic liquid dispersions in the laminar flow regime; in particular we present here a methodology to investigate the effect on the mixing efficiency of elasticity of one phase. To this aim, two low viscosity Boger fluids, obtained by mixing small amount of Polyacrilamide and Xantan gum in a Newtonian glycerin-water solvent, were used as aqueous phase and mixed with <b>silicon</b> <b>oils</b> of different molecular weight. In order to quantify the influence of viscoelasticity on the mixing efficiency, a reference Newtonian fluid (GLY) obtained by mixing water and glycerin in an appropriate concentration to obtain the same viscosity of the non-Newtonian reference was used. The mixing efficiency has been quantified by measuring the drop size distribution by optical microscopy and image analysis. The expected influence of the elasticity is to delay break-up phenomena, so resulting in a lower mixing efficiency, the effect is expected to be limited when the elasticity is only in the drop phase, compared to the case of elastic matrix. Below the drop size distribution for the case of aqueous disperse phase in SO is reported; on the left graph the numerical distribution is compared for Newtonian GLY and non-Newtonian XGh and PAA, on the right one the cumulative volumetric shows that the differences are limited to the large diameter tail of the distribution, that represents most of the dispersed phase volume...|$|R
