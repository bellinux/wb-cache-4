5|$|Attalea {{includes}} both large trees and small acaulescent palms which occupy {{a number of}} different ecological niches. Dense stands of some of the larger <b>species</b> <b>are</b> conspicuous elements on the landscape, while smaller <b>species</b> <b>are</b> found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter <b>species</b> <b>are</b> free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria; in {{contrast}} to Rhizobium species, they normally fix molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere without symbiotic relations with plants, although some Azotobacter <b>species</b> <b>are</b> associated with plants.

5|$|Cockroaches are {{abundant}} {{throughout the world}} and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some <b>species</b> <b>are</b> capable of surviving temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> found in Australia. Only about four widespread <b>species</b> <b>are</b> commonly regarded as pests.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{diversity}} and structure of bird communities is essential to delineate the importance of regional or local landscapes for avian conservation. Birds {{are very sensitive to}} environmental changes and are used as a “bioindicator. ” The study was carried out to explore {{the diversity}} and status of avifauna in the Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan, India, from January 2013 to December 2013. The line transect method was used to cover most of the study area. A total of 142 species of birds belonging to 45 families and 18 orders were recorded. Muscicapidae was the most dominant family with 23 species, and its relative diversity index was also found to be the highest (relative diversity index =  16. 19). The analysis of data on residential status revealed that 99 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> residents, six <b>species</b> <b>were</b> winter visitors, three <b>species</b> <b>were</b> summer visitors, and 14 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> passage visitors. The analysis of feeding habits showed that a maximum number of <b>species</b> (44 <b>species)</b> <b>were</b> omnivorous, 42 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> insectivorous, 35 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> carnivorous, 12 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> granivorous, four <b>species</b> <b>were</b> frugivorous, four <b>species</b> <b>were</b> insectivorous–nectivorous, and one <b>species</b> <b>was</b> nectivorous. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, 128 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Least Concern category, one <b>species</b> <b>was</b> in the Endangered category, two <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Critically Endangered category, six <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Near Threatened category, and two <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Vulnerable category. Thus, the Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary supports a sound avifaunal diversity. Its proper management will not only improve the situation for its resident species, but will also attract more migratory and vagrant species in the future...|$|R
40|$|The avifaunal {{diversity}} of Khairbandha lake was studied from February 2014 to January 2016 based on visual encounter surveys. The Khairbandha lake {{is located at}} Khalbanda having abundant food availability and rich aquatic vegetation that harbors a variety of birds. Now a days the anthropogenic activities and the environmental changes happening regularly affects the seasonal biodiversity. Total eighty six species including water birds and land birds were recorded belonging to different 33 families during the study period. Out of eighty six <b>species,</b> 56 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> residents (65 %), 23 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> winter visitors (27 %), 02 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> summer visitors (2 %) and 05 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> passage visitors (6 %). The maximum <b>species</b> <b>were</b> sighted during the winter season followed by summer and monsoon season respectively. Out of eighty six <b>species,</b> 39 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> very common, 16 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> common, 14 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> uncommon, 13 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> occasional and 04 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> rare for this site.

5|$|H. reaumuri {{differs from}} other desert {{woodlice}} {{in a number}} of respects. It is crepuscular, while other <b>species</b> <b>are</b> nocturnal.

Compared to other woodlice, H. reaumuri walks in an unusual manner, with its body held high off the ground.|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 2001 {{individuals}} of 50 woody <b>species</b> <b>were</b> recorded around the 177 grid points (Table[*] 1).

Although the well-established tea plant, Cam. sinensis, was an exception, most marker <b>species</b> <b>were</b> native plants. The growth forms of the marker <b>species</b> <b>were</b> diverse, and both deciduous and evergreen <b>species</b> <b>were</b> used.

5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> found in fresh water and another 5,000 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment. The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and some large <b>species</b> <b>are</b> fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 plant <b>species</b> <b>are</b> found {{nowhere else}} in the world, {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to the}} spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium <b>species</b> <b>are</b> endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid <b>species</b> <b>are</b> found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic.

The drugs vinblastine and vincristine are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle.

5|$|Non-native plants {{sometimes}} threaten {{native species}} by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic <b>species</b> <b>are</b> most {{commonly found in}} areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic <b>species</b> <b>are</b> controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, {{both of which are}} time consuming and expensive.|$|E
5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> Critically Endangered, 5 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> Endangered, 7 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> Near Threatened, and 7 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E

5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump, with broad, relatively short wings.

5|$|Some prey <b>species</b> <b>are</b> {{capable of}} {{fighting}} back against predators, whether with chemicals, through communal defence, or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker.

5|$|Terns are {{long-lived}} {{birds and}} are relatively free from natural predators and parasites; most <b>species</b> <b>are</b> declining in numbers due {{directly or indirectly}} to human activities, including habitat loss, pollution, disturbance, and predation by introduced mammals.
