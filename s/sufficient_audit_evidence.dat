40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{verification}} of selected internal processes and items in final accounts of the company Graziano Trasmissioni, Ltd. The theoretical basis of the thesis concerns problems with audit planning and performance. It provides an explanation of essential audit definitions, objectives and phases and a description of audit risks. It characterises methods {{which can be used}} for obtaining appropriate and <b>sufficient</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> that is necessary for expressing the auditor's opinion about credibility of final accounts. The emphasis is on obtaining information with the assistance of control and substantive tests. In the practical part of the thesis, control tests are applied to a purchase and sales process. The test results should show whether the internal control mechanisms are effective or not. The substantive tests validate balances of accounts receivable and accounts payable. The specific objectives are tested and the results prove whether the account balances are misrepresented in the financial statements or not...|$|E

The auditor should obtain <b>sufficient</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> to enable him to draw conclusions to support the content of his report. The auditor should obtain {{an understanding of the}} entity's accounting system and related internal controls to assess their adequacy as a basis for the preparation of financial information and to assist in the designing of his audit procedures. If the auditor intends to rely on any internal controls, he should study and evaluate those controls. If a database system is used, it is logical that all the financial data reside in the database. In order for an auditor to express an opinion on the financial statements, he has to determine to what extent he can rely on the integrity of the financial data that resides in the database. The {{objective of}} this research was to identify the risks and controls present in a general database environment as well as those present in the Oracle? database management system environment, to develop a comparison table between these environments and to develop an Oracle? internal control questionnaire...|$|E

This information must include the nature of the estimations and their accounting value at the date of the balance sheet. The auditing of the financial statements in which accounting estimations are presented frame a high risk of significant distortion. Because of this, the auditor must obtain <b>sufficient</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> which would certify if these estimations are reasonable, respectively if the data on which the estimations are based upon are accurate, complete and relevant, and the procedures and methods used {{for the development of the}} estimations are adequate for the balance sheet structures to which they apply. The development of provisions, as a manner to reflect uncertainties within the accounting system, contributes to the accurate representation of the company’s financial position. Such uncertainties are acknowledged through the presentation of their nature and value, but also through the exercising of prudence for the development of the financial statements. Prudence implies the identification of those accounting estimations, associated to the given uncertainties conditions, which would not over-evaluate the assets and the incomes, and the debts and expenses would not be under-evaluated. Exercising prudence should not allow, for instance, the accumulation of excessive provisions, the deliberate under-evaluation of assets and incomes, nor the deliberate over-evaluation of debts or expenses. This requirement is imperative, due to the fact that investors substantiate their economic decisions starting from the analysis of the financial statements, as accurate image of the financial position and efficiency of an entity...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is, in part, to {{illustrate}} and educate what forensic accountants do and how they do it with a step-by-step process. It demonstrates the kinds of simple research in which forensic accountants should engage and should help educate forensic accountants in the use of one of the basic tools of investigation – public records research using databases that are freely available. More information can, of course, be obtained from fee-based services, but one does not have to use fee-based services. This research can serve as a basis for showing forensic accountants where to look, what to look for, how to assemble various documents to tell a story, and how to arrive at conclusions based on the evidence obtained. Conducting a forensic accounting investigation typically leads to more questions as more facts are uncovered, which then leads the forensic accountant down other paths to discover other facts, and so forth, until a more complete picture is formed. This approach uses the American Accounting Association (AAA) as an example, looking at the AAA from a forensic accountant’s viewpoint. In spite of the term, forensic accounting is not all accounting and numbers. A forensic accountant gathers evidence just as auditors gather evidence to support an opinion. The Third Standard of Field Work for CPAs states, “The auditor must obtain <b>sufficient</b> appropriate <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> ” on which to base an opinion (AU Section 508 2011). In fact, a qualified opinion must be issued if “there is a lack of <b>sufficient</b> appropriate <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> ” (AU Section 508 2011). * The Executive Director and the current and next presidents were invited to respond to this article, but no response was forthcoming...|$|R

40|$|In auditing, {{professional}} skepticism {{refers to}} an attitude that requires ongoing questioning and critical assessment of evidence. An auditor needs to exercise professional skepticism to obtain <b>sufficient</b> and appropriate <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> to determine whether financial statements are free from material misstatements due to errors or frauds. Hurtt (2010) developed a professional skepticism scale to measure the level of an auditor’s skepticism. However, the exercise of professional skepticism among auditors is very subjective and difficult to measure. The validity of the Hurtt skepticism scale {{in the context of}} different countries requires further examination. A factor analysis study is conducted to validate the suitability of the instrument based on Malaysian data. The results indicate that only five of the Hurtt (2010) skepticism traits are relevant in determining professional skepticism in the Malaysian environment. The suspension of judgment trait seems to be irrelevant since respondents feel that this trait requires more time to make audit decisions and may delay audit work. Malaysian auditors are not likely to possess such a trait because they are burdened with numerous audit tasks that must be completed by a deadline. The results suggest that variances may exist across different countries due to differences in environment...|$|R
40|$|According to The International Standards on Auditing, {{the purpose}} of the auditor in an audit {{engagement}} is to express an independent, objective and a professional opinion regarding the accuracy of the financial statements of the companies audited. During his mission, the auditors must also assess the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, with a major impact on the preparation and the quality of financial statements that are reported. To support his opinion, regarding the hypothesis of going concern, the auditor must obtain <b>sufficient</b> and appropriate <b>audit</b> <b>evidence,</b> and perform the necessary audit procedures.

40|$|<b>Audit</b> <b>evidence</b> {{enables the}} auditor to express {{an opinion on}} the {{financial}} statements. To address {{the risk that the}} auditor may express an inappropriate opinion, the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures must be responsive to the assessed risks of material misstatement. The auditor must aggregate the levels of assurance obtained from different combinations of tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to respond to the assessed risks. These evidence planning decisions are complex and require professional judgement. Research has found that the extent of audit procedures is not linked to the assessed risks and that auditors may not know to aggregate evidence from different types of audit procedures. Research also supports the use of a structured audit methodology that includes decision models, to guide the application of professional judgement. This leads to the overall objective of this study: the development of an integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model to quantify the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> The study employs a grounded theory model building approach, interpreting the relevant concepts and principles from the literature review into the development of the model. The integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model quantitatively relates the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> in a logical and structured manner with the risk assessment and three distinct overall levels of assurance needed to support the audit opinion. It uses the cumulative nature of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> and the compensatory inter-relationship between tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to quantitatively aggregate the extent and levels of assurance from the different combinations of procedures to obtain reasonable assurance at the required overall level of assurance. The model provides a framework for influencing and guiding the exercise of professional judgement and is a practical and effective tool to benefit the users thereof when conducting an audit. Thus, the study models the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> with reference to the aggregation of different types and combinations of evidence and the linkage between the risk assessment and the extent of evidence that provides a flexible framework for the application of professional judgement regarding the gathering of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> AuditingD.
