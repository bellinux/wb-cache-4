The accrual accounting system has been adopted to substitute the cash accounting system by many central governments around the world.

The age-based depreciation approach, which is a traditional approach, is applied to determine the depreciation of an asset based on the defined useful life and the <b>straight-line</b> depreciation <b>method.</b> The advantage of this approach is its simplicity and its ability to support the long-term asset management system.

40|$|In {{the wide}} range of image {{processing}} and computer vision problems, line segment detection has always been among the most critical headlines. Detection of primitives such as linear features and straight edges has diverse applications in many image understanding and perception tasks. The research presented in this dissertation is a contribution to the detection of straight-line segments by identifying the location of their endpoints within a two-dimensional digital image. The proposed method is based on a unique domain-crossing approach that takes both image and parameter domain information into consideration. First, the straight-line parameters, i. e. location and orientation, have been identified using an advanced Fourier-based Hough transform. As well as producing more accurate and robust detection of <b>straight-lines,</b> this <b>method</b> has been proven to have better efficiency in terms of computational time in comparison with the standard Hough transform. Second, for each straight-line a window-of-interest is designed in the image domain and the disturbance caused by the other neighbouring segments is removed to capture the Hough transform buttery of the target segment. In this way, for each straight-line a separate buttery is constructed. The boundary of the buttery wings are further smoothed and approximated by a curve fitting approach. Finally, segments endpoints were identified using buttery boundary points and the Hough transform peak.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to present a {{rational}} depreciation method for a pyroprocess cost calculation. Toward this end, the so-called advanced decelerated depreciation method (ADDM) was developed that complements the limitations of the existing depreciation methods such as the <b>straight-line</b> <b>method</b> and fixed percentage of declining-balance method. ADDM was used to show the trend of the direct material cost and direct labor cost compared to the straight-line or fixed percentage of the declining-balance methods that are often used today. As a result, it was demonstrated that the depreciation cost of the ADDM, which assumed a pyroprocess facility's life period to be 40 years with a deceleration rate of 5 %, takes up 4. 14 % and 27. 74 % of the pyroprocess unit cost ($ 781 /kg heavy metal) in the 1 st and final years, respectively. In other words, it was found that the ADDM can cost the pyroprocess facility's capital investment rationally every year. Finally, ADDM's validity was verified by confirming that the sum of the depreciation cost by year, and the sum of the purchasing cost of the building and equipment, are the same...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the problem of}} selecting the most suitable economic optimization criteria for mathematical programming approaches to the synthesis, design, and optimization of chemical process flow sheets or their subsystems. Minimization of costs and maximization of profit are {{the most frequently used}} economic criteria in technical papers. However, there are manyother financial measures which can lead to different optimal solutions if applied in the objective function. This paper describes the characteristics ofthe optimal solutions obtained with various optimization criteria like the total annual cost, the profit, the payback time, the equivalent annual cost, the net present worth, and the internal rate of return. It was concluded that the maximization of the net present worth (NPW) with a discount rate equal to the minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) is probably the most appropriate method for the optimization of process flow sheets or their subsystems. Similar or equal solutions can be obtained by simpler criteria of minimum equivalent annual cost or maximum profit if the annual investment cost is calculated by using the MARR instead of the <b>straight-line</b> depreciation <b>method.</b> These criteria represent a thorough compromise between quantitative andqualitative measures, because they consider the absolute terms of future cash flows of investments equally important as profitability through the life cycle of the project.

40|$|The {{convergence}} {{characteristics of}} two viscous core corrections {{as used in}} <b>straight-line</b> segmentation <b>methods</b> are rigorously analysed. These are curvature corrections that account for the induced velocity contribution at a point on a vortex filament due to local curvature and core corrections that remove unrealistically high induced velocities near vortex segments. Two alternative versions of the latter correction are studied: the original as introduced by Scully and a recently introduced improved correction by the authors. The problem is analysed using a viscous vortex ring. A high-order numerical filament method is presented that uses rational B-spline curves to model the vortex ring geometry exactly. First, the separate influence of the two corrections on induced velocity values are studied using the numerical filament method. Afterwards, the corrections are combined in four separate cases that are studied using the segmentation method. It is found {{that in order to}} get accurate results at coarse discretisations, curvature corrections cannot be neglected. When used together with the original core correction model, results start to diverge from the reference values for discretisations smaller than approximately ten degrees. Combining the curvature correction with the improved core correction extends the discretisation region for which accurate results are found down by approximately one order. Finally, it is shown that segmentation methods that use the original core correction model without curvature correction completely fail to converge to the reference values.
