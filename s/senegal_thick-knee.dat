50|$|The <b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knee</b> (Burhinus senegalensis) is a stone-curlew, a {{group of}} waders in the family Burhinidae.|$|E
50|$|They {{are similar}} but {{slightly}} {{smaller than the}} Eurasian stone-curlew, which winters in Africa. The long dark bill, single black bar on the folded wing, and darker cheek stripe are distinctions from the European species. <b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knee</b> is striking in flight, with a broad white wing bar.|$|E
50|$|Burhinus chicks are precocial and nidifugous. They {{have long}} stout legs and thick down. The parents will guard and collect food {{for them when}} very young. They will also lead them to feeding ground over quite a large area. Bush stone-curlews have been seen lifting young after {{brooding}} and the <b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knee</b> is suspected of carrying their chicks. The parents will warn chicks to lay down when disturbed and the chicks will drop down, head and neck stretched out, making them very difficult to see.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knees</b> are medium-large waders {{with strong}} black and yellow black bills, large yellow eyes [...] - [...] which {{give them a}} reptilian {{appearance}} [...] - [...] and cryptic plumage. The scientific name refers to the prominent joints in the long yellow or greenish legs.|$|R
50|$|All Burhinus have a {{complete}} post-breeding moult which can take 4-5 months. The primaries are lost in descending sequence. The Eurasian and <b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knees</b> may suspend moulting of primaries in winter and finish in spring, leading to an overlap of moulting and breeding. It is very unusual for breeding and moulting to overlap, and the slow moult may possibly be to maximise re-nesting potential. Burhinus’ secondary feathers are usually not replaced in one season, with {{the inner and outer}} feather being shed first. A pre-breeding moult may just be the head and neck and sometimes not at all. Once they have fledged, juvenile Burhinus will moult only their head and body, some wing-coverts and central tail. Juveniles will moult their secondary wing feathers after their first winter. This can be helpful when estimating the age of young birds.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{disturbances}} {{will cause}} parents to quietly leave nest, while more serious threats will {{cause them to}} defend the nest. This can include distraction displays and aggressive behaviour, though very occasionally a broken wing display has been observed. The non-incubating parent will spot danger and warn their mate. The alarm is raised with a special posture. The sitting bird will walk away then runs and flies off, while the other bird flies in different direction. They will both turn back and meet, and watch to see {{what will become of}} the disturbance. The male will follow intruder if it leaves, whilst the female will carefully return. The pair will attack ground predators, diving, wings out and neck forward. On the other hand, they will stand upright wing fanned against herbivore that may trample the eggs or chicks. If chicks are not lost to the threat, the parents will lead them to a new area. <b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knees</b> will watch humans at nest and then return quite quickly even if watched.|$|R
5000|$|Location of Burhinus’ nests {{can vary}} {{and may be}} near {{vegetation}} or out in the open. The nest usually consists of a simple scrape that is sometimes lined with stones or shells. [...] Placement of nest site in different habitats such as heath-land or farmland can vary {{from year to year}} by the same pairs. If the vegetation becomes too tall, as can occur if nesting occurs within a crop, Burhinus will abandon the nest site. <b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knee</b> will use grit, straw, wood and shells to line its nest, while Spotted thick-knee uses smaller animal dung and vegetation to line the nest. Double-striped thick-knee may also use dung to line their nest. Water thick-knee will use more lining than other species and usually place the nest near a piece of driftwood or vegetation, sometimes on elephant dung. [...] Bush stone-curlews nest under trees of open woodland with understorey of short sparse or lush grass, often near dead timber.|$|E
50|$|Burhinus are a genus of long-legged, large-eyed, {{terrestrial}} waders with eerie nocturnal calls. They {{range from}} 32 cm (<b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knee)</b> to 59 cm (Bush stone-curlew). There are generally only minor plumage {{differences between the}} sexes, and the late juveniles of Burhinus appear similar to the adults. Females may be smaller. All species of this genus have cryptic plumage of sandy browns with streaks and mottles, usually with spots of cream, buff, brown and black. The head of the Burhinus has a broad domed crown, giving rise to the Afrikaans name of dikkop, which translates to “thick head”. The closed wings of most Burhinus have banded upper coverts. This is not as prominent on the American species and the Peruvian thick-knee is plainer and greyer except for the head. In flight, Burhinus’ wing plumage is much more striking with patterning that contrasts with the otherwise cryptic plumage. All Burhinus have black primary feathers with white patches, which is most developed in Bush stone-curlews. The wings are long and are held straight and out stretched in flight. Burhinus have a marked carpal angle and the outer wing has minimal tapering, with a pointed tip in some species. The inner wing is thinner, with 16-20 secondary feathers. Burhinus have 11 primary feathers, of which the outer most is very small and covered by the primary coverts. The twelve tail feather are generally short and rounded, except in the Spotted thick-knee which is medium in length and the Bush stone-curlew which has a longer more tapered tail. Their legs often extend beyond the tail in flight.Typically, the Burhinus bill is stout, and is considered medium to short in length for a wader. The tip of the bill is bulbous with sharp point when viewed from side, while from the top view it has a broad base. The bill is mostly dark but can have yellow at the base, with slit-like perforated nostrils like Laridae.|$|E
50|$|More {{species of}} Burhinus species {{are found in}} the tropics and sub-tropics, than other bioregions. They are {{generally}} sedentary and can live their whole lives within a few kilometres of hatching site. Eurasian stone-curlews are the exception, breeding in temperate areas and migrating south to avoid the northern winter. Birds from Britain and France will migrate to Italy, Greece, and Turkey and further. Bush stone-curlews will move to find food. Both Eurasian and Bush stone-curlews use a much larger area outside the breeding season. Double-striped, Peruvian and the Spotted thick-knees are rarely seen outside breeding areas while <b>Senegal</b> <b>thick-knees</b> will move based on rains in north.Burhinus are very typical in their requirements and are usually found in dry open country though the <b>Senegal</b> and Water <b>thick-knees</b> are associated with water. They can breed in arid and semi-arid habitats but not in closed woodland or forest. They are generally found in open spaces with extensive visibility on dry fairly even ground. Their habitat is usually a mixture of bare earth and vegetation with some species, like the Bush stone-curlew, found in lightly timbered, open forest and woodland. Eurasian stone-curlews are mostly found on free draining sandy soils with stones, both semi-natural and tilled. They will roost in the shade {{at the edge of a}} forest. Partly cleared farmland can be used as well but intense cultivation will drive them away. Burhinus are generally timid and wary, though in some case they may live close to humans using resources from dung and crops, as well as nesting on rooftops.|$|R
