5000|$|Cases for the [...]300 Whisper can {{be formed}} from common and {{plentiful}} [...]223 Remington brass by <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>trimming</b> to length. However, J.D. Jones has recommended against this, citing {{the difference in}} case thickness at the neck (compared to the [...]221 Fireball) as a potential issue. This problem can be exacerbated when military 5.56×45mm cases are used. (The Whisper name is trademarked thus: the only firearms with a [...]300 Whisper chamber are those from J.D. Jones and Thompson Center, which licensed the name. All other guns are cut to [...]300/221 which has different chamber specifications than the Whisper, particularly in neck wall thickness. Because the [...]300 Whisper is a wildcat cartridge there were no established Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) specifications for the chamber reamers, and the necks were cut to allow for standard [...]308 neck thickness, which is approximately the same thickness as produced from forming [...]223 brass. Typically only guns with Whisper chambers will have problems with [...]223 brass—.300/221 chambers work very well with [...]223 brass, and the [...]223 brass is considerably stronger than [...]221 brass.) ...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsPaul NelsonTrimmed {{means are}} robust estimators of {{location}} for distributions having heavy tails. Theory and simulation indicate that little efficiency is lost under normality when using appropriately <b>trimmed</b> means <b>and</b> that their use {{with data from}} distributions with heavy tails can result in improved performance. This report uses the principle of equivariance applied to trimmed means sampled from a Cauchy distribution to form a discrepancy function of the data and parameters whose distribution is free of the unknown median and scale parameter. Quantiles of this discrepancy function are estimated via asymptotic normality and simulation and used to construct confidence intervals for the median of a Cauchy distribution. A nonparametric approach based {{on the distribution of}} order statistics is also used to construct confidence intervals. The performance of these intervals in terms of coverage rate and average length is investigated via simulation when the data are actually sampled from a Cauchy distribution and when sampling is from normal and logistic distributions. The intervals based on simulation estimation of the quantiles of the discrepancy function are shown to perform well across a range of sample <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>trimming</b> proportions when the data are actually sampled from a Cauchy distribution and to be relatively robust when sampling is from the normal and logistic distributions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are {{widespread}} in underdeveloped countries. In Ethiopia, the prevalence {{and distribution of}} helminth infection varies by different exposing risk factors. We therefore investigated the prevalence of and risk factors of STHs infection in school children living in Ambo town, west Shoa Ethiopia. Methods In 2014 / 15, among 375 school children planed {{to be included in}} this study, only 321 school children were recruited in the study. Data onto school children from different schools were collected, including stool samples for qualitative STHs analysis. Questionnaire data on various demographic, housing and lifestyle variables were also available. Results Prevalence of any STHs infection was 12. 6 %. The respective prevalence of major soil-transmitted helminths is Ascaris (7. 8 %), Hookworm (2. 8 %) and Trichuris (2. 2 %). This study result shows STHs prevalence varies regards to age, sex, latrine use, family <b>size</b> <b>and</b> nail <b>trimming.</b> Conclusion The {{results of the present study}} indicated that the percentage of positive finding for STHs in Ambo area is low. Besides, Large Family <b>size,</b> not nail <b>trimming</b> <b>and</b> unavailability of improved latrine were identified as predisposing factor for STHs infections. All school children enrolled and not enrolled in this study should be treated twice a year until the prevalence falls below the level of public health importance...|$|R

2500|$|In the North American market, the Celica Supra was {{available}} in two distinct models. There was the [...] "Performance Type" [...] (P-type) and the [...] "Luxury Type" [...] (L-type). While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tire <b>size,</b> wheel <b>size,</b> <b>and</b> body <b>trim.</b> The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type {{did not get the}} option of a leather interior until 1983. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital dash with trip computer; some Canadian models had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models. The digital dash featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, and electronic fuel level and coolant level gauges. The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as fuel economy in miles-per-gallon, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and distance remaining to destination. Excluding the 1982 model, all P-types were available with headlight washers as an option, but the L-types were never given such an option. Although gear ratios changed throughout the years, all P-types came standard with a limited slip differential.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{prevalence}} of lameness as well as the prevalence of claw-horn disruptions, abnormal claw shape and dermatitis in lame cows in Greek dairy farms and to evaluate their risk factors. Forty dairy farms were visited twice, during winter and during summer, and the lameness of milking cows was scored using a 5 -point scale. In total 760 cows were lame (lameness score >= 3) and were further examined to identify macroscopically the claw disorders. The herd <b>size,</b> the <b>trimming</b> <b>and</b> footbathing frequency, the floor surface, the cleanness of the herd. the scraping frequency and the disinfectant used in the footbaths were recorded. The mean lameness prevalence was 18. 7 % and that of claw disorders observed in the lame cows was 75. 4 % for abnormal claw shape, 30. 2 % for dermatitis and 30. 6 % for claw-horn disruptions. Large herd <b>size</b> <b>and</b> the absence or only once per year trimming were associated with increased risk for the presence of lameness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Described as “one of {{the most}} {{important}} late 18th century plantation houses in Virginia” by the Senior Architectural Historian, Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Historic Resources, Mount Ida was built c. 1795 by William Cannon, on a hill overlooking {{the south side of the}} James River near New Canton in Buckingham County, Virginia. The site was near the northwest corner of Cumberland County and across the river from Bremo. In 1805 Cannon sold the property to the legendary land baron David Ross, who subsequently sold the property to William Leitch, a Buckingham merchant. Around 1850, Leitch, laden with tobacco export wealth, added a major addition to the east side of the house, as evidenced by the difference in siding, window <b>size</b> <b>and</b> interior <b>trim.</b> The intricate, extraordinary interior woodwork with its elegant and unique composition was designed by a master builder, modeled after patterns found in two early 18th century architectural treatises, William Pain’s Science of Architecture and Asher Benjamin’s Practical House Carpenter. While Leitch family lore contends that Irish immigrants performed the work, scholars are of the opinion that the work may have been done by the same skilled craftsman who markedly similar woodwork at Woodlands (1789-1794), originally in Amelia County and since relocated to Goochland County. The interior of Mount Ida has been compared to that at Plain Dealing Plantation (circa late 1780’s), another exemplary plantation home a few miles away in Keene.|$|R

40|$|We apply {{adaptation}} into ordinary circuits {{and systems}} to achieve high performance, high quality results. Mismatch in manufactured VLSI devices {{has been the}} main limiting factor in quality for many analog and mixed-signal designs. Traditional compensation methods are generally costly. A few examples include enlarging the device <b>size,</b> averaging signals, <b>and</b> <b>trimming</b> with laser. By applying floating gate adaptation to standard CMOS circuits, we demonstrate here {{that we are able}} to trim CMOS comparator offset to a precision of 0. 7 mV, reduce CMOS image sensor fixed-pattern noise power by a factor of 100, and achieve 5. 8 effective number of bits (ENOB) in a 6 -bit flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) operating at 750 MHz. The adaptive circuits generally exhibit special features in addition to an improved performance. These special features are generally beyond the capabilities of traditional CMOS design approaches and they open exciting opportunities in novel circuit designs. Specifically, the adaptive comparator has the ability to store an accurate arbitrary offset, the image sensor can be set up to memorize previously captured scenes like a human retina, and the ADC can be configured to adapt to the incoming analog signal distribution and perform an efficient signal conversion that minimizes distortion and maximizes output entropy...|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} design stage of helicopters consists of various operations {{and in each}} operation design several detailed analysis tasks are needed. The analysis tasks include performance and the required power estimation. In helicopter design, those are usually carried out by adopting the momentum theory. In this paper, an explicit form of computational analysis based on the blade element theory and uniform/non-uniform inflow model is developed. The other motivation of the present development is to obtain <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> required power estimation for various helicopter configurations. Sectional and hub loads, power, <b>trim,</b> <b>and</b> flapping equations are derived by using a symbolic tool. Iterative computations are carried out till convergence is achieved in the blade response, inflow, <b>and</b> <b>trim.</b> The predictions regarding the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> power estimation {{turn out to be}} correlated well with the experimental results. The effect of inflow is further investigated. It is found that the present prediction for the lateral cyclic pitch angle is improved with the non-uniform inflow model as compared to that by the uniform inflow model. The presently improved <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> power estimation will be useful for future helicopter <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> performance analysis...|$|R
