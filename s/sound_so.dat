5|$|The overall {{acoustic}} {{system is a}} distributed sound reinforcement system, which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly {{in a way that}} facilitates ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of <b>sound</b> <b>so</b> as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} three bullets were found inside Baader's cell is {{considered}} suspicious. The first explanation given was that Baader signaled the other prisoners. However {{the cells were}} soundproof and the jailors who were posted a few meters from the cells didn't hear any suspicious <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> it remains in question how the other prisoners could have communicated.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, {{the fusion}} of sounds work so well that Turkish pop music does not <b>sound</b> <b>so</b> Westernised like Indonesian or Filipino pop even though it does include global {{influences}} such as technological developments from the west, western harmonies grafted onto folk songs, influences from Arabic music and, of course, American-influenced rap and hip-hop from artists such as Erci-E.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his work, Tricky blurs the {{normally}} clear sexual definitions found within hip hop. Despite the heavy influence he drew from American hip hop in his debut album, Maxinquaye, he fights against typical sexual representations by, for example, dressing {{as a woman}} on the side sleeve of his album cover. As many of his tracks blend elements of varying types of music creating a difficult to define <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> go his lyrics, creating a more ambiguous and blurry take on sexuality.|$|E
25|$|This {{extraordinary}} instrument, a prehistoric-looking {{combination of}} horn and harp created by Gaston, produces a <b>sound</b> <b>so</b> terrible and loud that it causes physical destruction all around and panics animals and even fighter jet pilots. Like {{the voice of}} the bard Cacofonix in Asterix, it horrifies everyone except its originator. The first time the instrument appears, the plucking of just one string causes the floor to collapse. Gaston has also created at least one other instrument in the same vein, and an electric version of the Gaffophone. Fantasio has tried several times {{to get rid of the}} Gaffophone, without success.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce a}} shock wave, {{an object in}} a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In {{the case of an}} {{aircraft}} travelling at high subsonic speed, regions of air around the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> that the sound waves leaving the aircraft pile up on one another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock wave forms, the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (not coincidentally, since explosions create shock waves).|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} Middle Ages, {{two forms of}} 'v' developed, which were both used for its {{ancestor}} 'u' and modern 'v'. The pointed form 'v' was written {{at the beginning of}} a word, while a rounded form 'u' was used in the middle or end, regardless of <b>sound.</b> <b>So</b> whereas 'valour' and 'excuse' appeared as in modern printing, 'have' and 'upon' were printed 'haue' and 'vpon'. The first recorded use of 'u' and 'v' as distinct letters is in a Gothic alphabet from 1386, where 'v' preceded 'u'. Printers eschewed capital 'U' into the 17th century and the distinction between the two letters was not fully accepted by the French Academy until 1762.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{supervision}} of May and Taylor, numerous restoration projects have been under way involving Queen's lengthy audio and video catalogue. DVD releases of their 1986 Wembley concert (titled Live at Wembley Stadium), 1982 Milton Keynes concert (Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl), and two Greatest Video Hits (Volumes 1 and 2, spanning the 1970s and 1980s) have seen the band's music remixed into 5.1 and DTS surround <b>sound.</b> <b>So</b> far, {{only two of the}} band's albums, A Night at the Opera and The Game, have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on DVD-Audio. A Night at the Opera was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album's original release (CD+DVD-Video set). In 2007, a Blu-ray edition of Queen's previously released concerts, Queen Rock Montreal & Live Aid, was released, marking their first project in 1080p HD.|$|E
25|$|Now came {{word that}} the Japanese were moving south in force. Two battleships, a light cruiser, and 14destroyers were bound to destroy Henderson Field by bombardment, {{to break up the}} American {{reinforcement}} mission, and to cover reinforcement movements of their own. O'Bannon and the other ships of the Support Force, two heavy and three light cruisers and eight destroyers, confronted the greatly superior enemy early on 13November in Ironbottom <b>Sound,</b> <b>so</b> named for the number of ships on both sides sunk there during the Guadalcanal campaign. O'Bannon boldly attacked the Japanese battleship , closing so near, the battleship could not depress her main battery far enough to fire on the destroyer. O'Bannons gunfire, in combination with the attacks {{of the rest of the}} force, damaged Hiei so badly that she was a sitting duck for the air attack, which forced her scuttling the next day.|$|E

500|$|Firecracker: The {{predecessor}} of the firecracker was a type {{of heated}} bamboo, used as early as 200 BC, that exploded when heated continuously. The Chinese name for firecrackers, baozhu, literally means [...] "exploding bamboo." [...] After the invention of gunpowder, gunpowder firecrackers had a shape that resembled bamboo and produced a similar <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> the name [...] "exploding bamboo" [...] was retained. In traditional Chinese culture, firecrackers were used to scare off evil spirits.|$|E
500|$|Beck {{confirmed}} McCarty's {{account and}} added, [...] "Somebody'd say, 'Let's do something modern and exciting; {{we know we}} can get a good blues <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> let's spread it out a little bit.' [...] It was all spur of the moment, man". [...] Over two days at Chess, a backing track was completed and the Yardbirds continued their American concert tour. [...] Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, the group resumed recording at Columbia studios on 7 January and at RCA studios on 10 January 1966. [...] Singer Keith Relf contributed lyrics and a melody for the song.|$|E
500|$|Tarja {{announced}} {{she is to}} release a new album {{in the summer of}} 2016.

She also explained that the album will follow in the same footsteps as her other albums but with a new soul and growth. A [...] with a snippet of two songs was then released on her official YouTube channel. On 17 February 2016, Tarja also revealed the first letter of the album name to be T.|$|E

500|$|When it {{came time}} to record their second album, Revolutions per Minute, McIlrath noted that the band was {{suffering}} from an [...] "identity crisis". At the time, Fat Wreck Chords had a specific pop punk <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> Rise Against wanted to find a producer that could help distinguish them from the other bands on the label, and highlight the heavier aspects of their music. Sonic Iguana Studios, where Rise Against recorded The Unraveling, and another studio in San Francisco were both busy at the time, leaving the band had only thirty days to record. They decided on Bill Stevenson—the former drummer of the punk band Descendents—to produce the album.|$|E
500|$|The punk music {{during the}} bus scene {{was written by}} Thatcher after {{he learned that the}} audio for the scene would be by [...] "Duran Duran, or whoever" [...] and not [...] "raw" [...] and {{authentic}} punk. Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two sound editors who were in punk bands to create their own music. They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of [...] "I hate you", and wrote a song centered on the theme. Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the song in one take using cheap microphones to create a distorted sound. The song was also used in Paramount's Back to the Beach.|$|E
500|$|... "No Can Do" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} and final single from Catfights and Spotlights. When Digital Spy questioned group member Keisha Buchanan about her reaction to its release, she responded: [...] "I'm really excited about it. I'm looking forward to people hearing another side to the album. This single has got a kind of Jackson 5 feel to it which I love. The whole album has got a really old-school, laid-back Motown <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> hopefully 'No Can Do' will get more people interested in the album." [...] "No Can Do" [...] {{was released}} as a digital download in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 19 December 2008. The following day, it was made available as a CD single, which consists of three remixes of the track and a cover version of Keane's song [...] "Spiralling".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} strongly positive {{responses from}} critics, {{and it was}} frequently cited as {{the highlight of the}} album. Phil Sutcliffe in Sounds magazine said the song was [...] "so honest you might even risk calling it truth". Music website AllMusic called [...] "Biko" [...] a [...] "stunning achievement for its time", and {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's odd that such a bleak song can <b>sound</b> <b>so</b> freeing and liberating". Writing in 2013, Mark Pedelty would say that [...] "Biko" [...] "stood out for its unusual instrumentation (bagpipes and synthesizer), haunting vocals, and funerary chant," [...] and credited Gabriel with doing a [...] "masterful job of creating catalytic imagery and getting out of the way". Music scholar Michael Drewett wrote that the lyrics skillfully engaged the listener by moving from a specific story to a call for action.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} recorded objections to Anselm's argument was raised by one of Anselm's contemporaries, Gaunilo of Marmoutiers. He invited his reader to conceive an island [...] "more excellent" [...] than any other island. He suggested that, according to Anselm's proof, this island must necessarily exist, as an island that exists would be more excellent. Gaunilo's criticism does not explicitly demonstrate a flaw in Anselm's argument; rather, it argues that if Anselm's argument is <b>sound,</b> <b>so</b> are many other arguments of the same logical form, which cannot be accepted. He offered a further criticism of Anselm's ontological argument, suggesting {{that the notion of}} God cannot be conceived, as Anselm had asserted. He argued that many theists would accept that God, by nature, cannot be fully comprehended. Therefore, if humans cannot fully conceive of God, the ontological argument cannot work.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} scheduled for release, August 18, 2009, but plans were changed for unknown reasons. Legacy received main production credits on the album. In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t want everybody else’s sound. We wanted our own <b>sound.</b> <b>So,</b> I {{had no choice but}} to make my own beats to get that sound." [...] In an interview with Ozone Magazine, when asked about their music and the revival of the [...] "newer west" [...] movement, Ben J stated, [...] "Everything is becoming positive out here. People are growing out of that old mentality. Rapping about gangs ain’t really what it’s about out here now. Everybody is having fun."
