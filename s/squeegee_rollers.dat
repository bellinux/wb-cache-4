50|$|Silver stain is {{a common}} problem in roller {{transporter}} processors, since the material (usually paper) is pinched between <b>squeegee</b> <b>rollers</b> to remove excess developer and brought into the fixing bath without intermediate rinse or stop. Developers for such applications usually contain an antistaining agent, usually soluble organic thiols that form soluble but non-reactive silver compounds with free silver ions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the method}} of vector analysis, the {{mathematical}} model of <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> for twist drill groove was setup. At the same time, the parameter design and simulation software for the profile curve of drill groove <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> was developed with Visual C++ Language. The simulation {{results showed that the}} mathematical model of <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> was right, and the design accuracy and efficiency of the twist drill <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> was improved greatly...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{method of}} winding carbon {{filaments}} for carbon/carbon composite structures less costly and labor-intensive, also produces more consistent results. Involves use of <b>roller</b> <b>squeegee</b> to ensure filaments continuously wet with resin during winding. Also involves control of spacing and resin contents of plies to obtain strong bonds between carbon filaments and carbon matrices. Lends itself to full automation and involves use of filaments and matrix-precursor resins in their simplest forms, thereby reducing costs...|$|R
5000|$|Squeegees on broom handles {{were used}} for street {{cleaning}} in the later nineteenth century. This {{was the case in}} London by 1873. In the early twentieth century some cities in Europe and North America used horse-drawn machinery with rotating rubber <b>squeegee</b> blades on <b>rollers</b> behind a water tank connected to sprinklers. In 1911 this was described as [...] "a German invention which has been for some years in successful operation in leading German cities". A US version of the rotating squeegee machine, known as the Kindling Squeegee or Kindling Street Washing Machine, was in use by the time of that description. It was manufactured in Milwaukee by Louis Kindling who had migrated from Germany to Wisconsin in 1873. By 1915 some streets in Paris, Washington DC, and Philadelphia were being cleaned by this kind of machine, while London still depended on men with hand brooms and squeegees. In 1919 Kindling got a US patent for a design with “new and useful Improvements in Squeegee-Rollers”, following another [...] "improvements" [...] patent for squeegee street cleaning machines filed in 1915 by the inventor Samuel Whinery (resident of East Orange, New Jersey) and published in 1916.|$|R
