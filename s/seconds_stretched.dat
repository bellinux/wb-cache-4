40|$|Introduction: Applying static stretch before sport {{activities}} {{has been}} emphasized to improve range of motion, flexibility and muscle performance {{and also to}} reduce pain and muscle stiffness. Regarding to the controversies {{about the effect of}} static stretch and the importance of the balance control to prevent injuries during sport activities, {{this study was designed to}} investigate the effect of short and long duration static stretch on the static and dynamic balance indices. Materials and Methods: 45 young healthy non-athletic females were assigned to one of the three; a) 15 <b>seconds</b> static <b>stretch,</b> b) 45 <b>seconds</b> static <b>stretch</b> and c) control groups. Three set of 15 or 45 <b>seconds</b> static <b>stretch</b> exercise were applied over the Hamstring, Quadriceps and Gastrocnemius muscles of both lower limbs of the experimental groups, while no static stretch was applied for the control group. Before and after the intervention, static and dynamic balance indices including; overall, anterior-posterior and medial-lateral balance indices, were measured in all groups by Biodex SD machine. Results: Our findings showed decreased overall, anterior-posterior and medial-lateral dynamic balance indices in the 45 <b>second</b> <b>stretch</b> group compared to the 15 <b>seconds</b> <b>stretch</b> group (P< 0. 0001) and also the control group (P= 0. 003), while no significant differences in balance indices were seen between 15 seconds and control groups. Conclusion: The results may indicate that long duration static stretch exercises may disturb the function of the dynamic balance and so may cause sport injuries in athletics. Further studies are needed to investigate the specific effect of static stretch in the different type of sport activitie...|$|R

40|$|The passive {{tension and}} {{sarcomere}} length of relaxed frog skeletal muscle fibres were measured {{in response to}} imposed length stretches. The tension response to a constant-velocity stretch exhibited a clear discontinuity. Tension rose more rapidly during the initial ∼ 0. 4 %L 0 of the stretch than during the latter stages (where L 0 is the resting length of the fibre). This initial tension response is attributed to the short-range elastic component (SREC). The use of paired triangular stretches revealed that the maximum tension produced during the SREC response of the <b>second</b> <b>stretch</b> was significantly reduced by the first stretch. This history-dependent behaviour of the SREC reflects thixotropic stiffness changes that have been previously described in relaxed muscle. The biphasic nature of the SREC tension response to movement was most apparent during the first imposed length change after a period at a fixed length, irrespective of the direction of movement. If a relaxed muscle was subjected to an imposed triangular length change so that the muscle was initially stretched and subsequently shortened back to its original fibre length, the resting tension {{at the end of}} the stretch was reduced relative to its initial pre-stretch value. Following the end of the stretch, tension slowly increased towards its initial value but the tension recovery was not accompanied by a contemporaneous increase in sarcomere length. This finding suggests that the resting tension of a relaxed muscle fibre is not entirely due to passive elasticity. The results are compatible with the suggestion that a portion of the resting tension - the filamentary resting tension (FRT) - is produced by a low level of active force generation. If a <b>second</b> identical <b>stretch</b> was imposed on the muscle at a time when the resting tension was reduced by the previous stretch, the maximal tension produced during the <b>second</b> <b>stretch</b> was the same as that produced during the first, despite the <b>second</b> <b>stretch</b> commencing from a lower initial resting tension. In experiments using paired triangular length changes, an inter-stretch interval of zero did not produce a substantially greater thixotropic reduction in the <b>second</b> <b>stretch</b> elastic limit force than an inter-stretch interval in the range 0. 5 - 1 s. A theoretical model was developed in which the SREC and FRT arise as manifestations of a small number of slowly cycling cross-bridges linking the actin and myosin filaments of a relaxed skeletal muscle. The predictions of the model are compatible with many of the experimental observations. If the SREC and FRT are indeed due to cross-bridge activity, the model suggests that the cross-bridge attachment rate must increase during interfilamentary movement. A mechanism (based on misregistration between the actin binding sites and the myosin cross-bridges) by which this might arise is presented...|$|R
