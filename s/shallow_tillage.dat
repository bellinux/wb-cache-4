50|$|The {{fields are}} {{generally}} irrigated prior to seeding to achieve ideal soil moisture, to enhance seed soil contact, {{and to avoid}} burying the seed too deeply {{as a result of}} later irrigations or rainfall. Maximum germination occurs at a seeding depth of 6 mm (1/4 in). Emerging seedlings are frost sensitive; therefore, planting should be delayed until conditions are expected to remain frost free. Seed is broadcast at 5.5 to 8.25 kg/hectare (5 to 7.5 lb/acre) in India. In Arizona trials, seeding rates of 22 to 27.5 kg/ha (20 to 25 lb/acre) resulted in stands of 1 plant/25mm (1 inch) in 15 cm (6 inch) rows produced excellent yields. Weed control is normally achieved by one or two hand weedings early in the growing season. Control of weeds by pre-plant irrigation that germinates weed seeds followed by <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> may be effective on fields with minimal weed pressure.

Nonetheless, adoption of reduced tillage by organic farmers {{has been slow}} due to concerns about nutrient supply, soil structure, and weeds that may limit yields. Here, we compiled the results from both published and unpublished research comparing deep or <b>shallow</b> inversion <b>tillage,</b> with various categories of reduced tillage under organic management. Shallow refers to less than 25  cm. We found that (1) division of reduced tillage practices into different classes {{with varying degrees of}} intensity allowed us to assess the trade-offs between reductions in tillage intensity, crop yields, weed incidence, and soil C stocks. (2) Reducing tillage intensity in organic systems reduced crop yields by an average of 7. 6  % relative to deep inversion tillage with no significant reduction in yield relative to <b>shallow</b> inversion <b>tillage.</b> (3) Among the different classes of reduced <b>tillage</b> practice, <b>shallow</b> non-inversion <b>tillage</b> resulted in non-significant reductions in yield relative to deep inversion; whereas deep non-inversion tillage resulted in the largest yield reduction, of 11. 6  %.

The trial area, covering 143 ha, was split into three blocks: winter fallow with mouldboard ploughing (Block J); <b>shallow</b> non-inversion <b>tillage</b> with a winter oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus) cover crop (Block P); and direct drilling with a winter oilseed radish cover crop (Block L). Soil, water and vegetation chemistry across the trial area were monitored over the 2012 / 13 (pre-trial), 2013 / 14 (cover crops and non-inversion tillage) and 2014 / 15 (non-inversion tillage only) farm years. Results revealed oilseed radish reduced nitrate (NO 3 ¬¬-N) leaching losses in soil water by 75 – 97 % {{relative to the}} fallow block, but had no impact upon phosphorus (P) losses. Corresponding reductions in riverine NO 3 ¬¬-N concentrations were not observed, despite the trial area covering 20 % of the catchment. Mean soil NO 3 ¬¬-N concentrations were reduced by ~ 77 % at 60 – 90 cm depth beneath the cover crop, highlighting the ability of deep rooting oilseed radish to scavenge nutrients from deep within the soil profile. Alone, direct drilling and <b>shallow</b> non-inversion <b>tillage</b> were ineffective at reducing soil water NO 3 ¬¬-N and P concentrations relative to conventional ploughing. Applying starter fertiliser to the cover crop increased radish biomass and nitrogen (N) uptake, but resulted in net N accumulation within the soil.

This type of tillage before crop sowing can {{contribute}} to a successful weed management in systems where no herbicides are used, e. g. organic farming. The population dynamics of weeds in response to stale seedbeds is, however, hardly understood, and therefore possibly not optimised. The relevance of tillage depth in relation to seedling emergence is explored with a simple, deterministic model. We systematically examined the effect of seedling emergence and subsequent weed control on weed population dynamics, starting by considering the seed bank as one soil layer, and continued by considering a depth-structured seed bank. Whether the widely used tillage regime consisting of <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage,</b> again <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage,</b> and ultimately deep tillage, is preferred above the regime we propose (i. e. deep, shallow and ultimately <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage)</b> depends on the proportion emergence specific for each soil layer, the proportion of seeds that is moved from one layer to the other, and the seed distribution in the soil. A case study based on characteristics of the population dynamics of the weed Polygonum persicaria showed that the proposed tillage regime could give reductions in weed density of up to 32 % compared to the conventional tillage regime of stale seedbeds. The tillage regime that we propose requires techniques that restrict soil compaction to fixed traffic lanes, giving large zones favourable for crop growth.

Findings are presented from the interdisciplinary study that involved documenting farmers perceptions and on-farm field experimentation. In the farmers' perceptions study, three different traditional tillage practices applied by smallholder farmers in the area were identified. These are traditional no-till (TNT), <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> (ST) and ridging tillage (RT). The impacts of various tillage practices on soil fertility improvement, reduced weed infestation, soil moisture retention and crop yield were the main factors considered by farmers when selecting a particular tillage practice to apply. In two cropping seasons (i. e. 2006 / 7 and 2007 / 8) on-farm field experimentations were carried to test the effects of the three traditional tillage practices, manure and mulching practices on soil moisture retention and crop yield. Results from this experiment showed traditional no-till fields to have the lowest soil moisture retention capacity and the lowest infiltration flow rate as well as lowest crop yield compared to other studied practices. It was observed that improving the current tillage practices by the application of manure to both ST and RT, and mulching to ST at rates affordable to smallholder farmers as identified during perception study (i. e. 5 tons/ha for manure and 3 tons/ha for mulching materials) results in increased crop yield. When the grain yield is compared between traditional no-till and <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> with manure and mulching practices, the yield increase is between 50 and 100 %.

We studied surface and subsurface losses of P from a clayey underdrained field (Jokioinen/ Kotkanoja; Vertic Cambisol/Typic Cryaquept), with 2 % mean slope, during two separate experimental periods. Primary tillage treatments of the first experimental period of three years were moldboard ploughing (to 2023 cm depth) vs. no autumn tillage (wintertime stubble). During the second experimental period of five years, the treatments were moldboard ploughing (2023 cm) vs. shallow (to 58 cm) autumn tillage. The stubble treatment of the first experimental period produced higher dissolved reactive P (DRP) losses (104259 g ha 1 yr 1) than autumn ploughing (7796 g ha 1 yr 1), and equally high particulate P (PP) losses (mean 660, 2351300 g ha 1 yr 1). During the second experimental period, <b>shallow</b> autumn <b>tillage</b> produced 28 % higher DRP losses (mean 120, 107136 g ha 1 yr 1) than ploughing (83117 g ha 1 yr 1) and 11 % higher PP losses (mean 1090, 6861336 g ha 1 yr 1) than ploughing (7831253 g ha 1 yr 1).

Soil bulk density, which is the sign of compactness and porosity in turn, depends on type of implements, soil organic carbon, tillage method and plowing depth. Plowing depth causes a lot of pulling in tractors {{and in order to}} have deep plowings, heavy-duty tractors are needed. To determine the optimum depth of moldboard plow, the bulk density and soil organic carbon of cultivated soil were investigated in this research. The experiments were conducted, using a three-bottom plow with three plowing depths and four depth of soil, in a split plot design, which lasted for three years. Main plots, consisted of three plowing methods (shallow ~= 12 cm, semi-deep ~= 22 cm and deep tillage ~= 32 cm) and subplots, consisted of four soil depths (0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30 and 30 - 40 cm). The amounts of soil density, soil organic carbon, soil water infiltration and crop yields were measured.

40|$|Early autumn {{cultivation}} of soil {{is known to}} stimulate nitrogen (N) mineralization and {{increase the risk of}} N leaching from arable land. This is due to mineralization of soil organic matter and high release of nitrate after mechanical disturbance at a time when soil temperature still allows high microbial activities. Nitrogen uptake in winter wheat is rather low, often not more than 10 - 15 kg ha⁻¹. Therefore, N mineralized due to conventional establishment of winter wheat is at risk of leaching during autumn and winter, especially if the preceding crop leaves a lot of N in the soil and in its crop residues, e. g. oilseed rape. This project studied the extent to which direct-drilling or shallow cultivation using Väderstad Carrier (5 - 7 cm) or stubble cultivation (10 - 12 cm) instead of conventional establishment after early moldboard ploughing could mitigate N mineralization during autumn, and how it affected crop establishment and yield. One-year field trials with three replicates were established at three Swedish sites in autumn 2002 and studied for three consecutive years. All four techniques for establishment of winter wheat (including direct-drilling) resulted in more soil mineral N in comparison with untreated soil. The increase after direct-drilling compared to no treatment varied between 5 - 36 kg N per hectare and was possibly explained by faster release of N from the oilseed rape residues. Two weeks after sowing, the soil profile contained on average 10, 5 and 7 kg less soil mineral N after direct-drilling than after moldboard ploughing in a light clay soil in Skåne, a light soil in Västergötland and a heavy clay soil in Uppland respectively. Shallow cultivation resulted in - 3 kg, + 11 kg and - 10 kg less mineral N per hectare compared with moldboard ploughing in Skåne, Västergötland and Uppland respectively. In Skåne, soil mineral N increased with increasing tillage depth. At the two other sites, however, there was no clear relationship between tillage intensity and soil N content. In Västergötland shallow cultivation resulted in more soil mineral N than moldboard ploughing, while in Uppland direct-drilling resulted in more soil mineral N than <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage.</b> Comparing moldboard ploughing and <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage,</b> soil mineral N during autumn after establishment of winter wheat was more dependent on the timing of tillage than tillage method.

This paper reports how non-inversion (reduced) tillage impacts energy consumption and crop yield, utilising 8 years of replicated field trials undertaken by The New Farming Systems study in the East of England. Tillage regimes include: (1) plough, (2) shallow non-inversion (typically 10 cm), and (3) deep non-inversion (20 - 25 cm) within two rotations of either (1) winter sown / spring sown crops or (2) winter sown / spring sown + autumn cover crop. Energy use per ha (highest to lowest) was: plough > deep non-inversion > shallow non-inversion. Crop specific and temporal yield responses were observed. Winter sown crops responded favourably to deep non-inversion tillage, and yields improved as the trial progressed. When considered in combination with lower energy input per hectare, energy efficiency increased relative to the plough-only control. Yield response to <b>shallow</b> non-inversion <b>tillage</b> was variable. Spring sown crops, notably spring beans, declined in yield and overall energy efficiency, in the non-inversion tillage treatments...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was instigated {{by the fact}} that during the last decade annually repeated <b>shallow</b> disk <b>tillage</b> on the same field became frequent practice in Hungary. In order to study the changes of soil condition associated with disk tillage and to assess it is consequences, long-term tillage field experiments with different levels of nutrients were set up in 1991 (A) and in 1994 (B) on Chromic Luvisol at Gödöllö. The effects of disk tillage (D) and disk tillage combined with loosening (LD) on soil condition, on yield of maize and winter wheat, and on weed infestation were examined. The evaluation of soil condition measured by cone index and bulk density indicated that use of disking annually resulted in a dense soil layer below the disking depth (diskpan-compaction). It was found, that soil condition deteriorated by diskpan-compaction decreased the yield of maize significantly by 20 and 42 % (w/w), and that of wheat by 13 and 15 % (w/w) when compared to soils with no diskpan-compaction. Averaged over seven years, and three fertilizer levels, the cover % of the total, grass and perennial weeds on loosened soils were 73, 69 and 65 % of soils contained diskpan-compaction...|$|R
40|$|Within the Mediterranean basin, soil tillage {{enhances the}} {{mineralisation}} of soil organic matter. We assessed the short-term impact of <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> [field cultivator (FC), rotary tiller (RT) and spading machine (SM) ] on some soil quality indicators [bulk density, water-stable aggregates, total and labile organic C pools (microbial biomass and extractable organic C), soil respiration and related eco-physiological indexes] in a Sicilian vineyard. Also no tillage was included. We hypothesized that (i) RT and FC worsened soil quality indicators more than SM, and (ii) {{within the same}} tillage system, labile C pools, soil respiration and eco-physiological indexes will respond more efficiently than chemical and physical soil properties since the tillage starts. The experiment started at March 2009, and each tillage type was applied three times per year (March or April, May and June), with soil tilled up to 15 -cm depth. Soil was sampled (0 – 15 and 15 – 30 -cm depth) in March 2009, April 2010, May 2012 and June 2014. SM was very effective in preserving soil organic matter pool and in improving any monitored soil quality indicator, similarly to no tillage. By contrast, RT was the most deleterious machine as it worsened most investigated indicators. Such deleterious effects were due to drastic disruption of soil aggregates and consequent exposition of protected soil organic matter to further microbial mineralization. Labile organic C pools and microbial quotients were the most responsive soil parameters for assessing the impact of <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> on soil quality, even {{in the short term}} (< 5 years) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} recompaction after primary tillage were studied in {{two types of}} experiments: (1) Plants grown in soil cores sampled in two field experiments, in plots with {{mouldboard}} ploughing and with <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage.</b> The cores were sampled before and after seedbed preparation, {{in order to obtain}} a large variation in bulk density. (2) Plants grown in field experiments, with and without recompaction in three primary tillage systems: mouldboard ploughing, chisel ploughing to 10 cm, chisel ploughing to 20 cm. The recompacted plots were trafficked twice track-by-track with a tractor, weight 4500 kg, inflation pressure 50 kPa. In the soil cores, no general relationship between yield and bulk density was found. However, the average yield was higher in cores sampled after seedbed preparation, indicating a positive effect of recompaction on yield. The yield difference was highest in cores from mouldboard ploughed plots. In the field experiment there was a large and statistically significant increase in yield in recompacted plots, regardless of primary tillage system. In non compacted plots, the bulk density was similar for the different tillage systems to a depth of 10 cm. In the layer 10 - 25 cm it was highest in the treatment which was chiseled to 10 cm. In compacted plots, {{there was no significant difference}} in bulk density between the tillage systems. The results in the field experiment indicate that the chisel plough lowers bulk density to the same degree as the mouldboard plough in the tilled layer, and that recompaction can increase yield also in <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Tillage {{involves}} great expense {{for many}} farmers today. Lowering machinery costs, fuel consumption and working hours per hectare can reduce total costs. However, {{this must be}} achieved without compromising the results of tillage. In a project {{carried out in the}} autumn of 2003, draught requirement and tillage outcomes were compared for different tillage implements during autumn sowing on a light soil and a heavy soil. The tillage implements used were mouldboard plough, shallow plough, stubble cultivator, heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares, tandem disc harrow and heavy disc harrow designed for <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage.</b> Except for the mouldboard plough, one and two passes were investigated for each implement. After primary tillage, the seedbed was prepared with a disc harrow for <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> and a roller adapted for cultivation. Seed was drilled using a combi-drill with discs for <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage.</b> For each implement the fuel consumption was measured using an adapted tractor (Massey Ferguson 6290) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed. This effect was assumed to be equal to the effect available at the wheels. The drawbar power was calculated by subtracting power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. The draught requirement was calculated by dividing the drawbar power by the actual speed, which was measured during work. The actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then weighing the cultivated soil from a specific area. On the basis of the tillage depth, the working width and the draught requirements, it was possible to calculate the specific draught (force per cross-sectional tilled area, kN/m 2). The draught per metre working width (kN/m) was also calculated and used to calculate the fuel consumption per hectare for the different systems. Some of the cultivated soil from each line was sieved into different fractions, allowing the approximate surface area of the tilled soil (m 2 /kg) and the energy requirement for fracturing (J/m 2) to be calculated. After drilling, the soil surface was photographed and the images were analysed to calculate how much of the soil surface was covered with straw from the previous crop. To make a fair comparison of draught between different tillage implements, the actual working depth must be taken into consideration. The pre-set working depth is not an adequate parameter because the different implements do not leave equally uniform tillage bases. Therefore they till different volumes of soil at a particular pre-set working depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough nearly always worked to the pre-set depth while the other implements always tilled to a shallower level than the pre-set depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough had the lowest specific draught requirement. On the light soil, the specific draught did not differ much between the other implements. On the heavy soil, however, the specific draught was highest for the stubble cultivator and the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares. The specific draught for the second pass was higher than that for the first pass for each implement because the actual working depth became very shallow. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough were least effective at fracturing the soil, while there was little difference between the other implements. However, the tandem disc harrow and the heavy disc harrow designed for <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> fractured the soil most effectively. The fracturing did not increase much after the second pass with any of the implements. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough buried the straw best, while the direct drilling treatment left most straw on the soil surface. The differences between the other implements were low. The second pass did not seem to decrease the amount of straw on the soil surface. The tillage systems with the mouldboard plough and the shallow plough consumed the most fuel. Much of the fuel used in the overall tillage process is consumed in seedbed preparation. Both the tillage systems with the plough required more seedbed preparation than the other systems {{and that was one of}} the reasons why the fuel consumption was higher. The direct drilling system required the lowest amount of fuel. Of all the cultivation systems, those with one pass with the tandem disc harrow and the heavy disc harrow for <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> consumed the least fuel. On the basis of all the parameters studied here, it is hard to identify an optimal tillage system. The choice depends on the prevailing conditions in the field in question. If there is a large amount of straw from the previous crop that is likely to cause problems, the mouldboard plough or the shallow plough are preferable because in such cases it is important to bury the straw well and this can justify the higher fuel consumption. The results of this study show that shallow ploughing (~ 11 cm) with either of the two ploughs requires a lower amount of fuel, fractures the soil better and buries the straw as well as deep ploughing (~ 20 cm). If the straw from the previous crop is not a problem, the system with the heavy disc harrow for <b>shallow</b> <b>tillage</b> or the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares is preferable since both these implements give high soil fracturing and slicing across the entire working width, killing weeds effectively...|$|E

40|$|Conservation tillage {{practices}} were tested against autumn mouldboard ploughing {{for differences in}} physical properties of soil, surface runoff, subsurface drainflow and soil erosion. The study (1991 - 2001) was performed on a gently (2 %) sloping clayey soil of southern Finland, with two replicates of the tillage treatments on 0. 5 ha plots. The annual shares of surface runoff of the total flow (surface runoff + subsurface drainflow) were 842 % for ploughing (depth 2023 cm), 3666 % for shallow autumn stubble cultivation (depth 58 cm) and 3682 % for soil left untilled over winter. Surface runoff increased with decrease in the tillage intensity, and {{in line with the}} values of depressional water storage, macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Erodibility of this gently sloping soil was at highest after autumn and spring tillage operations and decreased with time. <b>Shallow</b> autumn <b>tillage</b> produced erosion as high as mouldboard ploughing (4071700 kg ha 1 yr 1), but 48 % and 12 % lower erosion levels were measured from plots left untilled in autumn, covered by grass or barley residues, respectively. Eroded soil particles moved relatively freely to the subsurface drains, which carried 3794 % of the annual soil losses from the field. The study shows that even on the relatively flat clayey soils typical for southern Finland, tillage has a great influence on soil losses. The frequency of tillage needs to be reduced rather than the depth of tillage on clayey soils with poor water conductivity and structural stability if soil loss is to be diminished by conservation tillage. ...|$|R
40|$|Tillage modifies soil {{structure}} and crop residue distribution {{and in turn}} affects the ability of soil micro-organisms to degrade soil organic matter and release nutrients for crop growth. In organic farming, soil microbiological activity is of primary importance as nutrient supply is mainly dependent {{on the degradation of}} soil organic matter by soil micro-organisms. The aim of this work was therefore to study, in organic farming, the effects of four tillage systems [mouldboard ploughing (MP), shallow mouldboard ploughing (SMP), reduced <b>tillage</b> (RT) and <b>shallow</b> soil <b>tillage</b> (ST) ] on {{soil structure}}, soil microbial biomass (SMB) and its potential activity (Cmin) during the first year following the treatments. To study simultaneously the effects of soil structure modifications and crop residue distribution on SMB and Cmin, we adopted a sampling scheme based on a morphological description of soil profiles. We distinguished and sampled compacted and non-compacted clods (D and G clods) at three depths (0 – 5, 5 – 15 and 15 – 30 cm). This method enabled us to have a precise estimation of the effects of tillage treatments on SMB and Cmin. MP reduced compacted zones and limited unfavourable conditions for microbial growth and enabled a homogenous distribution of SMB in the soil profile. At the opposite, the ST increased compacted zones in the soil profile and limited SMB development below the top few centimetres. The SMP and the RT systems appeared as intermediate techniques. RT seemed to be a conservation tillage technique which could be used in organic farming...|$|R
