40|$|Barrier fences {{have been}} used to control animal and human depredations since ancient times. They have exerted {{considerable}} influence upon the culture of the 2 ̆ 2 protected 2 ̆ 2 areas even though protection was rarely complete. The following materials {{have been used}} in construction of fences: earth, vegetative materials, wire, electric shock, and synthetic materials. Fence designs must consider the size, strength, intelligence and/or instinct, and physical agility of the species to be repelled as well as the attraction of the crop or area for potential depredators. Against deer, the 8 -foot upright, vertical overhanging, outrigger and <b>sloping</b> <b>fences</b> are more successful than electric fences. The larger predators are difficult to control with fencing. Net wire fencing of 1 / 2 -inch mesh is needed to keep all small predators out of the poultry yard. An L-shaped poultry netting fence topped with a hot wire has been found generally successful in protecting field crops against both carnivores and rodents. Lagomorphs can be contained with fences 30 to 36 inches high, but must be buried at least 6 inches underground to prevent digging under...|$|R
50|$|Both {{banks of}} the Zhdanovka river have been {{strengthened}} with wooden walls to prevent soil erosion. A wooden wall in ruins on the left bank preserves the lower Little Petrovsky Bridge. The first section of shore protection {{was built on the}} slopes of the Tuchkova dam on the right bank. Zhdanivka Tuchkova from bridge to bridge Zhdanov in 1931-1935 years. The project engineers were G.K. Usov, I.B. Tarasenko and the architect was K. M. Dmitriev. It was a low wall on wooden stilts with a curved outline of the <b>slope,</b> <b>fenced</b> diabase paving, and cast iron fence art casting. In 1962, this segment was rebuilt with a high granite wall. The project engineer was G.S. Yakovleva, and the architect was L.A. Noskov. As a result, the channel narrowed to 48 m from its original width of 54 m. At the same time, a low wall was built around the stadium. From 1963 to 1976, the river bank was fortified with more durable materials {{in the form of a}} low granite wall with a light pile foundation and a gentle green slope. Downstream 340 m from the Little Petrovsky Bridge along the right bank, including the tip of Cape Leontief, was a reinforced concrete retaining wall, which is now virtually destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|This {{plant is}} an aggressively growing vine which can climb to heights of 10-20 feet by {{twisting}} leafstalks. The leaves are opposite and pinnately compound, trifoliate (3 leaflets) that have coarse unequal teeth on the margins. It produces small dull white flowers of 13 to 19mm or 1/4 to 1/2" [...] wide in July into September that are faintly sweetly fragrant; normally dioecious {{so that there}} are separate staminate (male) and pistillate (female) plants. The male plants are a little showier in flower and don't bear seed. The dry fruit is an achene with long hair as silvery gray feathery plumes attached in late August into November. It grows on the edges of the woods, moist <b>slopes,</b> <b>fence</b> rows, in thickets and on streambanks. It grows in full sun to light full shade and is very adaptable to many soils from sandy to clay, dry to draining wet, and acid to alkaline with pH range of 6.0 to 8.5. It has a deep but sparse, fibrous root system that makes it hard to transplant.(2.) Good for USDA hardiness zones of 3 to 8.

40|$|Habitat enhancement, {{protection}} and monitoring were {{the focus of}} the Resident Fisheries Program during 2008. Enhancement and protection included <b>sloping,</b> <b>fencing</b> and planting wetlands plugs at sites on Spring Creek (Head-waters). Many previously constructed instream structures (rock barbs and wing dams) were repaired throughout the Fort Hall Indian Reservation (Reservation). Physical sampling during 2008 included sediment and depth measurements (SADMS) in Spring Creek at the Car Removal site. SADMS, used to track changes in channel morphology and specifically track movements of silt through Bottoms stream systems were completed for 5 strata on Spring Creek. Water temperature and chemistry were monitored monthly on Spring Creek, Clear Creek, Diggie Creek, and Portneuf (Jimmy Drinks) and Blackfoot rivers. Fish population densities and biomass were sampled in five reservation streams which included nine sites. Sampling protocols were identical to methods used in past years. Numbers of fish in Spring Creek series remained relatively low, however, there was an increase of biomass overall since 1993. Salmonid fry densities were monitored near Broncho Bridge and were similar to 2006, and 2007, however, as in years past, high densities of macrophytes make it very difficult to see fry in addition to lack of field technicians. Mean catch rate by anglers on Bottoms streams stayed the same as 2007 at 1. 5 /hr. Numbers of fish larger than 18 -inches caught by anglers increased from 2007 at. 20 to. 26 /hr...|$|R

40|$|Destructive wave {{overtopping}} {{tests have}} been performed at more than 20 dike sections in the Netherlands using the Wave Overtopping Simulator to simulate the overtopping waves. The tests show the combined behaviour of turf and substrate up to mean wave overtopping discharges of 75 ?/s per m, meaning wave volumes up to 5, 500 ?/m with flow velocities up to 8 m/s. Observed failure mechanisms are (1) erosion of the grass cover on the slope, (2) erosion at transitions to a horizontal berm or at the toe, and (3) erosion related to non-water retaining structures such as a concrete staircase in the <b>slope,</b> <b>fences,</b> and poles. Based on observations during the tests, preliminary conclusions are that transitions from slope to horizontal dike sections are the most vulnerable locations for damage. The dike slope itself covered with grass on clay never failed by erosion due to a mean overtopping discharge of 10 ?/s per m or less. Obviously, non-water retaining structures such as a staircase in the slope induces significant scour holes due to the concentrated flow adjacent of the staircase. The paper deals with the failure mechanism erosion at transitions. The overtopping wave acts as a jet impacting on the horizontal section and creates a scour hole. The scour hole increases during each overtopping wave with a certain ”amount of energy” above a threshold value determined by {{the characteristics of the}} grass-clay cover. Model development is going on based on both the analogy with jet erosion and the method according to the excess of the shear stress. Additional tests will be carried out from 2012 on sea and river dikes to further develop the erosion models. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
50|$|The town of Hempstead {{grew and}} {{expanded}} around this excavation until within a radius of 3500 feet there were 2200 homes and four public schools. In 1945 the town enacted Ordinance No. 16 {{in an attempt}} to regulate mining excavations within its limits. This ordinance provided that such pits must be enclosed by a wire fence and must comply with berm and slope requirements. Goldblatt complied with this ordinance but in 1956 the town sought an injunction against further excavation as being in violation of a zoning ordinance. The town's zoning case failed because Goldblatt was found to be conducting prior non-conforming use on the premises. In 1958 the town amended Ordinance No.16 to prohibit any excavating below the water table and to require back filling of any excavation below that level. This amendment also made the berm, <b>slope</b> and <b>fence</b> requirements more stringent.|$|R

The ramped shooting board addresses this problem by introducing a <b>slope</b> to the <b>fence.</b> As the hand plane moves along the <b>fence,</b> the <b>slope</b> causes {{the part of the}} blade in contact with the board to move along the blade's length. This even exposure of wood along the whole blade allows a longer blade life, as sharpening is less frequent.|$|R
40|$|Habitat enhancement, {{protection}} and monitoring were {{the focus of}} the Resident Fisheries Program during 2001. Enhancement and protection included <b>sloping,</b> <b>fencing</b> and planting willows at sites on Diggie Creek, Clear Creek and Spring Creek. In addition, many previously constructed instream structures (rock barbs and wing dams) were repaired throughout the Fort Hall Indian Reservation (Reservation). In 2001, exclosure fences were erected on Diggie Creek (250 m barbed wire; (70 m jack), Wood Creek (500 m jack), Clear Creek (20 m jack), Ross Fork Creek (200 m jack), West Fork Creek (200 m jack)) and the Portneuf River (1 km barbed wire; 100 m jack). Jack and rail exclosure fences that had deteriorated {{over the past ten years}} were repaired at numerous areas throughout the Reservation. Physical sampling during 2001 included sediment and depth surveys (SADMS) in Big Jimmy Creek and Diggie Creek. SADMS, used to track changes in channel morphology and specifically track movements of silt through Bottoms stream systems were completed for eight and nine strata in the Big Jimmy and Diggie Creek, respectively. Baseline SADM data was collected in Diggie Creek to monitor the effects of bank sloping and revegetation on channel morphology and sediment levels through time. Water temperature was monitored (hourly) in Spring Creek, Clear Creek, Ross Fork Creek and Big Jimmy Creek. Biotic sampling included invertebrate sampling in the 200 and 300 series of Clear Creek. Fish population densities and biomass were sampled in Clear Creek 200 and 300 series. Sampling protocols were identical to methods used in past years. Numbers of fish in Clear Creek 300 series remained similar to 2000 while numbers of fish in Clear Creek 200 series dropped to near pre project levels. Salmonid fry densities were monitored near Broncho Bridge and were significantly higher than 2000.

2500|$|After his brigade {{endured a}} {{three or four}} mile double-time march in 45 minutes, Weedon {{arranged}} his troops on a reverse <b>slope</b> behind a <b>fence.</b> He swung the right flank forward behind a fence and some woods so as to take any attackers in enfilade. Henry Monckton's 2nd Grenadier Battalion blundered into Weedon's trap as dusk fell. As his men came under heavy fire, Monckton asked Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald to ride and get help. The Hessian found James Agnew who brought up his 4th Brigade on Monckton's left. One of Agnew's regiments, the 64th Foot was roughly treated, losing 47 of its 420 men in the vicious firefight that followed. The Pennsylvania State Regiment was evidently part of the thrown-forward right flank. One witness recalled the unit's colonel, [...] "Stewart on foot, in its rear, animating his men." [...] An officer in the regiment wrote that, [...] "Our regiment fought at one stand about an hour under incessant fire, and yet the loss was less than at Long Island; neither were we so near each other as at Princeton, our common distance being about 50 yards." [...] With the assistance of some artillery, the British finally forced the Americans back, but the exhausted victors did not pursue in the dark.|$|R
40|$|Santa Rosa Island {{is one of}} the Channel Islands off {{the coast}} of {{southern}} California. Before the island was heavily grazed, Santa Rosa Island is thought to have had large stands of island oak trees, Quercus tomentella, that provided a critical source of water for the ecosystem by creating a “cloud forest”. Wind-borne fog collects on the leaves, branches, and twigs of the island oaks and other native shrubs. Once the water condenses it drips, falls, and soaks into the soil. Introducing cattle and especially sheep to the island has damaged the ecosystem and nearly decimated Santa Rosa Island of its native oaks and woodland plants. The Cloud Forest Restoration project aims to restore native trees and other plants to the central high ridge. Fog panels covered in mesh have been installed in areas on the ridge to collect fog and drip water down into the soil. In my study, soil moisture data was collected at areas 5 centimeters down <b>slope</b> from fog <b>fences</b> and above wattles (coconut fiber rolls used to prevent erosion of the slope). A second set of data was collected at areas with wattles only. Soil moisture readings were taken at 5 and 10 centimeters depths. The data suggests that the soil at fog fences is moister at both depths of 5 and 10 centimeters than at areas with wattles only. In addition, the soil was moister at 10 centimeters than 5 centimeters at sites with fog fences, suggesting substantial subsurface infiltration. This has implications for future planting projects because the extra fog drip provided by the panels does seem to be a significant source of moisture for new transplants...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{improving}} traffic safety on bridges under crosswind conditions, as adverse wind conditions can {{increase the risk of}} traffic accidents. Two ways to improve traffic safety are investigated: improving vehicle stability by means of wind fences installed on the bridge deck and by modifying the design parameters of the infrastructure. Specifically, this study examines the influence of different parameters related to the bridge deck configuration on the aerodynamic coefficients acting on a bus model under crosswind conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients related to side force, lift force and rollover moment are obtained for three classes of bridge deck (box, girder and board) by numerical simulation. FLUENT was used to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier?Stokes (RANS) equations along with the shear stress transport (SST) k?? turbulence model. Two crash barriers located on the box bridge deck were replaced with an articulating wind fence model and the effect of the angle between the wind fence and the horizontal plane on the bus aerodynamic was investigated. The risk of rollover accidents was found to be slightly influenced by the bridge deck type for a yaw angle range between 75 ° and 120 °. In order to study the effect of the yaw angle on the aerodynamic coefficients acting on bus, both the bus model and the bridge model were simultaneously rotated. The minimum value of the rollover coefficient was obtained for an angle of 60 ° between the wind <b>fence</b> <b>slope</b> and the horizontal plane. The only geometry parameter of the box bridge deck which significantly affects bus aerodynamics is the box height. The present research highlights the usefulness of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for improving traffic safety, studying the performance of the articulating wind fence, and determining which geometry parameters of the box deck have a significant influence on the bus stability.
