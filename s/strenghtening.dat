40|$|We {{quantify}} the competitive effects of removing vertical restraints, {{based on the}} recent proposals to liberalize the selective and exclusive distribution system in the European car market.

We then perform several policy experiments: the creation of international intrabrand competition (cross-border trade) and a possible <b>strenghtening</b> of national intrabrand competition. Our approach may also be useful to assess the competitive effects of vertical restraints in other applications. Distribution; Market; Effects; Proposals; Oligopoly; Applications;...|$|E

We use these ultrafilters in a topological application: a coherent P-ultrafilter on an algebra B is an untouchable point in the Stone space of B, witnessing its nonhomogeneity. Comment: 9 page...|$|E
