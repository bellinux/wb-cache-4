5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a third-person perspective, and the player can freely move in three-dimensional space and rotate the camera in any direction. The top left corner of the <b>screen</b> <b>interface</b> shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera will shift to first-person mode to assist in aiming.|$|E
25|$|Registers will {{typically}} {{feature a}} numerical pad, QWERTY or custom keyboard, touch <b>screen</b> <b>interface,</b> {{or a combination}} of these input methods for the cashier to enter products and fees by hand and access information necessary to complete the sale. For older registers as well as at restaurants and other establishments that do not sell barcoded items, the manual input may be the only method of interacting with the register. While customization was previously limited to larger chains that could afford to have physical keyboards custom-built for their needs, the customization of register inputs is now more widespread with the use of touch screens that can display a variety of point of sale software.|$|E

500|$|Decades {{received}} better reviews than On Tour, with reviewers {{noting that}} the game, released {{only a short time}} after the original On Tour, felt more like an expansion pack than a new title. [...] Critics noted that there was no change in the hardware design and the gameplay mechanics, such that the same issues with hand-cramping and the inability to keep the DS steady while playing still persisted in Decades. [...] Reviewers did praise the compatibility with the previous On Tour title, the improved touch <b>screen</b> <b>interface,</b> and the ability to play competitively with other users regardless of which version of the game they possessed.|$|E
500|$|Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition for Wii U {{received}} a mixed reception. GameRankings provided {{a score of}} 85%, and Metacritic provided a score of 85/100. Eurogamer's Richard Leadbetter was critical of technical performance including issues with visual quality and inconsistent framerate. EGMs Ray Carsillo said that the optional B.A.T. system made certain battles too easy. Carsillo also {{said it was the}} [...] "clearly inferior version" [...] of the game due to glitches and [...] "tacked on gimmicks". Nintendo World Report's Patrick Barnett wrote that certain uses of the Wii U controller made it [...] "the best way to experience Arkham City", but that some new features were a [...] "nuisance". Barnett added that it was [...] "on par, if not better, visually", than its counterparts. Joystiq's JC Fletcher opined that the persistent map screen and touch <b>screen</b> <b>interface</b> were appreciated, and complimented the use of augmented reality to explore crime scenes. Game Revolution's Blake Peterson praised the real-time management of information, upgrades and equipment that he considered made Batman more vulnerable, although Barnett included this as a point of criticism.|$|E

40|$|Despite growing {{awareness}} of the accessibility issues surrounding touch screen use by blind people, designers still face challenges when creating accessible touch <b>screen</b> <b>interfaces.</b> One major stumbling block {{is a lack of}} understanding about how blind people actually use touch screens. We conducted two user studies that compared how blind people and sighted people use touch screen gestures. First, we conducted a gesture elicitation study in which 10 blind and 10 sighted people invented gestures to perform common computing tasks on a tablet PC. We found that blind people have different gesture preferences than sighted people, including preferences for edge-based gestures and gestures that involve tapping virtual keys on a keyboard. Second, we conducted a performance study in which the same participants performed a set of reference gestures. We found significant differences in the speed, size, and shape of gestures performed by blind people versus those performed by sighted people. Our results suggest new design guidelines for accessible touch <b>screen</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Author Keywords: Accessibility, blind, touch screens, gestures, gesture recognition...|$|R
