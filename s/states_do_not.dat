5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and ratify the Environmental Modification Convention. Many <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.|$|E
5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E

50|$|The non-recognition of {{particular}} acts of a <b>state</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> normally effect {{the recognition of}} the state itself. For example, the international rejection of the occupation {{of particular}} territory by a recognised <b>state</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> imply non-recognition of the state itself, nor a rejection of a change of government by illegal means.|$|R
25|$|Typically, most <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{require that}} {{physicians}} administer the drugs for lethal injection, but many states do require that physicians be present to pronounce or certify death.|$|E
25|$|Relations are {{generally}} tense {{and the two}} <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have diplomatic relations. Like other Arab states, Bahrain does not recognize Israel. A brief period of warming in relations occurred in the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the Many-minds Interpretation {{does not}} solve the mindless hulks problem as a problem of supervenience. Mental <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> supervene on brain states as a given brain state is {{compatible}} with different configurations of mental states.|$|E

25|$|Switzerland {{represents}} United States {{interests in}} Iran, as Iran and the United <b>States</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> presently have diplomatic relations. US State Department spokesman Robert Wood {{raised questions about}} the transparency of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Court judicial system, commenting that a Swiss representative was not allowed in the courtroom during Saberi's trial.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the other}} New England <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have {{legislation}} regulating {{the color of}} lights on emergency vehicles. They only generalize red and blue lights as being restricted to emergency vehicles. However, most police, fire, and ambulance services in these other New England states voluntarily follow the same scheme as Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|Minor {{parties and}} Independents flourish. Rules which {{eliminate}} smaller parties from {{the ballot in}} most <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> exist in Vermont. As a result, voters often have extensive choices for general elections. Among others, this more open policy enabled independents like Bernie Sanders to win election as mayor of Burlington, U.S. Congressman and U.S. Senator.|$|E
25|$|Banks in the United <b>States</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> use IBAN as account {{numbers for}} U.S. accounts. Any {{adoption}} of the IBAN standard by U.S. banks would likely be initiated by ANSI ASC X9, the U.S. financial services standards development organization: a working group (WGAB20) was established as an X9 subcommittee to generate an IBAN construction for U.S. bank accounts.|$|E
25|$|The {{legality}} of polygamy varies widely around the world. Polygamy is legal in 58 out of nearly 200 sovereign states, {{the vast majority}} of them being Muslim-majority countries situated in Africa and Asia. In most of these states, polygyny is allowed and legally sanctioned. Polyandry is illegal in virtually every state in the world. The rest of the sovereign <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> recognize polygamous marriages.|$|E

25|$|The CCJ {{is based}} in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The {{majority}} of member states however, continue to utilize the Privy Council as their final appellate court and three member <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> use the CCJ for either its original jurisdiction or its appellate jurisdiction because they have either not signed the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (the Bahamas and Haiti) or are a current British colony (Montserrat).|$|E
25|$|Epiphenomenalism {{is a form}} of Property Dualism, {{in which}} it is {{asserted}} that one or more mental <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have any influence on physical states (both ontologically and causally irreducible). It asserts that while material causes give rise to , volitions, ideas, etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further: they are causal dead-ends. This can be contrasted to interactionism, on the other hand, in which mental causes can produce material effects, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|A profile HMM {{takes this}} {{modelling}} of sequence alignments further by modelling insertions and deletions, using I and D states, respectively. D <b>states</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> emit a residue, while I states do emit a residue. Multiple I states can occur consecutively, corresponding to multiple residues between consensus columns in an alignment. M, I and D states are connected by state transition probabilities, which also vary by {{position in the}} sequence alignment, to reflect the different frequencies of insertions and deletions across sequence alignments.|$|E
