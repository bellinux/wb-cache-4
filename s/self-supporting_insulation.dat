40|$|Cryogenic {{propellants}} such as {{liquid hydrogen}} (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LO 2) {{are a part}} of NASA's future space exploration due to the high specific impulse that can be achieved using engines suitable for moving 10 's to 100 's of metric tons of payload mass to destinations outside of low earth orbit. However, the low storage temperatures of LH 2 and LO 2 cause substantial boil-off losses for missions with durations greater than several days. The losses can be greatly reduced by incorporating high performance cryocooler technology to intercept heat load to the propellant tanks and by the integration of self-supporting multi-layer insulation. The active thermal control technology under development is the integration of the reverse turbo- Brayton cycle cryocooler to the propellant tank through a distributed cooling network of tubes coupled to a shield in the tank insulation and to the tank wall itself. Also, the <b>self-supporting</b> <b>insulation</b> technology was utilized under the shield to obtain needed tank applied LH 2 performance. These elements were recently tested at NASA Glenn Research Center in a series of three tests, two that reduced LH 2 boil-off and one to eliminate LO 2 boil-off. This test series was conducted in a vacuum chamber that replicated the vacuum of space and the temperatures of low Earth orbit. The test results show that LH 2 boil-off was reduced 60 % by the cryocooler system operating at 90 K and that robust LO 2 zero boil-off storage, including full tank pressure control was achieved...|$|E
40|$|During {{recent years}} pre-fabricated {{lightweight}} elements, here used as 3 D room modules, have become popular. There {{has also been}} an increased interest to place the fire protection outside of the room, {{in order to keep}} the production process simpler. Therefore, the only way to check the fire resistance is by using performance-based design. The combination of these two constrains creates the background for this work. A case study has been performed for lightweight 3 D room modules constructed of steel cassettes, which are externally insulated. The modules will serve as student accommodations and have been analysed with respect to temperature development and bearing resistance. Following are the research questions raised at the beginning: 1. How does external insulation affect the fire- and steel temperature in the room and is it necessary to take this into account? 2. What is the modulesâ€™ resistance at elevated temperatures and how realistic can 3 D effects be predicted by calculation? 3. Can the connections between wall and roof for self-supporting steel cassettes, be considered satisfactory at elevated temperature? 4. How well does simple calculation methods compare to advanced computer programs for these types of <b>self-supporting</b> lightweight modules?Externally <b>insulation</b> of steel modules contributes to higher gas temperature in the room and therefore higher steel temperatures, which should be considered in performance-based design. Influence of a low degree of utilization on the bearing resistance, will be investigated by using two different types of methods for structural resistance (a simpler method and an advance method). The standard fire curve ISO- 834 and other fire scenarios are used to predict temperature development in the room. Validerat; 20140808 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
