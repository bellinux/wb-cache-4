Control over the soluble signals that cells encounter in their local environment is a common theme in natural tissue formation, and also an emerging theme in functional tissue engineering strategies. This concept is particularly important in stem cell-based applications, in which local soluble signals can dictate cell fate decisions. Therefore, there is significant interest in using bioengineering approaches to control soluble signaling in the stem cell microenvironment. Nature often achieves intricate control over local soluble signaling via specific, non-covalent interactions. Inspired by these natural interactions, {{we are interested in}} creating biomaterials that actively regulate soluble signaling. For example, our recent studies have used engineered protein-peptide and protein-mineral interactions to build new classes of materials that are bio-responsive and capable of regulating growth factor signaling. This talk will specifically highlight bio-inspired protein conformational <b>shifts</b> and <b>engineered</b> growth factor sequestering as mechanisms to regulate stem cell behavior upon and within biomaterials...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we discuss}} how for self-adaptive systems some {{activities}} that traditionally occur at development-time are moved to run-time. Responsibilities for these activities <b>shift</b> from software <b>engineers</b> {{to the system}} itself, causing the traditional boundary between development-time and run-time to blur. As a consequence, we argue how the traditional software engineering process needs to be reconceptualized to distinguish both development-time and run-time activities, and to support designers in taking decisions on how to properly engineer such systems. Furthermore, we identify a number of challenges related to this required reconceptualization, and we propose initial ideas based on process modeling. We use the Software and Systems Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM) to specify which activities {{are meant to be}} performed off-line and on-line, and also the dependencies between them. The proposed models should capture information about {{the costs and benefits of}} shifting activities to run-time, since such models should support software engineers in their decisions when they are engineering self-adaptive systems...|$|R

Their complexities require a more effective approach to fire safety. A new way of thinking is essential. It should enable us to use the wisdom of past experience and state-of-the-art knowledge in foreseeing fire hazard interactions. The analysis present in this paper focus on the difficulties that transmission sector (i. e. transmission lines and substation) in Brazil has in tackling fire protection.

40|$|Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) Concrete {{has long}} {{been used in the}} {{construction}} industry as a primary material owing to its versatility, superior performance, low cost, easy workability and availability of accepted standards of practice. The readily available raw materials for the manufacture of cement, and subsequently for concrete itself, have been a driving force for the acceptance of concrete as a construction material worldwide. Recently however, OPC concrete has come under scrutiny over its large carbon footprint. This is largely due to the energy intensive manufacturing process of cement and the extensive use of virgin material in cement production. Focus is therefore <b>shifting</b> to <b>engineer</b> new construction materials that offer similar advantages to that of OPC concrete while being environmentally friendly. Geopolymer Concrete (GPC) is such a material. It has emerged during the last decades, and has been found to possess excellent engineering properties as well as enormous benefits on the sustainability front. The current study is conducted to investigate the compressive strength of GPC up to temperatures of 1000 °C for varying duration of exposure time. It was found that when tested at temperatures of 600 °C, 800 °C and 1000 °C, the GPC samples exhibited a higher compressive strength (8 - 18 %). However, the samples tested after cooling recorded a residual compressive strength 25 - 50 % lower than the ambient strength. Yet, the residual strength of GPC is significantly higher than that of OPC. The duration of exposure time was found to have an insignificant effect on the strength properties of GPC, especially at higher temperatures. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to reveal the changes to the micro-structure that took place after exposure to high temperatures and to get a useful insight into the behaviour of geopolymers...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{urbanization}} {{and climate}} change are influential in changing precipitation patterns and hydrological flow resulting in event driven urban flooding. The approach to flood protection has recently <b>shifted</b> from <b>engineered</b> and technical solutions to more sustainable and integrated solutions, by considering social, ecological and physical implications and exploring sustainable urban drainage options. Attenuation of peak stormwater flow using natural wetlands {{is one of many}} sustainable urban drainage methods used to reduce flooding and is an approach of interest for this research. The study site is located within the small, urbanized river system of the Liesbeek River in Cape Town, South Africa, which is prone to localized flooding during annual winter rainfall events. The study measures the attenuation capacity of a small-scale wetland adjacent to an urban river using a 2 D PCSWMM hydrodynamic model. Research is focused on illustrating the attenuation capacity of this wetland. The model ran historic flow data to determine the attenuation capacity and to measure peak flow reduction. While the reduction is not sufficient to reduce damaging floods, the findings provide new knowledge and understanding of the attenuation capacity of this wetland and motivation for expanding sustainable urban drainage within the catchment. The study aims to build a baseline dataset for the research site with the data available at present. Peak flow of the Liesbeek River was reduced in scenarios with the Valkenberg Wetland present to accept on a portion of this flow. Attenuation was most effective for rainfall events with sudden spikes in peak flow, where a 42 per cent reduction of peak flow was observed. For a scenario with lower flow rates yet a prolonged peak flow rate, the wetland was less effective, with a 20 per cent reduction observed. This wetland was found to have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services to the area by attenuating peak flow and thus reducing the occurrence of property damaging flooding downstream...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} 25 years wetland {{scientists}} have been striving to develop scientifically defensible wetland assessment methods that are robust, easily applied, affordable, and provide sufficient discrimination to guide management or regulatory decision making. While each generation of methods attempts to build upon the concepts and techniques developed in the previous generation, the fundamental goal remains to evaluate wetland(s) relative to a gradient of condition ranging from natural and undisturbed to extremely perturbed or altered. The progression from one method to the next is a natural and healthy indication that wetland science continues to advance and society learns. However, each generational transition is often accompanied by discourse {{about the benefits of}} various methods/approaches and the need or desirability to alter the assessment approach. Such was the case when the Corps of <b>Engineers</b> <b>shifted</b> from the Wetland Evaluation Technique (WET) to the Hydrogeomorphic Assessment Method (HGM).

Finally, the social construction of fire safety knowledge is discussed, raising questions about whether the confidence in the application of this knowledge by the full range of participants in the fire safety design and approvals process is always justified, given the specific assumptions involved in both the production of the knowledge and its extension to applications significantly removed from the original knowledge production; and the requisite competence that is therefore needed to apply this knowledge. The overarching objective is to argue that the fire safety professions ought to be more reflexive and informed {{about the nature of the}} knowledge and expertise that they develop and apply, and to suggest that fire safety scientists and engineers ought to actively collaborate with social scientists in research designed to study the way people interact with fire safety technology...|$|R
40|$|Agroforestry in the Western Ghats (WG) of peninsular India and satoyama {{in rural}} Japan are {{traditional}} land-use systems with similar evolutionary trajectories. Some of their relevance was lost {{by the middle}} of the twentieth century, when modern agricultural technologies and urbanisation <b>engineered</b> <b>shifts</b> in emphasis towards maximising crop production. There has been, however, a resurgence of interest in traditional land-use systems recently, in view of their ability to provide ecosystem services. Both agroforestry and satoyama are thought to be harbingers of biological diversity and have the potential to serve as “carbon forests. ” Carbon (C) stock estimates of the sampled homegardens in WG ranged from 16 to 36 Mg ha− 1. Satoyama woodlands owing to variations in tree stocking and management conditions indicated widely varying C stocks (2 – 279 Mg ha− 1). Agroforestry and satoyama also differ in nature, complexity, and objectives. While agroforestry involves key productive and protective functions, and adopts ‘intensive management’, the satoyama woodlands are extensively managed; understorey production is seldom a consideration. Differences in canopy architecture (multi-tiered structure of agroforestry vs. the more or less unitary canopy of satoayama) and land ownership pattern (privately owned/managed agroforestry holdings vs. community or local government or privately owned and mostly abandoned satoyamas) pose other challenges in the transfer and application of knowledge gained in one system to the other. Nonetheless, lessons learnt from satoyama conservation may be suitable for common pool resource management elsewhere in Asia, and aspects relating to understorey production in agroforestry may be relevant for satoyama under certain scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The author {{intends to}} prove that {{economic}} policy in Germany after 1979 was opposed to that recommended by Kalecki in his famous 'Three ways to Full Employment' and {{was responsible for the}} surge in unemployment. Part I of the paper sketches the theoretical background of Kalecki's recommendations. Special attention is devoted to private investment, budget deficit and trade balance as factors determining (but not being determined by) private savings. A related topic is the change of the degree of capacity utilization and of labour force. Part II is devoted to an empirical investigation of Germany in 1960 - 96. The author comes to the conclusion that two factors were mainly responsible for the slowdown of GDP growth after 1979 first, the weak expansion of private investment, caused - at least to some degree - by the restrictive monetary policy of the Bundesbank and, second, the increase in the private propensity to save, related to an <b>engineered</b> <b>shift</b> in the distribution of income from wages to profits. The increase of the trade surplus in the 1980 s and then in the 1990 s could not prevent the slowing down of GDP growth and the increase of unemployment provoked by these two factors. In the USA, in contrast, the stagnation of private investment in 1980 - 91 was counterbalanced by a decrease of the private propensity to save and by an increase of the budget deficit.
