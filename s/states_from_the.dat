5|$|Although the Poitevin was not {{the only}} breed of horse used for the {{production}} of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They were in high demand in the United <b>States</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the Deux-Sèvres region, especially in the district of Melle, near Luçon and Saint-Maixent, mule breeding began to be concentrated in ateliers (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the cities}} {{that have been}} {{proposed}} to house {{the headquarters of the}} United Nations are Saint Petersburg, Montreal, Dubai, Jerusalem, and Nairobi.

They also state that the proposals have never gone from being mere declarations.|$|E

5|$|Because Republicans {{controlled}} neither {{house of}} Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge {{did not believe}} Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession.

5|$|The {{breakup of}} Yugoslavia began in 1992, the territories {{consisting}} of Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo composed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

5|$|Another {{development}} {{that lead to}} the shift to modern globalization was the development of a more politicized system. Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger <b>states</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava. The settlement of these individuals made it easier for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy. The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of globalization. The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.|$|E

5|$|As in the 2005 season, {{the team}} {{predicted}} it was highly probable {{that at least}} one major hurricane would directly impact the United States. The forecast suggested an 81%probability {{that at least one}} major hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland, a 64%chance of at least one major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States (including the Florida peninsula), and a 47%chance of at least one major hurricane striking the Gulf Coast of the United <b>States</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Florida Panhandle westward. The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average. A few months later, on April 4, 2006, CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, the British {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} princely states more closely with British India, in 1921 creating the Chamber of Princes as a consultative and advisory body, and in 1936 transferring {{the responsibility for the}} supervision of smaller <b>states</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> provinces to the centre and creating direct relations between the Government of India and the larger princely states, superseding political agents. A more ambitious aim was a scheme of federation contained in the Government of India Act 1935, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government. This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 {{as a result of the}} outbreak of the Second World War. As a result, in the 1940s the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and by the various treaties between the British crown and the states.|$|E
5|$|In 1177, Saladin led a {{force of}} some 26,000 soldiers, {{according}} to Crusader chronicler William of Tyre, into southern Palestine after hearing {{that most of the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem's soldiers were besieging Harim north of Aleppo. Suddenly attacked by the Templars under Baldwin IV of Jerusalem near Ramla, the Ayyubid army was defeated at the Battle of Montgisard, with the majority of its troops killed. Saladin encamped at Homs the following year and a number of skirmishes between his forces, commanded by Farrukh Shah, and the Crusaders occurred. Undeterred, Saladin invaded the Crusader <b>states</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west and defeated Baldwin at the Battle of Marj Ayyun in 1179. The following year, he destroyed the newly built Crusader castle of Chastellet at the Battle of Jacob's Ford. In the campaign of 1182, he sparred with Baldwin again in the inconclusive Battle of Belvoir Castle in Kawkab al-Hawa. The Ayyubid na'ib (deputy governor) of Yemen, Uthman al-Zandjili, conquered the greater part of Hadramaut in 1180, upon Turan-Shah's return to Yemen.|$|E

5|$|Many of the wettest {{tropical}} cyclones in the United States {{have moved}} into the contiguous United <b>States</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean.

Intermediate amounts have been measured across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the breeding grounds of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|NWA/WCW United States Tag Team Championship reigns were {{determined}} by professional wrestling matches, in which competitors are involved in scripted rivalries. These narratives create feuds between the various competitors, which cast them as villains and heroes. Overall, there were 19 reigns among 15 tag teams, all of which occurred in the United <b>States.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> information known, The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane)'s first reign was the longest in the title's history at 346 days, while The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers)' second reign was the shortest, at 19 days. The Midnight Express also held the most reigns overall as a tag team and individually, with three.|$|E
5|$|Players {{choose an}} 18th-century faction {{and set out}} to achieve {{domination}} over the known world through military force, diplomacy, espionage and economics. The interface and play are similar to earlier Total War titles: although the campaign element of the game is turn-based, players can direct battles in real-time. Empire: Total War is the first game in the series to allow naval battles to be conducted in real-time. In addition to the standard campaign mode, a special campaign follows the development of the United <b>States</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> settlement of Jamestown to the American War of Independence. Players may also recreate several historical battles from the early modern era, such as the Battle of Fontenoy, Battle of Rossbach, Battle of Brandywine Creek and Battle of Lagos.|$|E
