5|$|Although Parker {{had promised}} to hold auditions for {{students}} attending the Performing Arts, the school was initially advised by the Board of Education to prevent the students from working on the film, fearing it would affect their studies.

Parker distributed casting call advertisements at the Performing Arts school and the High School of Music & Art.|$|E
5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why attacks are more common in <b>summer,</b> <b>when</b> more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic <b>summer</b> <b>when</b> {{phytoplankton}} bloom was apparent, {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases were trapped in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{women wear}} bikinis when they {{vacation}} abroad or in Goa without the family. Despite the conservative ideas prevalent in India, bikinis {{have become more}} popular. In <b>summer,</b> <b>when</b> women take up swimming, often in a public space, a lot of tankinis, shorts and single-piece swimsuits are sold. The maximum sales for bikinis happen in the winter, the honeymoon season.|$|E
5|$|Urban heat islands {{increase}} {{demand for}} energy consumption during the <b>summer</b> <b>when</b> temperatures rise.

5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South West England, Frome has a {{temperate}} climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10°C (50°F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in <b>summer,</b> <b>when</b> the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.|$|E

5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith.

To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female {{as a prelude to}} mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (spring and early <b>summer),</b> <b>when</b> both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and <b>summer,</b> <b>when</b> the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E

5|$|Sea Mither, or Mither of the Sea, is {{a mythical}} being of Orcadian {{folklore}} {{that lives in}} the sea during <b>summer,</b> <b>when</b> she confines the demonic nuckelavee to the ocean depths.

Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to the depths of the ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late <b>summer,</b> <b>when</b> wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|Stallions must be {{registered}} New Foresters, {{and are not}} allowed to run free all year round on the Forest. They normally are turned out only for a limited period in the spring and <b>summer,</b> <b>when</b> they gather several groups of mares and youngstock into larger herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back) in the following year.|$|E
