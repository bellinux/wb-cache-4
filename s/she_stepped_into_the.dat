60|$|So saying, <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> lightly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{snow and}} advanced, while her {{companion}} {{stood looking at}} her with a half-amused, half-anxious smile.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carriage, and {{the soft}} folds of her gown spread {{themselves}} out over the cushions. She drew them on one side {{to make room for}} him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkened room, {{and closed}} the door behind her. Domiloff, who was looking white and scared, turned the key in the lock and faced her nervously.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} slight variations. Sometimes the {{assistant}} carries {{a string of}} inflated balloons when he or <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cabinet.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{taximeter}} {{and drove}} away, with a farewell nod, abrupt although not altogether unkindly. Yet {{as she looked}} behind, a few seconds later, her face was very much softer--her eyes were almost regretful.|$|E

[...] (Palmano also directed the videos [...] "Silent All These Years," [...] "Winter," [...] "China" [...] and [...] "Pretty Good Year," [...] this last one from Amos' second album, Under the Pink.) ...|$|R
