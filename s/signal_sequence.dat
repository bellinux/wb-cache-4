5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The {{precursor}} to tomato systemin is transcribed as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a <b>signal</b> <b>sequence.</b> In tomato, mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E
5|$|The ER is {{involved}} in cotranslational sorting of proteins. A polypeptide which contains an ER <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> is recognised by a signal recognition protein which halts {{the production of the}} protein. the SRP transports the polypeptide to the ER membrane where its released in through a membrane pore and translation resumes.|$|E
5|$|The processive {{polyadenylation}} {{complex in}} the nucleus of eukaryotes works on products of RNA polymerase II, such as precursor mRNA. Here, a multi-protein complex (see components on the right) cleaves the 3'-most part of a newly produced RNA and polyadenylates the end produced by this cleavage. The cleavage is catalysed by the enzyme CPSF and occurs 10–30 nucleotides downstream of its binding site. This site often has the polyadenylation <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> AAUAAA on the RNA, but variants of it that bind more weakly to CPSF exist. Two other proteins add specificity to the binding to an RNA: CstF and CFI. CstF binds to a GU-rich region further downstream of CPSF's site. CFI recognises a third site on the RNA (a set of UGUAA sequences in mammals) and can recruit CPSF even if the AAUAAA sequence is missing. The polyadenylation signal– the sequence motif recognised by the RNA cleavage complex– varies between groups of eukaryotes. Most human polyadenylation sites contain the AAUAAA sequence, but this sequence is less common in plants and fungi.|$|E

The pre-mRNA is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines (A) are added to form poly(A) tail, which protects the RNA from degradation. Poly(A) tail is bound by multiple poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP) necessary for mRNA export and translation re-initiation.|$|E
25|$|SHH {{undergoes}} {{a series of}} processing steps before it is secreted from the cell. Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45kDa and {{is referred to as}} the preproprotein. As a secreted protein it contains a short <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the signal recognition particle during the translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first step in protein secretion. Once translocation is complete, the <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> is removed by signal peptidase in the ER. There SHH {{undergoes a}}utoprocessing to generate a 20kDa N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a 25kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role. The cleavage is catalysed by a protease within the C-terminal domain. During the reaction, a cholesterol molecule is added to the N-terminus of SHH-N. Thus the C-terminal domain acts as an intein and a cholesterol transferase. Another hydrophobic moiety, a palmitate, is added to the alpha-amine of N-terminal cysteine of SHH-N. This modification is required for efficient signaling, resulting in a 30-fold increase in potency over the non-palmitylated form, and is carried out by a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family, Protein-cysteine N-palmitoyltransferase, HHAT.|$|E

40|$|Selected mapping (SLM) is a {{well-known}} peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Recently, a low-complexity SLM scheme, called Class-III SLM scheme, was proposed, which performs only one inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to generate alternative OFDM <b>signal</b> <b>sequences.</b> By randomly selecting the cyclic shift and rotation values, Class-III SLM scheme can generate up to N- 3 alternative OFDM <b>signal</b> <b>sequences,</b> where N is the IFFT size. However, all N- 3 alternative OFDM <b>signal</b> <b>sequences</b> do not achieve good PAPR reduction performances. Therefore, an efficient selection method of good rotation and cyclic shift values is needed, which results in good PAPR reduction performance. In this letter, a selection method of cyclic shift values is proposed, which is optimal in terms of minimizing the variance of correlation values between alternative OFDM <b>signal</b> <b>sequences.</b> It is also shown that rotation values are useless when U ?= N/ 8, where U {{is the number of}} alternative OFDM <b>signal</b> <b>sequences.</b> Also, a selection method of proper rotation values when U ?

25|$|Secretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, {{are moved}} across the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a <b>signal</b> <b>sequence.</b> The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.|$|E
25|$|Ricin is {{synthesized}} in the endosperm of {{castor oil}} plant seeds. The ricin precursor protein is 576 amino acid residues {{in length and}} contains a signal peptide (residues 1–35), the ricin A chain (36–302), a linker peptide (303–314), and the ricin B chain (315–576). The N-terminal <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> delivers the prepropolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then the signal peptide is cleaved off. Within the lumen of the ER the propolypeptide is glycosylated and a protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes disulfide bond formation between cysteines 294 and 318. The propolypeptide is further glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus and transported to protein storage bodies. The propolypeptide is cleaved within protein bodies by an endopeptidase to produce the mature ricin protein that is composed of a 267 residue A chain and a 262 residue B chain that are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond.|$|E

Only O-glycosylation sites are found on glycoprotein B and these are linked via serine or threonine. Residues 80-100 of glycophorin A and 51-71 of glycophorin B are very similar. The intervening residues in contrast differ significantly. The antigenic determinant for the blood group Ss is located at residue 29 where S has a methionine and s a threonine. This is due to a mutation at nucleotide 143 (C->T). The S antigen is also known as MSN3 and the s antigen as MNS4.|$|E

25|$|Mutations {{that cause}} Werner {{syndrome}} only {{occur at the}} regions of the gene that encode for protein and not at non-coding regions. These mutations can {{have a range of}} effects. They may decrease the stability of the transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA), which increases the rate at which they are degraded. With fewer mRNA, fewer are available to be translated into the WRNp protein. Mutations may also lead to the truncation (shortening) of the WRNp protein, leading to the loss of its nuclear localization <b>signal</b> <b>sequence,</b> which would normally transport it to the nucleus where it can interact with the DNA. This leads to a reduction in DNA repair. Furthermore, mutated proteins {{are more likely to be}} degraded than normal WRNp. Apart from causing defects in DNA repair, its aberrant association with p53 down-regulates the function of p53, leading to a reduction in p53-dependent apoptosis and increase the survival of these dysfunctional cells.|$|E
25|$|Milstein's {{early work}} on {{antibodies}} {{focused on the}} nature of their diversity at the amino acid level {{as well as on the}} disulphide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a <b>signal</b> <b>sequence.</b> The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E
40|$|Rearrangement of gene {{segments}} {{to generate}} antigen receptor coding regions {{depends on the}} RAG 1 / 2 recombinase, which assembles a synaptic complex between two DNA <b>signal</b> <b>sequences</b> and then cleaves the DNA directly adjacent to the paired signals.

A mammalian joining apparatus consisting of purified Ku 70 / 86, XRCC 4, and DNA ligase IV proteins was sufficient to join deproteinized cleaved ends, but retention of <b>signal</b> <b>sequences</b> within the <b>signal</b> end complex blocked access to the DNA ends and prevented their joining by these proteins.

40|$|Ig {{variable}} region {{genes are}} assembled from separate germline DNA gene segments {{during the early}} stages of pre-B lymphocyte development. The Ig heavy chain (H) variable region gene is first assembled from three (VH, D, and JH) gene segments. Subsequently, the Ig light chain gene (L) is assembled from two (VL and JL) gene segments. The site-specific recombination machinery (VDJ recombinase) that performs these joining events is apparently targeted by conserved <b>signal</b> <b>sequences</b> that flank all variable gene segments (see references 1, 2 for a review). VDJ recombinase mediated rearrangements have been proposed to occur by a nonreciprocal mechanism in which the coding and <b>signal</b> <b>sequences</b> are differentially processed.
