For the data taking in 2006, the COMPASS RICH has been upgraded in the central photon detection area (25 % of the surface) with a new technology to detect Cherenkov photons at very high count rates of several 106 s− 1 per channel and a new dead-time free read-out system, which allows trigger rates up to 100 kHz.

Lens telescopes of fused silica lenses have been designed and built to focus the Cherenkov photons onto the individual photomultipliers. The read-out electronics of the PMTs {{is based on the}} MAD 4 amplifier-discriminator chip and the dead-time free high resolution F 1 -TDC.

Accelerometers placed directly on the bearing plates at the ends of tendons recorded high-intensity waveforms. Accelerometers placed elsewhere on concrete surfaces of the containment model revealed substantial attenuation and reduced intensities of captured waveforms. Locations of wire breaks could be determined accurately through measurement of differences in arrival times of the signal at the sensors.

Between September 2003 and May 2004, 382 organisms were captured using gill and atarraya nets. Eight samples were developed every month a long this study. Standard length in centimeters (Le), total weight in grams (Pt), scale length in centimeters (Lesc) and growth rings were determined. The size and weight ranged from 38 to 232 mm (Le) and 8. 7 to 311. 9 g (Pt), respectively. The growth rings analyses reveal four age groups, being the second group the most representative with 34. 3 % of the total sampled. The <b>scale</b> <b>ring</b> analyses showed two growth rings, one develops between November-January and the other between April-May, in good correlation with low temperature and gonad development, respectively.

40|$|We {{propose to}} use the self-seeding scheme with single crystal {{monochromator}} at the European X-ray FEL to produce monochromatic, high-power radiation at 16 keV. Based on start to end simulations we show that the FEL power of the transform-limited pulses can reach about 100 GW by exploiting tapering in the tunable-gap baseline undulator. The combination of high photon energy, high peak power, and very narrow bandwidth opens a vast new range of applications, and includes the possibility to considerably increase the user capacity and fully exploit the high repetition rate of the European XFEL. In fact, dealing with monochromatic hard X-ray radiation one may use crystals as deflectors with minimum beam loss.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the flame structure and fire plume entrainment {{of natural gas}} diffusion flames on 0. 10, 0. 19 and 0. 50 m. diameter burners. The heat release rates ranged from 10 kW to 200 kW. Flame heights based on high speed photography and eye averages show a transition in the dependence of flame height on a dimensionless heat addition parameter around unity. For flames taller than three burner diameters, the initial diameter of the fire {{does not affect the}} length of these flames whereas for short flames initial geometry becomes important. Another prominent feature of these flames is the presence of large <b>scale</b> <b>ring</b> vortex-like structures which are formed close to the burner surface more or less regularly. It is found that these structures are responsible for the fluctuations of the flame top. Entrainment measurements spanned heights starting very close to the burner surface to distances about six times the average flame heights. Experiments indicate the presence of three regions; a region close to the burner surface where plume entrainment rates are independent of the fuel flow (or heat release) rates; a far field region above the flame top, where a simple point source model correlates the data reasonably well; and a not so well-defined intermediate region where entrainment seems to be similar to that of a turbulent flame with plume-like characteristics. It is also found that the disturbances in the ambient atmosphere will greatly enhance the fire plume entrainment. Finally, a theoretical study of a steady, buoyant, diffusion flame indicated the importance of the puffing in the entrainment process...|$|E

Based on observations with the Wide Field Spectrograph WiFeS at the 2. 3 m telescope of the Australian National University, we present spatially resolved emission-line diagnostics of the bright Seyfert 1. 5 galaxy HE 2211 - 3903 which is drawn from a sample of the brightest Seyfert galaxies at z< 0. 06 with luminosities around the classical Seyfert/QSO demarcation. In addition to the previously known spiral arms of HE 2211 - 3903, the emission-line maps reveal a large <b>scale</b> <b>ring</b> with a radius of about 6 kpc which is connected to the active galactic nucleus (AGN) through a bar-like structure. The overall gas kinematics indicates a disk rotation pattern. The emission-line ratios show Seyfert-type, HII region-type, and composite classifications, while there is no strong evidence of LINER-type ratios. Shock ionization is likely to be negligible throughout the galaxy. The composite line ratios are explained via a mixing line between AGN and HII region photoionization. Composite line ratios are predominantly found in between the HII regions in the circum-nuclear region, the bar-like structure to the east of the nucleus, and the eastern half of the ring, suggesting AGN photoionization of the low-density interstellar medium in an ENLR on galaxy scales. The line ratios in the nucleus indicate N-enrichment, which is discussed in terms of chemical enrichment by Wolf-Rayet and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars during past and ongoing nuclear starburst activity.

It was found that the polymerisations were well-defined and that di-block copolymer products could be obtained due to the living nature of the systems. Molecular modelling studies have been performed using the CAChe® 3. 2 program on the di-substituted second generation polycarbonate dendronised monomer and on a dendronised polymer up to a degree of polymerisation of 16. It was found that low DP oligomers of the second generation polycarbonate dendronised monomer had an approximately spherical shape, which tended towards cylindrical as the DP increased. The polymer at a DP of 16 had dimensions of approximately 10 nm diameter by 4 nm thickness. AFM images were also obtained using a scanning probe microscope MultiMode™ Nanoscope IV. The structures were found to be pancake shaped with dimensions of between 30 - 50 nm diameter and 3 - 6 nm thickness, which was approximately a factor of 3 greater than the dimensions calculated by molecular modelling.

The {{reason for this is}} that the numerous physical processes associated with MI coupling occur over multiple spatial lengths and temporal scales. One typical example of MI coupling is large <b>scale</b> <b>ring</b> current (RC) electrodynamic coupling that includes calculation of the magnetospheric electric field that is consistent with the ring current (RC) distribution. A general scheme for numerical simulation of such large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes has been presented earlier in many works. The mathematical formulation of these models are based on "modified frozen-in flux theorem" for an ensemble of adiabatically drifting particles in the magnetosphere. By tracking the flow of particles through the inner magnetosphere, the bounce-averaged phase space density of the hot ions and electrons can be reconstructed and the magnetospheric electric field can be calculated such that it is consistent with the particle distribution in the magnetosphere. The new a self-consistent ring current model has been developed that couples electron and ion magnetospheric dynamics with calculation of electric field. Two new features were taken into account in addition to the RC ions, we solve an electron kinetic equation in our model, self-consistently including these results in the solution. Second, using different analytical relationships, we calculate the height integrated ionospheric conductances as the function of precipitated high energy magnetospheric electrons and ions as produced by our model. This results in fundamental changes to the electric potential pattern in the inner magnetosphere, with a smaller Alfven boundary than previous potential formulations would predict but one consistent with recent satellite observations. This leads to deeper penetration of the plasma sheet ions and electrons into the inner magnetosphere and more effective ring current ions and electron energization...|$|E
