5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug <b>smuggling</b> to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug <b>smuggling</b> grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug <b>smuggling</b> and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E

As an initial step to curb enhanced <b>smuggling,</b> the Tamil Nadu government has set up 30 more marine police stations to bring the state’s entire coastal belt under close vigil.|$|E
5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the <b>smuggling</b> ring during a trip aboard an airliner. An Interpol agent investigating the <b>smuggling</b> is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the <b>smuggling</b> ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the <b>smuggling</b> ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, who believe that Amano's business group is involved with the <b>smuggling</b> ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek {{to bring an end to}} the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to get money from his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the <b>smuggling</b> ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>smuggled</b> {{cigarettes}} {{have been}} a prevalent problem and a severe challenge to public health and welfare around the world, {{little is known about}} the behavior associated with smoking <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes and the issue is difficult to study due to data limitations. By means of a population-based tobacco survey conducted in Taiwan, the present paper applies a latent class model to identify potential smokers who are either currently or will at some point in the future be consuming <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes. This methodology, in contrast to the traditional discrete models, allows potential smokers who are more inclined to smoke <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes to be endogenously classified. The empirical results indicate that socio-demographic factors do increase the inclination to smoke <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes after unobserved heterogeneity has been accounted for...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{analysed}} the socio-economic {{factors that}} influence a smokers decision to consume <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes {{when faced with the}} rising costs of legal cigarettes. We hope our findings will help public health authorities create policies that simultaneously discourage consumption of <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes and lower overall smoking levels. Methods: We conducted a national telephone survey from April to June 2004. We then applied Multiple Logistic Regression to the collected data to answer the following questions: do socio-economically disadvantaged smokers differ significantly in their characteristics If so, which characteristics are most influential in the decision to purchase <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes Results: Smokers with a personal monthly income of less than New Taiwan dollar (NT) 10 000 are 24 more likely to smoke <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes than are smokers who earn NT 10 000 or more. Smokers with the least amount of education are 21 more likely to smoke <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes than those with higher levels of education. Smokers with the most experience purchasing <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes are 31 more likely to do so than those with less experience. Finally, smokers who have a personal monthly income of less than NT 10 000 and the least amount of education are 54 more likely to smoke <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes than those with just oneor noneof these characteristics. Conclusion: Low-income, poorly-educated smokers are most likely to purchase <b>smuggled</b> cigarettes. To alter such behaviour, government must understand the motivations and opinions of this population and create marketing messages targeted specifically to their needs...|$|R
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been <b>smuggling.</b> Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce <b>smuggling</b> and generate revenue for the government.|$|E

Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recognition}} of trafficked persons as [...] "victims" [...] but <b>smuggled</b> migrants as [...] "objects" [...] {{of a process}} is a principal point of difference between how international law treats trafficked and <b>smuggled</b> migrants. Nonetheless, {{it is important to}} recognise that in reality and in law, <b>smuggled</b> migrants can still be victims of crime - whether this is theft, fraud, sexual assault, deprivation of liberty or even human trafficking.|$|R
50|$|Many {{individuals}} who consent to being <b>smuggled</b> are escaping poverty and hardship, seeking opportunities and better conditions abroad, or escaping natural disaster, conflict, or persecution. Others may be seeking asylum. While {{many who are}} <b>smuggled</b> are poor and uneducated, there are also others who belong to the educated middle class. As such, perhaps the only generalization {{that can be made}} about <b>smuggled</b> individuals is that they are all on a quest for a better life.|$|R

5|$|Goldfinger is {{the seventh}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959. Goldfinger originally bore the title The Richest Man in the World and was written in January and February 1958. The story centres on the investigation by MI6 operative James Bond into the gold <b>smuggling</b> activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence organisation. As well as establishing the background to the <b>smuggling</b> operation, Bond uncovers a much larger plot, with Goldfinger planning to steal the gold reserves of the United States from Fort Knox.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that Menem was {{under investigation for}} his role in the 1995 Río Tercero explosion, which is alleged to have been part of the weapons scandal involving Croatia and Ecuador. Following an Appeals Court ruling that found Menem guilty of aggravated <b>smuggling,</b> he was sentenced to seven years in prison on June 13, 2013, {{for his role in}} illegally <b>smuggling</b> weapons to Ecuador and Croatia; his position as senator earned him immunity from incarceration, and his advanced age (82) afforded him the possibility of house arrest. His minister of defense during the weapons sales, Oscar Camilión, was concurrently sentenced to five and a half years.|$|E

50|$|A joint {{investigation}} {{conducted by the}} FBI and the Department of Justice Inspector General found that a correction officer at FCC Petersburg, Keif Jackson, conspired with inmate Walter Brooks to <b>smuggle</b> heroin inside the facility. In 2008, Brooks recruited Jackson to <b>smuggle</b> heroin {{to him in the}} prison. At Brooks’ request, Officer Jackson contacted acquaintances of Brooks. He met with them on several occasions to obtain heroin, and <b>smuggled</b> the drugs into the prison. After Brooks was released from FCC Petersburg in 2010, Brooks began supplying heroin to Jackson to <b>smuggle</b> into the prison. Approximately one year later, on Oct. 10, 2011, Jackson was stopped by the police on his way to work. Upon searching his vehicle, officers recovered a package containing heroin.|$|R

5|$|<b>Smuggling</b> off American coasts was {{an issue}} before the Revolutionary War, and after the Revolution it was more problematic. Along with <b>smuggling,</b> lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E
