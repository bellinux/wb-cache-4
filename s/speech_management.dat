40|$|The pragmatic marker 'well' has {{received}} a lot of attention in studies on native speaker discourse and has served as an interesting testing ground for theories accounting for the multifunctionality of pragmatic markers. In the rapidly expanding body of research on pragmatic markers in learner English 'well' has also claimed a prominent position, but so far no comparison has been made of how learners of varying mother tongue backgrounds use 'well'. This article offers a Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (cf. Granger 1996) in scrutinising 'well' as a pragmatic marker in the Dutch, French, German, Spanish and Chinese components of the Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage (LINDSEI) and comparing these results with Aijmer’s (2011) findings for the Swedish component of LINDSEI and a comparable native speaker corpus. 'Well' is shown to be more prevalent overall in each of the learner corpora than in the native corpus, except for the Chinese (in which well displays a marginal incidence). This overall discrepancy between the learners and native speakers only holds for the <b>speech</b> <b>management</b> functions of 'well'; its attitudinal functions are significantly less common in the learners’ discourse than in the native speakers’.

40|$|Background: Treating {{speech and}} {{language}} problems in repaired cleft palate patients in India {{is still an}} uphill task {{due to lack of}} facilities. This study attempted to use parents as team members for the <b>speech</b> <b>management</b> of cleft palate patients in Andhra Pradesh, India. Objectives: To investigate whether a positive change in speech understandability for individuals with cleft palate will result from a parent-administered intervention program. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight parents had enrolled for the speech camp held in September 2004. The parent-training program at the speech camp ensured that parents were given adequate awareness. Out of the 28, 18 (64. 28 &#x 0025;) reported for one follow-up, referred to in this article as Group I. Ten (35. 72 &#x 0025;) out of the 28 came for two consecutive follow-ups, referred to in this article as Group II. Results: Pre and post training understandability scores obtained in the known context (reciting a familiar poem in the native language, counting 1 to 10) and unknown context (peer group names, family information, describing their journey from home to hospital) for Group I and Group II were evaluated. Results revealed that a higher percentage of cases showed significant improvement in understandability in the unknown context after treatment. Unknown context can be considered a measure to assess speech understandability after training. Further, it shows that parent training without practice at home may not show the desired results.

Despite the dramatic changes in physical, emotional and cognitive domains {{that are likely to}} impact stuttering treatment, adolescents’ response to stuttering treatment is not well documented. The Michael Palin Centre provides an intensive two-week therapy programme for adolescents who stutter. This programme consists of three components including <b>speech</b> <b>management</b> skills, cognitive behavioural therapy, and communication skills training. The overarching goal of this programme is to reduce overt and covert symptoms of stuttering. This poster presents data from a group of adolescents who stutter who attended the programme during a 3 -year time period (2008 - 2010). Data will be presented from 38 adolescents who attended the intensive programme. All were between the ages of 16; 0 - 18; 11. This is a longitudinal study that measures stuttering severity (SSI- 3), frequency (%SS) and a battery of self-report questionnaires over a 12 -month period. Stuttering frequency measures were taking from videos the adolescents made at home during reading and in conversation. Questionnaires were completed at eight time points during the programme were taken and include a pre-therapy baseline, treatment initiation, treatment conclusion, and at 5 follow-up sessions. Preliminary results have been completed for the first four measures. For stuttering frequency, there is no change during the two-month baseline before therapy. After the intensive treatment there is a reduction in stuttering frequency in reading. This reduction in stuttering frequency is maintained over a 5 -week follow up period. A similar pattern emerged for stuttering severity with stuttering severity not changing during the baseline, but reducing immediately after treatment and maintaining 5 weeks after treatment. A full analysis of the maintenance of stuttering frequency and severity over the long-term will be presented as well as an analysis of the results from the self-report questionnaires...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} effect of a two-week {{intensive}} therapy group for three young people aged 10 - 14 years who stammer. The aims of this course are to enhance fluency and to reduce the impact of stuttering on both parents and children. Group activities seek to develop social communication skills, <b>speech</b> <b>management</b> strategies and management of the cognitive emotional aspects of the disorder (Cook & Botterill, 2005). Therapy recommendations are informed by children's and parents’ views of the stuttering and their degree of worry and anxiety about it. DesignA repeated measures multiple-case single subject experimental design was used. The study had four phases:Phase A - 5 -week no therapy baselinePhase B - 2 -week intensive treatment phasePhase C - 5 -week consolidation phase during which treatment was self-managePhase D - 10 -month maintenance phase (until 1 year post therapy). Outcome measuresSpeech samples of the children during reading and conversation tasks were recorded at home on a weekly basis during Phases A+C, daily during Phase B and monthly during Phase D. These were randomly analysed to determine percentage of stuttered syllables (%SS). Statistical analysis of the %SS was carried out using a simplified time-series analysis (Blumberg, 1984; Tryon, 1982). Parents and children's perceptions of the stuttering and its impact were measured using self-report measures. These measures were completed {{at the beginning of the}} baseline phase, the first and last day of the therapy phase, then at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment. ResultsAnalysis of the results indicates that this therapy approach can be effective in reducing stammering and the impact that it has on children and parents in the short and long term. The findings highlight the individual variability in outcomes for different children and the fluctuating nature of progress over time...|$|E
30|$|Radiology reports contain {{information}} that can feed multiple processes: diagnosis, of course, and, more generally, many clinical decision processes, as explained above. Besides, radiology reports constitute a precious information source {{for the evaluation of}} the quality and effectiveness of radiology (including the value radiology adds to patient care) through the derivation of important metrics [12]. Finally, radiology reports {{can be seen as a}} rich source of information for research, e.g. research on imaging biomarkers, because they allow linking of qualitative and quantitative information about patient pathophysiology to descriptions of clinical states and symptoms. This allows automated data mining, which may help to validate the relevance of imaging biomarkers by highlighting the clinical contexts in which they are most appropriate and helping to devise potential new application domains. For this broad use of information contained in reports to become a reality, radiology reports must be structured with a content based on a standard terminology, and they must be accessible via standard access mechanisms and protocols. Moreover, the data must be stored in a suitable format that makes it easily accessible for any authorised party who needs to extract any appropriate or desired information. Examples of such situations include extraction of some significant observations from a computer-assisted detection (CAD) report to include them in the final report, assessing the relevance of a particular case with respect to clinical trials performed locally, clinical research, inclusion into pathology-specific imaging biobanks and big data learning [3]. Indeed, current implementations of reporting software often keep the structured content of the reports in proprietary databases and deliver and share only non-structured documents (e.g. pdf format), thus jeopardising any kinds of reuse by other applications. Such situations may be found, e.g. with specialised applications dedicated to the assessment of patient treatment response (such as RECIST based) or to <b>speech</b> <b>management</b> and recognition. Actually, all applications involved in either the creation or utilisation of structured reports should constitute a robust ecosystem, supporting both sophisticated radiology reporting and decision support systems, as demonstrated in [13].|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} three aspects of conversational management in emergency (999) telephone calls {{made to the}} fire brigade: turn-taking, the use of speech acts and the transmission of information. Examination of the 16 longest calls in the corpus showed two problem types, situation specific and information transfer. The occurrence of situation specific problems was linked to longer calls. Turn-management behaviour was studied in 146 calls. Both operators and callers interrupted more when the caller was a woman. No difference {{was found in the}} distribution of speech across role or sex. Operators used significantly more assent words than callers. <b>Speech</b> act <b>management</b> was examined in 91 calls, using Conversational Exchange Analysis (Thomas, Bull and Roger, 1982). Operators and callers used different repertoires of speech acts. The operator also used acts which lead to predictable responses from the caller. The questions asked by the operator in 92 calls were categorised by the type of information requested and the sequence of questions was analysed to determine whether the operators used Requests to structure the call. The majority of probable transitions were between repeated instances of the same question. The sequence of questions could be predicted only {{at the beginning and end}} of the call. Information transfer was studied using three measures in 72 calls: method of information transfer, lapses between the parts of transfer sequences and errors in transfer. Different items of information were differed on all three measures.
