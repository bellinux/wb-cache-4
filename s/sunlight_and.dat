5|$|Not all {{cities have}} a {{distinct}} urban heat island. Mitigation {{of the urban}} heat island effect can be accomplished {{through the use of}} green roofs and the use of lighter-colored surfaces in urban areas, which reflect more <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> absorb less heat.|$|E
5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> dry conditions.|$|E

5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the {{research}} To test whether health literacy is associated with sunlight exposure behavior, we interviewed 648 Chinese adults aged 65 years or older. Methods Using the information–motivation–behavioral skills model and structural equation modeling, we tested whether health literacy {{was associated with the}} complex relationships among knowledge about vitamin D, attitudes toward sunlight exposure, doctor recommendations regarding <b>sunlight</b> exposure, <b>and</b> <b>sunlight</b> exposure behavior. Results Health literacy was directly associated with sunlight exposure (β = . 20, p < . 01). Indirect relationships also existed between knowledge <b>and</b> <b>sunlight</b> exposure through health literacy (β = . 46, p < . 001) and between attitudes <b>and</b> <b>sunlight</b> exposure through health literacy (β = −. 12, p < . 05). The model had good fit (χ 2 /df =  2. 79; RMSEA = . 053, p = . 346; CFI = . 95; TLI = . 92). Conclusions Health literacy should be considered when educating older adults about vitamin D supplements <b>and</b> <b>sunlight</b> exposure. Providing relevant knowledge or making doctor recommendations might not be effective. Training should focus on individuals with low health literacy who may be less likely to receive sunlight exposure...|$|R
5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated <b>sunlight,</b> <b>and</b> is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{technologies}} are characterized as either passive or active {{depending on the}} way they capture, convert and distribute <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator.

Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle program may be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E

5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors {{did not agree with}} the delimitation of these forms as distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{artist and}} {{engraver}} Agostino Aglio, starting in 1826, {{became the first}} to transcribe and illustrate the codex completely for Lord Kingsborough, who published it in his nine volumes of Antiquities of Mexico in 18311848. The codex then had some damage due to handling, <b>sunlight,</b> <b>and</b> moisture. It received direct water damage that was significantly destructive from being kept in a flooded basement during the bombing of Dresden in World War II. German historian G. Zimmerman noted that the damage was extreme on pages 2, 4, 24, 28, 34, 38, 71 and 72. Certain details of the glyph images have been lost because of this. This shows when the current codex is compared to the Kingsborough copies of 1831-1848 and the Förstemann facsimile editions of 1880 and 1892.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{association}} of <b>sunlight</b> exposure <b>and</b> antioxidant level with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Four thousand seven hundred fifty-three participants aged 65 years or older in the European Eye Study underwent fundus photography, were interviewed for adult lifetime <b>sunlight</b> exposure, <b>and</b> gave blood for antioxidant analysis. Blue light exposure was estimated by combining meteorologic and questionnaire data. Data on <b>sunlight</b> exposure <b>and</b> antioxidants were available in 101 individuals with neovascular AMD, 2182 with early AMD, and 2117 controls. No association was found between blue light exposure and neovascular or early AMD. Significant associations were found between blue light exposure and neovascular AMD in individuals in the quartile of lowest antioxidant level-vitamin C, zeaxanthin, vitamin E, and dietary zinc-with an odds ratio of about 1. 4 for 1 standard deviation unit increase in blue light exposure. Higher odds ratios for blue light were observed with combined low antioxidant levels, especially vitamin C, zeaxanthin, and vitamin E (odds ratio, 3. 7; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 6 - 8. 9), which were also associated with early stages of AMD. Although {{it is not possible}} to establish causality between <b>sunlight</b> exposure <b>and</b> neovascular AMD, our results suggest that people in the general population should use ocular protection and follow dietary recommendations for the key antioxidant nutrient...|$|R
