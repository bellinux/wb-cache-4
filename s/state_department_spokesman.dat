500|$|The {{detention}} conditions prompted {{national and}} international concern. Juan E.

In January 2011 Amnesty International asked the British government to intervene because of Manning's status as a British citizen by descent, although Manning's lawyer said Manning did not regard herself as a British citizen. The controversy claimed a casualty in March that year when <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>spokesman</b> Philip J. Crowley criticized Manning's treatment and resigned two days later. In March, 295 members of the academic legal community signed a statement arguing that, contrary to former professor of constitutional law President Obama's assertion that Manning's confinement was [...] "appropriate and meet our basic standards," [...] Manning was being subjected to [...] "degrading and inhumane pretrial punishment." [...] On April 20 the Pentagon transferred Manning to the medium-custody Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she was placed in an 80-square-foot cell with a window and a normal mattress, able to mix with other pretrial detainees and keep personal objects in her cell.|$|E
