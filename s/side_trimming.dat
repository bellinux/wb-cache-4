2500|$|Also {{with this}} generation, each model of Taurus {{received}} different exterior trim. The lowest level Taurus L had light grey plastic mirrors and window trim, while the bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> were also light grey. The GL, the mid priced model, got chrome window trim and body color mirrors, while still retaining the grey bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> The top-of-the-line LX model had its bumpers color keyed, {{as well as}} having the grey <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> replaced with color keyed body cladding. 1992 L and GL models (and the Mercury Sable GS) could also be ordered with a two-tone paint job, in which instead of being grey, the bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> were painted a slightly darker shade of the vehicle's body color. [...] To cut costs, this was discontinued for the 1993 model year, as all models received color-matched trim and bumpers from that year onward.|$|R

50|$|The Daytona {{line was}} {{expanded}} for 1963, adding the new Wagonaire {{to the continuing}} convertible and hardtop. A new Custom trim level, which used <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> {{similar to that used}} on the 1962 Daytonas, stepped into the Regal's former place. Daytonas received new <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> that started as a narrow molding on the front fenders and widened toward the rear. The basic design of this trim was shared with the Cruiser.|$|R

25|$|In {{a bid to}} stem declining sales, a 2-seat economy {{version of}} the Minicar was {{introduced}} in October 1964, the Bond 250 G Tourer. This basically used the saloon car body, but with a larger rear deck incorporating an opening boot lid, a folding hood, new fibreglass bonnet, plain door panels, no chrome <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and non-opening quarter lights. In standard form it came with the 35A engine, but the <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and 4T engine were available as an option.|$|R
50|$|Carryover {{parts from}} earlier Packard models {{included}} taillights, wheel covers, block letters on hood, instruments and radios. The headlight 'eyebrows' and front bumper assembly were styled for a Packard appearance. A 1955 hood ornament was modified {{to fit the}} Studebaker hood shape and the long wide <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> {{was designed to be}} reminiscent of recent Packard trim. A stamped overlay for the lower rear fenders also gave them a body crease line suggestive of the <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> of the 1956 Caribbean.|$|R

5000|$|The front {{nose was}} {{redesigned}} with slimmer headlights, while retaining the first generation's [...] "bottom breather" [...] nose, albeit {{in a more}} aerodynamically efficient design that flowed into the front bumper. In the rear, it received new taillights that closely resembled those of the previous generation, {{as well as an}} entirely new rear clip. The trunk was also redesigned, with a spoiler being integrated into the trunk lid's design to make the car more aerodynamically efficient.Also with this generation, each model of Taurus received different exterior trim. The lowest level Taurus L had light grey plastic mirrors and window trim, while the bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> were also light grey.

5000|$|Model year 1956 saw a mild {{facelift}} {{with a more}} up-to-date grille, bezeled headlamps, larger front {{indicator lights}} and revised <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> The ´56 reached {{a top speed of}} 140 km/h and consumed [...]|$|R
50|$|Although {{based on}} the same body, 1959 Plymouth Suburbans {{featured}} an 'egg-crate' grille and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> changes, while the front bumper lost its raised centre section and larger tail lamps set the '58s apart from the rear.|$|R
50|$|MODELLISTA MAXI {{includes}} custom front bumper, side skirt, rear bumper. MODELLISTA MIXTURE includes custom B-pillar shadow, mirror cover, {{back window}} panel, <b>side</b> door <b>trim.</b> MODELLISTA MIXTURE <b>side</b> make set only includes custom mirror cover and <b>side</b> door <b>trim.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{luggage space}} is greater, made {{possible}} {{by the fact that the}} higher bonnet allows the spare wheel to be placed on the tank. The first version <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> was soon replaced by a contrasting colour side stripe.|$|R
50|$|For 1966, the Chrysler New Yorker {{adopted the}} new 440-cid V8 engine. Styling changes {{included}} a new grille, taillamps and revised <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> The Town & Country wagon was dropped {{as the model}} was now marketed as a series on its own.|$|R
50|$|The {{final version}} of the Royal was the AP3 which was {{introduced}} during 1960. The new series was easily distinguished from its predecessors by its vertically stacked quad headlamps and triple tail lights {{similar to those of the}} 1959 US Desoto models. A new pressing for the roof panel was also used. Chrysler's 3-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission replaced the 2-speed PowerFlite automatic of the AP2. Production ceased in 1964. The AP3 was available as a Royal four-door sedan and a Wayfarer two-door coupé utility. The choice of six cylinder and V8 engines continued, with the V8 identified by twin <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> strips (the six cylinders having only one <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> strip) and a small V8 badge on the rear quarter.|$|R
25|$|The Caprice {{models were}} renamed to Caprice Classic for the 1973 model year. The Kingswood Estate model with {{simulated}} wood-grain body <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> was now named the Caprice Estate. The convertible was {{moved from the}} Impala to the Caprice lineup {{for the first time}} in 1973.|$|R
50|$|For 1962 Canadians {{did not get}} the new Sport 300, {{but instead}} got the Saratoga. The grille was shared with the Newport/Windsor while the <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> was from the American Newport. The trunk lid sported New Yorker trim. Model {{offering}} remained 4-door sedan and hardtop plus 2-door hardtop.|$|R
50|$|New for 1957 was the 283 in3 small-block V8. The fuel-injected {{version was}} {{theoretically}} also {{available to the}} 150 buyer. The 1957 150 had <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> similar to the 1955's Bel Air trim. 56,266 '57 Chevy 150 four-door sedans were made, compared to the approximately 75,000 2-door versions.|$|R
50|$|The Custom Royal Lancer also {{featured}} a padded dashboard and steering wheel, Lancer emblems on the fenders, steering wheel, hubcaps, foot-operated windshield wipers, dual radio antennas, deluxe <b>side</b> <b>trim,</b> and thick chrome eyebrows. Optional equipment included power windows and brakes, air conditioning, and swivel seats. The Lancer designation was dropped for 1960.|$|R
5000|$|The Two-Ten {{shared the}} {{wedge-shaped}} <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> with the Bel Air, {{but unlike the}} Bel Air (which had the wedge filled with an aluminum trim panel) the Two-Ten's wedge was painted either body color, or top color with the optional two-tone paint package. [...] "Chevrolet" [...] in script was mounted inside the wedge.|$|R
50|$|The DPL {{included}} special {{lower body}} <b>side</b> <b>trim,</b> numerous standard convenience {{items such as}} reclining bucket seats upholstered in brocade fabrics or optional vinyl. An optional interior trim featured houndstooth fabric and included two throw pillows. The DPL model was aimed {{to compete with the}} new, more upscale trimmed Plymouth VIP, Ford LTD, Chevrolet Caprice and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1961 the BLSIP-3 was released. It {{featured}} the new [...] 1.9 L GB-4 inline-four engine. The front end was changed slightly, with the [...] "PRINCE" [...] grille letters removed and instead a Prince badge {{on the left}} front side of the hood. The <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and rear trim panels remained identical to the BLSIP-2.|$|R
5000|$|The {{external}} {{side walls}} were manufactured from high grade stainless steel unlike the 3100 class that were painted steel. The roof hatches on these locomotives {{were made from}} aluminium. The overall colour scheme for the 3500 class matched the 3100 class with orange fronts, green <b>side</b> <b>trims</b> and high polished stainless steel sides. Body length was 19.38 metres ...|$|R
25|$|V200 <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> {{reverted to}} the 1960 concept, {{following}} the tailfin crease and lower body break crease. However, the 1962 trim was more massive and contained an oblong triple-window effect {{at the rear}} of the body break crease. On Signets, the front fenders had an open-centred double spear, connected at the front and back, within which was contained a secondary body paint colour.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was much improved over the Herald; wooden door cappings {{were added to}} match the wooden dashboard and the car featured better seats and door trims. Optional extras included a vinyl/fabric, (Britax Weathershield), sunroof on saloon models. Exterior trim was also improved with stainless steel <b>side</b> <b>trim,</b> and satin-silver anodised alloy bumper cappings replacing the white rubber Herald design.|$|R
50|$|The Mark V, {{introduced}} in 1951, featured <b>side</b> chromium <b>trim</b> and a floor mounted handbrake.|$|R
50|$|The 1953 Cavalier {{was easily}} {{identified}} from other Packards by its unique chrome <b>side</b> spear <b>trim.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} a {{modified}} version of the TC 108G styled by Graber of Switzerland but built by Mulliner Park Ward and distinguished by having twin headlights mounted one above the other. Saloon and drophead versions were available. The design was noted for its lack of bright <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> or creases moulded into the body parts. The windshield was one-piece, curved, and not too highly sloped.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} include black mirror covers, radiator grille and trim strips, black nappa leather seats, door and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and black steering wheel with light coloured seams, trim strips and radio trim in candy white, sill panel strips with white night letters. Other {{features include}} climatronic climate control system, sports chassis lowered 15 mm and heated front seats. This option is available with all non V6 models.|$|R
50|$|The <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> was revised slightly, {{with the}} twin beading strips running {{separately}} {{along the length}} of the coach, only meeting at the very front. However, this was variable: some operators opted for the older layout instead; Barton Transport requested that the strips separate further back, allowing a larger space for their logo; the National Bus Company generally opted for only a single strip.|$|R
5000|$|Elsewhere in the lineup, the Cruiser {{was given}} heavy {{promotion}} as a sensibly sized luxury car. The brochures {{referred to it}} as [...] "America's First and Only Limousette." [...] To separate it from the Lark, Studebaker eliminated the [...] "Lark" [...] lettering from the front fenders and added fancier <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> Inside, buyers could choose luxurious broadcloth upholstery, lending credence to Studebaker's luxury push for the Cruiser.|$|R
