The endpoint used to assess toxicity was a tetrazolium-based assay whereas, the phototoxic potential of acylglutamate surfactants was predicted using two models namely, the Photo-Irritation Factor and Mean Photo Effect. The results of this study showed that the fatty acid chain length of acylglutamate greatly influences toxic effects on human keratinocyte cells. In addition, all the acylglutamate surfactants tested on human keratinocyte cells demonstrated significantly less cytotoxicity (when irradiated and non-irradiated with ultraviolet B light; p < 0. 05) and no phototoxic potential was observed in any of the acylglutamate surfactants, when compared with the positive control chlorpromazine.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} known that the {{inhibition}} of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase {{is one of the}} earliest events occurring under hypoxia and this inhibition can lead to neuronal damages. Thus, the cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor sodium cyanide (NaCN) is widely used to produce a model of chemical hypoxia by inhibiting this enzyme. However, the downstream signaling pathways of the inhibition of the cytochrome c oxidase remain to be studied. In the present paper, we used sodium cyanide to mimic the inhibition of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and studied its effect on glutamate release in synaptosomes from the prefrontal cortex using on-line fluorimetry. We also further investigated the mechanisms underlying the enhancing effect of <b>sodium</b> cyanide on <b>glutamate</b> release using pharmacological approaches combined with other techniques. The results showed that sodium cyanide significantly increased glutamate release from synaptosomes of prefrontal cortex; the broad-spectrum free radical scavenger MnTBAP and melatonin completely abolished the effect of <b>sodium</b> cyanide on <b>glutamate</b> release; the H 2 O 2 –NMDA receptor pathway mediated one part, whereas the lipid peroxyl radicals-ATP synthase pathway mediated another part of the <b>sodium</b> cyanide-induced <b>glutamate</b> release; scavenging H 2 O 2 and enhancing ATP synthase activity could completely abolish the <b>sodium</b> cyanide-induced <b>glutamate</b> release...|$|R

They exhibit ∼ 50 % identity and this homology is even greater at the carboxyl terminal half, which is predicted to have an unusual topology. Determination of the topology shows that the carboxyl terminal part contains several transmembrane domains separated by two reentrant loops that are in close proximity to each other. We have identified several conserved amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminal half that play crucial roles in the interaction of the transporter with its substrates: <b>sodium,</b> potassium and <b>glutamate.</b> The conformation of the transporter gating the anion conductance is different from that during substrate translocation.

Transport does not occur in response to valinomycin-induced membrane potential.

International and national bodies governing food additives currently consider MSG safe for human consumption as a flavor enhancer. Under normal conditions, humans can metabolize relatively large quantities of glutamate, which is naturally produced in the gut in the course of protein hydrolysis. The median lethal dose (LD50) is between 15 and 18 g/kg body weight in rats and mice, respectively, five times greater than the LD50 of salt (3 g/kg in rats).

In the two com-ponent model with potassium and calcium ion concentrations, we demonstrate, using updated pa-rameter values, travelling solitary waves of increased potassium and decreased calcium. These have circular wavefronts emanating from a region of application of potassium chloride. The collision of two such waves does not, as in one space dimension, result in annihilation but the formation of a unified wave with a large wavefront. For the first time we show that the mathematical model repro-duces the actual properties of spreading depression waves in cortical structures. With attention to geometry, timing and location of stimuli we have succeeded in finding reverberating waves matching experiment. By simulating the technique of anodal block, spiral waves have also been demonstrated which parallel those found experimentally.

A significant improvement in specific cell growth rate, cell production and IFN-gamma production (up to 45 %) was achieved on both shake-flask and fermentor cultures.

In the cases where lobotomy had been performed after administration of <b>sodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> and the contents of both acids were determined, and the following results were obtained: 1. The amount of pyruvate in blood= 1. 00 ± 0. 06 mg/dl; the amount of α-ketoglutarate in blood= 0. 41 ± 0. 06 mg/dl; the amount of pyruvate in spinal fluid of lumbar region= 0. 69 ± 0. 02 mg/dl; the amount of α-ketoglutaric acid in spinal fluid of lumbar region= 0. 35 ± 0. 03 mg/dl; pyruvate in ventricle fluid= 0. 80 ± 0. 02 mg/dl; and α-ketoglutaric acid in ventricle fluid= 1. 83 ± 0. 13 mg/dl. On comparing each of these values with respective values of the control reported in Part 1, both amounts of pyruvate and α-ketoglutaric acid in blood and spinal fluid of lumbar region show a decreasing tendency. This phenomenon seems to be due to the tranquilizing effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> on the central nervous system or to improved liver function due to this drug. On the other hand, in the case of the ventricle fluid the pyruvate content was less than that in the control, and the content of α-ketoglutaric acid was somewhat increased.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} main aspects of neuroprotection and excitotoxicity. DISCUSSION: This is a {{significant}} theory on the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia; {{it is based on}} the release of excitatory aminoacid (EAA), mainly glutamate. The sequence starts with a decrease of the blood flow and ends in neuronal death. The main stages of this reaction are herein presented and discussed. An in depth study of the effects of the excessive intracellular calcium is undertaken. Neuroprotectors (NP) are a group of drugs that reduce the excitotoxicity, opposing the excessive release of EAA and its intracellular effects. Neuroprotectors represent a rational approach to stroke treatment and offer a number of potential advantages. They prevent or limit ischemia-induced damage. CONCLUSION: There are many experimental and clinical NP trials. A minimum of 800 trials are currently under study worldwide. The most important NP subgroups are: N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) agonists, amino-hydroxy-methyl-isoxalone propionic acid (AMPA) antagonists, reducers of intracellular Ca++ inhibitors of nitric oxide modulation pathway free radicals scavengers, <b>sodium</b> channel antagonists, <b>glutamate</b> release inhibitor, growth factors, hypothermia and potassium channel activators...|$|R
