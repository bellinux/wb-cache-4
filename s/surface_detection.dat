40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports the}} recent {{development}} of a <b>surface</b> fatigue crack <b>detection</b> technique based {{on the use of}} surface-mount piezoelectric paint sensor. Polymer-based piezoelectric paints that can be directly deposited onto the surface of host structures are being utilized to make the sensor for <b>surface</b> crack <b>detection.</b> Because of its electromechanical coupling properties, voltage signals can be generated by the piezoelectric paint sensor when subjected to mechanical strain in its film plane. Results from recent development of the piezoelectric paint-based <b>surface</b> crack <b>detection</b> technique indicate that piezoelectric paint sensors with a special electrode design can potentially provide an effective method to detect fatigue cracks occurring in structural surfaces. A simple damage index is defined to determine the occurrence of surface cracks in a pre-specified region. However, complex sensor electrode patterns may be necessary in some cases to improve the spatial resolution of <b>surface</b> crack <b>detection.</b> Experiments conducted to validate this <b>surface</b> crack <b>detection</b> technique are also described in this study...|$|R

30|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of review papers [6 – 12] on various aspects of <b>surface</b> defect <b>detection</b> have been reported. Various aspects and methods for texture {{analysis}} have been reviewed in [13, 14]. Two comparatively recent review papers are [6, 7]. Advances in <b>surface</b> defect <b>detection</b> using texture analysis techniques have been dealt with by Xie [6] covering applications in mainly textiles, tiles and wood. Kumar [7] has covered very comprehensively research work done in fabric <b>surface</b> defect <b>detection</b> and provided some valuable conclusions. Review papers particularly on texture defects and defects in fabrics also mention steel surface as a category where identified techniques can be applied. It is worth mentioning that as early as in 1982, 11 papers were listed under ‘Inspection in Metal Processing Industry’ category in a review by Chin and Harlow [12]. Gonzalez and Woods [15] provide an excellent theoretical background to all aspects of image processing, whereas theoretical basis for neural network-based classification is adequately covered by Haykins [16]. However, the authors could not locate any review of research work done {{in the field of}} steel <b>surface</b> defect <b>detection</b> and classification. Therefore, in this paper, attempt has been made to consolidate the published literature from academia, steel industry and manufacturers on the topic of automatic defect detection and classification of steel surfaces.|$|R
