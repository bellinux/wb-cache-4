40|$|<b>Goal</b> <b>setting</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{replicated}} and influential paradigms in the management literature. Hundreds of studies conducted in numerous countries and contexts have consistently demonstrated that <b>setting</b> specific, challenging <b>goals</b> can powerfully drive behavior and boost performance. Advocates of <b>goal</b> <b>setting</b> have had a substantial impact on research, management education, and management practice. In this article, we argue that the beneficial effects of <b>goal</b> <b>setting</b> have been overstated and that systematic harm caused by <b>goal</b> <b>setting</b> has been largely ignored. We identify specific side effects associated with <b>goal</b> <b>setting,</b> including a narrow focus that neglects non-goal areas, a rise in unethical behavior, distorted risk preferences, corrosion of organizational culture, and reduced intrinsic motivation. Rather than dispensing <b>goal</b> <b>setting</b> as a benign, over-the-counter treatment for motivation, managers and scholars need to conceptualize <b>goal</b> <b>setting</b> as a prescription-strength medication that requires careful dosing, consideration of harmful side effects, and close supervision. We offer a warning label to accompany the practice of <b>setting</b> <b>goals.</b> Goals Gone Wild 3 Goals Gone Wild: The Systematic Side Effects of Over-Prescribing Goal-Settin...|$|R
