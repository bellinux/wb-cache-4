In anticipation of Fiesta's 75th anniversary in 2011, Homer Laughlin announced its 75th anniversary color: Marigold. In addition, it introduced the first of a line of specially backstamped annual anniversary items, a set of three baking bowls, at the 2008 International Home and Housewares Show in Chicago, Illinois. This was followed by the introduction of a large <b>serving</b> <b>platter</b> in 2009 and a numbered soup tureen. Dinnerware and accessories were available in 2011-2012, with each introduction marketed for 75 weeks, beginning April 1, before being retired.|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays, the use {{of hands}} during eating, known as [...] "kamayan" [...] (using the washed left hand for picking the {{centralized}} food and the right hand for bringing food to the mouth), has become a trend. Kamayan generally means [...] "eating with your hands", which was how Filipinos ate before the colonization of the country. It is further becoming more popular due to the incorporation of the [...] "boodle fight" [...] concept, a style of dining popularized by the Philippine Army, which utilizes banana leaves {{spread out on the}} table as the main <b>serving</b> <b>platter,</b> upon which is laid out portions of rice and a variety of Filipino viand for brotherly, friendly, filial, or communal feasting. The use of spoons and forks, however, is still the norm.|$|E
5000|$|In Arii Matamoe, Gauguin {{achieves}} a tropical sensibility through a color palette ranging from muted purples and browns to yellows, reds, and vivid pinks. The rustic, exotic qualities of Gauguin's imaginary [...] "palace" [...] are emphasized by the artist's {{choice of a}} rough, burlap-like cloth for his canvas. The severed head, displayed on a low-lying table or <b>serving</b> <b>platter,</b> is decorously presented with only a hint of blood; a despairing nude woman crouches nearby, while a figure just outside the room seems to proclaim the man's death to still more people further away. The interior is rich with Tiki-like figures and suggestive geometric patterns. Freely mixing Eastern and Western influences, Gauguin combined motifs and imagery borrowed from Tahitian, Javanese, French, and Peruvian sources, and by doing so created a rich symbolic mélange which, according to Gauguin scholar Elizabeth Childs, indicates that he was [...] "interested in proving himself to a Parisian art market".|$|E

5000|$|The tureen's {{prehistory}} may {{be traced}} {{to the use of the}} communal bowl, but during the reign of Louis XIV it was developed from a practical covered serving vessel into one of the most richly ornamented centerpieces of the formal apparatus of dining. This period also saw the old practice of dressing the dinner table with every dish at once (service à la française) superseded by the new practice of separate courses at meal time (service à la Russe), each entrée entering from the kitchens with an air of ceremony. Soup remained the first course of most meals, from the king's table to the peasant's, and the soup tureen on its <b>serving</b> <b>platter</b> provided the opening ceremony. Tureens naturally tended towards the impressive; the world's record auction price fetched for a single piece of silver was achieved by a silver tureen made in 1733 by the Parisian silversmith Thomas Germain, sold at Sotheby's New York, 13 November 1996: at US$ 10,287,500, tripling the former record.|$|E
50|$|Injera, as {{previously}} mentioned, {{is the most}} important component to any Ethiopian meal. It is often both the <b>serving</b> <b>platter</b> and utensil for a meal. Hearty stews such as Wat (food) are placed on top of the bread and then the meal is eaten by tearing pieces of injera off and scooping up the stews. While injera's literal use has not changed since its creation: to be the base and staple of any Ethiopian meal, its symbolic value has taken on new meanings. For starters, different varieties of injera {{can be found in the}} highlands vs. lowlands of Ethiopia. In the lowlands injera is often made with sorghum and in the highlands it is more commonly made with barley. Either way, because it is made with something other than tef its symbolic value has already decreased compared to the symbolic value of injera made with tef. There are symbolic value differences with types of tef as well. White-grained tef is more expensive to buy and thus symbolizes a higher status than its cheaper counterpart, red-grained tef.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{prepared}} {{at least a}} day or more in advance by braising or simmering a piece of veal from the back leg called Eye Round, which is then cut into thin, individual servings. For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks in an electric blender or food processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. The thick, smooth purée is then somewhat thinned with a little water and cooking liquid from the veal and a few capers are stirred in. Some of the sauce is spread out on a <b>serving</b> <b>platter</b> and the cold slices of veal are arranged {{in a single layer on}} top. The rest of the sauce is then poured over the veal so that it is, generally, completely covered. The dish is allowed to refrigerate for a period up to 5 days to fully develop the flavor.|$|E

5000|$|In service à la russe, {{courses are}} brought to the table in sequence. Only empty plates are set {{in front of each}} guest.

A filled plate is never placed in front of a guest because that would imply limited portions. Guests are expected to choose whatever they like and to eat as much as they want.|$|R
5000|$|The Middle Ages, Everyday Life in Medieval Europe by Jeffrey L.

After the meal, the sauce-soaked trenchers were probably distributed to servants or the poor. Food was <b>served</b> on <b>platters,</b> commonly one platter to two diners, from which they transferred it to their trenchers." ...|$|R
