50|$|Mantelliceras is {{characterized}} by a strongly ribbed, moderately involute shell with a moderately wide umbilicus, and rounded whorl section. The final whorl leaves inner whorls partly exposed. High <b>standing</b> <b>ribs</b> cross over the venter smoothly. Primary ribs arise from the ubilical wall. Secondaries, usually one per intervening space, arise higher on the flanks. Species of Mantelliceras are known to reach a diameter of about 13 centimeters.|$|E

5000|$|After {{hiding from}} Tom by wearing white paper decorations from the <b>standing</b> <b>rib</b> roast {{to look like}} two ribs, Jerry runs off, but the little mouseketeer Nibbles begins making a ham {{sandwich}} while singing [...] "Alouette" [...] to himself. Tom emerges behind him and pokes him with his sword, and Nibbles yells in protest. The little angry mouse says [...] "He, attention-la! Vous pourez faire mal a quelqu'un, Monsieur Pussycat!...Pussycat?! Au secours! Au secours! Le pussycat! Le pussycat!" [...] (Hey! Watch it! You could hurt someone like that, Mister Pussycat. Pussy Cat!? Help! Help! The pussycat! The pussycat!). But before he can get away, Tom captures him by putting his rapier through Nibbles' cape. Jerry manages to stab Tom in the rear-end to rescue Nibbles, and throws a custard in Tom's face for good measure. This launches a swashbuckling fencing display against Tom, ending in Tom catching Jerry. Nibbles tips a long-handled axe toward Tom and it shaves the tabard and all the fur off Tom's back from head to hind end, (and revealing ruffled white underwear), while Nibbles hides in some fruit.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} oven temperature, dry-roasting,and breed on the eating quality of beef was {{determined}} by sensory and objective methods. Two adjacent <b>standing</b> <b>rib</b> and two adjacent chuck roasts of prime, choice, and good grades from animals of Hereford, Shorthorn, and Charolais breeding were dry-roasted. Control roasts (9 - 12 th ribs) were cooked at 325 F. Experimental roasts (6 - 8 th rib and two chucks) were assigned an oven temperature of 325 or 250 F at random. All roasts were allowed to reach ah internal temperature of 155 F as recorded on a potentiometer. Tenderness, as determined by a Warner-Bratzler shear, was greater in roasts cooked in the 325 F oven. The amount of press fluid {{and the percentage of}} total cooking loss due to drip was greater in the 325 F oven. The panel of judges preferred the flavor of meat which was dry roasted to that cooked by a moist heat method. An effect of breed on eating quality was shown: meat from animals of Charolais breeding rated highest by the taste panel for tenderness, juiciness, and flavor. One group of samples from a Shorthorn sire was consistently low in the three factors scored. There was a high correlation between objective and sensory methods of evaluation for tenderness and juiciness. Correlations were high between the taste panel scores for tenderness and flavor and also for juiciness and flavor. Flavor and backfat thickness were shown to be closely related...|$|R
40|$|According to the 1964 census the {{production}} and sale of livestock provided {{a major source of}} income in the state of Utah. Twenty-three of the state 2 ̆ 7 s twenty-nine counties received more than 40 percent of their total farming income from livestock sales in 1959. According to Taylor (1965) this is expected to increase even more. In studying the economic sources within Utah, it becomes evident that many of the state 2 ̆ 7 s farmers and ranchers depend heavily on the sale of livestock for their livelihood. Upon observing this fact, Taylor (1965) states that farm income will depend just as heavily on the sale of livestock as in the past. He suggests one reason for this increase is because beef cattle have been replacing dairy herds and sheep since 1945. For example, between 1962 - 64 dairy cattle decreased by 38, 000 head. The chief agricultural export items in Utah are beef and lamb in carcass form. The meat packing plants process 250 million pounds of red meat annually. Of this 250 million pounds, 209 million pounds are consumed in Utah and about 41 million pounds are exported to other states. In recent years much study and research have been done on tenderness of beef. The quality and consumption of less tender cuts of beef, which are also less expensive, would be increased if a method of cooking could be used to attain this tenderness. Hiner (1955) points out that 2 ̆ 2 tenderness in beef is a function of many interrelated factors namely: breeding, feeding, management, age, period of aging of raw meat, presence of collagenous and elastic fibers, the method of cooking the meat and probably many others. 2 ̆ 2 Recent studies have shown that low temperature cooking increases the tenderness of beef. Cover (1937 and 1943) reports that roasts cooked at 176 F were 2 ̆ 2 very tender 2 ̆ 2 but dry as compared with those roasted at 257 F. She explains that the 2 ̆ 2 tenderness is due to the longer cooking time rather than the oven temperature. 2 ̆ 2 This may be true with quantity roasts but more work needs to be done on dry-roasting at the standard oven temperature which is from 300 to 325 F. Nielsen and Hall 2 ̆ 7 s (1965) study shows that blade roasts were more tender roasted at 225 F than at 325 F and were equally as tender as those braised. Many housewives no longer have time to roast a piece of meat for two or three hours just before dinner. If they could put the meat in the oven at a lower temperature before leaving for work in the morning and take it out in time for dinner at night; having a comparable roast in tenderness, juiciness, and flavor; their cooking problem would be somewhat simplified. The Animal Science Department of Utah State University has been experimenting with breeding Hereford and Hereford-Shorthorn crosses. One phase of their experiment is concerned with tenderness. The Food and Nutrition Department agreed to conduct tests for tenderness, juiciness, and flavor and acceptability on <b>standing</b> <b>rib</b> roasts cooked at 325 F. Through the courtesy of the Animal Science Department adjacent <b>standing</b> <b>rib</b> roasts and adjacent paired chuck roasts were furnished and were dry-roasted at 225 F and 325 F. This was done to compare tender and less tender cuts of beef roasted at the two different oven temperatures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of genetic background, oven temperature, and dry-roasting of less tender cuts upon tenderness, juiciness, flavor and acceptability and cooking losses of tender and less tender cuts of beef...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 8 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Marcus Welcome Center, Wichita State University, April 18, 2012. Research completed at the Department of Physician Assistant, College of Health ProfessionsThis research aims to {{study the effects of}} position on the respiratory support of speech breathing in adolescent children. It was hypothesized that when children were seated, speech would be supported mainly by rib cage movement (expansion of the thoracic cage) with limited abdominal movement, and that both rib cage and abdomen would contribute equally when children were <b>standing.</b> Methods: The <b>rib</b> cage and abdominal muscle movements of children ages 8 to 12 were measured using inductive plethysmography during both conversational and scripted speech. Their respiratory signals were compared to determine the relative contributions of the rib cage and abdomen during the speech tasks. Current Results: During reading in both positions, rib cage contributions tend to be greater than those of the abdomen. During speaking in both positions, there is high variability, with neither rib cage nor abdominal contributions being consistently higher than those of the other. Discussion: More data is currently being analyzed. The results to date suggest {{that it is not the}} position that influences the contribution of each chest wall component, but the type of speech task. The findings of this normative research may increase our understanding of respiratory support for speech in atypical situations.

60|$|It was Elliot's jackanapes, very meagre, as I could feel, {{and all his}} <b>ribs</b> <b>standing</b> out, but he {{made much}} of me, fondling me after his manner; and indeed, for my lady's sake, I kissed him, {{wondering}} much how he came there. Then he put something into my hands, {{almost as if he}} had been a Christian, for it was a wise beast and a kind. Even then there shone into my memory the thought of how my lady had prayed for her little friend when he was stolen (which I had thought strange, and scarcely warranted by our Faith), and with that, hope wakened within me. My eyes being now more accustomed to the darkness, I saw that the thing which the jackanapes gave me was a little wallet, for he had been taught to fetch and carry, and never was such a marvel at climbing. But as I was caressing him, I found a string about his neck, to which there seemed to be no end. Now, at length, I comprehended what was toward, and pulling gently at the string, I found, after some time, that it was attached to something heavy, on the outside of the casement. Therefore I set about drawing in string from above, and more string, and more, and then appeared a knot and a splice, and the end of a thick rope. So I drew and drew, till it stopped, and I could see a stout bar across the stanchions of the casement. Thereon I ceased drawing, and opening the little wallet, I found two files, one very fine, the other of sturdier fashion.|$|R
