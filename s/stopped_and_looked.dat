2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>Look</b> Detection Algorithm is a {{procedure}} for computing the cumulative {{probability of detection}} {{as a function of}} time for a searcher looking discretely for an evading target. The assumptions required for computation are: target detection is deterministic, i. e., cookie cutter, the target leaves datum on a random fixed course at constant velocity, the searcher travels at constant velocity <b>and</b> the searcher <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> for the target leaves datum on a random fixed course at constant velocity, the searcher travels at constant velocity <b>and</b> the searcher <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> for the target at predetermined search points. This report contains a description of the algorithm, the IBM-PC BASIC Program for cmputation and several examples. Additional keywords: BASIC programming language; Computer graphics.
