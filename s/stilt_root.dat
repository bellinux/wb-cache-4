This research aim to analyze the model of root architecture or the R. apiculata at different growth phases. The approach used the survey descriptive method (qualitative and quantitative). This research is conducted directly in field to get the data of lateral root architecture (underground system) and <b>stilt</b> <b>root</b> by using method of profile root trenching.

Rev. Biol. Trop. 55 (3 - 4) : 787 - 793. Epub 2007 December, 28. Comparamos características físicas de raíces aéreas de la palmera Socratea exorrhiza en sitios inclinados (pendiente> 20 º) y sitios planos, en dos lugares neotropicales. S. exorrhiza (n= 80 árboles) no muestra diferencias en el número de raíces, la altura vertical de las raíces, la circunferencia y la masa del cono de las raíces, o la posición de las raíces en los sitios con pendiente. Encontramos relaciones positivas entre el crecimiento vertical y la arquitectura de las raíces aéreas, incluso entre el número de raíces, la circunferencia del cono de las raíces, y la masa del cono de las raíces. Es posible que las raíces aéreas permitan a S. exorrhiza crecer en altura y mantener la estabilidad mecánica sin involucrar el diámetro del tallo y la estructura de las raíces subterráneas. Probablemente, esta estrategia incrementa la capacidad de la especie para usar claros de luz rápidamente, en comparación con palmeras carentes de raíces aéreas; posiblemente también exista un incremento en su supervivencia cuando las adultas palmeras se acercan a sus límites de estabilidad mecánica...|$|E
40|$|Water uptake by {{mangrove}} trees {{can result}} in salt accumulation in sediment around roots, negatively influencing growth. Tidal pumping facilitates salt release and can be enhanced by crab burrows. Similarly, flushing of burrows by incoming tidal water decreases sediment salinity. In contrast to burrows with multiple entrances, the role of burrows with one opening for salinity reduction is largely unknown. In a microcosm experiment we studied the effect of artificial, burrow-like macro-pores with one opening on the desalting of mangrove sediment and growth of Rhizophora mangle L. seedlings. Sediment salinity, seedling leaf area and seedling growth were monitored over six months. Artificial burrows facilitated salt release from the sediment after six weeks, but seedling growth was not influenced. To test whether crab burrows with one opening facilitate salt release in mangrove forests, sediment salinities were measured in areas with and without R. mangle stilt roots in North Brazil {{at the beginning and}} end of the wet season. In addition, burrows of Ucides cordatus were counted. High crab burrow densities and sediment salinities were associated with <b>stilt</b> <b>root</b> occurrence. Precipitation and salt accumulation by tree roots seem to have a larger effect on sediment salinity than desalting by U. cordatus burrows...|$|E

The results revealed that survival rates of two species were 100 percent in all treatments. Growth of R. apiculata were high in three levels of flooding: soil surface level, 10 and 20 cm above soil surface in the 4 th and 8 th month.

5000|$|Corner in 1961 {{hypothesised}} {{that the}} unusual <b>stilt</b> <b>roots</b> of S. exorrhiza were an adaptation {{to allow the}} palm to grow in swampy areas of forest. No evidence exists that <b>stilt</b> <b>roots</b> are in fact an adaptation to flooding, and alternative functions for them have been suggested. John H. Bodley suggested in 1980 that they in fact allow the palm to [...] "walk" [...] away {{from the point of}} germination if another tree falls on the seedling and knocks it over. If such an event occurs then the palm produces new vertical <b>stilt</b> <b>roots</b> and can then right itself, the original roots rotting away. Radford writes in the December 2009 Skeptical Inquirer that [...] "As interesting as it would be to think that when no one is around trees walk the rainforest floor, it is a mere myth", and cites two detailed studies that came to this conclusion. Other advantages of <b>stilt</b> <b>roots</b> over normal roots have since been proposed. Swaine proposed in 1983 that they allow the palm to colonise areas where there is much debris (for example, dead logs) as they can avoid it by moving their roots. Hartshorn suggested in 1983 that <b>stilt</b> <b>roots</b> allow the palm to grow upwards to reach light without having to increase the diameter of the stem. The roots make the palm more stable and therefore allow it to grow taller and more quickly than if they did not possess them. They also allow the palm to invest less biomass in underground roots than other palms, therefore leaving more energy to be used in growing above ground. It was also thought that the roots may confer an advantage when the palm is growing on a slope, but no evidence has been found that this is the case.|$|R

If removed too soon, the plantlet will not have the energy or water reserves to produce roots before dying.
