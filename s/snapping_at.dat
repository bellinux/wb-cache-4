5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, {{with the exception of}} rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E
5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Martill {{suggested}} that the odontoid {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw of Istiodactylus served to fill the space where no tooth was present. This completed an arc-like bite that would have been necessary to sever morsels that would otherwise remain attached by a thread. Martill stated that few other animals are known with teeth similar to those of Istiodactylus, but pointed out the similarity to various types of sharks and reptiles, including the cookiecutter shark, which takes circular bites from fish as well as prey much larger than itself (including whales). Istiodactylus may also have taken circular bites from prey larger than itself (such as dinosaurs and crocodiles), but perhaps also from fish, for example by <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> their backs near the water surface. Martill stated that there were many differences between the skull of Istiodactylus and extant scavengers, such as the lack of a sharp, pointed beak, which could have made it less capable of tearing flesh, but the long neck may have provided enough pulling power, and the claws on the fingers may have been used to manipulate carcasses. Martill agreed that Istiodactylus was most likely a scavenger that would have used its robust teeth to scrape meat from bones, as indicated by wear-facets on the tooth-tips (he proposed that scratch-marks should be looked for on dinosaur bones). He also {{suggested that}} if they were scraping away the last flesh from a carcass, like marabou storks, they would have been in the back of the queue for access to it.|$|E
25|$|Despite Alpha's victory, Sir Alan was {{not happy}} with either team's performance, and in {{particular}} had heavy criticism for Helene's leadership, even questioning whether she had deliberately tried to make her team lose {{to get rid of}} Lucinda, something that Helene insisted was untrue. Lucinda repeatedly told Helene she was not prepared and asked if someone could switch, but Helene refused and accused Lucinda of being lazy, resulting in Lucinda <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> her. The panel on You're Fired pointed out that the members of Alpha admitted they had little confidence in Lucinda's abilities, effectively undermining her contribution; it was agreed that had they lost, Helene should have been fired.|$|E

25|$|As {{leader of}} {{division}} Red 5 of VF-6, Vorse regularly flew CAP {{and had a}} number of memorable sorties during the month of August. In fact the very first day of combat, 7 August, he would launch three times: initially to run SCAP (air patrol for the transport screen) at 0642 hours, then CAP at 1015, and finally an attack flight sent up at around 1320 in which he ran headlong into an enemy bomber formation. Vorse's section was headed for Tulagi at the time and was so surprised to see the three-plane section of Val dive bombers from 5th Air Attack Force's 2nd Air Group that they almost flew past them. Only Vorse acted quickly enough to chase the Vals into their diving run, <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> the heels of the trailing plane and ultimately flaming it before it could unleash its payload.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of 1988, during an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Hercules was {{swinging}} his chain in the direction of another muscular power wrestler the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules' full nelson and landing on top of him before lifting his shoulder at the two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules. During the match the Warrior had no-sold a number of Hercules' signature power moves, including receiving two clotheslines before being taken down with a third. This match has generally been {{regarded as one of the}} poorest matches in WrestleMania history.|$|E

When a colleague is stuck in an elevator with his feet dangling out of the doors, Ling asks, [...] "Does this mean I'm {{going to have to}} take the stairs?" [...] She is impatient in getting what she wants, for example <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> a judge to [...] "hurry up" [...] as he read a verdict. [...] She frequently announces that she is uninterested in proceedings that don't affect her personally. As her co-counsel questions a witness in court, Ling objects to the judge, [...] "I'm bored! As an officer of the court, I have a duty to be open and forthright. I think the witness is tedious and I'm concerned for the jury's attention span." ...|$|E

500|$|Abbott, {{unfamiliar}} with the Court of King's Bench (having been a regional lawyer rather than a London-based one), was initially a disappointment, but soon improved. By 1818 he showed [...] "the highest judicial excellence", although he was criticised for <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> boring barristers and for taking the government's side in prosecutions. That year, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Ellenborough had a stroke, forcing his retirement. Most of the other judges and legal figures were inappropriate for the role; Sir Samuel Shepherd, for example, was while an able lawyer too deaf to sit as a judge. As a result, Abbott was appointed, and formally took up his position on 4 November 1818. As Lord Chief Justice he saw the Court of King's Bench flourish, with competent Justices and his own abilities; [...] " [...] had more knowledge of mankind than any of , and was more skilful as a moderator in forensic disputation". Abbott's central weakness as a judge was seen to be his support of James Scarlett, his leader when Abbott was a barrister; [...] "The timid junior, become Chief Justice, still looked up to his old leader with dread, was afraid of offending him, and was always delighted when he could decide in his favour".|$|E
2500|$|Huxley said [...] "I am Darwin's bulldog". While {{the second}} half of Darwin's life was lived mainly within his family, the younger combative Huxley {{operated}} mainly out in the world at large. A letter from Huxley to Ernst Haeckel (2 November 1871) states: [...] "The dogs have been <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> [...] heels too much of late." [...] At Oxford and Cambridge Universities, [...] "Bulldog" [...] was and still is student slang for a university policeman, whose job was to corral errant students and maintain their moral rectitude.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst {{his many}} admirers {{was the great}} Stanley Matthews, who said about him [...] "I felt [...] was the ideal partner for me... Carter was a supreme {{entertainer}} who dodged, dribbled, twisted and turned, sending bewildered left-halves madly along false trails. Inside the penalty box with the ball at his feet {{and two or three}} defenders <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> his ankles, he'd find the space to get a shot in at goal... Bewilderingly clever, constructive, lethal in front of goal, yet unselfish. Time and again he'd play the ball out wide to me and with such service I was in my element." ...|$|E

2500|$|Task Review: Velocity {{decided to}} go for a {{contemporary}} calendar featuring kitten photos despite numerous protests from Jo. However, their pitches were not helped by Nargis, who lost track of what she was saying, even <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> the buyers, and the calendar received criticism for being irrelevant to the charity and for having the dates printed too small to make usable. Despite these issues, all three retailers made orders. Meanwhile, Invicta decided on a calendar featuring [...] "fun" [...] photos of children dressed up in various costumes. While the calendar's design was criticised, and Mani's early pitches were extremely poor, the team received a large order from one retailer that effectively earned them victory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{figure of}} Lycurgus, {{bound by the}} vine and naked apart from boots, is flanked on the left by a {{crouching}} Ambrosia, at a considerably smaller scale. Behind her one of Dionysus's satyrs (shown with a normal human form) stands on one foot {{as he prepares to}} hurl a large rock at Lycurgus. [...] In his other hand he holds a pedum or shepherd's crook. [...] To the right of Lycurgus comes first a figure of Pan, then at his feet a rather canine-looking panther, the traditional companion of Dionysus, whose face is missing but was presumably <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> the king, and then the god himself, taunting him with his right arm extended in an angry gesture. [...] Dionysus carries a thyrsus, the special staff of the god and his followers, and his dress has an Eastern, perhaps Indian, flavour, reflecting what the Ancient Greeks generally believed (perhaps wrongly) about the origins of his cult. [...] The calf section of one leg has been lost. [...] A streamer hanging behind him from his thyrsus overlaps the raised foot of the satyr with the rock, completing the circle of the cup.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the episodes}} from 6 August, All About Soap said that [...] "the finger of {{suspicion}} [...] is pointing firmly [...] Michael Moon this fortnight." [...] Following {{the scene of}} Michael <b>snapping</b> <b>at</b> Janine and leaving her with their baby, the magazine thought he could be seeking comfort from Kat, and Janine also overhears Michael arranging to meet someone, which they thought could be Kat. Kat also tells Janine that Michael was having doubts on their wedding day, which they thought could be [...] "Kat's sly way of telling her nemesis that Michael would rather be with another woman", and when Janine sees Michael taking cash from her safe, he could be using it to fund the flat. The same week, Janine telephones Michael, but when he answers his phone, Kat is also calling her lover, which Inside Soap says would leave viewers wondering who he had answered the phone to. After Ray was eliminated as a suspect, Inside Soap said that Michael seemed to become the front-runner, as there had been looks between him and Kat, and Kat seemed distraught, and when Kat {{had a conversation with}} Janine, Kat told Michael that she did not tell her [...] "everything". Jack had become involved with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and Max had his own problems. However, again they felt it could be a red herring and Derek could be the one as he had been [...] "conspicuous by his absence".|$|E
