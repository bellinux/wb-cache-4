5|$|Together, Schmitt, Kutuzov and {{the other}} generals, with von Stiebar's advice on the local terrain, concocted a plan to {{encircle}} the French at Dürenstein. Russian commander Mikhail Miloradovich would approach Gazan's division from the east, supported by Pyotr Bagration's corps, and pin the French in place. Three additional columns, commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov (Doctorov), Maj. Gen. <b>Strik</b> and Schmitt, would outflank the French from {{the west and the}} north. They would offer, as bait, a rumor: the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krems.|$|E
5|$|Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan {{waited for}} Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was {{expected}} to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite12:00 or 14:00varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. <b>Strik</b> arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. The narrow defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack in waves. Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next two to three hours, Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle. The French were outnumbered more than three to one, assaulted in the front by Miloradovich's column, in the middle by Strik's and in the rear by Dokhturov.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 10–11 November a Russian column under <b>Strik's</b> command began its passage through the narrow canyons, intent on {{arriving}} at Dürenstein by noon; two more columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, moved in wider semicircles, planning {{to pass through the}} mountains and attack the French, who were extended along the river bank. According to the plan, in late morning <b>Strik's</b> column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right. This flanking attack, combined with Miloradovich's frontal assault from Stein, would force the French into a vise; encircled, they would have no option but to surrender—or die. To ensure the success of the plan, the second and third columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, would arrive in early and mid-afternoon and support the earlier assaults. In this way, even if the French tried to retreat west to Marbach, they would not escape the vise-like grip of the Coalition army.|$|R

40|$|Com o objetivo de estudar os achados epidemiológicos, clínicos e hematológicos associados com ehrlichiose, e comparar técnicas citológicas para detecção de mórulas de Ehrlichia canis a partir de um método de leuconcentração (LC) e pela citologia de sangue periférico da veia jugular (SP) e de margem de orelha (MO), foram obtidas amostras de 60 cães naturalmente infectados, utilizando-se outros 35 como controle. Para validação das técnicas, adotou-se a PCR como técnica padrão-ouro. Verificou-se que a doença foi mais comum nos meses frios e secos, nos cães com idade {{inferior}} a um ano e com definição racial, que habitavam locais com presença de terra e outros cães e tinham histórico de infestação por carrapatos. Os sinais clínicos mais comuns foram apatia, anorexia, linfadenomegalia, febre e palidez de mucosas. Melena e hemorragias na pele foram os principais sinais hemorrágicos. Anemia e trombocitopenia constituíram-se nas alterações hematológicas mais freqüentes, e tiveram sua sensibilidade aumentada quando foram associadas. A leuconcentração mostrou-se a melhor técnica, especialmente para animais em fase aguda. A sensibilidade e especificidade foram, respectivamente, de 13, 33 % e 100 % em SP, 26, 67 % e 97, 14 % na PO, e de 73, 33 % e 100 % para a LC. Os valores preditivos positivo e negativo corresponderam a 100 % e 40, 23 % em SP; 94, 12 % e 43, 59 % em MO; e a 100 % e 68, 63 % na LC. Palavras-chave: achados clínico-laboratoriais; canino; diagnóstico; ehrlichiose; epidemiologia. The {{subject of}} this work was to correlate the epidemiological, clinical and hematological findings with ehrlichiosis, and to compare the citological diagnostic based on the detection of Ehrlichia canis morulae using a leukoconcentration technique (LT) with the blood smear of pheripheral vein (PV) and ear margin (EM). Sixty animals with natural infection entered {{in the study and}} others 35 were used as control. The methods were compared to the PCR gold standard. The disease was most frequent in the coldest and driest months. The prevalence was higher in purebred. The maiority were one to twelve months old, they lived in contact with earth and dogs, and the tick infestation was related by their owners. Apathy, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, fever and pale mucous membranes were the most consistent clinical signs. The most <b>strikking</b> hemorragic signals were melena e disturbes in the skin. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were the most common hematological findings, and their sensibilities were highest when they were used in combination. The LT presented the best results for the detection of morulae, specially in the acute phase of the disease. Sensibility and specificity were, respectivelly, of 13, 33 % and 100 % for PV; 26, 67 % and 97, 14 % for EM; and 73, 33 % and 100 % for LT. The preditive positive and negative values were 100 % and 40, 23 % for PV; 94, 12 % and 43, 59 % for EM; 100 % and 68, 63 % for LT.
