40|$|Investigations of {{unsteady}} pressure loadings on {{the blades}} of fans operating near the stall flutter boundary {{are carried out}} under simulated conditions in the NASA Transonic Flutter Cascade facility (TFC). It has been observed that for inlet Mach numbers of about 0. 8, the cascade flowfield exhibits intense low-frequency pressure oscillations. The origins of these oscillations were not clear. It was speculated that this behavior was either caused by instabilities in the blade separated flow zone or {{that it was a}} tunnel resonance phenomenon. It has now been determined that the strong low-frequency oscillations, observed in the TFC facility, are not a cascade phenomenon contributing to blade flutter, but that they are solely caused by the tunnel resonance characteristics. Most likely, the <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> originate in the system of exit duct resonators. For sure, the <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> can be significantly suppressed for a narrow range of inlet Mach numbers by tuning one of the resonators. A considerable amount of flutter simulation data has been acquired in this facility to date, and therefore it is of interest to know how much this tunnel <b>self-induced</b> flow <b>oscillation</b> influences the experimental data at high subsonic Mach numbers since this facility is being used to simulate flutter in transonic fans. In short, can this body of experimental data still be used reliably to verify computer codes for blade flutter and blade life predictions? To answer this question a study on resonance effects in the NASA TFC facility was carried out. The results, based on spectral and ensemble averaging analysis of the cascade data, showed that the interaction between <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> and forced blade motion oscillations is very weak and can generally be neglected. The forced motion data acquired with the mistuned tunnel, when strong <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> were present, can be used as reliable forced pressure fluctuations provided that they are extracted from raw data sets by an ensemble averaging procedure...|$|R

Whereas aluminum cylinder kept almost the same amplitude, the amplitude was damped for the nylon cylinder. Especially when the period, as well as the amplitude, were small, the nylon cylinder stopped the oscillation due to overheating.

The internal flow characteristics for both conventional and improved AJP were numerically investigated and compared by a validated {{computational fluid dynamics}} model. The numerical comparison demonstrated an approximately 10 % pumping performance increase compared with the conventional pump, which is mostly attributed to the improved mass and energy transfer along the oscillating phase interface. Furthermore, transient flow analysis was conducted to resolve the unsteady self-introduced oscillation. The results revealed the self-introduced oscillation induces a continuous break-up and formation of fresh water-air interfaces, which exhibits a periodic feature with a dominant frequency of 147 Hz for the current design under given operational conditions.

As a result, the exciton-polariton condensates exhibit <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> and emit an equidistant frequency comb light spectrum. A plethora of possible emission spectra with asymmetric peak dis- tributions appears due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry.

This paper presents a linear analysis of the coupling between Poiseuille flow and a tensioned membrane of finite length using an eigenvalue approach. The undisturbed state of the channel flow is perfectly parallel. To some extent, this configuration bridges the gap between two types of theoretical models: one for the travelling-wave flutter in an infinite, flexible channel, {{and the other for}} the <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillation</b> of a collapsing section of a Starling-resistor tube. In our study, we focus on the parameter range where the wall-to-fluid mass ratio is high (100), and the Reynolds number based on the maximum flow velocity in the channel is moderately high (200). Eigenmodes representing both static divergence and flutter are found. Particular attention is paid to the energetics of flutter modes. It is shown that energy transfer from the flow to the membrane occurs as a result of unstable, downstream-travelling waves, while the upstream-travelling waves are stable and release most of the transferred energy back to the flow. Coupling between different in vacuo modes offers another view of the origin of energy transfer. In addition, an energy conservation analysis similar to the one used in aeroacoustics is carried out. It is shown that terms directly proportional to fluid viscosity contribute most to the production of fluctuation energy, leading to a special type of dynamic instability which resembles both Tollmien-Schlichting instability {{in the sense that the}} fluid viscosity destabilises, and traditional travelling wave flutter since the structural damping plays the role of stabilising. Effects of the membrane mass, length and structural damping are also studied. The characteristics of the membrane flutter are found to depend crucially on the upstream and downstream boundary conditions. © 2001 Academic Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft are {{flexible}} aeroelastic structures. Therefore, in-flight {{they are}} susceptible to a <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillation</b> known as flutter {{which can lead to}} rapid and catastrophic structural failure. The aircraft design process must ensure that flutter occurs beyond the flight envelope, yet the Government Aircraft Factories Nomad aircraft has occasionally experienced low speed flutter involving its flaperon. Past attempts to investigate the Nomad’s flaperon flutter were unsuccessful. Consequently, not much is known about the critical flutter mode except that it occurs upon landing at a speed of about 100 knots. The objective of this research was to make a contribution towards the knowledge needed to help resolve the Nomad&# 039;s flutter. The scope of this work was limited to applying computational methods rather than physical experiments. A nonlinear aeroelastic simulation was deemed necessary for an accurate flutter analysis with the Nomad’s wing geometry in its landing configuration. However, nonlinear aeroelastic methods need significant development in many areas before they can be applied to problems like the Nomad. In particular, the nonlinear aerodynamics component of nonlinear aeroelastic simulations was identified as critical area. Hence, the focus of the research work related to nonlinear computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and more specifically, turbulence modelling, grid generation and the computational cost involved. Flow phenomena around high-lift wings, like the Nomad&# 039;s, are not well understood under take-off and landing conditions. Therefore, studying the local flowfield structures around the Nomad’s wing-flaperon landing configuration would be valuable. No such examination has been reported in the literature. The steady, two-dimensional flowfield around the Nomad&# 039;s wing was simulated. Results showed separated regions behind the flaperon and main wing element, and attached flow elsewhere. Pressure distributions along the flaperon were strongly influenced by turbulence model. Thus, existing Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence models, coupled with wall modelling, are unreliable for this problem. Field grid generation required for nonlinear aerodynamics computations can be laborious and may involve considerable computational resources, especially for moving geometries essential for aeroelastic simulations. Therefore, an efficient grid generation algorithm was developed. It generated a structured O-grid around a single arbitrarily shaped body in two and three dimensions by solving a system of elliptic Laplace or Poisson equations. This algorithm differs from others by implementing several acceleration techniques, including approximate factorisation and the method of false transients, to enhance the convergence rate. Computation times were drastically reduced relative to traditional methods. In nonlinear aeroelastic simulations, over 60 % of the total computational time is expended on nonlinear CFD calculations (excluding grid generation). This cost can be reduced by exploiting rapidly advancing computer technology. In this work, the scaling performance of Intel’s first general purpose quad-core processor for personal computers was studied using a CFD problem. Using a two-dimensional Euler solver developed from scratch, the results showed speedups of 350 % and 256 % for coarse and fine grids, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{visual cue}} of optical flow {{plays a major}} role in the {{navigation}} of flying insects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A major problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance estimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to distance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to estimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control inputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control gain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the distance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first starts to exhibit <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations,</b> eventually leading to instability. The proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major attractive characteristics. First, <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> are easy for the robot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be estimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i. e., around hover. The stability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with a Parrot AR drone 2. 0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final approach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2) estimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire landing if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the 'edge of oscillation'...|$|R

Using this property, our method estimates the scale by adapting the gain and detecting <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Unlike conventional monocular approaches, no additional metric sensors are used for scale estimation.

40|$|The {{flow field}} and forces on an {{isolated}} oscillating NACA 0012 airfoil {{in a uniform}} flow is studied using viscous vortex particle method. The simulations are carried out at very low chord (c) based Reynolds number (Re= 1000), motivated by the current interest in development of Micro Air Vehicles (MAV). The airfoil is forced to oscillate in both heave and pitch at different normalized oscillation frequencies (f), which {{is represented by the}} non-dimensional reduced frequency fc/U). (From the unsteady loading on the airfoil, the net energy transfer to the airfoil is calculated to determine the propensity for the airfoil to undergo <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> or flutter at these very low Reynolds numbers. The simulations are carried out using a viscous vortex particle method that utilizes discrete vortex elements to represent the vorticity in the flow field. After validation of the code against test cases in the literature, simulations are first carried out for the stationary airfoil at different angles of attack, which shows the stall characteristics of the airfoil at this very low Reynolds numbers. For the airfoil oscillating in heave, the airfoil is forced to oscillate at different reduced frequencies at a large angle of attack in the stall regime. The unsteady loading on the blade is obtained at different reduced frequencies. This is used to calculate the net energy transfer to the airfoil from the flow, which is found to be negative in all cases studied. This implies that stall flutter or <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> are not possible under the given heave conditions. The wake vorticity dynamics is presented for the different reduced frequencies, which show that the leading edge vortex dynamics is progressively more complex as the reduced frequency is increased from small values. For the airfoil oscillating in pitch, the airfoil is forced to oscillate about a large mean angle of attack corresponding to the stall regime. The unsteady moment on the blade is obtained at different reduced frequencies, and this is used to calculate the net energy transfer to the airfoil from the flow, which is found to be positive in all cases studied. This implies that stall flutter or <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> are possible in the pitch mode, unlike in the heave case. The wake vorticity dynamics for this case is found to be relatively simple compared to that in heave. The results of the present simulations are broadly in agreement with earlier stall flutter studies at higher Reynolds numbers that show that stall flutter does not occur in the heave mode, but can occur in the pitch mode. The main difference in the present very low Reynolds number case appears to be the broader extent of the excitation region in the pitch mode compared to large Re cases studied earlier. region in the pitch mode compared to large Re cases studied earlier...|$|R

A special type of propagating stall appears as a self-induced disturbance; an asymmetric velocity profile introduced at the compressor inlet constitutes a forced disturbance. Both phenomena have been treated from a unified theoretical {{point of view in}} which the asymmetric disturbances are linearized and the blade characteristics are assumed quasi-steady. Experimental results are in essential agreement with this theory wherever the limitations of the theory are satisfied.

50|$|Acoustic {{oscillations}} in a {{media are}} {{a set of}} time depending properties, which may transfer energy along its path. Along the path of an acoustic wave, pressure and density {{are not the only}} time dependent property, but also entropy and temperature. Temperature changes along the wave can be invested to play the intended role in the thermoacoustic effect. The interplay of heat and sound is applicable in both conversion ways. The effect can be used to produce acoustic oscillations by supplying heat to the hot side of a stack, and sound oscillations can be used to induce a refrigeration effect by supplying a pressure wave inside a resonator where a stack is located. In a thermoacoustic prime mover, a high temperature gradient along a tube where a gas media is contained induces density variations. Such variations in a constant volume of matter force changes in pressure. The cycle of thermoacoustic oscillation is a combination of heat transfer and pressure changes in a sinusoidal pattern. <b>Self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> can be encouraged, according to Lord Raleigh, by the appropriate phasing of heat transfer and pressure changes.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonlinear mechanics of a bimetallic, optically absorbing SiN-Nb nanowire {{in the presence}} of incident laser light and a reflecting Si mirror. Situated in a standing wave of optical intensity and subject to photothermal forces, the nanowire undergoes <b>self-induced</b> <b>oscillations</b> at low incident light thresholds of < 1 μ W due to engineered strong temperature-position (T-z) coupling. Along with inducing self-oscillation, laser light causes large changes to the mechanical resonant frequency ω_ 0 and equilibrium position z_ 0 that cannot be neglected. We present experimental results and a theoretical model for the motion under laser illumination. In the model, we solve the governing nonlinear differential equations by perturbative means to show that self-oscillation amplitude is set by the competing effects of direct T-z coupling and 2 ω_ 0 parametric excitation due to T-ω_ 0 coupling. We then study the linearized equations of motion to show that the optimal thermal time constant τ for photothermal feedback is τ→∞ rather than the widely reported ω_ 0 τ = 1. Lastly, we demonstrate photothermal quality factor (Q) enhancement of driven motion as a means to counteract air damping.

40|$|Large {{amplitude}} roll oscillations {{are inherent}} to fixed-wing MAVs. This paper reviews our recent {{works on the}} suppression of the <b>self-induced</b> roll <b>oscillations</b> of LAR rectangular wings using active flow control techniques. Both acoustic excitation and synthetic jet blowing have been used to attenuate the self-excited roll oscillations. Three rectangular wings, of flat plate, NACA 0012 and SD 7003 - 085 - 88 profiles were tested. It was found that roll oscillations can be completely suppressed and the onset of the roll oscillations can be delayed by active flow control approaches. PIV measurements indicated that the excitations could restore a symmetric vortex flow over free-to-roll wings thus stabilize the roll oscillations...|$|R
