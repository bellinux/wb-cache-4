5000|$|On February 11, 2008, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution {{reported}} that [...] "House Speaker Glenn Richardson {{and his wife}} filed for divorce, completed the dissolution of their marriage and got court records of the proceedings sealed." [...] According to the AJC, this was done by Paulding Superior Court Judge James Osborne, a former law partner of Richardson's, who then sealed the records in apparent {{violation of the rules}} that govern the state's superior courts. State law requires a 30-day waiting period before uncontested divorces become final, but a judge may grant an immediate divorce after finding circumstances such as spousal abuse, incurable mental illness or adultery. The handling of the divorce raised questions as to whether the speaker of the state House received preferential treatment from Judge James Osborne, who was not initially assigned the case but signed the order placing it under wraps. The judge, once the speaker's law partner, is now weighing a request to unseal the divorce file. He <b>said</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>that</b> he has treated the Richardsons' request like any other. First Amendment advocates note there is a strong presumption to access to proceedings and records to ensure courts are treating both parties to a dispute fairly."Public access protects litigants both present and future, because justice faces its gravest threat when courts dispense it secretly", the Georgia Supreme Court said in 1988, ordering court records unsealed in a paternity suit against a Roman Catholic priest.(Atlanta Journal-Constitution July 13, 2008) ...|$|E

As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of truthiness; excerpts of the story are:"When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to mention Colbert, he began a tongue-in-cheek crusade, not unlike the kind his muse Bill O'Reilly might lead in all seriousness."It's a sin of omission...' Stephen Colbert told the AP on Thursday...'It's like Shakespeare still being alive and not asking him what Hamlet is about,' he said.""The Oxford English Dictionary has a definition for 'truthy' dating back to the 1800s....'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut."Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as The New York Times wrote, 'a summation of what Colbert sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN."Colbert, who referred on his program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' <b>said</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>that</b> it was similar to the much-criticized weapons of mass destruction reporting leading up to the Iraq War.
