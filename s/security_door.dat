5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel <b>security</b> <b>door,</b> and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a <b>security</b> <b>door,</b> Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|With Kate {{convicted for}} Pope's murder, Merc plans {{a way for}} Faith to ambush the police convoy {{transporting}} her to prison, and Faith helps to free Kate. She gives Kate her comms unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he will guide her back to his hideout. When Faith returns to the hideout, she finds it in ruins, with Merc dying and Kate recaptured. In his dying words, Merc tells Faith that Kate {{is now at the}} Shard, which contains Mayor Callaghan's office and the servers that run the city's surveillance systems. With Miller's help, Faith is able to enter the Mayor's private offices, and destroys the servers that will unlock the rooftop <b>security</b> <b>door.</b> She gains access to the roof, but Miller is killed. On the roof, she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife. Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus, and {{has been part of the}} plan all along to lure the Runners out of hiding. When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter, Faith jumps on before it can leave, knocking Jacknife out of the helicopter to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process. Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter.|$|E

500|$|To {{increase}} the interactivity with the game-world, id Software designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers. Rather than using a simple [...] "use key" [...] to operate these computers, the crosshair {{acts as a}} mouse cursor over the screens allowing the player to use a computer in the game world. This allows for in-game computer terminal to perform more than one function, from operating <b>security</b> <b>door</b> codes, activating machinery, toggling lights or unlocking weapons lockers. According to the Doom 3 manual, GUI designer Patrick Duffy wrote over 500,000 lines of script code, and generated more than 25,000 image files to create all of the graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout Doom 3. Other important features of the game engine are normal mapping and specular highlighting of textures, realistic handling of object physics, dynamic, ambient soundtrack, and multi-channel sound. Doom 3 on Xbox supports 480p widescreen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Moonraker was {{composed}} by John Barry and recorded in Paris, again, as with production, marking {{a turning point}} away from the English location at CTS Studios in London. The score also marked {{a turning point in}} John Barry's output, abandoning the Kentonesque brass of his earlier Bond scores and instead scoring the film with slow, rich string passages – a trend which Barry would continue in the 1980s with scores such as Out of Africa and Somewhere in Time. For Moonraker, Barry uses {{for the first time since}} Diamonds Are Forever (1971), a piece of music called [...] "007" [...] (on track 7), and Bond smells a rat; [...] the secondary Bond theme composed by Barry which was introduced in From Russia with Love during Bond's escape with the Lektor; some classical music pieces were also included in the film. For the scene where Bond visits Drax in his chateau, Drax plays Frédéric Chopin's Prelude no. 15 in D-flat major (op. 28), [...] "Raindrop" [...] on his grand piano (although he plays in the key of D major). Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka by Johann Strauss II was featured during the hovercraft scene on the Piazza San Marco in Venice, and Tchaikovsky's [...] "Romeo and Juliet Overture" [...] was used for the scenes in Brazil in which Jaws meets Dolly following his accident. Other passages pay homage to earlier films including Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra (op. 30), associated with , with the hunting horn playing its distinctive first three notes, Elmer Bernstein's theme from The Magnificent Seven when Bond appears on horseback in gaucho clothing at MI6 headquarters in Brazil, and the alien-contacting theme from Close Encounters of the Third Kind as the key-code for a <b>security</b> <b>door</b> as mentioned previously.|$|E
