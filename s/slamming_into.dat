5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{intensified}} to EF4 {{strength as}} it entered Van Buren County and tore {{through the south}} edge of Clinton, killing three people in the vicinity. One of these deaths occurred at a boat manufacturing plant in town which was destroyed. The plant was completely leveled to the ground, with its metal beam frame severely mangled. Homes in this area were leveled and swept from their foundations, vehicles were wrapped around trees and rendered nearly unrecognizable, a dentists office was obliterated, and trees were debarked. A church and several businesses were damaged as well. 62 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 30 were severely damaged, and 31 sustained minor damage. The tornado maintained EF4 intensity as it continued into Stone County, <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> the town of Mountain View. The local hospital sustained heavy roof and wall damage, and several doctors offices were destroyed, along with a paint shop, a body shop, and a car parts store. A car dealership was completely flattened, with vehicles being tossed from the sales lot and across the highway. One vehicle was lofted a considerable distance {{through the air and}} over a building before being dropped into a ravine. Surveyors observed a utility pole in this area that was pulled up and jammed back into the ground with wires still attached. The town's fire station was heavily damaged, and one fatality occurred when a house was swept from its foundation. 38 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 15 sustained major damage, and 15 sustained minor damage in the Mountain View area. The tornado weakened slightly to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed into Izard County and impacted the rural community of Zion, killing two people, destroying 43 homes and mobile homes, severely damaging 14, and lightly damaging 36 more. Hundreds of cattle were killed in this area, and a Jeep was stripped down to its frame and tires and found wrapped around the stump of a large tree that was snapped. An unanchored home in the area was swept clean from its foundation as well, leaving only the slab behind. Maintaining EF3 intensity, the tornado then struck the town of Highland in Sharp County, resulting in severe damage. At least 40 businesses along U.S. Route 412 in Highland were damaged or destroyed, including a strip mall, a restaurant, a church, and a car dealership. The local fire station was destroyed along with much of the equipment inside, and multiple vehicles were overturned along the highway. 40 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 8 sustained major damage, and 19 sustained minor damage in the Highland area. Highland High School and two apartment buildings sustained minor damage as well. To the northeast of Highland, the tornado rapidly weakened and dissipated.|$|E
25|$|Gontermann {{was pulled}} from the wreck alive, though with severe head {{injuries}} after <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> the machine gun breeches. He {{was taken to the}} Jasta's medical bay, where he died from his injuries several hours later. Some sources say his death occurred the day after his accident.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2013, {{investigators}} from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan confirmed the load shift hypothesis {{as the starting}} point: three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles, totalling 80 tons of weight, had not been properly secured. At least one armoured vehicle had broken loose on takeoff and rolled backwards, <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> the airplane's rear bulkhead, puncturing the bulkhead and knocking out the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder. This also crippled hydraulic systems 1 and 2 and damaged the horizontal stabilizer components - most notably the jackscrew, which rendered the airplane uncontrollable. Control of the aircraft was therefore lost, with the abnormal pitch-up rotation, stall, and crash to the ground ensuing. The damage to the tail controls and hydraulic systems {{made it impossible for}} the crew to regain control of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the ARVN 39th Ranger Battalion secured their {{objective}} on Mount Chop Non, {{with the main}} formation of the Viet Cong 45th Battalion lining their troops on the rear positions of the South Vietnamese Rangers. At 2:05pm the Viet Cong finally unleashed their ambush on the ARVN 2nd Battalion, forcing the South Vietnamese infantrymen {{to fight for their}} lives. As fighting erupted on Mount Ma To, the ARVN 3rd Marine Battalion inside the village of Phuoc Loc was ordered to relieve the 2nd Battalion. However, by 3:30pm the 3rd Marine Battalion was also surrounded by the Viet Cong 60th Battalion on Hill 47, which had moved out from Vinh Loc village to engage the South Vietnamese Marines. At the same time, Viet Cong mortar fire began <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> South Vietnamese positions in the village of Phuoc Loc, and fighting continued until 5pm. When it concluded that evening both sides had suffered heavy casualties and the South Vietnamese 2nd Battalion and the 3rd Marine Battalion were forced to retreat back to Phuoc Loc with four M-113 APCs providing fire support.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{started with}} an {{exchange}} of gunfire at long range, the federal gunboats {{setting up a line}} of battle across the river and firing their rear guns at the cottonclads coming up to meet them as they entered the battle stern first. Two of the four rams advanced beyond the line of the gunboats and rammed or otherwise disrupted the movements of their opponents; the other rams misinterpreted their orders and did not enter the battle at all. With the federal rams and gunboats not coordinating their movements and the Confederate vessels operating independently, the battle soon was reduced to a melee. It is agreed by all that the ram flagship, , initiated hostilities by <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> CSS Colonel Lovell. She was then rammed in turn by {{one or more of the}} remaining cottonclads. Ellet was at this time wounded by a pistol shot in his knee, thereby becoming the only casualty on the Union side. (In the hospital, he contracted measles, the childhood disease that killed some 5,000 soldiers during the war. The combination of the disease and the debilitation caused by his wound was too great, and he died on June 21.) The remainder of the battle is obscured by more than the fog of war. Several eyewitness accounts are available; however, they are mutually contradictory to a greater degree than usual. All that is certain is that at the end of the battle, all but one of the cottonclads were either destroyed or captured, and one Yankee boat, Queen of the West, was disabled. The sole boat to escape, CSS General Earl Van Dorn, fled to the protection of the Yazoo River, just north of Vicksburg. Personnel losses among the Confederates cannot be estimated reliably.|$|E
500|$|Some {{time later}} a {{controversy}} emerged over why Monitor sank. In the Army and Navy Journal Ericsson accused {{the crew of}} drunkenness during the storm, being consequently unable to prevent the vessel from sinking. Stodder vigorously defended the crew and rebuked Ericsson's characterization of the crew and events and wrote to Pierce that Ericsson [...] "covers up defects by blaming those that are now dead", pointing out {{that there were a}} number of unavoidable events and circumstances that led to the ship's sinking, foremost being the overhang between the upper and lower hulls which came loose and partially separated during the storm from <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> the violent waves. Stodder's account was corroborated by other shipmates.|$|E

500|$|The 2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season was {{historically}} {{busy for}} the Tampa Bay area. The region {{was affected by}} a record four hurricanes that year; Frances, Jeanne, Charley, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Ivan. [...] Jeanne and Frances passed over Tampa as tropical storms after making their way across the state from the east coast. Charley was forecast to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay from the south-southwest, which would have been the worst-case scenario for local storm surge flooding. But the storm made a sudden and unexpected turn to the northeast and brought only tropical storm force winds to the region, devastating the Ft. Myers/Port Charlotte area instead. [...] Ivan also threatened the area as it moved north up the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It remained far to the west of central Florida, however, and brought only a bit of rain and wind to Tampa Bay before eventually <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> coastal Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.|$|E
500|$|L'Estrange's balloon descended rapidly {{over the}} rooftops of Woolloomooloo, <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> a house near {{the corner of}} Palmer Street and Robinson Lane. L'Estrange managed to {{disentangle}} himself and fell first onto a chimney then a shed [...] below. He scrambled down from the rooftops to a waiting mob, who whisked him away to Robinson's hotel on the William Street corner and would not let him leave. At the crash site, during an attempt to free the balloon, the escaping gas was ignited when the resident of the house opened a window {{to see what the}} commotion was and the gas came into contact with the open flame of the room's chandelier. The resulting fireball destroyed the balloon, burnt a number of bystanders and was bright enough to [...] "...cast a brief but vivid illumination over the entire suburb". A panicked crush developed as groups tried to both flee from and rush towards the brief, but extremely bright, conflagration while those further away at the launch site assumed L'Estrange had been killed. Several people were injured in the crush or burned by the fire with one lady reportedly being blinded.|$|E
500|$|After {{these two}} {{relatively}} underdistributed albums, Bleeding Through signed {{to a larger}} label, Trustkill Records in 2003, releasing their third full-length album in September of the same year. Promoting the Ulrich Wild produced This is Love, This is Murderous they embarked upon US nationwide touring, opening for AFI. These dates had propelled the band to national attention albeit for all the wrong reasons. Traveling from Utah to a show in Colorado the group's vehicle hit black ice on the highway, {{spinning out of control}} and <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> a truck that was already flipped over. A mobile TV unit, there to report on another crash, caught the entire incident on film as their equipment trailer rolled and exploded, showering their instruments and gear across the road. Fortunately the band escaped with only minor injuries (Johnson had a minor cut on his head), but due to this accident they had to drop off the [...] "Pure Hatred" [...] tour with Chimaira, Soilwork and As I Lay Dying. The KSL-TV footage of the accident taking place can be viewed in Real Media format on the channel's official site. The dramatic televised footage was broadcast everywhere from CNN Headline News, Good Morning America, NBC News and even The Weather Channel.|$|E

500|$|Reeves and Baker {{completed}} {{a third and}} final draft that was [...] "substantially toned down" [...] in content from the previous attempts. This version of the screenplay, which was filmed {{with only a few}} minor revisions during the production, was missing many of the more explicit moments of violence described in the first submitted drafts: the death spasms of the pre-credits hanging victim, Lowes getting stabbed fifteen times with a steel spike, and a sniper's victim somersaulting through the air and <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> a tree. A sequence depicting the Battle of Naseby was to be filmed, during which a soldier's head was to be cut off on screen. Most significantly, the film's finale was completely altered. In the original ending, Stearne falls in with a group of gypsies and attempts to rape one of their women, who successfully fights off her attacker by plunging her thumbs into his eyes, blinding him. The gypsies then stake him to death. Marshall arrives and convinces the gypsies to assist him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is viciously beaten by Marshall, who forces a [...] "confession" [...] out of the bloodied man. Marshall partially drowns Hopkins (whose thumbs have been tied to his feet), then finally hangs him. Tenser had previously expressed concerns regarding the scope of the Battle of Naseby sequence as well as the gypsy-ending, noting that these would both require the employment of additional groups of extras. He asked Reeves and Baker to remove the battle sequence and simplify the ending for the final draft.|$|E
500|$|The three cannot {{return to}} the present right away since the [...] "return pad" [...] to Stewie's time machine fails to activate. [...] They decide to go to England where Mort, who is Jewish, will be safe from the Nazis. While {{attempting}} to cross the border, German officers find out that Mort is Jewish (while doing a poor impersonation of a Catholic priest), resulting in their being chased by the Nazis. [...] Mort, Stewie and Brian make a getaway on a motorbike, followed by an elaborate undersea pursuit in a hijacked U-boat. The chase scene on the motorbike re-enacts the skateboard chase scene in Back To The Future. [...] Like Biff, the Nazi officers' car ends up <b>slamming</b> <b>into</b> a manure truck ("Das Poop!"). [...] The three make it to England safely, and see Winston Churchill. Stewie examines the return pad and discovers it has run out uranium fuel. [...] Brian states that the only place they can find the needed uranium in this time is at a [...] "secret" [...] nuclear testing facility in Berlin, Nazi Germany. The three join the Royal Air Force and fly a Lancaster bomber as they participate in a dogfight against a squadron of Luftwaffe Me-109 fighters, eventually reaching Berlin. After finding the nuclear research lab, Stewie disguises himself as Adolf Hitler, while the other two disguise themselves as Nazi Officers, and obtains the needed uranium. They then run into the real Hitler, who orders their execution, but they escape on the return pad back to their time (Hitler offered to spare them if they performed a charming musical number, but Mort cuts the eager Stewie and Brian off at the first line).|$|E
