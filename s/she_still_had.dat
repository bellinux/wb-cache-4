5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired studio audience, combined {{with two of the}} panellists, disagreed with the decision, feeling that Claire should have been fired for her complete lack of respect, although Simon himself said that he deserved to be fired.

25|$|After {{the parent}} album failed to chart or produce {{successful}} follow-ups, the Motown-styled These Arms was released, but it flopped and was quickly withdrawn, and Wells' Epic contract fizzled. The album's failure {{may have been}} due to light promotion. <b>She</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> one more album in her CBS contract, and in 1982 released an album of cover songs, Easy Touch, which aimed for the adult contemporary radio format.|$|E
25|$|When MacKillop {{returned}} to Australia in January 1875, after {{an absence of}} nearly two years, she brought approval from Rome for her sisters and the work they did, materials for her school, books for the convent library, several priests and most of all, 15 new Josephites from Ireland. Regardless of her success, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{to contend with the}} opposition of priests and several bishops. This did not change after her unanimous election as superior general in March 1875.|$|E
25|$|If {{her good}} looks, strong clear voice, and lively wit were {{responsible}} for catching the eye of Killigrew, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to prove herself clever enough to succeed as an actress. This was no easy task in the Restoration theatre; the limited pool of audience members meant that very short runs were the norm for plays and fifty different productions might be mounted in the nine-month season lasting from September to June. She was reputed to have been illiterate.|$|E

The British authorities seized Patria on 15 August and placed her under {{the management of}} the British-India Steam Navigation Co. She was assigned to be a troop ship, authorised to carry 1,800 troops (excluding the crew). <b>She</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> only enough lifeboats for the original 805 passengers and crew, so these were supplemented with liferafts.|$|E
25|$|Her advisor W.P. Fraser {{travelled}} to Western Canada in 1917 so {{he could}} begin researching stem rust from a devastating epidemic in 1916 that had destroyed 100 million bushels of wheat worth about $200 million. He assigned Newton to study the samples he collected, who accepted only after the school's dean eliminated restrictions on women using laboratory facilities at night; <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{to contend with the}} 22:00 curfew of her residence. During her research, she discovered that stem rust spores infected wheat with different rapaciousness.|$|E

25|$|With Vindex {{damaged and}} needing a refit and Campania still not commissioned, Nairana {{was the only}} ship of her class fit for sea on 1 April 1944.

At the end of the month Vindex joined the 5th Escort Group. On 6 May a patrolling Swordfish was contacted by two of the escort frigates, who reported they were in contact with a submerged U-boat. The frigates carried out a depth charge attack and forced U-765 to the surface. The Swordfish despite the anti-aircraft fire from the U-boat dropped two of its depth charges which broke the submarine in half.|$|E
25|$|Without any obvious cause Genie's {{incontinence}} immediately resurfaced, and {{was especially}} severe {{for the first}} few weeks after she moved in but persisted at a lower level for several months. In contrast to Butler's writings, the Riglers observed Genie still acted out her anger on herself and noted that certain situations in particular, such as spilling containers of liquid, sent her into tantrum behavior, which doctors attributed to her having been beaten for these actions as a child. The research team recorded her speech being much more halting and hesitant than Butler described, writing that Genie very rarely spoke and that, for {{the first three months of}} her stay, almost always used one-word utterances. Unless she saw something which frightened her both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency, often several minutes delayed, for no clear reason, and <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> no reaction to temperature. She continued to have a very difficult time controlling her impulses, frequently engaging in highly anti-social and destructive behavior.|$|E
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the words she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E

25|$|Concerned by {{the poor}} start in the Warwick, Waller decided to add ear muffs to Winx's racing {{equipment}} to help her relax – she had always worn them during trackwork but previously had them removed in the parade ring before racing. She made her next start on 2 September in the Chelmsford Stakes at Randwick. This time she broke well and settled {{near the front of}} the main pack. On the lead, Red Excitement set a quick pace and opened up a large lead of five lengths to the second place horse, who in turn was over five lengths in front of Winx. Turning into the stretch, Winx moved into second but still had five lengths to make up on Red Excitement with 450m remaining. At the 200m mark, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> three lengths to make up when Bowman dropped the whip. Under a hand ride, Winx continued to close ground and pulled clear in the final strides to win by a length.|$|E
25|$|Darnell Leroy Wilkes (played by Flex Alexander Season 1, Khalil Kain Seasons 2–8) is Maya's husband. He and Maya {{married at}} a young age and had Jabari.

Sister Jude knows her to be the Angel of Death, but {{questions}} her about why she has appeared now, instead of the many other times when she attempted suicide: the night her husband left her after she {{told him he had}} infected her with syphilis, leaving her barren, or the night she committed the hit-and-run. Shachath tells her that the other times, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> hope and purpose, but now she is willing to help Jude find peace. Sister Jude agrees, but says she must do one last thing. She visits the parents of the girl she killed, Missy, claiming to be a nun who found her calling after hearing of Missy's accident. She is intent on telling them the truth, when an adult Missy (Kristin Slaysman) walks into the home, revealing that she had in fact survived the accident. Sister Jude is stunned and the parents recount that they never learned who was responsible, but have made peace with it.|$|E

Passing up the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, her commander, Lieutenant Gabriel-Etienne-Louis Le Marant Kerdaniel, raided British {{merchant}} shipping and was consequently delayed. At 15:00 on 5 July, the 20-gun sloop HMS Bonne Citoyenne under Captain William Mounsey, on passage from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Quebec, spotted Furieuse to the southwest taking possession of a British merchant ship. As Bonne Citoyenne approached, Kerdaniel abandoned the merchant ship and sailed northwards, Mounsey giving chase but trailing [...] behind throughout the day.|$|E

Upon her return, Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) learned that Naomi had been in Melbourne instead of Hawaii and Toadie accused her of sending Sonya poison-pen letters. Naomi denied being the sender.|$|E

[...] Todd had thought he had cured her, multiple times, but <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> episodes, and when she had to attend to a large farm in empty Vermont alone, she was pushed over the edge. This began his theory that mental retardation (insanity at the time) was a disease and had a cause and possibly a cure. This began his revolutionary treatments, and what made the government give so much money for the mental hospital to be built.|$|E
