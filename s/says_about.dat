5|$|What Arafat <b>says</b> <b>about</b> me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also}} {{a whole list of}} Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance <b>says</b> <b>about</b> their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E

25|$|The {{real problem}} is what this movie <b>says</b> <b>about</b> us. When those Abu Ghraib {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half of}} America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E

25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in it that we could not infer from Tibullus himself and from what Horace <b>says</b> <b>about</b> Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. It is another moot question of some importance whether our poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia. Porphyrio's view was examined by Postgate (Selections from Tibullus, appendix A).|$|E

50|$|Foundationalism can be {{compared}} to a building. Ordinary individual beliefs occupy the upper stories of the building; basic, or foundational beliefs are down in the basement, in the foundation of the building, holding everything else up. In a similar way, individual beliefs, <b>say</b> <b>about</b> economics or ethics, rest on more basic beliefs, <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the nature of human beings; and those rest on still more basic beliefs, <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the mind; and in the end the entire system rests on a set of basic beliefs which are not justified by other beliefs.|$|R

500|$|However, because Wollstonecraft {{herself is}} {{contradictory}} and vague in the unfinished Wrongs of Woman, {{there is no}} real scholarly consensus on what exactly the novel <b>says</b> <b>about</b> sensibility. Wollstonecraft is intentionally breaking the conventions of sentimental fiction, but exactly what her goals are in doing so is unclear. [...] For example, Maria and Jemima can seemingly be identified with the traditional categories of [...] "reason" [...] (Jemima) and [...] "sensibility" [...] (Maria), but since such couples were usually male and female, Wollstonecraft's characterization challenges conventional definitions of gender.|$|E
500|$|Except {{for when}} Hagström needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing.

But {{most of the}} time I'll just present the drums, and explain my ideas {{for the rest of the}} song, sing some riffs." [...] The band uses Cubase to record the tracks, and the guitars are routed through {{software}} amplifier modeling, because it allows them to change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded.|$|E
