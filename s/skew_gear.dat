25|$|On 31 May 1958 Henry Blogg {{took part}} in an unusual rescue when she was called to aid the Sheringham {{lifeboat}} Forester's Centenary. This service began with a call at 9.50am to the Sheringham honorary secretary from the Trinity House Superintendent of Great Yarmouth requesting that a sick man {{be taken off the}} Dudgeon Light-vessel. At 10.15am the Sheringham lifeboat Forester's Centenary was launched with a doctor on board and she reached the light-vessel by 1.10pm. The doctor went aboard the light-vessel and dispensed a sedative to the sick man and he was then strapped to a stretcher and transferred to the Forester's Centenary. The lifeboat then set off on the return journey to her station. Nine miles north east from home at around 4.40pm the Forester's Centenary was in trouble when her <b>skew</b> <b>gear</b> which drives the lifeboat's oil and water pumps broke down. Henry Blogg was called out and had to take the Sheringham lifeboat in to tow. Both boats arrived back at the Sheringham station at 7.00pm and the sick man was taken to hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Lubrication {{is fully}} forced and the gear type oil pump is driven {{vertically}} {{in tandem with}} the ignition distributor from a single <b>skew</b> <b>gear</b> on the camshaft ...|$|E
50|$|Other {{signs of}} the Morris origins of the design were the {{crankcase}} being cast with strengthening ribs (a feature not introduced to the A-Series until 1980) and the big end bearings being split diagonally rather than horizontally. The C-Series also had a hydraulic tensioning unit for its timing chain and had the oil pump and distributor driven via separate sets of skew-cut gears on the camshaft. This was relatively unusual for mass-produced engines of the time; the A- and B-Series engines, and most of their contemporaries, had both oil pump and distributor driven by one shaft driven from one <b>skew</b> <b>gear.</b> The C-Series' arrangement reduced load on the gears and therefore wear, preventing the ignition timing falling out of specification over time.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is a diagram due to Martin Disteli. The diagram, {{illustrating}} the relation between the angular velocities of a pair of <b>skew</b> <b>gears,</b> is intended for the analysis of the relative screw motion between the two gears. The diagram, based on a circle, seems to have been overlooked by the community of kinematicians...|$|R

50|$|The {{connecting}} rods {{for the two}} cylinders are {{side by side on}} the same crank pin making firing points equidistant. The engine is mounted directly on the chassis frame. It can be seen from the illustration the rearmost bracket rolls over the flywheel making the rear mountings much further apart from the front set than would be allowed by mounting the engine direct from the very short block. Magneto, distributor and water pump are driven by <b>skew</b> <b>gear</b> from the front of the crankshaft as are the pinions and chains which drive the valve shafts operating the sleeve valves. The two jet carburettor incorporates a silencer on its air intake. The first jet is used only at starting or at idle.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{synthesis}} of spatial cycloidal gears, based on Disteli’s work, which was published {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century. In particular, the properties of the cylindroid or Plücker’s conoid for the relative motion between a pair of <b>skew</b> <b>gears</b> are analyzed in order to extend Reuleaux’s principle from the planar and spherical cases to the spatial case with the aim of synthesizing a pair of conjugate cycloidal teeth. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} {{methodology}} for a <b>skew</b> line <b>gear</b> pair oriented to additive manufacturing technology, with an one-tooth driving line gear and its coupled driven line gear, {{used for the}} conventional powered transmission, is researched based on strength analysis. First, the expressions of meshing forces on the line tooth of line gears are deduced; the deformations and stresses of existing structures of a line gear pair are analyzed by using ANSYS Workbench. Then, the reliable structure and the parameters standardization formulae of a line gear pair are deduced by stiffness and strength analyses. Finally, a design case shows that the proposed design methods provide a convenient and reasonable design tool for designing a <b>skew</b> line <b>gear</b> pair in conventional powered transmission field...|$|R
50|$|The Silver Hawk’s 592 cc {{design was}} a {{development}} of the Silver Arrow and shared a similar frame design and cycle parts, {{as well as the}} monoblock 26 degree V with a one-piece OHC head concept. The single bevel-gear overhead camshaft ran across the cylinder head and four bores with special air cooling housed two pairs of cylinders at 26 degrees to each other. A single carburettor fed all four induction valves through a cross shaped induction that produced an uneven feed. Coil and dynamo ignition was driven by <b>skew</b> <b>gearing</b> from the camshaft-drive vertical shaft. A dry-sump oil system was supplied from a steel tank {{at the base of the}} front-down tube, bolted to the engine's crankcase. The engine was flexible, however, and could be started by hand and run in top gear most of the time. This was an important factor for the hand operated gear change.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} helical-bevel gearing (HBG). The helical-bevel gearing commonly {{includes a}} cylindrical and a bevel gear. The tooth profiles {{can be either}} spur or helical. The involute HBG provides an opportunity to design a broad variety of gear trains, unobtainable {{by the use of}} conventional types of gears. The article defines methods of their generation, a contact shape and points out advantages of various arrangements of gears, diagrams of an external helical-bevel <b>gearing</b> <b>skew</b> axis, hypoid <b>gearing,</b> intersecting axes, parallel axes. The expediency of the use of such gear in a machine drive is justified...|$|R
50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical <b>skew</b> <b>gears</b> from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil pump driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil pump drive remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a blanking plate. Small engines, or scooters may have internal gear pumps mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The C11 engine had an iron {{barrel and}} alloy head with {{overhead}} valves operated by pushrods which ran {{in a separate}} tube to fully enclosed rockers. The camshaft was geared directly from the crankshaft with <b>skew</b> <b>gears</b> driving the oil pump and the contact breaker assembly mounted behind the cylinder via a shaft. The alternator was {{to the left and}} the primary drive was via a duplex chain to a multi plate clutch. The four speed gearbox was {{at the rear of the}} vertically split crankcase. The frame was single loop with twin rails under the engine and pivoted fork rear suspension, and both wheels were 17 inch with full width cast iron hubs. An oil tank was under the seat on the right matched by a toolbox on the left. Between them was an ignition switch panel hiding the battery. The headlamp was fitted in a nacelle which also housed the instruments and switches as was fashionable at the time. Deeply valanced mudguards were fitted to the standard model, making it look heavier than it actually was.|$|R
40|$|All normal {{lines of}} a helical {{developable}} Φ have the same distance to its axis a and make the same angle with a. This implies that on coaxial one-sheet hyperboloids of revolution or skew ruled helical surfaces with generators included in the normal-congruence of Φ any orthogonal trajectory of the rulings is located on a translate of Φ. Let line n be the normal of the helical developable Φ at C. When Φ performs a helical motion or rotation about its axis a with constant velocity, then the point C of intersection with the fixed normal line n runs along n with constant velocity, too. The same holds for circular involutes in the plane. This property offers the most simple way to grasp why helical developables serve as tooth flanks for <b>skew</b> <b>gearing</b> according to Jack Phillips (2003) and why the gear ratio is independent from the relative position of their axes. The generators of two conjugate tooth flanks Φ 1 and Φ 2 passing through the instantaneous point C of contact remain parallel to their respective initial position. The corresponding osculating cones of the tooth flanks have axes fixed in the gear box and parallel to the related helical axis...|$|R
50|$|The Concorde {{was missing}} the crucial spacer {{from the left}} main landing gear beam {{that would have made}} for a snug-fitting pivot. This {{compromised}} the alignment of the landing gear and the wobbling beam and gears allowing three degrees of movement possible in any direction. The uneven load on the left leg's three remaining tyres <b>skewed</b> the landing <b>gear,</b> with the scuff marks of four tyres on the runway showing that the plane was veering to the left. Air France found out that its maintenance staff had not replaced or renewed the spacer, which was found in a workshop after the crash.|$|R
40|$|The {{computerized}} {{design of}} advanced straight and <b>skew</b> bevel <b>gears</b> produced by precision forging is proposed. Modifications of the tooth surfaces {{of one of}} the members of the gear set are proposed in order to localize the bearing contact and predesign a favorable function of transmission errors. The proposed modifications of the tooth surfaces will be computed by using a modified imaginary crown-gear and applied in manufacturing through the use of the proper die geometry. The geometry of the die is obtained for each member of the gear set from their theoretical geometry obtained considering its generation by the corresponding imaginary crown-gear. Two types of surface modification, whole and partial crowning, are investigated in order to get the more effective way of surface modification of skew and straight bevel gears. A favorable function of transmission errors is predesigned to allow low levels of noise and vibration of the gear drive. Numerical examples of design of both skew and straight bevel gear drives are included to illustrate the advantages of the proposed geometry.

40|$|A pair of {{hypoid gears}} {{refers to a}} pinion and a <b>gear</b> with <b>skew</b> axes. Hypoid <b>gears</b> are crucial to some power {{transmission}} systems, {{such as those of}} helicopters, power generation machines and automobiles. However, the design and manufacturing of hypoid gears are quite difficult. Currently, the major parameters of hypoid gears are calculated, but the geometries of the gears are not fully defined. To machine a hypoid gear, parameters of cutting systems are determined according to the gear design, whereas, settings of CNC machine tools with the machining parameters are also computed. The existing hypoid gears machining methods use the simplified blade model of the cutting systems, resulting in large errors in the machined gears. This new work proposes an accurate approach, to determine the parameters of the cutting system blades, for the face-milling of hypoid gears. In this work, a parametric model of the blades is established; and according to the hypoid gear parameters, the pressure angle and the cutting system radius are precisely calculated. Currently, hypoid gear engineers can use special CAD/CAM software to design the gears and to calculate machine settings. Unfortunately, these software are developed only for particular machine tools; it cannot be used for hypoid gear machine tools of different configurations. Moreover, few technical articles has been published to clearly address challenges in the CNC programming and post-processing for the multi-axis face-milling of hypoid gears, such as the parameters determination of a cutter system, its location and orientation calculation and CNC programs generation. To solve the current problems, another part of this research proposes a generic approach to CNC programming and post-processing for gear face-milling. The main contributions of this part includes (1) a new mathematical model to calculate the cutter system location and orientation and (2) a generic post-processing method to establish the machine kinematics chain and to compute the coordinates of the machine axes in face-milling. This approach provides a general and accurate methodology for the face-milling of hypoid gears on any machine tools and can be directly applied to the hypoid gear manufacturing for better quality...|$|R
