50|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>pusher</b> designs vary {{across the}} industry. They are {{typically}} between 3 ft m and 5.5 ft m high and range from 6 ft m to 40 ft m wide. Snow pushers are typically mounted on wheel loaders, skid steers, or backhoes. For wheel loaders and backhoes, they are mounted using a universal mounting system {{that consists of}} a set of posts (or plates) between which the machine bucket is placed. Chains are attached to the <b>snow</b> <b>pusher</b> and the bucket and tightened using a chain binder. This system allows for snow pushers to be mounted on any machine without regard for brand-specific mounting brackets. Skid steer loaders can use the universal mounting system; however, most manufacturers typically offer skid steer snow pushers with a universally accepted quick-attach system. Though the <b>snow</b> <b>pusher</b> might seem like a simple product, there are many variations across the industry in areas such as moldboard height and angle, sidewall support system (post, wedge, or unsupported), trip edge system, shoe thickness, and rubber cutting edge quality, to name a few.|$|E
50|$|Although snow pushers did {{not become}} widely used until the 1980s, they have {{been around since the}} 1970s. Initially, they were not {{produced}} by manufacturers, but they were recognized as a good idea by snow removal professionals who either welded their own or contracted to have them fabricated. For a long time, the most common <b>snow</b> <b>pusher</b> design was to take a septic tank or other large steel cylinder and cut it in half, then build a mounting system on the back to attach it to a machine. This type of bare bones construction lasted until the 1990s when various manufacturers began producing them commercially.|$|E
50|$|The {{oldest and}} still {{common form of}} alpine ski turn is the stem, turning {{the front of the}} skis {{sideways}} from the body so they form an angle against the direction of travel. In doing so, the ski <b>pushes</b> <b>snow</b> forward and to the side, and the <b>snow</b> <b>pushes</b> the skier back and to the opposite side. The force backwards directly counteracts gravity, and slows the skier. The force to the sides, if unbalanced, will cause the skier to turn.|$|R
60|$|He trembled so that {{he could}} hardly spread the {{remaining}} quilts over the dead face. The box was wide enough to receive the stiff, curved right arm, and {{he had nothing to do}} but to nail the cover on, which he did in feverish haste. Then he rose, grasped his tools, rushed outside, slammed the door, and set off in great speed across the <b>snow,</b> <b>pushed</b> on by an indescribable horror.|$|R
50|$|New Jersey's major {{towns and}} cities were {{particularly}} hard hit with snow and some rain coming onshore. During the day, rain inundated the coastline as temperatures were not cold enough for snow. Around 5 P.M, heavy <b>snow</b> <b>pushed</b> the rain offshore, making for blizzard conditions along the coast. In New Jersey, anywhere from 2 to 20 inches of snow fell. During {{the height of the}} storm, power was knocked out in places from Paterson, New Jersey to Cape May, New Jersey.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a nod to}} Disney, Gina {{explains}} to Bart that she got into juvie because she <b>pushed</b> <b>Snow</b> White off the Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland.|$|R
50|$|Daigle {{invented the}} Daigle Banger, a ski ballet {{manoeuvre}} that involves a front flip and rotation {{during which the}} skier's uphill hand or arm comes {{into contact with the}} <b>snow,</b> and <b>pushes</b> off once the front flip has been landed. The Daigle Banger became a widely used ski ballet manoeuvre during competition in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Artists {{come from}} all over the world to create a {{community}} of urban street and <b>snow</b> ingenuity, and <b>push</b> the boundaries of the State of the Art.|$|R
5000|$|A {{snow blower}} or snow thrower is a machine for {{removing}} snow {{from an area}} where it is not wanted, such as a driveway, sidewalk, roadway, railroad track, ice rink, or runway. The misnomer [...] "snow blower" [...] is often used, as the snow is moved using an auger or impeller instead of blowing it. It can use either electric power (line power or battery), or a gasoline or diesel engine to throw snow to another location or into a truck to be hauled away. This is {{in contrast with the}} action of <b>snow</b> plows, which <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> to the front or side.|$|R
60|$|The <b>snow</b> was <b>pushed</b> {{away from}} before Tom's face, {{his left arm}} was cleared, and then his uncle with a {{vigorous}} pull brought him back close to him. Here he was comparatively free, for {{a part of the}} roof had fallen close to the wall and had partially kept off the snow. Then Harry turned, and with some difficulty managed to get Jerry, who was next to him, freed from the snow.|$|R
50|$|Most snow shovels are {{designed}} for either <b>pushing</b> <b>snow</b> or lifting snow, although some are crossovers which can do either job. Some snow shovel scoops have sharpened blades which can chip away and lever up slabs of ice.|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} to stub switches {{is that they}} work better in the snow. The sideways action of the point rails <b>pushes</b> <b>snow</b> to the side, instead of packing the snow between the points and the rail in a more modern design.|$|R
50|$|A {{snowplow}} {{works by}} using a blade to <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> to the side to clear it from a surface. Modern plows may include technology {{to make it easier}} to perform the work and stay on the road. These include Global Positioning System receivers, head-up displays and infrared cameras.|$|R
5000|$|A new {{overhead}} cam Jeep Tornado engine 230 CID L straight-six producing [...] was standard. Innovations for four-wheel-drive pickups included optional automatic transmission (an industry first), {{as well as}} power brakes, power steering, and a Power Take-Off unit for numerous accessories that included <b>snow</b> plows and <b>push</b> plates.|$|R
50|$|Wedge snowplows {{were the}} {{traditional}} mechanized method of clearing snow from railroad tracks. These <b>pushed</b> <b>snow</b> off the tracks, deflecting {{it to the}} side. Deeper drifts cannot easily be cleared by this method; there is simply too much snow to be moved. For this purpose, the rotary snowplow was devised.|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that pronival (protalus) ramparts can be formed by a snow-push mechanism and need not accumulate {{in the conventional}} manner {{as a result of}} supranival processes. Ridges in pronival positions up to 1. 2 m high and of unequivocal snow-push origin are described from two sites in Smørbotn cirque, Romsdalsalpane, southern Norway. The seven lines of evidence are: (1) parallel abrasion tracks on large boulders embedded in the substrate; (2) displaced surface and embedded clasts with proximal furrows; (3) corrugated (flute-like) substrate surfaces; (4) the sickle-shaped plan-form of the ridges; (5) generally asymmetrical ridge cross-profiles (shallow, concave proximal; steep, convex distal); (6) strong preferred orientations and dips of surface-embedded clasts on ridge proximal slopes; and (7) a subnival/pronival ridge comprising loosely packed diamicton forming along the contact zone between the snowbed and substrate. This evidence indicates ridge formation by snow sliding involving bulldozing of the substrate. Factors considered important in favouring <b>snow</b> <b>push</b> producing distinct pronival ramparts at the sites include: a maritime periglacial climate with heavy winter snowfall and rapid snow-firn conversion producing snow densities of up to 900 kg m– 3; a deformable substrate with relatively small inputs of rockfall or avalanche debris; and a steep headwall susceptible to snow avalanching and hence enhanced snow supply. Consideration is given to the prospect that larger pronival ramparts can form incrementally by a snow-push mechanism...|$|R
50|$|A snow groomer is a {{tracked vehicle}} {{equipped}} in front {{with a shovel}} (or dozer blade) and behind with a cutter (or roller). It is usually driven by diesel engines. When the machine drives over a snowfield, it <b>pushes</b> <b>snow</b> ahead of it and, at the same time, smooths out any surface unevenness.|$|R
50|$|Snow pushers (also {{known as}} box plows, {{containment}} plows, or box style plows) {{are designed to}} move <b>snow</b> by <b>pushing</b> it straight ahead. They do this by being constructed with a curved moldboard that lies perpendicular to the direction of travel and a sidewall at either end that keeps the snow contained. For parking lots, runways, laneways, etc. this is an improvement on the traditional windrow plowing, which uses an angled plow to move snow to the side. Snow pushers allow the snow to be moved en masse and completely off site to be piled someplace out of the way.|$|R
5000|$|The Blizzard of 1966 {{swept across}} {{most of the}} United States and Canada east of the Rocky Mountains on January 29, 1966, and brought record low temperatures, high winds and heavy {{snowfall}} in its wake. Within days, at least 142 people had been killed — 31 had frozen to death, 46 died in fires that started while {{people were trying to}} heat their home. Others died from heart attacks while shoveling <b>snow</b> or <b>pushing</b> cars, or traffic accidents caused by slick roads. [...] The death toll reached 201 by Wednesday, February 2, as the storm eased.|$|R
5000|$|Snow in {{the state}} of Louisiana {{presents}} a rare and serious problem because of the state's subtropical climate. For <b>snow</b> to <b>push</b> into the southern region of Louisiana, extreme weather conditions for the area must be present, usually a low-pressure system coupled with unusually low temperatures. [...] Average snowfall in Louisiana is approximately 0.2 in per year, a low figure rivaled only by the states of Florida and Hawaii. [...] Due to the infrequency of these cold weather patterns, southern areas affected in this state are often unprepared to deal with slick streets and freezing temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|The windrows {{created by}} the plows in {{residential}} areas often block driveways and imprison parked cars. The <b>snow</b> <b>pushed</b> there by any plow is a dense, packed version of [...] "normal" [...] fallen snow. When the temperatures are significantly below freezing this packed snow takes some {{of the characteristics of}} solid ice. Its removal is nearly impossible without mechanical means.The largest roads and highways are the first to be cleared; roads with steep hills or other dangers are also often a priority. Streets used by buses and other mass transit are also often given higher priorities. It often takes many hours, or even days, to cover every street in a city. In some places, a snow emergency will be declared, where automobile owners are instructed to remove their vehicles from the street (or one side of a street). If cars are in the way when the plows come around, they may be hauled away by tow trucks. Some communities have standing snow emergency rules in winter, in which vehicles may not be parked on streets overnight, whether it snows or not. After smaller snow storms only main roads are cleared while residential ones are left to be melted by passing traffic. Decisions on immediate removal versus [...] "natural melting" [...] can be hard to make because the inconvenience to citizens and the economy in general must be weighed against the immediate effect on the snow removal budget at that particular moment in the season.|$|R
50|$|Handles may be {{straight}} or bent. Straight handles make the pushing angle easier to adjust and snow throwing easier {{compared to a}} bent handle. Long handles enable the user to leverage their weight for <b>pushing</b> <b>snow,</b> but shorter handles make tossing snow easier. Plastic and fiberglass handles are lightweight, while wood handles are heavy. Metal handles conduct heat away from the hands more readily than other kinds of handles, so they feel colder.|$|R
50|$|Moguls are {{a series}} of bumps on a piste formed when skiers <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> into mounds as they do sharp turns. This tends to happen {{naturally}} as skiers use the slope but they can also be constructed artificially. Once formed, a naturally occurring mogul tends to grow as skiers follow similar paths around it, further deepening the surrounding grooves known as troughs. Since skiing tends to be {{a series of}} linked turns, moguls form together to create a bump field.|$|R
50|$|Snow removal {{services}} may include driveway and parking area snow removal, walkway and deck handwork, and occasionally roof clearing. Contractors use hand shovels, walk behind snowblowers (or snow throwers), truck plows, skid-steers, light-weight tractors, and heavy front-end loaders. Many times, these machines will require use of tire chains {{to perform their}} tasks. <b>Snow</b> may be <b>pushed</b> by plowing methods or blown to {{an area of the}} property by snowblowers. Contracts may apply sand or salt in some locations to help melt ice accumulations.|$|R
5000|$|The Big Drift is in Glacier National Park, in the U.S. {{state of}} Montana {{and is an}} area along the Going-to-the-Sun Road where {{a large amount of}} winter snow can {{accumulate}} to depths of 80 ft. [...] Located immediately east of Logan Pass, the westerly winds <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> over the crest of the Continental Divide onto the eastern flank of a long arête which extends south from Pollock Mountain. West of the divide, this arête is known as the Garden Wall.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} after-school activities, like sewing, {{computer}} time, an open gym {{for students and}} teachers, and sports teams. The primary sport {{in the school and}} in the surrounding Tłı̨chǫ areas is soccer. The entire school takes part in the yearly Get Active event. Every school in the Northwest Territories takes part in this event. The Dene Games is a yearly event; schools from the surrounding Tłı̨chǫ area take part. Stick Pull, <b>Snow</b> Snake, Pole <b>Push,</b> Hand Games, and Finger Pull are the games taken.|$|R
50|$|In {{places with}} light snow, brooms or other light {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to brush off snow from walks and other surfaces. In regions with more precipitation, snow is commonly removed with snow shovels, a large lightweight shovel used to <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> and lift it, and snow scoops or sleigh shovels, a large and deep hopper-like implement fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it on any slippery surface to another location without lifting. Other tools include snow pushers and shovels with one or more wheels.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the unusually}} brutal winter of 2014–15, the entire MBTA system {{was shut down}} on several {{occasions}} by heavy snowfalls. The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail, which iced over during storms. When a single train stopped due to power loss, other trains soon stopped as well; without continually running trains <b>pushing</b> <b>snow</b> off the rails, the lines were quickly covered in snow. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead lines on its surface section due to its proximity to corrosive salt air, it was not subject to icing issues.) ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, SPUIs can be {{somewhat}} difficult to clear of snow. The large {{area in which}} lanes cross {{may have to be}} shut down to allow efficient and thorough cleaning lest a snowplow leave piles of snow, interfering with traffic and visibility {{in the middle of the}} uncontrolled pavement. Additionally, if the wide area of uncontrolled pavement is on a bridge, as in the diagram, the <b>snow</b> cannot be <b>pushed</b> to the sides of the bridge as it may pose a hazard to the road underneath. This problem can be exacerbated by the comparatively large bridge width required by the SPUI.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive {{propelled}} Jordan Ditcher/Spreaders {{are still}} sometimes used to plow especially deep {{snow in the}} US on the former Wisconsin Central railroad. These machines carry large main plows and hydraulic or air powered articulating wings to <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> {{far away from the}} tracks, sometimes past the next adjacent track to facilitate clearing snow from yards and sidings. These machines can also used to create ditches and plow the tracks clear of loose material during maintenance operations. Russell Plows are still in service at some locations, with large front wedge plows and shorter hinged air powered wings only suitable for plowing snow.|$|R

5000|$|... 3rd: The plow has a {{vertical}} wedge to <b>push</b> the <b>snow</b> horizontally {{away from the}} track. The vertical wedge may be less acute than the horizontal wedge, but often included a cast or sheet metal cutting edge on wooden plows. <b>Pushing</b> <b>snow</b> horizontally off the track may create an unbalanced horizontal force where asymmetrical snow accumulation is encountered. (such as snow drifting into {{one side of a}} cut) This unbalanced force may derail the plow. The leading edge of the horizontal wedge is typically forward of the vertical wedge so stabilizing downward snow loading precedes horizontal loads.|$|R
50|$|Snow shovels {{designed}} for lifting snow generally have smaller scoops than snow shovels {{designed for}} throwing snow. A typical push-type shovel scoop {{would be about}} 24 inches across with a wide, blunt blade, while a lift-type shovel scoop may be half that size. A narrower scoop makes the removal of deep, wet, or heavy snow easier. Scoops with a large curve can carry more snow, while those with a shallow curve are intended to <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> rather than carry it. Metal scoops are studier than plastic but heavier, and they also require more maintenance. Steel and steel-edged scoops are heavier than aluminum or plastic, but are also more durable. Although they are very good for dealing with ice, they can also damage delicate outdoor home surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Rotary snowplows are {{expensive}} {{due to their}} high maintenance costs, which the railroad incurs {{regardless of whether they}} are needed in a given year. As a result, most railroads have eliminated their rotaries, preferring to use a variety of types of fixed-blade plows that have significantly lower maintenance costs, in conjunction with bulldozers, which can be used year-round on maintenance-of-way projects. In addition, because rotaries leave an open-cut in the snowbank that fixed-blade plows cannot <b>push</b> <b>snow</b> past, once rotaries have been used, they must be used for all further significant snowfalls until the snowbank has melted. Since rotaries, which need some form of fuel to power the blades, also cost more to operate than fixed-blade plows, they are now generally considered to be a tool of last resort for the railroads that own them.|$|R
500|$|With skate skiing, {{the skier}} {{provides}} propulsion on a smooth, firm <b>snow</b> surface by <b>pushing</b> alternating skis {{away from one}} another at an angle, {{in a manner similar}} to ice skating. Skate-skiing usually involves a coordinated use of poles and the upper body to add impetus, sometimes with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on a temporarily [...] "dominant" [...] side ("V1") or with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on either side ("V2"). Skiers climb hills with these techniques by widening the angle of the [...] "V" [...] and by making more frequent, shorter strides and more forceful use of poles. A variant of the technique is the [...] "marathon skate", where the skier leaves one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski.|$|R
500|$|While skate skiing, {{the skier}} {{provides}} propulsion on a firm <b>snow</b> surface by <b>pushing</b> alternating skis {{away from one}} another at an angle, {{in a manner similar}} to ice skating. Skis are waxed with a glide wax over their entire length, making them faster than classic skis. Freestyle events take place on smooth, wide specially groomed courses. With the skating technique double-poling is usually employed with alternating skating strides or with every skate stride. The following table puts these poling sequences into order according to the speed achieved as a progression of [...] "gears". In the lowest gear (rarely used in racing), one is poling on the side of the sliding ski, similar to diagonal stride. In the highest gear, the athlete skates without poles. There are equivalent terms in other languages; for example in Norwegian, skating is likened to paddling or dancing, depending on the tempo.|$|R
