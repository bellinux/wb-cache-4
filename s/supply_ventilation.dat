The principles of [...] "moral treatment" [...] stressed the importance of providing a pleasant environment for patients, and are evident at Challinor in the extensive vistas, the well designed buildings, the distinct areas of male and female patients, the sunken fences, the gardens and mature trees, water <b>supply,</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems, and provision of employment, and recreation areas. Challinor Centre is also significant for its pivotal {{role in the development of}} services for intellectually disabled in Queensland. Throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th century, little consideration was given to the needs of the intellectually disabled in Queensland asylums. They were simply regarded as belonging to the class of insane. A growing awareness of the special needs of the intellectually disabled in Queensland resulted in the construction of the first facilities for children at Challinor in 1933. This building, later known as Dagmar House accommodated children with severe intellectual and physical disabilities. From the mid 1930s, Challinor began to cater more and more for these children.|$|E
40|$|This report evaluates {{residential}} {{ventilation systems}} for the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) ENERGY STAR{reg_sign} Homes program and recommends mechanical ventilation strategies for new, low-infiltration, energy-efficient, single-family, ENERGY STAR production (site-built tract) homes in four climates: cold, mixed (cold and hot), hot humid, and hot arid. Our group in the Energy Analysis Department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab compared residential ventilation strategies in four climates according to three criteria: total annualized costs (the sum of annualized capital cost and annual operating cost), predominant indoor pressure induced by the ventilation system, and distribution of ventilation air within the home. The mechanical ventilation systems modeled deliver 0. 35 {{air changes per hour}} continuously, regardless of actual infiltration or occupant window-opening behavior. Based on the assumptions and analysis described in this report, we recommend independently ducted multi-port <b>supply</b> <b>ventilation</b> in all climates except cold because this strategy provides the safety and health benefits of positive indoor pressure as well as the ability to dehumidify and filter ventilation air. In cold climates, we recommend that multi-port <b>supply</b> <b>ventilation</b> be balanced by a single-port exhaust ventilation fan, and that builders offer balanced heat-recovery ventilation to buyers as an optional upgrade. For builders who continue to install forced-air integrated <b>supply</b> <b>ventilation,</b> we recommend ensuring ducts are airtight or in conditioned space, installing a control that automatically operates the forced-air fan 15 - 20 minutes during each hour that the fan does not operate for heating or cooling, and offering ICM forced-air fans to home buyers as an upgrade...|$|E

This paper explores mechanisms that cause particle deposition on heat exchanger surfaces. We present {{a model that}} accounts for impaction, diffusion, gravitational settling, and turbulence. Simulation results suggest that some submicron particles deposit in the heat exchanger core, but do not cause significant performance impacts. Particles between 1 and 10 {micro}m deposit with probabilities ranging from 1 - 20 % with fin edge impaction representing the dominant mechanism. Particles larger than 10 {micro}m deposit by impaction on refrigerant tubes, gravitational settling on fin corrugations, and mechanisms associated with turbulent airflow.

40|$|This {{technical}} report combines research {{results from the}} Norwegian Research Center on Zero Emission Buildings (ZEB) and a competence project about simplified hydronic distribution funded by Husbanken. In the Norwegian definition of the passive house standard (NS 3700), the current building code TEK 10 or existing concepts of ZEB residential buildings, building envelopes are so-called super-insulated in order to drastically reduce the space-heating needs. Given this high level of insulation, it is theoretically possible to simplify the space-heating distribution inside the building by {{reducing the number of}} heat emitters. There is currently a lack of theoretical knowledge about the design of simplified distribution systems and lack of evidence-based feedbacks about their actual performance during real operation. The present work investigates the performance of simplified space-heating distribution in superinsulated residential buildings using one radiator per floor. The case with less than one heat emitter per floor is not considered here. In all investigated cases, the building was equipped with balanced mechanical ventilation with one centralized heat recovery and one set-point temperature for the <b>supply</b> <b>ventilation</b> air (sometimes called one-zone mechanical ventilation). In other words, all the <b>supply</b> <b>ventilation</b> air is preheated at the same temperature, without distinction between rooms. The research methodology is based on field and laboratory measurements, calibrated detailed dynamic simulations (using IDA-ICE) as well as user’s interviews. The main research question was to investigate the real, desired and perceived thermal environment in heated areas (like the living room) and in the rooms without radiators (like bedrooms). In this context, the question of window openings in bedrooms was also addressed. The research also investigated the user behavior, such as the way users operate the heating system in reality.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} {{particle}} pollution in an office under two different ventilation modes, that is, mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation. The particle concentration distribution in a full scale office has been numerically simulated, while the size distribu-tion of particles from copiers, which are regarded as a major particle source in offices, has been measured for numerical simulation. The results show that most parti-cles generated by the copiers are in sub-micron range, with diameters of 0. 5 – 2. 0 m. Based on the numerical results of particle concentration distribution, the concept of perceived particle intensity (PPI) proposed in a previous study has been applied to evaluate the particle pollution in an office under two different venti-lation modes. In addition the occupied density (OD) concept is employed to consider the occupant distribu-tion. The results show that for the cases presented, side <b>supply</b> (mixing <b>ventilation)</b> is better than bottom <b>supply</b> (displacement <b>ventilation)</b> since in our construc-tion the particle source (copier) was located close to the displacement diffuser, which implies that displace-ment ventilation needs to be carefully designed and adapted for actual application.
