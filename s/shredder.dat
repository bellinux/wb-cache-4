40|$|The {{combustion}} {{mechanism of}} a <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed during puffing has been investigated. To evaluate {{changes in the}} burning rate of the <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed in the region close to the paper char-line, an experimental study was carried out on the reverse combustion of the <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed packed in a furnace. Measurements of {{the temperature in the}} <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed were conducted to calculate the combustion propagation rate. The combustion propagation rate decreased with an increase in the tobacco <b>shred</b> width, the tobacco packing density, and with a decrease in the air flow velocity. To investigate differences in the combustion propagation rate, the oxygen transfer coefficient of the <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed was evaluated using the effective diameter of the tobacco <b>shred</b> and the effective surface area of the <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed. The combustion propagation rate of the <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed increased with the oxygen transfer coefficient of the <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed. Furthermore, the weight loss of the cigarette during puffing was evaluated. The weight loss of the cigarette during puffing showed an increase with an increase in the oxygen transfer coefficient of the <b>shredded</b> tobacco bed...|$|R

Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the <b>shredder.</b> Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again.

5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government <b>shredder</b> to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E

40|$|Scrap tire {{stockpiles}} {{have grown}} in the United States leading to a significant disposal problem. The most recent {{survey conducted by the}} Scrap Tire Management Council reported that 850 million tires are stockpiled in the United States, with an additional 250 million tires still generated each year (1995). The research described herein was undertaken to develop design guidelines for <b>shredded</b> tire stream crossings. The shear strength properties have been investigated for tire <b>shreds</b> as well as tire <b>shreds</b> in contact with glacial till. The <b>shredded</b> tires range from 40 mm to 1. 4 m in length. There are several documented cases where <b>shredded</b> tires have been used successfully as drainage structures. Most of these projects make use of tire chips or <b>shreds</b> ranging from 13 to 152 mm in size. Since production costs for larger-size <b>shreds</b> are significantly less, they offer a distinct advantage over the smaller shreds.;This study uses large scale direct shear tests to investigate the shear strength of large-size tire <b>shreds.</b> Like other studies conducted on tire <b>shreds,</b> Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used to interpret laboratory results. This study concludes that for pure tire <b>shreds,</b> no correlation appears to exist between the size of tire <b>shreds</b> and Mohr-Coulomb failure parameters. At higher normal stresses, this study shows that the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope in not linear, indicating that Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion may not be not accurate over a large stress range in interpreting the shear strength of tire <b>shreds.</b> This study concludes that the shear strength of <b>shredded</b> tires can be interpreted with the relationship: [Tau]= 1. 4 [Sigma] 0 Â· 79. A slope stability analysis is conducted with the shear strength properties of pure tire <b>shreds</b> and tire <b>shreds</b> in contact with glacial till...|$|R
