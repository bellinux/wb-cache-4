5|$|On June 22 {{and into}} June 23, 2016, C-SPAN took video {{footage of the}} House floor from {{individual}} House representatives via streaming services Periscope and Facebook Live during a <b>sit-in</b> by House Democrats asking for a vote on gun control measures after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. This {{needed to be done}} because—as the <b>sit-in</b> was done out of formal session and while the House was in official recess—the existing House cameras could not be utilized for coverage of the event by rule.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville sit-ins, {{which lasted}} from February 13 to May 10, 1960, {{were part of}} a nonviolent direct action {{campaign}} to end racial segregation at lunch counters in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The <b>sit-in</b> campaign, coordinated by the Nashville Student Movement and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, was notable for its early success and emphasis on disciplined nonviolence. It was part of a broader <b>sit-in</b> movement that spread across the Southern United States {{in the wake of the}} Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|African-American {{protests in}} the South {{accelerated}} {{in the early}} 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students staged a <b>sit-in</b> in a segregated North Carolina department store, the <b>sit-in</b> movement gained momentum across the United States. During 1960-61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. The ACLU also provided legal help for the Freedom Rides in 1961, {{the integration of the}} University of Mississippi, the Birmingham campaign in 1963, and the 1964 Freedom Summer.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, in {{imitation}} of the nationally famous <b>sit-ins</b> at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, black students and sympathizers {{held a series of}} <b>sit-ins</b> at the lunch counter of the Tallahassee Woolworth's. At least one white student from FSU was expelled for participating. The <b>sit-ins</b> were unsuccessful (Woolworth's desegregated nationally in 1962), and helped segregationist governor Farris Bryant win election later in 1960.|$|R
40|$|The {{narratives}} of thirty-two male pro-life direct activists {{were subjected to}} a content analysis. While {{a number of different}} themes emerged, only two were significantly related to the frequency with which these activists engaged in <b>sit-ins,</b> or 2 ̆ 2 rescues. 2 ̆ 2 Men who used martial or war images engaged in significantly more <b>sit-ins</b> {{than those who did not}} use such imagery. Men whose activism derived from the strong bonds they either felt or sought with some group (typically fellow congregants) were significantly less active in <b>sit-ins</b> than those who did not refer to such bonds when they described their decisions to participate in <b>sit-ins...</b>|$|R
50|$|On July 1, a 48-hour {{deadline}} {{was issued}} to Morsi, demanding that he {{respond to the}} protesters' demands. Morsi refused to do so. On July 3, which was when the deadline ended, Morsi was removed from offices. <b>Sit-ins</b> originally to celebrate the one-year anniversary of his inauguration became anti-government, anti-protests, and anti-military as supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi held two main <b>sit-ins</b> opposing the protests and subsequent overthrow. The <b>sit-ins</b> comprised individuals supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood, who were demanding the reinstatement of Morsi.|$|R
5|$|Tensions mounted {{over the}} {{following}} week as <b>sit-in</b> demonstrations spread to other cities and race riots broke out in nearby Chattanooga. On February 27, the Nashville student activists held a fourth <b>sit-in</b> at the Woolworths, McClellan, and Walgreens stores. Crowds of white youths again gathered in the stores to taunt and harass the demonstrators. This time, however, police were not present. Eventually, several of the <b>sit-in</b> demonstrators were attacked by hecklers in the McClellan and Woolworths stores. Some were pulled from their seats and beaten, and one demonstrator was pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs. When police arrived, the white attackers fled and none were arrested. Police then ordered the demonstrators at all three locations to leave the stores. When the demonstrators refused to leave, they were arrested and loaded into police vehicles as onlookers applauded. Eighty-one students were arrested and charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.|$|E
5|$|The second <b>sit-in</b> {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} and then left, again without incident. The third <b>sit-in</b> {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{more than}} 400 students, {{angry about the}} {{dismissal}} of a popular professor, Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the <b>sit-in</b> ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended, the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.|$|E

5|$|In June 2016, Black Lives Matter was {{selected}} by Pride Toronto as the honoured group in that year's Pride parade, during which they staged a <b>sit-in</b> to block the parade from moving forward for approximately half an hour. They issued a number of demands for Pride to adjust its relationship with LGBTQ people of colour, including stable funding and a suitable venue for the established Blockrama event, improved diversity in the organization's staff and volunteer base, and most famously that Toronto Police officers be banned from marching in the parade in uniform. Pride executive director Mathieu Chantelois signed BLM's statement of demand, but later asserted that he had signed it only to end the <b>sit-in</b> and get the parade moving, and had not agreed to honour the demands.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June, {{several weeks}} after President Suharto resigned, Sudarmo was ousted from his office after {{students}} conducted a <b>sit-in</b> at the Bantul Assembly House. He was soon convicted of corruption for his payment to the Dharmais Foundation, but the conviction was overturned by a higher court, after which Sudarmo retired. Wuryanto never served time for his disposal of Udin's blood.|$|E
5|$|On the Monday {{following}} the first <b>sit-in,</b> the Baptist Minister's Conference of Nashville, representing 79 congregations, unanimously voted {{to support the}} student movement, thus throwing the weight of Nashville's black religious community behind the students. Local religious leaders called on people of good will to boycott downtown merchants who practiced segregation. Nashville's black community strongly supported the boycott, causing economic hardship for the merchants.|$|E
50|$|In many towns, the <b>sit-ins</b> were {{successful}} in achieving the desegregation of lunch counters and other public places. Nashville's students, who were already planning their <b>sit-ins</b> and started them {{a few days after}} the Greensboro group, attained desegregation of the downtown department store lunch counters in May, 1960.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest and}} best-organized of these campaigns were the Nashville <b>sit-ins,</b> whose groundwork was already underway. They {{involved}} hundreds of participants, {{and led to}} the successful desegregation of Nashville lunch counters. Most {{of the participants in the}} Nashville <b>sit-ins</b> were college students, and many, such as Diane Nash, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, and C. T. Vivian, went on to lead, strategize, and direct almost every aspect of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. The students of the historically black colleges and universities in the city played a critical role in implementing the Nashville <b>sit-ins.</b>|$|R

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Nashville <b>sit-in</b> campaign, sit-ins were staged at {{numerous}} stores in the central business district. <b>Sit-in</b> participants, who consisted mainly of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store lunch counters when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. Later that day, nearly 4000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. When asked if he believed the lunch counters in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should. After subsequent negotiations between the store owners and protest leaders, an agreement was reached {{during the first week of}} May. On May 10, six downtown stores began serving black customers at their lunch counters for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The arrests {{brought a}} surge of media {{coverage}} to the <b>sit-in</b> campaign, including national television news coverage, front page stories in both of Nashville's daily newspapers, and an Associated Press story. The students generally viewed any media coverage as helpful to their cause, especially when it illustrated their commitment to nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, {{along with the}} North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where several neighborhoods were bisected by new routes. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose <b>sit-in</b> strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement, starting in 1947.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{campaign}} successfully desegregated downtown lunch counters, <b>sit-ins,</b> pickets, and protests against other segregated facilities continued in Nashville until {{passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended overt, legally sanctioned segregation nationwide.

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized <b>sit-in</b> was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McClellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, {{they sat in the}} stores for two hours and then left without incident.|$|E
5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a <b>sit-in</b> protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the {{congregation}} began some joint programming with Anshe Sefard, New Orleans' only other remaining Orthodox synagogue, {{and in the}} summer hired Uri Topolosky as its new rabbi.

He continued to enjoy occasional pranks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{opposition}} parties supported the protests' plans, while {{others did not}} explicitly call for demonstration. However, they demanded deep reforms and changes similar to those by the youth. Before the start of protests, the government introduced a number {{of economic and political}} concessions. The protests started with a <b>sit-in</b> in solidarity with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 {{in the vicinity of the}} Egyptian embassy in the capital, Manama ten days before the 'Day of Rage'. On the eve of 14 February, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters south of Manama.|$|E

But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestorswhite and blackwho were arrested while protesting in the South. The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters. The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.|$|E
