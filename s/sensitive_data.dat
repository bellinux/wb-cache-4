In 2003, Gothenburg University was ordered by the court to release medical records and other <b>sensitive</b> <b>data</b> about a group of children who had participated in a longitudinal psychiatric study done by Gillberg and other researchers, to two individuals under the Freedom of Information Act; this was done despite the researchers' assertion that anonymization was not considered feasible due to the nature and length of the study (a small group of participants had been followed for a period of 16 years and the data included a combination of taped interviews, medical records, criminal records, school records, and psychiatric evaluations). The court ordered the University to set conditions for the access so that the interests of the children and the families would be protected.|$|E

External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating system's kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or carried out directly. Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>data</b> held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature. The United States Government Department of Defense (DoD) created the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information.|$|E

Richardson named Lee, an employee at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, as a suspect who might have given nuclear secrets to the Chinese government. Lee was later cleared of espionage charges and won a settlement against {{the federal government for}} the accusation. Richardson was also criticized by the Senate for his handling of the espionage inquiry, which involved missing computer hard drives with <b>sensitive</b> <b>data,</b> by not testifying in front of Congress sooner. Richardson justified his response by saying that he was waiting to uncover more information before speaking to Congress. Republican Senators called for Richardson's resignation while both parties criticized his role in the incident, and the scandal ended Richardson's hope of being named as Al Gore's running mate for the 2000 presidential election.|$|E

As you are aware, the need to protect personally identifiable information has never been greater. For purposes of this review, we defined <b>sensitive</b> employee <b>data</b> to be personally identifiable information including an employee’s name, address, Social Security number (SSN), or medical information. This definition was consistent with reports and articles written about privacy. There was particular concern about the availability of SSNs because they often are the best gateway to obtain other personal information. The objectives of this review were to identify: various administrative documents and systems that include <b>sensitive</b> employee <b>data</b> and the controls designed to protect that information, and relevant policies and practices for handling <b>sensitive</b> employee <b>data.</b> The intent of our work was to identify specific issues related to protecting the confidentiality o...|$|R
