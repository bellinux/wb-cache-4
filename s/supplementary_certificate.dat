40|$|Measures {{are being}} {{developed}} and implemented enabling the co-existence of conventional, genetically modified (GM) and organic cropping systems. In order to segregate GM from conventional crops in the entire supply chain, a food or feed company has to reorganise its production. This may involve for dedication of the production line to non-GM, or production can be organised on the same plant, using spatial or temporal segregation. In practice, only the latter method {{is used in the}} feed industry, as no investments in new machinery are necessary in the case. The segregation and identity preservation of GM and non-GM crops has to be well organised. An important tools used to proof the identity of the imported raw materials is the batch or product declaration and in some cases, a <b>supplementary</b> <b>certificate</b> of analysis for the raw materials is provided. In compound feed production, specific procedures to reduce carry-over are introduced and described in a book of charge, such as rinsing of transportation and production line, empty declaration of transport systems or storage bins and specific discharge and production orders. All these measures however imply supplementary costs to the manufacturer. A major additional cost is the price difference between GM and non-GM raw materials. Other extra costs result from losses in flexibility, a devaluation of the rinsing product, analysis and audits. As a result, the cost of a compound feed using non-GM is higher than with GM. Benefits to the segregation measures are an increased gamut of products and an improved organisation and management of the production. Together with an improved traceability system, consumers’ confidence is also increased. GMO, co-existence, costs, segregation, identity preservation, compound feed, Agribusiness,...|$|E

40|$|Resume - <b>Supplementary</b> Protection <b>Certificates</b> for Medicinal Products Nowadays, the {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{plays an important role}} in the world's economy and {{the pharmaceutical}} research has a decisive impact on the continuing improvement in public health. The system of patent law is of cardinal significance to the industry because it confers monopolies, for a limited period of time, on using innovations and provides a crucial incentive for basic research activities. Innovative companies require the guaranteed period of market exclusivity afforded by patents in order to sustain drug prices, recoup research and development expenditures and finance the development of new products. Although the availability of a patent protection for chemical and pharmaceutical products has, from a historical perspective, only been reaffirmed in the near past, it has been widely accepted as a global standard mainly through the provisions of the WTO's TRIPS agreement. On the other hand, despite the existence of various international treaties harmonising patent laws, patents have to date in their effects remained strictly limited to individual jurisdictions. Closely bound to the patent system itself are the means of the so-called off-patent protection - <b>supplementary</b> protection <b>certificates</b> and the others, for example market [...] ...|$|R
