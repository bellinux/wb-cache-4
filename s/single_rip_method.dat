40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} performance objectives for a localization system is positional accuracy. It is fundamental and essential to general location-aware services. The radio interferometric positioning (<b>RIP)</b> <b>method</b> [1] is an exciting approach which promises sub-meter positional accuracy. In this work, we would like to enhance the <b>RIP</b> <b>method</b> by dynamically selecting the best anchor nodes as beacon senders, and further optimizing the positional accuracy when tracking multiple targets. We have developed an estimation error model to predict positional error of the RIP algorithm given different combinations of beacon senders. Building upon this estimation error model, we further devise an adaptive <b>RIP</b> <b>method</b> that selects the optimal sender-pair combination (SPC) according to the locations of targets relative to anchor nodes. We have implemented the adaptive <b>RIP</b> <b>method</b> and conducted experiments in a real sensor network testbed. Experimental results have shown that our adaptive <b>RIP</b> <b>method</b> outperforms the static <b>RIP</b> <b>method</b> in both single-target and multi-target tracking, and improves the average positional accuracy by 47 %~ 60 % and reduces the 90 % percentile error by 55 %~ 61 %. ...|$|R

40|$|The Running-In-Place (<b>RIP)</b> <b>method</b> is {{implemented}} {{in the framework of}} the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. RIP aims at accelerating the spin-up of the regional LETKF system when the WRF ensemble is initialised from a global analysis, which is obtained at a coarser resolution and lacks features related to the underlying mesoscale evolution. The <b>RIP</b> <b>method</b> is further proposed as an outer-loop scheme to improve the nonlinear evolution of the ensemble when the characteristics of the error statistics change rapidly owing to strong nonlinear dynamics. The impact of using RIP as an outer-loop for the WRF-LETKF system is evaluated for typhoon assimilation and prediction with Typhoon Sinlaku (2008) as a case study. For forecasts beyond one day, the typhoon track prediction is significantly improved after RIP is applied, especially during the spin-up period of the LETKF assimilation when Sinlaku is developing rapidly from a severe tropical storm to a typhoon. The impact of the dropsondes is significantly increased by RIP at early assimilation cycles. Results suggest that these improvements are because of the positive impact on the environmental condition of the typhoon. Results also suggest that using the RIP scheme adaptively allows RIP to be used as an outer-loop for the WRF-LETKF with further improvements...|$|R

40|$|SummarySpore {{formation}} in Bacillus subtilis {{relies on a}} regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) pathway that synchronizes mother-cell and forespore development. To address the molecular basis of this SpoIV transmembrane signaling, we carried out a structure-function analysis of the activating protease CtpB. Crystal structures reflecting distinct functional states show that CtpB constitutes a ring-like protein scaffold penetrated by two narrow tunnels. Access to the proteolytic sites sequestered within these tunnels is controlled by PDZ domains that rearrange upon substrate binding. Accordingly, CtpB resembles a minimal version of a self-compartmentalizing protease regulated by a unique allosteric mechanism. Moreover, biochemical analysis of the PDZ-gated channel combined with sporulation assays reveal that activation of the SpoIV RIP pathway is induced by the concerted activity of CtpB and a second signaling protease, SpoIVB. This proteolytic mechanism is of broad relevance for cell-cell communication, illustrating how distinct signaling pathways can be integrated into a <b>single</b> <b>RIP</b> module...|$|R

Then measurements of the three-dimensional structure of the flow {{in the area where}} the rip channel, the bar and the trough meet and well inside the rip channel are presented. These measurements reveal that 3 D effects play an important role, and that a depth-integrated viewpoint may not always be sufficient for predicting the flow in the near bed region. Particle-tracking experiments illustrate the near bed flow pattern over the entire area. These demonstrate how the overall trajectory pattern changes {{as a function of the}} distance of wave breaking from the bar crest: For some conditions, the rip current is fed from the trough and for other conditions it is fed directly from the bar. Both the 3 D measurements and the trajectory tests show the existence of a weaker onshore-directed near-bed drift in the area where the rip current ceases. Finally, in a series of sensitivity tests, measurements of the rip current intensity for different wave climate and water level conditions reveal a strong correlation between the rip current intensity and the wave height (both normalized) ...|$|R

40|$|In Neurospora crassa, DNA {{sequence}} duplications are detected {{and altered}} efficiently during the sexual cycle {{by a process}} known as RIP (repeat-induced point mutation). Affected sequences are subjected to multiple GC-to-AT mutations. To explore the pattern in which base changes are laid down by RIP we examined two sets of strains. First, we examined the products of a presumptive spontaneous RIP event at the mtr locus. Results of sequencing suggested that a <b>single</b> <b>RIP</b> event produces two distinct patterns of change, descended from the two strands of an affected DNA duplex. Equivalent results were obtained using an exceptional tetrad from a cross with a known duplication flanking the zeta-eta (zeta-eta) locus. The mtr sequence data were also used to further examine the basis for the differential severity of C-to-T mutations on the coding and noncoding strands in genes. The known bias of RIP toward CpA/TpG sites in conjunction with the sequence bias of Neurospora accounts for the differential effect. Finally, we used a collection of tandem repeats (from 16 to 935 bp in length) within the mtr gene to examine the length requirement for RIP. No evidence of RIP was found with duplications shorter than 400 bp while all longer tandem duplications were frequently affected. A comparison of these results with vegetative reversion data for the same duplications is consistent with the idea that reversion of long tandem duplications and RIP share a common step...|$|R

The significant runup height, herein defined as the significant vertical excursion of water level at the shoreline, was typically 2 m, 60 % of the incident significant wave height at the breakpoint. The runup spectra were dominated by the energy at low frequencies, with 99. 9 % {{of the variance in}} motions with periods longer than 20 s and 83 % for periods longer than 50 s. A peak between 0. 005 and 0. 010 Hz was present in all spectra. Analysis of this band showed the motion to be a standing edge wave with wavelength between 5 and 10 km and significant edge wave height at the antinode of 1. 3 m, accounting for half of the local significant runup height. The edge wave period was approximately 140 s and the mode number in the range 3 - 7. An apparently linear sand bar was present 175 m offshore, roughly the same location as the first node of cross-shore velocity for the edge wave. While the edge wave could not have been the cause of the bar (a standing edge wave does not create a linear bar), the opposite may be true, with the bar potentially providing a topographic resonance. As the local head-lands extend {{only a small fraction of}} the offshore distance of the edge wave, they are unlikely to be significant reflectors.

40|$|Due to poor {{correlation}} between steady state mRNA levels and protein product, purely transcriptomic profiling methods may miss genes posttranscriptionally regulated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). RNA immunoprecipitation (<b>RIP)</b> <b>methods</b> developed to identify in vivo targets of RBPs have greatly elucidated those mRNAs {{which may be}} regulated via transcript stability and translation. The RBP HuR (ELAVL 1) and family members are major stabilizers of mRNA. Many labs have identified HuR mRNA targets; however, many of these analyses have been performed in cell lines and oftentimes are not independent biological replicates. Little is known about how HuR target mRNAs behave in conditional knock-out models. In the present work, we performed HuR RIP-Seq and RNA-Seq to investigate HuR direct and indirect targets using a novel conditional knock-out model of HuR genetic ablation during CD 4 + T activation and Th 2 differentiation. Using independent biological replicates, we generated a high coverage RIP-Seq data set (> 160 million reads) that was analyzed using bioinformatics methods specifically designed to find direct mRNA targets in RIP-Seq data. Simultaneously, another set of independent biological replicates were sequenced by RNA-Seq (> 425 million reads) to identify indirect HuR targets. These direct and indirect targets were combined to determine canonical pathways in CD 4 + T cell activation and differentiation for which HuR plays an important role. We show that HuR may regulate genes in multiple canonical pathways involved in T cell activation especially the CD 28 family signaling pathway. These data provide insights into potential HuR-regulated genes during T cell activation and immune mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The pneumotachometer is {{currently}} the most accepted device to measure tidal breathing, however, it {{requires the use of}} a mouthpiece and thus alteration of spontaneous ventilation is implied. Respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP), which includes two belts, one thoracic and one abdominal, is able to determine spontaneous tidal breathing without the use of a facemask or mouthpiece, however, {{there are a number of}} as yet unresolved issues. In this study we aimed to describe and validate a new <b>RIP</b> <b>method,</b> relying on a combination of thoracic RIP and nasal pressure signals taking into account that exercise-induced body movements can easily contaminate RIP thoracic signals by generating tissue motion artifacts. A custom-made time domain algorithm that relies on the elimination of low amplitude artifacts was applied to the raw thoracic RIP signal. Determining this tidal ventilation allowed comparisons between the RIP signal and simultaneously-recorded airflow signals from a calibrated pneumotachometer (PT). We assessed 206 comparisons from 30 volunteers who were asked to breathe spontaneously at rest and during walking on the spot. Comparisons between RIP signals processed by our algorithm and PT showed highly significant correlations for tidal volume (Vt), inspiratory (Ti) and expiratory times (Te). Moreover, bias calculated using the Bland and Altman method were reasonably low for Vt and Ti (0. 04 L and 0. 02 s, respectively), and acceptable for Te (< 0. 1 s) and the intercept from regression relationships (0. 01 L, 0. 06 s, 0. 17 s respectively). The Ti/Ttot and Vt/Ti ratios obtained with the two methods were also statistically correlated. We conclude that our methodology (filtering by our algorithm and calibrating with our calibration procedure) for thoracic RIP renders this technique sufficiently accurate to evaluate tidal ventilation variation at rest and during mild to moderate physical activity...|$|R

This assimilation system is inspired by the method of Kang et al. [2011, 2012], who estimated the surface carbon fluxes in an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) mode, as evolving parameters in the assimilation of the atmospheric CO 2, using a short assimilation window of 6 hours. They included the assimilation of the standard meteorological variables, so that the ensemble provided {{a measure of the}} uncertainty in the CO 2 transport. After introducing new techniques such as variable localization, and increased observation weights near the surface, they obtained accurate carbon fluxes at grid point resolution. We {{developed a}} new version of the LETKF related to the Running-in-Place (<b>RIP)</b> <b>method</b> used to accelerate the spin-up of EnKF data assimilation [Kalnay and Yang, 2010; Wang et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2014]. Like RIP, the new assimilation system uses the no-cost smoothing algorithm for the LETKF [Kalnay et al., 2007 b], which allows shifting at no cost the Kalman Filter solution forward or backward within an assimilation window. In the new scheme a long observation window (e. g., 7 -days or longer) is used to create an LETKF ensemble at 7 -days. Then, the RIP smoother is used to obtain an accurate final analysis at 1 -day. This analysis has the advantage of being based on a short assimilation window, which makes it more accurate, and of having been exposed to the future 7 -days observations, which accelerates the spin up. The assimilation and observation windows are then shifted forward by one day, and the process is repeated. This reduces significantly the analysis error, suggesting that this method could be used in other data assimilation problems...|$|R

The number of butt-swept trees was not significantly affected by treatment, but ths severity of stem deviation and sinuosity resulting from initial butt sweep was related to treatment. The straighter the taproot and the deeper its penetra-tion, the less stem deviation.
