5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E
25|$|The Timekeeper and its {{original}} European counterpart Le Visionarium {{marked the first}} time that the Circle-Vision film process was used to deliver a narrative story line. This required a concept to explain the unusual visual characteristics of the Theater, hence the character Nine-Eye. Nine-Eye was sent through Time by The Timekeeper, so that she could send back the surrounding images as she recorded them in whichever era <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly a}} decade of labor in this field, she {{returned}} East, and, through the winter of 1876-7, was, with her husband, {{in charge of a}} ladies' school in Yonkers, New York, but in the following autumn, removed with her husband to Buffalo. A few years later, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> her old home in Cleveland, her husband having received a call to the charge of the normal school in that city.|$|E

25|$|Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) Chief Yellowcoat/Sports Organiser/Radio Maplin Announcer – Gladys {{was born}} in 1933 in Pontypridd, and spent her youth in the Rhondda Valley. She joined Maplins holiday camp in 1955 and rose through the ranks to become sports {{organiser}} and later chief Yellowcoat. She won the competition for the most popular girl Yellowcoat every year between when she joined and 1959, when she was beaten by Sylvia Garnsey. Upon Jeffrey Fairbrother's arrival at the camp {{at the start of}} the 1959 season, she fell passionately in love with him, although he did not reciprocate this. On one occasion, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a situation where Jeffrey had unintentionally become drunk, and she helped him back to his chalet. The following morning he awoke naked with no memory of the previous night, and found Gladys' bra in his bed. What actually happened was left ambiguous. Gladys disliked all the other female Yellowcoats, in particular Sylvia Garnsey, whom she saw as competition in her fight for Jeffrey's affections. Like Jeffrey, she also disapproved of Ted's schemes to scam the campers, even though she secretly had her own scheme selling reconditioned tennis balls. In the 1960 season, Spike Dixon fell in love with her, although she never knew this and it never amounted to anything. Gladys was left heartbroken when Jeffrey departed for Wisconsin without telling anyone at the end of the season, but she quickly recovered upon meeting Squadron Leader Clive Dempster, who arrived to take over Fairbrother's job. She immediately became attracted to Clive, and the two had an on-off relationship throughout the 1960 season. She eventually married Clive and moved to Australia with him at the end of the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitutional}} {{position of}} Sophie, Anne's mother, became difficult after Frederick's death in 1588, when <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{a power struggle}} with the Rigsraad for control of King Christian. As a matchmaker, however, Sophie proved more diligent than Frederick and, overcoming sticking points {{on the amount of}} the dowry and the status of Orkney, she sealed the agreement by July 1589. Anne herself seems to have been thrilled with the match. On 28 July 1589, the English spy Thomas Fowler reported that Anne was [...] "so far in love with the King's Majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off and hath made good proof divers ways of her affection which his Majestie is apt in no way to requite." [...] Fowler's insinuation, that James preferred men to women, would have been hidden from the fourteen-year-old Anne, who devotedly embroidered shirts for her fiancé while three hundred tailors worked on her wedding dress.|$|E
500|$|For Duff, who {{stated that}} the song can be {{interpreted}} in many different ways, [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] {{tells the story of}} a heterosexual relationship, in which the woman was in love with the man, but he was not [...] "as into her as she was him". After the couple break-up, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a place where she [...] "wasn't herself". She then [...] "comes out of her shell again", which Duff described as: [...] "Coming out again, dancing again, smiling again, having fun and seeing everything in a brighter light." [...] The Dead Executives were instrumental in the instrumentation of [...] "Beat of My Heart", performing on the bass and guitars. They also mixed and engineered the song; the latter was also conducted by Todd Parker and Grant Conway and assisted by Allan Hessler. It was mixed and recorded at the Foxy Studio in Los Angeles, California. The drums featured on the track was performed by Dean Butterworth while Monique Powell and The Fruit performed backing vocals. The song was then mastered by Joe Gastwirt.|$|E

Royer had very little income and had a son who was studying at the École Polytechnique.

She was therefore obliged to reapply each year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last six}} contestants {{included}} Nikki, Dina, Vick, Andrew and Saipul. Jaclyn performed an effortless [...] "Lady Marmalade", but received a less favourable comment from Roslan, {{who said that}} [...] "she is a super singer but not an idol", and he felt bored week by week of her performances thus far. On the results show, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the bottom two {{for the first time}} (with Nikki, who performed [...] "Emotion"), but she survived the elimination. After reaching the last three, her chances were improved by her performance of Alicia Keys' [...] "If I Ain't Got You".|$|E
2500|$|Following the telecast, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> demand again, often {{having to}} choose between several offers. She {{accepted}} roles in the television miniseries The Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978) and the theatrical film Death on the Nile (1978), an Agatha Christie murder mystery. The bulk of her remaining work was for television. She won an Emmy Award for [...] (1979) with Gena Rowlands, and was nominated for her performances in White Mama (1980) and Little Gloria...
