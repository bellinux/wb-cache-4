40|$|Morphological {{differentiation}} in microorganisms {{is usually}} {{accompanied by a}} decrease in intracellular GTP pool size, as has been demonstrated in bacillaceae, streptomycetaceae, and yeasts. The obg gene, which codes for a GTP-binding protein belonging to the GTPase superfamily of proteins, was cloned from Streptomyces griseus IFO 13189. The gene is located just downstream of the genes for ribosomal proteins L 21 and L 27, encoded a protein of 478 amino acids (51 kDa), and possessed three consensus motifs which confer GTP-binding ability; Obg protein expressed in Escherichia coli bound GTP, as demonstrated using a UV cross-linking method. Introduction of multiple copies of obg into wild-type S. griseus <b>suppressed</b> <b>aerial</b> mycelium development in cells on solid media. However, no effect on streptomycin production was detected, indicating that Obg {{is involved in the}} regulation of the onset of morphological but not physiological differentiation. Multiple copies of obg also suppressed submerged spore formation in liquid culture. Southern hybridization studies indicated that genes homologous to obg exist widely in streptomycetes, and an obg homolog was successfully cloned from S. coelicolor A 3 (2). We propose that by monitoring the intracellular GTP pool size, the Obg protein is involved in sensing changes in the nutritional environment leading ultimately to morphological differentiation...|$|E
50|$|An {{attempted}} coup by the Colorados in 21 September 1962 was <b>suppressed</b> {{following an}} <b>aerial</b> bombardment in San Antonio de Padua, and many participating officers {{were forced to}} retire or demoted. Sporadic clashes were extended {{for the next six}} months.|$|R
50|$|Night effect : Radio waves {{reflected}} {{back by the}} ionosphere {{can cause}} signal strength fluctuations 30 to 60 nautical miles (54 to 108 km) from the transmitter, especially just before sunrise and just after sunset. This is more common on frequencies above 350 kHz. Because the returning sky waves travel over a different path, {{they have a different}} phase from the ground wave. This has the effect of <b>suppressing</b> the <b>aerial</b> signal in a fairly random manner. The needle on the indicator will start wandering. The indication will be most erratic during twilight at dusk and dawn.|$|R
5000|$|The agency's {{capabilities}} {{have been}} enhanced {{through the use}} of aircraft in fire suppression. At first, the Forest Fire Service used aircraft to observe and identify fires, beginning in 1927 under the efforts of state firewarden Leonidas Coyle. However, aircraft would not be used actively to <b>suppress</b> fires through <b>aerial</b> bombardment until 1961 when [...] "a Stearman biplane operating out of Coyle Field managed to drop 5,220 gallons of retardant on various fires, at 100 gallons a pop".|$|R
40|$|The resting {{membrane}} {{potential of the}} pacemaker neurons {{is one of the}} essential mechanisms underlying rhythm generation. In this study, we described the biophysical properties of an uncharacterized channel (U-type channel) and investigated the role of the channel in the rhythmic activity of a respiratory pacemaker neuron and the respiratory behaviour in adult freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Our results show that the channel conducts an inward leak current carried by Na(+) (I(Leak-Na)). The I(Leak-Na) contributed to the resting {{membrane potential}} and was required for maintaining rhythmic action potential bursting activity of the identified pacemaker RPeD 1 neurons. Partial knockdown of the U-type channel <b>suppressed</b> the <b>aerial</b> respiratory behaviour of the adult snail in vivo. These findings identified the Na(+) leak conductance via the U-type channel, likely a NALCN-like channel, as one of the fundamental mechanisms regulating rhythm activity of pacemaker neurons and respiratory behaviour in adult animals...|$|R
40|$|A-factor (2 -isocapryloyl- 3 R-hydroxymethyl-γ-butyrolactone) is {{essential}} for the initiation of aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus. amfR is one of the genes which, when cloned on a low-copy-number plasmid, <b>suppresses</b> the <b>aerial</b> mycelium-negative phenotype of an A-factor-deficient mutant of S. griseus. Disruption of the chromosomal amfR gene resulted in complete abolition of aerial mycelium formation, indicating that amfR {{is essential}} for the onset of morphogenesis. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the region upstream of amfR predicted an operon consisting of orf 5, orf 4, and amfR. Consistent with this idea, Northern blotting and S 1 mapping analyses suggested that these three genes were cotranscribed mainly by a promoter (PORF 5) in front of orf 5. Furthermore, PORF 5 was active only in the presence of A-factor, indicating that it is A-factor dependent. Gel mobility shift assays showed the presence of a protein (AdpB) able to bind PORF 5 in the cell extract from an A-factor-deficient mutant but not from the wild-type strain. AdpB was purified to homogeneity and found to bind specifically to the region from − 72 to − 44 bp with respect to the transcriptional start point. Runoff transcriptional analysis of PORF 5 with purified AdpB and an RNA polymerase complex isolated from vegetative mycelium showed that AdpB repressed the transcription in a concentration-dependent manner. It is thus apparent that AmfR as a switch for aerial mycelium formation and AdpB as a repressor for amfR are members in the A-factor regulatory cascade, leading to morphogenesis...|$|R
