Chloropicrin (CP) is an important soil fumi-gant for the production of many fruit and vegetable crops, but its emissions must be minimized to reduce exposure risks and air pollution. The objective {{of this study was to}} de-termine the capacity of biochar to adsorb CP and the effect of biochar amendments to soil on CP emission, concentration in the soil gas phase, degradation in soil and CP bioactivity for controlling <b>soil</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pests.</b> CP emission and concentration in the soil air phase were measured from packed soil columns after fumigant injection at 20 -cm depth and application of selected doses of biocharto the surface 5 cm soil. Laboratory incubation and fumigation experiments were conducted to determine the capacity of biochar to adsorb CP, the effects on CP degradation and, separately, CP’s bioactivity on <b>soil</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pests</b> in soil amended with biochar. Biochar amendment at 2 % to 5 % (w/w) greatly reduced total CP emission losses by 85. 7 %- 97. 7 % compared to fumigation without biochar.

40|$|Inter-cropping {{mustard and}} oilseed radish in potato {{production}} {{has been shown}} to suppress potato cyst nematode (PCN) reproduction in field plots. This suppressive effect is mostly attributed to the release of glucosinolate (GSL) hydrolysis products such as isothiocyanates, following chopping and incorporation of the crop biomass. This study examined the degradation of sinigrin introduced into soil where Indian mustard and oilseed radish were cultivated and the effect on PCN suppression. Glucosinolate degradation was measured by introducing sinigrin into the soil samples pre-planting, pre- and post-incorporation of the brassicas, while the soil microbial activity was quantified as the concentration of fluorescein di-acetate (FDA) g− 1 oven dry soil. Sinigrin was significantly (P < 0. 001) degraded pre- and post-incorporation of the brassicas cultivated in unsterilized soil. The total microbial activity increased significantly (P < 0. 001) pre- and post-incorporation of brassicas when compared with fallow controls. Unsterilized soils planted with oilseed radish resulted in a significant (P < 0. 027) suppression of G. pallida encysted eggs (30 – 35 % mortality). Microbial activity correlated positively with G. pallida mortality (R 2 = 0. 94, P < 0. 001), but inversely with sinigrin degradation. This study has revealed that brassicas used for biofumigation may affect <b>soil</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pests</b> and pathogens not just after incorporation of the crop residues, but also during active growth of these plants...|$|E

On the other hand, high employment of traditional plastic sheets in agriculture causes the production of enormous quantities of waste, whose inappropriate management might have negative effects on the environment. In order to determine a reduction of the charge of plastic waste and to facilitate the waste disposal, {{one of the most interesting}} approaches, from an environmental point of view, lies in the location of innovatory plastic films such as co-extruded ultrathin films, which are able to reduce the plastic quantity to be managed, and biodegradable larninates, which after a first usage, will spontaneously start up a degradation process that avoids their collection and their con sequent disposal. Beside the ecological proprieties of these innovative films, it is necessary to study their technical and agronomical behavior in order to determine their efficiency and the possibility to be used in pIace of the traditional plastic films. This paper represents a review of the researches carrier out by the Technical Economics Department of the University of Basilicata (Italy) in the last years (1999, 2000, 2002 and 2003) on the technical performances of some innovative plastic films used for soil solarization...|$|E

40|$|The {{valorization}} of Brassica oilseed crops, {{starting from}} the agronomical phase up to the exploitation of the derived products, was studied. Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz applications in biorefineries is of deep interest, given the high added value of its oil and oilseed cake residue. Camelina was evaluated {{as a case study}} for the cultivation in the Po valley. In such conditions, camelina has shown to be potentially well adaptable and had a positive impact on the yields of the subsequent crop. Thus, studies on camelina management and its impact on soil properties deserve more attention. Novel Brassica defatted seed meals (DSMs), containing different glucosinolates, were applied in the control of the southern root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White Chitwood) in controlled glasshouse conditions. Among different Brassica DSMs, the best results in the reduction of M. incognita infestation were achieved by Eruca sativa, Barbarea verna and Brassica nigra DSMs. These first results open new perspectives for innovative bioactive molecules for biofumigation applied in cropping systems where nematode suppression is critical. Finally, the effect of Brassica DSMs, applied in formulations with and without crude glycerin, on seed germination inhibition was evaluated. The most effective formulations were applied in in vitro and glasshouse trials to evaluate the germination inhibition of black-grass (Alopecurus myosuriodes Huds.). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the effectiveness of Brassica DSMs formulated with glycerin, especially B. nigra, in germination inhibition.

40|$|Anaerobic soil {{disinfestation}} (ASD) is {{a proven}} but relatively new strategy to control <b>soil</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pests</b> of horticultural crops through anaerobic decomposition of organic soil amendments. The ASD technique has primarily {{been used to}} control soil borne pathogens; however, this technique has also shown potential to control plant parasitic nematodes and weeds. ASD can utilize {{a broad range of}} carbon (C) amendments and optimization may improve efficacy across environments. In this context, a meta-analysis using a random-effects model was conducted to determine effect sizes of the ASD effect on soil borne pathogens (533 studies), plant parasitic nematodes (91 studies), and weeds (88 studies) compared with unamended controls. Yield response to ASD was evaluated (123 studies) compared to unamended and fumigated controls. We also examined moderator variables for environmental conditions and amendments to explore the impact of these moderators on ASD effectiveness on pests and yield. Across all pathogen types with the exception of Sclerotinia spp., ASD studies show suppression of bacterial, oomycete and fungal pathogens (59 % to 86 %). Pathogen suppression was effective under all environmental conditions (50 % to 94 %) and amendment types (53 % to 98 %), except when amendments applied at rates less than 0. 3 kg m- 2. The ASD effect ranged from 15 % to 56 % for nematode suppression and 32 % to 81 % for weed suppression, but these differences were not significant. Significant nematode moderators included study type, soil type, sampling depth, incubation period, and use of mixed amendments. Weed suppression due to ASD showed significant heterogeneity for all environmental conditions, confirming that these studies do not share a common effect size. Total crop yield was not reduced by ASD when compared to a fumigant control and yield was significantly higher (30 %) compared to an unamended control, suggesting ASD as a feasible option to maintain yield without chemical soil fumigants. We conclude ASD is effective against soil borne pathogens and while not conclusive due to a limited number of studies, we expect the same for nematodes and weeds given observed effect sizes. Findings should assist researchers in exploring ASD efficacy in particular environmental conditions and allow for development of standard treatment protocols...|$|E
