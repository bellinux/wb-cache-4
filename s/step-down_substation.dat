Autonomous power supply system has been implemented for power system optimization and associated petroleum gas utilization. The article investigates the technic of choosing the feeder line, main <b>step-down</b> <b>substation,</b> gas turbine installations for electricity generating. Moreover, it provides explanation of economic model main parameters as investment value, maintenance and total overhaul costs of installed equipment. The new implemented power supply system has been compared with centralized system using economic criteria: net present value, minimum price for electricity in both variants. Sensitivity analysis has been performed on model inputs, which have the most crucial impact to change in NPV: investment value, discount rate, electricity price, external financing share, associated petroleum gas burning penalties.

40|$|Abstract. Power {{distribution}} engineering {{plays an}} important role in power system, whose construction quality directly impacts the investment income, social and environmental benefits. This paper firstly analyzed the necessity of quality management in power distribution engineering, and then introduced the application of total quality management to the quality management in power distribution engineering. Finally, by combining the basic points of TQM, applying the PDCA cycle and controlling the factors affecting quality management, this article built a basic system model for quality management in power distribution engineering. Statement of the Problem In general, a power distribution system refers to the part of the power system from <b>step-down</b> <b>substations</b> delivered to the clients, which is directly related to the user's reliability and quality of electric utilization, and occupies an important position in the power system. Construction project has the quality features like general products [1], such as applicability, durability, security, reliability, economic efficiency and other value and properties meeting social needs. Besides, as a special product, power distribution project has its intrinsic features, like having many influential factors, large fluctuations in quality, concealed quality, limitation...|$|R
