2500|$|Guess {{began in}} 1981 {{as a book}} of styles by Georges Marciano. [...] Maurice, Georges brother, was first sought by Georges to help with product development. Armand and Paul, also Georges' brothers, {{were in charge of}} {{distribution}} and advertising, respectively. [...] Armand ran distribution. Paul created the advertising, all of it in-house. Georges designed the clothes, burnishing Guess' signature style: <b>stonewashed</b> denim, lighter in color, softer and more form-fitting than the competitors. This initial chain of command later led to the earlier break-up of the brothers' cooperation with Georges selling his share of the Guess company to his other brothers due to a disagreement in a choice of product distribution strategy. Georges wanted to keep Guess in only the more exclusive stores, such as Bloomingdales. The remaining brothers in the disagreement wanted a larger distribution in KMart. Georges hated the idea. Different camps formed within the company, with each pledging allegiance to either Georges or the other three. Georges eventually gave in and sold his stake to his brothers in 1993 for $214.2 million. To finance the purchase, they had to borrow $210 million, and $105 million was still outstanding three years later. To raise money, the brothers decided to take Guess public.

50|$|<b>Stonewashed</b> jeans are jeans {{that have}} been treated to produce a faded, worn appearance. This is usually {{accomplished}} either by washing the jeans with pumice in a rotating drum, or also by using chemicals to create the appearance {{without the use of}} a rotating drum. The expanding cost of importing pumice stone from Italy, Greece and Turkey led to extensive mining of pumice deposits in California, Arizona, and New Mexico, triggering a negative response from American ecologist groups. The reduction of pumice usage and the growing disposal of its chemically-tainted residue triggered a search for novel methods, notably the use of alternative abrading materials or machines and the use of cellulase enzymes. <b>Stonewashed</b> jeans were a popular 1970s fashion trend, before commercial acid wash denim (discussed below) was introduced in the 1980s.

40|$|Research Background Having {{undertaken}} {{research at}} the Kassel Documenta and the Venice Biennale, I was invited to prepare a short paper on the Istanbul Biennale for Art Monthly. There had been little direct reporting done on this relatively new contemporary art event and my experience in international contemporary art reviewing provided Art Monthly with coverage which included a broad overview with some specific analysis of the Australian artist Callum Morton (who would represent Australia in a future Venice Biennale). Research Contribution: Whilst the article is brief, as specified by the editor, the field work has introduced a direct narrative with a significant international art event. The review format adopts an autoethnographic approach making direct commentary on current phenomena. Research Significance: A number of journals have adopted this short review approach which facilitates a much greater global perspective of contemporary art, especially Australian art, in international settings. Callum Morton’s work <b>Stonewash,</b> has only been reviewed once in the national framework; he has made special mention of this article as {{the one of the}} few that recognised his earlier work utilising a sophisticated narrative approach based on authentic fieldwork...|$|R

40|$|Textile dyeing {{effluents}} {{present a}} substantial environmental problem, primarily because such wastewaters contain {{high concentrations of}} waste dyes, dye by-products, and variable salt concentrations originating from printing or dyeing processes. Such wastewater streams often do not meet regulatory standards for wastewater discharge even after undergoing treatment by conventional means. The decolorization of textile wastewaters is a worldwide problem. Various processes have been utilized to remove the colored colloidal bodies and suspended solids and to reduce the associated high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). ^ Currently, no single treatment system is adequate to degrade the dye structures in wastewaters. A significant disadvantage of the current processes is their high capital and operating expenditures. Oxidation methods for example, are only effective in wastewater with a very low concentration of organic color while the adsorption process by active polymer resin is expensive {{and it is difficult}} to regenerate the adsorbent. ^ Palygorskite is a crystalloid hydrous magnesium-aluminum silicate mineral with very good colloidal properties such as specific features in dispersion high temperature endurance, salt and alkali resistance, and a high adsorbing and de-coloring capability. The structure of palygorskite was first proposed by Bradley (1940), who described a theoretical formula of [Si 8 Mg 5 O 20 (OH) 2] (H 2 O) 4. 4 H 2 O. Due to its sorptive properties, Palygorskite has been effectively applied in decolorizing and clarifying mineral oils and fats, as a carrier in pesticides, in the filtration of special products, as a sorbent on factory floors, and in the pharmaceutical industry. Its ability to adsorb indigo waste and other contaminants from textile effluents however has not been studied. Palygorskite is one of the two constituents of Maya Blue, a material of unprecedented stability with potential application in paints and coatings. The properties and quality of the pigments synthesized from the recovery products compares favorably to pigments synthesized from pure products. ^ The primary objective of this research was to demonstrate the ability of palygorskite to recover waste indigo dye from blue denim wastewater and to use the recovery products as a substrate for the synthesis Maya-blue pigment, a by-product with potential commercial applications. A secondary objective was to demonstrate the simultaneous removal of salts from the wastewater without substantially compromising the quality of the synthesized pigment. Salt reductions of up to over 60 per cent were achieved. Removal of the color and salts from the wastewater essentially opens up opportunities for possible reuse of the wastewater. ^ We demonstrate the effectiveness of palygorskite to concurrently remove indigo dye and salts from the wastewater without significantly compromising the quality of the synthesized by-product. Given that over a billion pairs of blue jeans are manufactured every year and the inordinate quantities of indigo dye used and released as effluent in the <b>stonewash</b> process, the possibility to apply the process on a commercial scale would have substantial economic and environmental implications. ...|$|R
