5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of Dunedin, {{which was}} <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> Scots, many early {{settlers}} in Caversham were English. This {{led to some}} degree of antagonism by the councils {{of the city and}} Caversham borough {{in the early days of}} settlement; Dunedin had been <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> the Presbyterian church, whereas Caversham's population was largely Anglican, Methodist, and Baptist. There is little evidence of this distinction in modern Caversham, other than the origins of local street names, several of which reflect the names of English counties and early English settlers.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall at the mercy of wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

5|$|The {{region that}} is now Belarus was first <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> Baltic tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area {{was taken over by}} Slavic tribes.

5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually <b>settled</b> <b>by</b> a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E
