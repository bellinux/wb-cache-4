5|$|Whilst outnumbered, the Muslims {{gained the}} early {{initiative}} {{and forced the}} Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a <b>serious</b> <b>mistake</b> was committed by {{a part of the}} Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of Muhammad's orders by the Muslim archers, who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan cavalry, led by Meccan war veteran Khalid ibn al-Walid, which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further, but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{planned to}} {{fight their way}} out eastward but—using a local double agent, usually known by his cover of François Toli—attempted to deceive Bonaparte into {{thinking}} {{they would try to}} march north, cross the Po, and head for Milan, joined by the remaining troops marching up from Genoa. The spy would advise Bonaparte to march via Sale on the northern side of the plain, so that he could be engaged by the Austrian left wing; meanwhile the main force would move through Marengo village in the centre, turn north, and fall into the French left flank. Ott arrived from Montebello of 13 June in a war council. The senior generals of the Austrian army strongly approved this plan, as the alternative would have meant that the Austrian army would have had to retreat along the river Po and leave Piedmont to the enemy without a fight. Nonetheless, by abandoning the San Giuliano plain, where the superior Austrian cavalry could have given him an edge, Melas probably made a <b>serious</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E

25|$|Truman sought {{approval}} of Winslow's design {{from the more}} senior Delano. Delano was dismayed by the plans and elevations and feared that dismantling the columns and the Cross Hall opening created by McKim was a <b>serious</b> <b>mistake.</b> Delano was so concerned about the design he travelled to Washington to meet with Truman and Winslow in person {{to work out a}} solution. Winslow prepared a series of detailed architectural models called maquettes to explore the design of the Grand Staircase and how it related to the Entrance Hall and Cross Hall. The paired Doric columns were retained, and an opening in the Cross Hall looking into the Grand Staircase were unanimously agreed upon.|$|E
25|$|Alexei's {{haemophilia}} was {{integral to}} the rise of Grigori Rasputin. One of the many things Rasputin did that unintentionally facilitated the fall of the Romanovs was to tell the Tsar that the war would be won once he (Tsar Nicholas II) took command of the Russian Army. Following this advice was a <b>serious</b> <b>mistake</b> as the Tsar had no military experience. The Tsarina, Empress Alexandra, a deeply religious woman, came to rely upon Rasputin and believe in his ability to help Alexei where conventional doctors had failed. This theme is explored in Robert K. Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra. It is possible that if Alexei had not suffered so terribly, Rasputin could never have gained such influence over Russian politics during World War I, which is generally seen to have at least hastened the collapse of Romanov rule.|$|E
25|$|In 602, Maurice, always {{dealing with}} the lack of money, decreed that the army should stay for winter beyond the Danube, which would prove to be a <b>serious</b> <b>mistake.</b> The {{exhausted}} troops mutinied against the Emperor. Probably misjudging the situation, Maurice repeatedly ordered his troops to start a new offensive rather than returning to winter quarters. After a while, his troops gained the impression that Maurice no longer mastered the situation, proclaimed Phocas their leader, and demanded that Maurice abdicate and proclaim as successor either his son Theodosius or General Germanus. Both men were accused of treason, but riots broke out in Constantinople, and the emperor left the city with his family for Nicomedia. Theodosius headed east to Persia, but historians are not sure whether he had been sent there by his father or if he had fled there. Phocas entered Constantinople in November and was crowned Emperor, while his troops captured Maurice and his family.|$|E

25|$|Result: Kinetic {{immediately}} left Tussauds, but initially {{suffered a}} lack of organization, with Haya not setting a specific list of who should buy what, which nearly resulted in the team buying two three-piece suits for Tussauds' Justin Bieber waxwork. However, the team generally negotiated well, with James in particular being a stand-out. One item which caused the team trouble was a Dashiki, which they spent the day fruitlessly searching for, with Harry H. being mistakenly told it was an Arabic garment instead of an African one. Despite being initially more organized, Atomic's sub-team, Zara and Hayley, wasted time travelling to and from Croydon {{in order to obtain}} a pocketwatch which they paid wildly over the odds for, under the mistaken belief that they were required to purchase one made of gold. On top of that, Harry M. led the team on a wild chase to buy the suit, continually asking adult tailors even after repeatedly being told that they would need to ask a children's tailor for a suit in Bieber's dimensions. Lizzie also made a <b>serious</b> <b>mistake</b> by deciding not to negotiate any discount on a set of shoes {{near the end of the}} day, resulting in a massive fine, with Lord Sugar noting that they would have actually received less of a fine by just not buying the shoes. Kinetic spent £969.10, while Atomic spent £1,480.87.|$|E

500|$|The bomber mafia, {{through a}} [...] "failure of imagination" [...] in not {{expanding}} the doctrine to include establishing air superiority {{as a prerequisite}} for success, would not accept either of these concepts—they believed the heavy bomber fleet could protect itself, and thus they contributed to the delay {{in the development of}} a long-range escort fighter until two years into the war. However, the doctrine nonetheless became the foundation for the separation of the Air Force from the Army, and the basis for modern airpower theory. ACTS graduate, instructor, and [...] "Bomber Mafia" [...] member Haywood S.

500|$|Arguing for {{the renewal}} of the series for a third season {{following}} its low viewership, Ryan said that [...] "letting the show die would be a <b>serious</b> <b>mistake,</b> for the network and for the bigger Disney-ABC conglomerate...These days, entertainment properties have to be viewed not just {{through the lens of}} their ratings (admittedly weak for Agent Carter). They have to be evaluated {{within the context of the}} overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus, and what Agent Carter adds to Disney-ABC is simply too valuable to give up... something different to the company's superhero portfolio." [...] She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where [...] "fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to" [...] and Agent Carters [...] "status as a period piece—which may have harmed it on broadcast—could be a real draw for Netflix viewers". Ryan also felt Marvel [...] "could copy what CBS is [...] " [...] by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows [...] "as well as premium exclusives like a third season of Agent Carter". Ryan concluded, [...] "A third Agent Carter season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling." ...|$|E
