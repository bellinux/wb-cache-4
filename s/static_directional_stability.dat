40|$|AbstractA generic {{aircraft}} usually {{loses its}} <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> at moderate {{angle of attack}} (typically 20 – 30 °). In this research, wind tunnel studies were performed using an aircraft model with moderate swept wing and a conventional vertical tail. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate flow mechanisms responsible for <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability.</b> Measurements of force, surface pressure and spatial flow field were carried out for angles of attack from 0 ° to 46 ° and sideslip angles from − 8 ° to 8 °. Results of the wind tunnel experiments show that the vertical tail is the main contributor to <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability,</b> while the fuselage is the main contributor to static directional instability of the model. In the sideslip attitude for moderate angles of attack, the fuselage vortex and the wing vortex merged together and changed asymmetrically as angle of attack increased on the windward side and leeward side of the vertical tail. The separated asymmetrical vortex flow around the vertical tail is the main reason for reduction in the <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability.</b> Compared with the wing vortices, the fuselage vortices are more concentrated and closer to the vertical tail, so the yawing moment of vertical tail is more unstable than that when the wings are absent. On the other hand, the attached asymmetrical flow over the fuselage in sideslip leads to the static directional instability of the fuselage being exacerbated. It is mainly due to the predominant model contour blockage effect on the windward side flow over the model in sideslip, which is strongly affected by angle of attack...|$|E

Principle configuration variables included wing leading-edge flap deflection, wing trailing-edge flap deflection, horizontal tail effectiveness, and fuselage forebody strakes. A limited investigation was also conducted to determine the low speed aerodynamic effects due to slotted training-edge flaps. Results of this investigation demonstrate that deflecting the wing leading-edge flaps downward to suppress the wing apex vortices provides improved static longitudinal stability; however, it also results in significantly reduced <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability.</b> The use of a selected fuselage forebody strakes {{is found to be}} effective in increasing the level of positive <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability.</b> Drooping the fuselage nose, which is required for low-speed pilot vision, significantly improves the later-directional trim characteristics...|$|E

The tests showed that a slightly unstable pitch-up tendency occurred simultaneously with {{a break in the}} normal-force curve in the angle-of-attack range from about 27 deg to 36 deg. The top vertical tail contributed positive values of <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> and effective dihedral up to an angle of attack of about 35 deg.

A force oscillation technique was used to obtain dynamic derivatives at angles of attack from 0 to 60 deg. The tests were conducted for several canard deflections and with the canards removed to investigate {{the effects of the}} close coupled canard on the high angle of attack stability characteristics of the configuration.

The revised rocket arrangement provided a considerable increase in the <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> contributed by the vee tail at small angles of yaw. The conventional tail provided a greater <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> than the vee tail without increasing the rolling moment due to sideslip. The rolling moment die to sideslip was considerable reduced by either drooped wing tips or open main landing-gear doors.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a wind tunnel investigation to determine the tail contribution to the directional aerodynamic characteristics of a 1 / 6 -scale model of the rotor systems research aircraft (RSRA) with a tail rotor. No main rotor was used during the investigation. Data were obtained with and without the tail rotor over a range of sideslip angle and over a range of rotor collective pitch angle. The model with the tail rotor was tested at several advance ratios with and without thrust from the auxiliary thrust engines on the RSRA fuselage. Increasing {{the space between the}} tail-rotor hub and the vertical tail reduced the tail-rotor torque required at moderate to high rotor thrust.

40|$|Abstract. A {{wind tunnel}} test was {{conducted}} to compare the characteristics of low speed stability and control for aircraft with conventional tail and V-tail configurations. Comparison was made in terms of <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> at selected test speed of 40 m/s, which corresponds to Reynolds number of 0. 1622 x 106 based on the chord. Three types of simplified tail-only model were tested in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia's Low Speed Wind Tunnel (UTM-LST). Results show that the V-tail configuration greatly affects the aerodynamic characteristics in directional stability as the side force and yaw moment tends to vary linearly with yaw angles up to 25 degrees, compared to conventional tail that has linear characteristics up to only 10 degrees yaw...|$|E

In the lateral-directional modes, the airplane was characterized by light wheel forces, low <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> beyond approximately 2 deg of sideslip, adverse yaw response to aileron inputs throughout the entire Mach number range, and negative effective dihedral with wingtips full down. At subsonic Mach numbers, with the flight augmentation control system off, the light wheel forces and adverse yaw response to aileron inputs caused the pilots to minimize use of the ailerons. At supersonic Mach numbers, with the augmentation system off, the adverse yaw due to aileron and the negative effective dihedral were conducive to pilot-induced oscillations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs to {{guarantee}} flight safety when system failures occur, modern fly-by-wire flight control systems for commercial aircraft incorporate reconfiguration control modes.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the reduction of flying qualities when reconfiguration laws are activated. Longitudinal and lateral-directional control laws, along with their alternative and direct modes, were developed for a commercial aircraft with relaxed longitudinal and <b>directional</b> <b>static</b> <b>stabilities.</b> Flying qualities assessment with reconfiguration laws were carried out based on the handling qualities rating method (HQRM), which has certification levels connected to military specifications such as MIL-STD- 1797 A.

The blades were not installed for this test. The fairings {{were designed by}} NASA and Bell Helicopter Textron under a joint program and tested in the Ames Research Center 7 -by 10 -Foot Wind Tunnel. All six aircraft forces and moments were measured using the tunnel scales system. Previous research has identified the integrated hub and pylon fairing approach as the most efficient in reducing helicopter drag.

The geometry of the new fairings is described in detail. Test results are presented in the form of plots of the six model forces and moments. The data show that model drag can be reduced by as much as 20 percent by combining a small hub fairing (that has a circular arc upper surface and a flat lower surface) integrated with a nontapered pylon fairing. To minimize drag, the gap between the lower surface of the hub and upper surface of the pylon fairing must be kept to a minimum.

40|$|A {{low speed}} wind tunnel {{investigation}} is {{conducted for the}} vortex flow characteristics of a tailless fighter configuration that features full length, fuselage-blended forebody strakes. Static pressure distributions were obtained on the forebody upper surface, and six-component forces and moments were measured on the complete, 60 -deg cropped delta wing-fuselage-centerline vertical fin model at angles of attack and sideslip respectively reaching 50 deg and + or - 20 deg. The surface pressure data reveal that development of concentrated vortices from the sharp edged forebody strakes occurred at moderate and high angles of attack. The blended forebody was effective in capturing the windward vortical flow up to high incidence and sideslip angles. The direct suction effect of the windward vortex on the forebody sidewall was the primary contributor to <b>static</b> <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> at high angles of attack.

40|$|The {{results of}} testing hub and pylon {{fairings}} {{mounted on a}} one-fifth scale helicopter {{with the goal of}} reducing parasite drag are presented. Lift, drag, and pitching moment, as well as side force and yawing moment, were measured. The primary objective of the test was to validate the drag reduction capability of integrated hub and pylon configurations in the aerodynamic environment produced by a rotating hub in forward flight. In addition to the baseline helicopter without fairings, three hub fairings and three pylon fairings were tested in various combinations. The three hub fairings tested reflect two different conceptual design approaches to implementing an integrated fairing configuration on an actual aircraft. The design philosophy is discussed in detail and comparisons are made between the wind tunnel models and potential full-scale prototypes.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the low-subsonic stability and control characteristics of a l/ 7 -scale free-flying model modified to represent closely the North American X- 15 airplane (configuration 3) {{has been made in}} the Langley full-scale tunnel. Flight conditions at a relatively low altitude were simulated with the center of gravity at 16. 0 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord. The longitudinal stability and control were considered to be satisfactory for all flight conditions tested. The lateral flight behavior was generally satisfactory for angles of attack below about 20 deg. At higher angles, however, the model developed a tendency to fly in a side-slipped attitude because of static directional instability at small sideslip angles. Good roll control was maintained to the highest angles tested, but rudder effectiveness diminished with increasing angle of attack and became adverse for angles above 40 deg. Removal of the lower rudder had little effect on the lateral flight characteristics for angles of attack less than about 20 deg but caused the lateral flight behavior to become worse in the high angle-of-attack range.

The side-force coefficients were small for both models and indicated that the models were directionally stable. A possible tendency toward dynamic directional instability in the transonic region was indicated by short-period oscillations of the side forces. The results showed a partial-span inboard aileron to be ineffective or to cause negative control in the the transonic region when deflected approximately 5 deg but not when deflected 10 deg.
