2500|$|The European Commission {{recommended}} that the negotiations should begin in 2005, but also added various precautionary measures. The EU leaders agreed on 16 December 2004 to start accession negotiations with Turkey from 3 October 2005.

5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{acknowledged}} that enlargement has its limits, the EU cannot expand endlessly. Former Commission President Romano Prodi favoured granting [...] "everything but institutions" [...] to the EU's neighbour states; allowing them to co-operate deeply while not adding strain on the EU's institutional framework. This has in particular been pushed by France and Germany as a <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership</b> for Turkey, membership for which has faced considerable opposition on cultural and logistical grounds.|$|R

50|$|In {{terms of}} foreign policy, the CDU commits itself to European {{integration}} {{and a strong}} relation with the United States. In the European Union, the party opposes the entry of Turkey into the EU, preferring instead a <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership</b> with Turkey. In addition to citing various human rights violations, the CDU also believes that Turkey's unwillingness to recognise Cyprus as an independent, sovereign state contradicts the EU policy that its members must recognise the existence of one another.|$|R

40|$|Within European law {{enforcement}} circles, counter-terrorism networks and <b>privileged</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{tend to be}} preferred to formal bureaucratic structures because of their flexibility and directness. The professional preference for informal, bilateral and privileged relationships may, however, undermine the potential of formally established agencies such as Europol and Eurojust, which work through national and centrally co-ordinated channels of information and intelligence. This article seeks to assess whether standards of democratic, legal and social legitimacy are under pressure {{as a consequence of}} this persistent preference for horizontal, direct and informal co-operation. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In early 2004, Guttenberg {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} a <b>Privileged</b> <b>Partnership</b> between Turkey and the European Union as a viable alternative to accession of Turkey to the European Union into the German political discourse. Guttenberg based his opposition to full Turkish membership in the EU on the country’s insufficient fulfillment of relevant accession criteria, for example with regard to the Cyprus dispute. At the same time, he stressed the necessity of maintaining good relations with Turkey and was therefore critical of a French initiative to criminalize the denial of the Armenian Genocide.|$|R

40|$|In 2005 the EU and Turkey officially started {{accession}} negotiations that {{were intended to}} lead to Turkey’s full membership of the EU. Yet today, the Turkish accession process has virtually {{ground to a halt}} and lost all credibility. Talk of alternatives to full membership can be heard from various sides; we highlight four instances of what we call ‘parallelism’, namely the elusive concept of a ‘privileged partnership’, the EU-Turkey customs union, the recently launched ‘Positive Agenda’ and Turkish participation in the Energy Community Treaty. While a <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership</b> represents a more comprehensive but still remote framework for EU-Turkish relations, the latter three are merely an escape route from preaccession. We conclude our analysis with a discussion on Turkey’s possible membership of the European Economic Area, which in effect would serve none of the parties involved. We conclude that both partners, the EU and Turkey, would be well advised to remember their pre-accession commitments of 13 years ago – for their mutual benefit...|$|R
5000|$|The mediocrity {{principle}} is the philosophical notion that [...] "if an item is drawn at random {{from one of}} several sets or categories, it's likelier {{to come from the}} most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories". The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the evolution of the Solar System, Earth's history, the evolution of biological complexity, human evolution, or any one nation. It is a heuristic in the vein of the Copernican principle, and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is <b>special,</b> <b>privileged,</b> exceptional, or even superior.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{interviews}} and field work in Rwanda {{over the course}} of two years, this article argues that genocide survivors have been excluded from the human rights guarantees and protections offered to refugees and asylum seekers experiencing persecution and threat to their lives and welfare. It illustrates how genocide survivors are subject to unique psychological and social vulnerabilities, including psycho-social trauma and high levels of chronic stress which impede their capacity to rehabilitate themselves and rebuild their lives. Many are forced to live in the same neighborhoods and villages as the genocidaires that raped and tortured them as well as their families and friends, and who murdered many of their closest kin. This is an intrinsically psychologically destabilizing position which burdens and overwhelms genocide survivors, subjecting them to continuous retraumatization. Consequently, it argues that genocide survivors should be granted <b>special</b> <b>privileged</b> immigration rights to resettlement outside of Rwanda...|$|R
5000|$|German Chancellor Angela Merkel has {{repeatedly}} opposed full membership of Turkey to the EU on German-Turkish summits, advocating instead a <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership.</b> Some Christian Democrats back fuller support for Turkey, risking the chancellor becoming more isolated in advocating for a [...] "privileged partnership". In September 2011, {{on the occasion}} of the visit of the Turkish president Gül, Merkel said: [...] "We don't want the full membership of Turkey. But we don't want to lose Turkey as an important country", referring to her idea of a strategic partnership. In 2006, Chancellor Merkel said [...] "Turkey could be in deep, deep trouble when it comes to its aspirations to join the European Union" [...] regarding its refusal to open up its ports to European Union member Cyprus. Again in 2014, when Erdogan urged Merkel to strongly support his country's bid, there was no sign the chancellor had relinquished her skepticism. She revealed after the two had talked: [...] "I personally said that we are in a negotiation process that has certain outcome and no fixed time frame. It is no secret and nothing has changed in my view that I am sceptical about full membership for Turkey." ...|$|R

She has said that a French-Russian partnership is necessitated by [...] "obvious civilization and geostrategic factors" [...] as well as France's energy security interests. She believes that [...] "France's interests are in Europe, but in Greater Europe, especially including its partnership with Russia". Interviewed by Kommersant, she said [...] "the process of demonization of Russia is taking place {{at the level of}} the EU leadership and on the wishes of the US, which is trying to create a unipolar world." [...] Interviewed about democracy in Russia and Vladimir Putin, she replied: [...] "We also do not have an ideal democracy in France and, therefore, do not have the right to give Russia lessons in democracy. But I openly admit that, to some extent, I admire Vladimir Putin. He makes mistakes, but who doesn’t? The situation in Russia is complicated, and one cannot expect all the problems stemming from the collapse of the Soviet Union to be quickly resolved - they require time. I think that Vladimir Putin has principles and a vision of the future that is necessary to ensure Russia's prosperity, which it deserves".|$|R
30|$|Society is an {{important}} part of the whole innovation system. Society may be seen in two projections. First, society is a taxpayer, the one who should understand the value of science and support it. In Russia, respect to a researcher engineer is rather low—it was not the case in the Soviet Union where salary of teaching staff and researchers was higher than average and academic freedom put them in a <b>special</b> <b>privileged</b> working conditions. The change has occurred partially because of comparatively low income of such specialists. Additionally, popularization of science and technologies in Russia was during the last 25  years at a very modest scale. Citizens do not understand what science gives them; instead in newspapers and magazines, one may read about scandals and rumors around institutes for development (ROSNANO, Skolkovo, MSU Technological Valley), or scandals around reform of RAS, or about confrontation between academy institutes and universities in their fight for federal money.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} effective pension age in Russia {{and in particular the}} role of <b>special</b> <b>privileged</b> early retirement programs in enlarging the number of pensioners in recent decades. When it is possible to receive a pension and continue to work, people often choose to draw the pension at the earliest possible age and continue to work as before. Binary logistic regression demonstrates that availability of pension benefits and disability status contributed significantly to the drop in employment of people at the ages below the normal pension age. Thus, while early retirement schemes do need to eliminate the right of getting earnings while drawing pensions, {{it should be possible to}} keep this option for people at the standard age. Reform of early pension schemes along with gradual increasing of normal pension age of women up to the age of 60 make alternative options of reducing liabilities of the state pension system. pension reform, old-age pensions, early retirement, working pensioners, ageing...|$|R

To this end, the impact of the 1996 Customs Union covering most industrial goods and processed agricultural goods, is evaluated on a sectoral level.
