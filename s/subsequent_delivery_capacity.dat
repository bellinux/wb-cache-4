Various aspects of the dynamic system were studied, however, emphasis {{was given to the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> of the storage cylinder since it is the absolute measure of ANG storage system viability. The results demonstrated that activated carbons have better <b>delivery</b> <b>capacities</b> than molecular sieve zeolite and silica gel in spite of their higher thermal instability. Dynamic <b>delivery</b> <b>capacities</b> were found to be related inversely to discharge rate as a subsequent of further thermal instability. Increase in discharge rate from 1 L minâˆ’ 1 to 5 L minâˆ’ 1 resulted in the severest reduction in steady state <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity,</b> represented by a net factor between 7. 6 and 12. 1 % taking the total <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> as a reference. This range is dependent on the adsorbent type and properties. However, no hydrodynamic hindrances were observed in spite of these adsorbents were in powder form. Non-methane hydrocarbon gases have potential impacts on all types of <b>delivery</b> <b>capacities</b> within a reduction factor of 19. 4 % for natural gas containing 14. 98 and 14. 54 vol. % of ethane and propane discharged at 1 L minâˆ’ 1. Such behavior appears to be mainly governed by the deactivation degree of the adsorbent with heavier hydrocarbon molecule...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the message <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> problem in delay-constrained mobile sensor networks. The message <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> {{specifies}} the maximum percentage of sensing messages {{that can be}} successfully delivered to sink nodes within a given time constraint. This captures the overall system capacity in terms of successful sensing message delivery. By taking full advantage of sensor mobility and rendezvous during senor node encounters, messages can be delivered to a sink node either directly or through relays by other sensor nodes. In this paper, for the first time, we present the delay-constrained message <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> formulation in mobile sensor networks. The objective is to maximize the message <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> subject to the delay and buffering constraints. We first identify a number of unique challenges involved in such systems including message relay and buffer replacement mechanisms, and we derive the capacity bound under perfect message relay and buffer replacement mechanisms. Due to an unrealistic assumption about the foreknowledge of sensor moving trajectories, we next proceed to propose a practical algorithm to approximate the maximal message <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> based on current global network knowledge. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm is proposed to reduce the control overhead for information exchange. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms and examine their sensitivity with respect to delay constraints, buffer size and message relay, and replacement schemes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 1 – Since battery {{energy is}} often a premium {{resource}} in wireless sensor networks, many systems attempt to conserve battery energy by turning the transceivers off in a process referred to as duty-cycling. In [4 - 5], the authors proposed two different random duty-cycling protocols utilizing pseudo random number generators to efficiently exchange ON/OFF schedules among neighboring nodes for transmission coordination. We propose two simple transmission schemes that are superior {{to the performance of}} the schemes in [4 - 5] in terms of energy consumption and a macro network metric termed <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity.</b> The <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> measures the maximum long term average unicast traffic delivery capability of a network. Through analyses and simulations, we present a detailed energy and <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> tradeoff study of the transmission schemes in [4 - 5] and the schemes we propose. We show that one of our proposed schemes is near-optimal in energy consumption for low traffic loads. In addition, we provide insights on the appropriate ON/OFF dutycycling parameters that can achieve the optimal energy and <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> tradeoff curve...|$|R

Methods: This retrospective study used a perinatal database and chart review from 1978 to 1995. Only women whose first delivery was at our institution at more than 36 weeks 2 ̆ 7 gestation, vaginal singleton, vertex presentation, and birth weight greater than 2500 g, with a <b>subsequent</b> <b>delivery</b> were included.

Comparison of data was by Fisher exact and t tests. Results: Four thousand fifteen women met our starting criteria. In their first delivery, the average birth weight, use of instrumentation, and episiotomy rate were significantly higher in those women sustaining a severe laceration.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} coordinated scheduling of production and delivery subject to the production window constraint and the <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint. We have a planning horizon consisting {{of one or more}} delivery times each with a unique <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity.</b> There is a set of jobs each with a committed delivery time, processing time, production window, and profit. The company can earn the profit only if the job is processed in its production window and delivered before its committed delivery time. From the company point of view, we are interested in selecting a subset of jobs to process and deliver so as to maximize the total profit subject to the <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint. We consider both the single delivery time case and the multiple delivery time case. In both cases, the problem is strongly NP-hard since the subproblems at the production stage and at the delivery stage are both strongly NP-hard. Our goal is to design approximation algorithms. Suppose the jobs are k-disjoint, that is, the jobs can be partitioned into k lists of jobs such that the jobs in each list have disjoint production windows. When k is a constant, we developed the first PTAS for the single delivery case. For multiple delivery time case, we also develop a PTAS when the number of delivery times is a constant as well...|$|R

40|$|Estimation of the {{nitrogen}} delivery of grassland in temperate regions is possible through {{measurement of the}} organic N content of the top layer. Organic nitrogen is built up under recently sown grassland until equilibrium is reached ('old' grasslands). Comparison of the actual soil organic N content with this equilibrium {{makes it possible to}} determine {{the nitrogen}} delivery (Hassink, 1995). To determine this equilibrium, the soil layers 0 - 6 cm, 0 - 15 cm and 0 - 23 cm of 40 unfertilised old grasslands in Belgium with different soil textures (clay, loam, sandy loam and sand) were analysed for their organic N-content and granulometric composition (9 fractions). From these fields {{it was found that the}} soil organic N-content correlated with the texture. For determination of the nitrogen delivery, 31 unfertilised experimental fields were set up, on which dry matter yield and nitrogen delivery were determined. NFNS (non fertiliser nitrogen supply, kg N/ha. yr) = 139. 1 - 445. 6 *Delta orgN (r(2) = 0. 63) (%, Delta orgN = orgN(eq) - orgN(act); sampling depth 0 - 15 cm and texture fraction 0 - 20 mu). The remaining variation in the data set may be partially explained by the water <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity,</b> as suggested by individual results.

Therefore, the manufacturer can quickly respond to demand of the wholesaler under the condition that the total cost is invariable. Moreover, when the <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> isn’t absolute flexibility, the manufacturer may motivate the wholesaler to undertake product delivery through reducing the transfer price so that the wholesaler’s optimal order size under decentralized supply chain is closer to both the manufacturer’s optimal production size and the entire supply chain’s optimal size under centralized supply chain, which may benefit the entire supply chain since both can obtain a win-win solution...|$|R
