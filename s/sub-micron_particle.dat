30|$|However, {{it should}} be noted that the {{building}} blocks of the above-mentioned icy objects are interstellar grains which are sub-micron sized icy grains containing silicate cores (Li and Greenberg, 1997). Let us suppose that a sub-micron-sized silicate particle is placed in water. The question is whether the particle can settle down or not. The Stokes settling velocity for water is quite small; it is on the order of 10 − 7 cm s− 1 inside a 1000 -km-radius object. This velocity is obtained from the Stokes’s drag law (Eq.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{permittivity}} response of crystalline calcite powders produced by pulverizing and milling from well crystallized marble. Crystal characterization of continuous solid and powder compacts {{was based upon}} XRD. The particle size of the powders has been characterized by laser granulometry. Different packing densities of the powders were investigated i. e., unpacked, tapped, pressed to form pellets by different forces. The dielectric spectroscopy demonstrates the significance of reduced particle size and material packing density. At low frequencies, particle surface state effects dominate and the applied electrical energy is stored on the surfaces. This induces surface polarization effects that are normally considered in nanodielectric technology. As {{the size of the}} particles is reduced the surface polarization effects intensify and extend their frequency range towards the higher frequencies. In the high frequency regime (i. e., f > 100 kHz) the energy supplied by the electric field is stored in the volume of the particles. The dielectric data of the powder is determined by the packing density of the particles. A potential energy model is proposed in order to help workers to envisage the implications of surface vs. volume energy absorption process of <b>sub-micron</b> <b>particle</b> compacts when subjected to AC electric fields.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to analyse the {{particle}} size distribution of a liposome dispersion, which contained small egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles and had been prepared by high-pressure homogenisation, by various size analysis techniques. Such liposomes were chosen since they can be looked at as a prototype of drug nano-carriers. Three <b>sub-micron</b> <b>particle</b> size analysis techniques were employed: (1) fixed-angle quasi-elastic laser light scattering or photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), (2) size exclusion chromatographic (SEC) fractionation with subsequent (off-line) PCS size-analysis and quantification of the amount of particles present in the sub-fractions, and (3) field-flow-fractionation coupled on-line with a static light scattering and a refractive index (RI) -detector. When designing liposome-based drug carrier systems, a reliable and reproducible analysis of their size and size distribution is of paramount importance: Not only does liposome size influence the nanocarrier’s in-vitro characteristics such as drug loading capacity, aggregation and sedimentation but also it is generally acknowledged that the pharmacokinetic behaviour and biodis-tribution of the carrier is strongly size-dependent. All three approaches of liposome size analysis used here were found to yield useful results, although they were not fully congruent.

The effect of additive structure on surface segregation has also reported. A method of depositing charge onto polypropylene substrates from a high potential scanning AFM tip was developed. The relation between AFM tip- voltage and the level of charge deposited on the substrate suggested that a localised corona discharge was generated.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{manipulate}} biological cells and micrometer-scale particles {{plays an important}} role in many biological and colloidal science applications. However, conventional manipulation techniques, such as optical forces, electrokinetic forces (electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis (DEP), and traveling-wave dielectrophoresis), magnetic forces, acoustic forces (surface standing acoustic waves (SAW), and bulk standing acoustic waves(BAW)), and hydrodynamic flows, cannot achieve high resolution and high throughput at the same time. While electrokinetic forces and other mechanisms provide higher throughput than optical mechanism, but lack the flexibility or the spatial resolution necessary for controlling individual particles. None of which could provide high resolution, throughput and versatility in clinical applications.
