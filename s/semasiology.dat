50|$|A {{comparative}} {{science was}} born in the 19th century who declared that we should inspect the differences, rather than the similarities, when comparing two languages.

Every word has a variety of senses and connotations, which can be added, removed, or altered over time, often to the extent that cognates across space and time have very different meanings. The study of semantic change can be seen as part of etymology, onomasiology, <b>semasiology,</b> and semantics.|$|E

50|$|In {{international}} scientific vocabulary semantics is {{also called}} <b>semasiology.</b> The word semantics {{was first used}} by Michel Bréal, a French philologist. It denotes a range of ideas—from the popular to the highly technical. It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation. This problem of understanding {{has been the subject}} of many formal enquiries, over a long period of time, especially in the field of formal semantics. In linguistics, it is the study of the interpretation of signs or symbols used in agents or communities within particular circumstances and contexts. Within this view, sounds, facial expressions, body language, and proxemics have semantic (meaningful) content, and each comprises several branches of study. In written language, things like paragraph structure and punctuation bear semantic content; other forms of language bear other semantic content.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the contribution of}} cognitive linguistics to diachronic lexicology and describes how lexical studies within cognitive linguistics are gradually and naturally evolving toward a sociolexicological approach that links up with sociolinguistics. It takes the distinction between <b>semasiology</b> and onomasiology as its basic organizing principle. Based on this distinction, the article charts the field of onomasiology (probably the lesser known of the two subfields of lexicology) and examines the contribution of cognitive linguistics to that field. It also illustrates the importance of sociolexicology {{for the study of}} onomasiological variation and change, with references to sociolinguistic studies at large within cognitive linguistics. There are two ways in which cognitive linguistics contributes to diachronic semasiology: by employing such mechanisms of semantic change as metaphor and metonymy, which cognitive linguistics has shed new light on, and by exploiting the prototype-based structure of polysemy. This article also considers prototype theory, modulations on the core cases, the development of radial sets, semantic polygenesis, semantic change from subsets, and referential and nonreferential types of meaning.

40|$|International audienceThe semasiological-onomasiological {{distinction}} is arguably {{one of the}} most fundamental axioms of langauge science (Geeraerts 2010). Although the theoretical basis of the {{distinction is}} not questioned, this study shows that, analytically, it cannot not be strictly maintained within the framework of Cognitive Linguistics. The aim is to show that instead of discrete items in context, lexemes actually consist in onomasiological bundles of fine-grained morpho-syntactically varied constructions. The analysis examines the semasiological variation of the English preposition over. Applying multifactorial usage-feature analysis (Geeraerts et al. 1994) to 471 contextualised occurrences of the lexeme, the study demonstrates that fine-grained morpho-syntactic variation correlates with semasiological structure. The results reveal that specific lexical senses are significantly associated with specific morpho-syntactic patterns. Moreover, it is shown that semasiological structure more generally can be mapped using these fine-grained formal variations. The results are interpreted as evidence for the need to treat linguistic forms, not as discrete contextualized units, but as composite onomasiological bundles. This non-reified understanding of form parallels Greeraerts’ (1993) claim that we need to treat meaning as a non-reified phenomenon, but blurs the analytical line between onomasiology and <b>semasiology</b> sensu stricto...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with semantic change in English along two dimensions: time and place. The second dimension considers controversies that have arisen after the global spread of English and the subsequent emergence of 'deviant' semantic norms as perceived by native speakers. This {{is linked to the}} puristic role that English pedagogy has been playing since the heyday of 'etymology'. The thesis argues as follows. Although the prevalence of the Saussurean (1915) principle of 'arbitrariness' has contributed to the sanctioning of semantic change, it has not freed modern linguistics from the shackles of linguistic purism. This purism, however, has acquired a nationalistic face now that English derives its high status from belonging to English-speaking nations. The 'true' meanings of English words are now commonly seen as those that have developed with the rise and development of the Anglo-Saxons' language. These are evolutionary processes and must be accounted for validity in historical semantics. The thesis contributes to the field by offering a corpus-based study of semantic change using the case of the lexical category to show in a diachronic version of Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) work on metaphor. The aim is to stress the role of metaphor in semantic change on both levels of <b>semasiology</b> and onomasiology. A second contribution highlights {{the extent to which the}} study of meaning in time in western linguistics is thought to be worthwhile as compared to that of meaning in place. Meaning in place is a synchronic, controversial issue commonly examined along sociolinguistic parameters in which the role of conceptual metaphor in generating local innovations is neglected. A third contribution shows how the focus on spreading the 'core' and 'fixed' norms of the English vocabulary through ELT has shifted attention from the centrality of metaphor to language use. An empirical study is also offered to demonstrate the influence of nationalism on the design of the EFL/EIL lexical syllabus...|$|E
40|$|The review gives a {{critical}} {{assessment of the}} content {{and structure of the}} five-volume dictionary of Slavic animal names (zoonyms), compiled by Stefan Warchol, a professor at the University of Lublin. The author is given high credits for systematizing the extensive lexical material (over 120, 000 items) collected on the indigenous Slavic territories in Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Upper and Lower Lusatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. It is highly appreciated that the research material was recorded directly from informants (1, 500 people) and is supplemented by commentary elaborating on each name’s motivation. The dictionary articles are noted for particular thoroughness of the lexicographical description to include information about the original form of the animal’s name, the place where it was registered (the name of the village, region, country), the nomination background and the frequency of use. The breadth of coverage of zoonymic data, which includes the names of 44 species of domestic and domesticated wild animals, is emphasized. The first volume contains the names of buffaloes, bulls, oxen and horses; the second — the names of cows; the third is devoted to cats and dogs names; the fourth collects the names of different kinds of pet animals (hedgehogs, foxes, hares, canaries, parrots, etc.). The dictionary articles of the fifth volume present the names of animals of different species categorized on the common root basis, which allows one to trace the level of its productivity and the breadth of its distribution throughout the Slavic territory. Particular attention in the review is given to the conceptual side of the research which builds on the author’s study of the archaic layer of zoonymic vocabulary and develops into the original hypotheses on Slavic ethnogeny problem and delineating the boundaries of the ancestral home of the Slavs. The peer-reviewed dictionary provides rich and well-systemized information relevant for research in the fields of Slavic zoonyms, onomastics, <b>semasiology,</b> onomasiology, etymology, dialectology, ethnolinguistics, and the cultural history of the Slavic peoples...|$|E
40|$|Corpus-based {{approaches}} to constructional semantics are a rapidly developing area of contemporary linguistics. This dissertation, which presents a multivariate quantitative {{analysis of the}} Dutch causative constructions with 'doen' and 'laten', contributes to this research area by introducing several theoretical and methodological innovations. First, this study integrates the inter- and intraconstructional perspectives on semantics (cf. onomasiology and <b>semasiology).</b> To describe the internal structure of each constructional category, different exemplars of the constructions and their features are evaluated {{with regard to their}} intracategorial family resemblance. Several quantitative techniques, such as multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, are used to establish the relevant dimensions of semantic variation and the senses, which are operationalized as groups of similar exemplars. The similarity is based on thirty-five manually coded semantic and formal variables. The analyses show that the main conceptual dimensions along which the exemplars are distributed correspond to the distinction between mental and non-mental caused events, and the one between more or less autonomous Causees, or direct vs. indirect causation. The exemplars form a continuum along these dimensions, rather than a set of discrete senses, although there are several densely populated clusters, mostly associated with highly frequent low-level schemata, such as doen denken aan remind of and laten weten let know, inform. From the interconstructional perspective, the study explores the most distinctive exemplars and features, which are associated with the two constructions. These features and exemplars are related to the dimension direct vs. indirect causation, in accordance with the previous studies. This conclusion is {{made on the basis of}} a series of quantitative analyses, which involve cutting-edge statistical techniques: logistic regression with mixed effects, conditional inference trees and random forests. The analyses reveal that the intracategorial prototypicality and intercategorial distinctiveness of the exemplars and their semantic features do not correlate in the case of laten, which is more semantically heterogeneous than doen. This has important implications for Empirical Cognitive Semantics and especially for the ongoing debate about the nature of salience phenomena and their corpus-based operationalization. The study also explores variation in the use of the constructions in different registers and national varieties of Dutch, and proposes an innovative account of language variation and change. The analyses demonstrate that the difference between the lectal variants of the constructions is due to the different prominence of specific low-level schemata and referential situations. The results also suggest that the causative doen may be an obsolescent form. The main methodological novelty of this study is that constructional semantics is modelled in a fully bottom-up fashion, with the individual constructional exemplars as a starting point, and the generalizations (the senses and semantic dimensions), which emerge as a result of a fully automatic procedure. The approach thus integrates objectivity and measurability with intuitive interpretability of the results, which can be seen as one of the main challenges for contemporary corpus-based models of semantics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Meaning {{dynamics}} in emergent natural language definitions: {{a method for}} semasiological corpus linguistics Context – This contribution {{is based on a}} study which examines how narrow LSP technical terms emerge in creative LGP media discourse and gradually set up a broad conceptual profile according partly to metaphorical and mental-space extensions of the core meaning in so-called natural language definitions. Through a longitudinal case study of the semantic development of the word Internet in Dutch and French, we offer a methodology for describing meaning dynamics. Word meanings then do not only present a static given, but are also a discursive source of meaning creation and linguistic change in the short term. Objectives – There is a methodological and theoretical objective. (1) Our methodology transforms a monitor corpus which tracks all occurrences of natural language definitions of a term, in order to describe its semantics not only as static representations, but also emergent meaning, as it unfolds in discourse. We present a descriptive method for the microscopic unfolding of the <b>semasiology</b> of the term under investigation along ten dimensions with different levels of granularity. (2) On a theoretical level, we classify semasiological features in terms of cognitive subdomains, like metaphorical source domains or mental spaces on the one hand, and more general ways-of-seeing / qualia on the other. Natural language definitions then ought {{to be seen as a}} Langackerian partial sanction, as the gradual conceptual extension and measurable combinations of these dimensions, domains and qualia, which involve multiple definitions interacting in authentic discourse sequences intertextually, intratextually and on the level of the mere definiens NP. Framework – Our cognitive corpus approach combines a geneaological discursive inspiration (Foucault 2008, Pêcheux 1969, 1995) and cognitive grammar (Langacker 2001, 2008). In other words, corpus linguistics, discourse analysis and cognitive linguistics meet, in line with cognitive linguistics’ recent call for more usage-based analyses open to variational parameters. Data – We examined about 1000 definitions in 150 articles of ten Dutch and French general and economic Belgian weekly newspapers from 1991 to 1995, containing the first attestations of the word Internet and the first definitions of this word. It is the semasiological inventory of these definitions we capture. Descriptive results – Our method allows us to describe (explicit) natural language definitions as a multidimensional conceptualization at different levels of granularity and, more importantly, monitors the emergence and evolution of natural language definitions and their fine-grained semasiological structure, which takes into account contextual variation according to press types and languages examined. This patterning provides a method for better insights in similarities and differences between linguistic and genre variation both statically and as they develop through time.

40|$|This is a {{theoretical}} and ethnographic study of conceptions of “courage” among combat infantry, specifically U. S. Marines. U. S. infantry combat soldiers {{conceive of the}} cultural value courage in its many manifestations and formulations. I maintain that courage manifests itself in both vocal signs, as directly or indirectly referenced spoken discourses, and in action signs, {{as a way of}} moving in a semantically-laden enactment space. In its many formulations within Western thought, courage has been understood primarily as the product of psychobiological or instinctive forces. In contrast, I shall argue it is best understood as an expressed cultural and personal value. The study aims to contribute new knowledge to an American subculture almost entirely neglected by anthropologists: modern American combat infantry. A unique focus of this project is to argue for a conception of courage as a moved value performed by dynamically embodied persons rather than a reified entity. For example, while many Americans can readily appreciate that Japanese Geisha move in very distinctive ways, and acknowledge that those ways of moving are cultural, that is, value-driven, the distinctive movements of American infantry soldiers, both in terms of their cultural origins and as expressions of cultural values, are masked by the wide and deeply-held American value of utility and its long historical deployment in warfare. In other words such movements are viewed as merely practical in function and efficient in their execution, without links to moral, ethical, gendered, racial, or other cultural values. This invisibility coupled with a Western academic preference for explanatory resources that reify and render mysterious the source of personal action, makes courage as a moved value almost inconceivable. To see courage according to this new formulation requires special theoretical resources, most notably an agent-centered theory of human movement, provided in the work of linguistic and socio-cultural anthropologists Drid Williams and Brenda Farnell (referred to as <b>semasiology).</b> It also requires a robust conception of agent causality applicable to the social sciences emerging from a critical realist philosophy of science as found {{in the work of the}} philosopher of science Rom Harré and the philosopher of social science Charles Varela. The position taken in this dissertation is that courage among American combat infantry is best understood as an idiom of body movement and the expression of cultural values made manifest in the highly detailed and nuanced social situations generated in training and on a battlefield. A battlefield per se, and as a value-laden context, is the joint creation of persons engaged in a certain kind of embodied talk. I argue that training for battle can be captured in the phrase “domesticated combat. ” By this phrase I mean that certain key performative and contextual variables are controlled, but never entirely so, in the training context. To the extent that training replicates key factors faced by infantry on the battlefield is the extent to which courageous action can be trained. The term “courage,” at least as it is used in the United States, will be shown to be an abstract placeholder whose meaning is inseparable from specific semiotic practices of combat infantry in particular contexts. For combat infantry, specifically U. S. Marines, courage will be shown to consist in the selfless pursuit of prized cultural values in situations of moral and physical risk. This study is based on over sixty individual and group, formal and informal interviews with combat and non-combat veterans from World War II through Operation Iraqi Freedom II and beyond. These interviews are complemented by participant-observation in two seven-week training courses with active duty Marines during the summers of 2007 and 2008. This study makes two contributions to anthropological understanding. It provides new ethnographic knowledge of an academically neglected and misunderstood American community, and applies, and develops further special theoretical resources within socio-cultural and linguistic anthropology that preserve and foreground embodied human agency and action. In other words, while this project is important for the empirical reason that few studies focus on modern Western combat soldiers, and none at all utilize an ‘anthropology of human movement’ approach, it is also important for the theoretical reason that it offers a conception of the relationship of biology and culture that is grounded scientifically, and so gives a plausible account of that relationship in the service of a proper representation of dynamically embodied persons living culturally. Failing to ground ethnographic interpretation in a plausible account of the relationship between biology and culture promotes the replacement of the meaning of actors with those of the researcher. As a result opinion often masquerades as insight and advocacy often becomes partisanshi...|$|E
