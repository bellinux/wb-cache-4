5|$|The Solomon Islands <b>skink</b> (Corucia zebrata), {{also known}} as prehensile-tailed <b>skink,</b> monkey-tailed <b>skink,</b> giant <b>skink,</b> zebra <b>skink,</b> and monkey <b>skink,</b> is an {{arboreal}} species of <b>skink</b> endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago. It is the largest known extant species of <b>skink.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{a variety}} of mitochondrial and nuclear genes places the Noronha <b>skink</b> among the tropical African species of Trachylepis, a position also supported by morphological similarities. It may have arrived on its island on rafting vegetation from southwestern Africa via the Benguela Current and the South Equatorial Current, which passes Fernando de Noronha. This possibility was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace before 1888. Mausfeld and coworkers calculated that the journey from Africa to Fernando de Noronha would take 139 days. Because this period seemed too long for the <b>skink</b> to survive, they proposed that the Noronha <b>skink</b> instead arrived via Ascension Island, where a <b>skink</b> may have persisted into historical times.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Mausfeld and others {{conducted}} a molecular phylogenetic {{study on the}} Noronha <b>skink,</b> using the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes, and showed that the species is {{more closely related to}} African than to South American Mabuya species, as previously suggested on the basis of morphological similarities. They split the old genus Mabuya into four genera for geographically discrete clades, including Euprepis for the African–Noronha clade, thus renaming the Noronha species to Euprepis atlanticus. In 2003, A.M. Bauer found that the name Euprepis had been incorrectly applied to this clade and that Trachylepis was correct instead, so that the Noronha <b>skink</b> is currently referred to as Trachylepis atlantica. Additional molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2003 and 2006 confirmed the relationship between the Noronha <b>skink</b> and African Trachylepis.|$|E
50|$|Ornate <b>skinks</b> co-exist widely with copper <b>skinks,</b> and at {{selected}} localities with robust <b>skinks,</b> Mokohinau <b>skinks,</b> McGregor's <b>skinks,</b> Poor Knights <b>skinks</b> and on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands, marbled <b>skinks.</b> Ornate <b>skinks</b> are {{not currently}} known to co-exist with Whitaker's <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Notoscincus is a genus of <b>skinks.</b> They are {{commonly}} known as soil-crevice <b>skinks</b> or snake-eyed <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Panaspis is a genus of <b>skinks,</b> {{commonly}} called lidless <b>skinks</b> or snake-eyed <b>skinks,</b> endemic to Sub-saharan Africa.|$|R
5|$|Reptiles {{recorded}} on North Island include Binoe's prickly gecko (Heteronotia binoei), the gecko Christinus marmoratus, the Jew lizard (Pogona barbata), King's <b>skink</b> (Egernia kingii), the western limestone ctenotus (Ctenotus australis), the western worm lerista (Lerista praepedita), the common dwarf <b>skink</b> (Menetia greyii), and the Abrolhos bearded dragon (Pogona minor minima). The carpet python was reported as {{present on the}} island in very low numbers before 1960, but {{it has never been}} observed there by naturalists, and is now absent.|$|E

5|$|Trachylepis tschudii is {{an enigmatic}} <b>skink,</b> purportedly from Peru. First {{described}} in 1845 {{on the basis}} of a single specimen, it may be the same as the Noronha <b>skink</b> (T.atlantica) from Fernando de Noronha, off northeastern Brazil. T.tschudii represents one of two doubtful records of the otherwise African genus Trachylepis on mainland South America; the other is T.maculata from Guyana.|$|E
50|$|Five-lined <b>skinks</b> also exhibit antipredation behavior. In evasion {{of various}} predators {{including}} snakes, crows, hawks, shrews, moles, opossums, skunks, raccoons, and domestic cats, <b>skinks</b> may disconnect their entire tail {{or a small}} segment. <b>Skinks</b> run to shelter to escape their distracted predators as the disconnected tail continues to twitch. <b>Skinks</b> may also utilize biting as a defensive strategy.|$|R
50|$|Lamprolepis, {{the emerald}} <b>skinks,</b> are a genus of <b>skinks</b> in the {{subfamily}} Lygosominae.|$|R
50|$|They are {{commonly}} known as red-eyed crocodile <b>skinks,</b> or, rarely, red-eyed bush crocodile <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Two {{terrestrial}} reptiles {{are native}} to the island group: the Lord Howe Island <b>skink</b> and the Lord Howe Island gecko. Both are rare on the main island but more common on smaller islands offshore. The garden <b>skink</b> and the bleating tree frog have been accidentally introduced from the Australian mainland.|$|E

5|$|The Noronha <b>skink</b> {{probably}} lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha {{was discovered}} by humans, but several species that arrived since do prey on it, most commonly the cat (Felis catus) and cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis). These may negatively affect <b>skink</b> abundance at some localities on the island. The Argentine black and white tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae, and three introduced rodents, the house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the house mouse, may have been scavenging on already dead skinks.|$|E
50|$|Grand <b>skinks</b> are {{relatively}} large {{compared to other}} New Zealand <b>skinks,</b> capable of growing to lengths up to 11 inches (29 cm). They are marked with yellow-green speckling, which provides excellent camouflage in their rocky habitat of lichen-covered rocks and schist outcrops. Like most <b>skinks,</b> grand <b>skinks</b> are omnivores and feed {{on a wide variety}} of insects and fleshy fruits.|$|R

5|$|Lizards that {{inhabit the}} island include the white-bellied <b>skink</b> (Emoia cyanura), photographed by E. H. Quayle during an {{expedition}} in 1922, and a lizard {{reported in the}} journal of an expedition in 1935 by James Chapin. The species of the latter was uncertain, but it was thought to be a gecko, possibly either an oceanic gecko (Gehyra oceanica) or a mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris). The 1991–92 Pitcairn Islands Scientific Expedition found specimens of both the mourning gecko and the white-bellied <b>skink.</b> The only mammal known to inhabit Ducie is the Polynesian rat; In 1997 there was a successful project to eradicate these by Brian Bell (WMIL) and Graham Wragg (S/V Te Manu), to aid the conservation of bird species threatened by the rat population. Green sea turtles feed on Ducie, but have not been seen to breed there.|$|E
5|$|The Solomon Islands <b>skink</b> is {{completely}} herbivorous, eating many different {{fruits and vegetables}} including the pothos plant. It {{is one of the}} few species of reptile known to function within a social group or circulus. Both male and female specimens are known to be territorial and often hostile towards members not a part of their family group.|$|E
5|$|The Solomon Islands <b>skink</b> is {{native to}} Solomon Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the {{south-west}} Pacific Ocean. The common subspecies (C. z. zebrata) is found on the islands of Choiseul Island, New Georgia, Isabel, Guadalcanal, Ngela, Malaita, Makira (Solomon Islands), Ugi and Santa Ana. The northern subspecies (C. z. alfredschmidti) is known from the islands of Bougainville and Buka and the Shortland Island Group. Bougainville and Buka are geographically part of the Solomons Archipelago, though politically part of Papua New Guinea. Both subspecies of the Solomon Islands <b>skink</b> are strictly arboreal, usually inhabiting the upper canopy of forested areas throughout its range. It commonly occurs in the strangler fig tree (Ficus sp.), provided the epiphytic growth of its several food plants are present. It occurs in trees in semi-cleared areas and cultivated food gardens, again provided its food plants occur there.|$|E
50|$|Eugongylus is a genus of <b>skinks</b> in the {{subfamily}} Lygosominae. The namesake of the Eugonglyus {{group of}} genera, it occupies a quite basal position among these. Members of this genus are commonly called mastiff <b>skinks</b> or short-legged giant <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dasia, {{commonly}} known as tree <b>skinks</b> or Dasias, is a genus of <b>skinks</b> found in Asia.|$|R
50|$|Pedra Branca <b>skinks</b> live in crevices in the rocks, {{which provide}} {{protection}} from wind, salt spray and waves. Adult <b>skinks</b> defend their burrows against intrusion by other <b>skinks.</b> However, {{they are only}} active when air temperatures are above 15 °C (59 °F).|$|R
5|$|In reptiles, {{features}} of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha <b>skink,</b> the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T.maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts). Mabuya species and T.maculata generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in T.maculata, which has 18. The Noronha <b>skink</b> has 26presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha <b>skink</b> is very {{abundant}} throughout Fernando de Noronha, even occurring commonly in houses, {{and also}} occurs on the smaller islands {{that surround the}} main island of the archipelago. Its abundance may {{be a result of}} the absence of ecologically similar competitors. Apart from T.atlantica, the reptile fauna of Fernando de Noronha consists of the indigenous amphisbaenian Amphisbaena ridleyi and two introduced lizards, the gecko Hemidactylus mabouia and the tegu Tupinambis merianae.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in several microhabitats, but most often on rocks. Although {{predominantly}} ground-dwelling, {{it is a good}} climber. Nothing is known about its reproduction except that skinks studied in late October and early November, during the dry season, showed little evidence of reproductive activity. The Noronha <b>skink</b> is oviparous (egg-laying), like many Trachylepis, but unlike Mabuya, which are all viviparous (giving live birth).|$|E
50|$|Lankascincus is a genus of <b>skinks,</b> {{commonly}} known as Lanka <b>skinks.</b> The genus is endemic to Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|Niveoscincus is a genus of <b>skinks</b> (family Scincidae), {{commonly}} called snow <b>skinks</b> or cool-skinks and residing mainly in Tasmania or Victoria, Australia. The genus Niveoscincus {{belongs to a}} clade with the genera Carlia, Lampropholis and possibly others of the Eugongylus group. For similar <b>skinks</b> see genera Pseudemoia, Lampropholis, and Bassiana. These <b>skinks</b> have adapted to the cooler weather of southern Australia and particularly Tasmania, hence the common names.|$|R
50|$|These <b>skinks</b> (along {{with the}} similar Plestiodon fasciatus) are {{sometimes}} wrongly {{thought to be}} venomous. Broad-headed <b>skinks</b> are nonvenomous.|$|R
5|$|According to a 2006 study, the Noronha <b>skink</b> is {{infected}} by several parasitic worms, most frequently by the nematode Spinicauda spinicauda. Another nematode, Moaciria alvarengai, is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two trematodes—Mesocoelium monas and an undetermined species of Platynossomum—and an undetermined species of Oochoristica, a cestode. S.spinicauda is usually only found in teiid lizards; {{it may have}} entered the archipelago when Tupinambis merianae, a teiid, {{was introduced to the}} island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported M.alvarengai and Thelandros alvarengai from the skink; the presence of S.spinicauda could explain the rarity of M.alvarengai and absence of T.alvarengai in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's <b>skink,</b> white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
5|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9m (between 1.5 and 6.5m) off {{the ground in a}} variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers, as well as the introduced green tree <b>skink.</b>|$|E
