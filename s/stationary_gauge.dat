40|$|The spatial {{assessment}} of short time step precipitation is a challenging task. Low density of observation networks, {{as well as}} the bias in radar rainfall estimation motivated the new idea of exploiting cars as moving rain gauges with windshield wipers or optical sensors as measurement devices. In a preliminary study, this idea has been tested with computer experiments (Haberlandt and Sester, 2010). The results have shown that a high number of possibly inaccurate measurement devices (moving cars) provide more reliable areal rainfall estimations than a lower number of precise measurement devices (<b>stationary</b> <b>gauges).</b> Instead of assuming a relationship between wiper frequency (W) and rainfall intensity (R) with an arbitrary error, the main objective {{of this study is to}} derive valid W – R relationships between sensor readings and rainfall intensity by laboratory experiments. Sensor readings involve the wiper speed, as well as optical sensors which can be placed on cars and are usually made for automating wiper activities. A rain simulator with the capability of producing a wide range of rainfall intensities is designed and constructed. The wiper speed and two optical sensors are used in the laboratory to measure rainfall intensities, and compare it with tipping bucket readings as reference. Furthermore, the effect of the car speed on the estimation of rainfall using a car speed simulator device is investigated. The results show that the sensor readings, which are observed from wiper speed adjustment according to the front visibility, can be considered as a strong indicator for rainfall intensity. Also the optical sensors showed promising results toward measuring rainfall rate. It is observed that the car speed has a significant effect on the rainfall measurement. This effect is highly dependent on the rain type {{as well as the}} windshield angle...|$|R
40|$|Following up {{on recent}} {{work in the}} context of {{ordinary}} fluids, we study the equilibrium partition function of a 3 + 1 dimensional superfluid on an arbitrary stationary background spacetime, and with arbitrary <b>stationary</b> background <b>gauge</b> fields, in the long wavelength expansion. We argue that this partition function is generated by a 3 dimensional Euclidean effective action for the massless Goldstone field. We parameterize the general form of this action at first order in the derivative expansion. We demonstrate that the constitutive relations of relativistic superfluid hydrodynamics are significantly constrained by the requirement of consistency with such an effective action. At first order in the derivative expansion we demonstrate that the resultant constraints on constitutive relations coincide precisely with the equalities between hydrodynamical transport coefficients recently derived from the second law of thermodynamics.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric Einstein gravity {{with a thin}} null-dust shell, under boundary conditions that fix {{the evolution of the}} spatial hypersurfaces at the two asymptotically flat infinities of a Kruskal-like manifold. The constraints are eliminated via a Kuchar-type canonical transformation and Hamiltonian reduction. The reduced phase space Γ̃ consists of two disconnected copies of R^ 4, each associated with one direction of the shell motion. The right-moving and left-moving test shell limits can be attached to the respective components of right-hand-side and left-hand-side masses as configuration variables provides a global canonical chart on each component of Γ̃, and renders the Hamiltonian simple, but encodes the shell dynamics in the momenta in a convoluted way. Choosing the shell curvature radius and the "interior" mass as configuration variables renders the shell dynamics transparent in an arbitrarily specifiable <b>stationary</b> <b>gauge</b> "exterior" to the shell, but the resulting local canonical charts do not cover the three-dimensional subset of evolution at the infinities is freed by introducing parametrization clocks, we find on the unreduced phase space a global canonical chart that completely decouples the physical degrees of freedom from the pure gauge degrees of freedom.

40|$|We {{study the}} thermal {{partition}} function of quantum field theories on arbitrary stationary background spacetime, and with arbitrary <b>stationary</b> background <b>gauge</b> fields, {{in the long}} wavelength expansion. We demonstrate that the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics are significantly constrained by the requirement of consistency with any partition function. In examples at low orders in the derivative expansion we demonstrate that these constraints coincide precisely with the equalities between hydrodynamical transport coefficients that follow from the local form of the second law of thermodynamics. In particular we recover the results of Son and Surowka on the chiral magnetic and chiral vorticity flows, starting from a local partition function that manifestly reproduces the field theory anomaly, without making any reference to an entropy current. We conjecture that the relations between transport coefficients that follow from the second law of thermodynamics agree to all orders in the derivative expansion with the constraints described in this paper.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{evolution}} of the so called intelligent networks (insect society without leader, cells of an organism, brain [...] .) during their apprenticeship period. The used formalism draws one's inspiration from the one of the Quantum field theory (Principle of <b>stationary</b> action, <b>gauge</b> fields, invariance by symmetry transformations [...] .). After a recall of some definitions, we consider at first the free network, that is to say which does not exchange any information with outside. Then we study {{the evolution of the}} network connected with its environment, that is to say immersed into an information field created by this environment which so dictates to it the apprenticeship constraints. At that time, we obtain Lagrange equations which solutions describe the network evolution during the whole apprenticeship period. Finally, while proceeding with the same formalism inspiration, we suggest other study ways capable of evolving the knowledge in the considered scope.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{interpolation}} theory for the phenomenological effects of thermal fluctuations in superconductors. Fluctuations are {{described by a}} simple gauge invariant extension of the gaussian effective potential for the Ginzburg-Landau static model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a concept for the collaborative distributed acquisition and refinement of geo-related information. The underlying {{idea is to}} start with a massive amount of moving sensors which can observe and measure a spatial phenomenon with an unknown, possibly low accuracy. Linking these measurements with a limited number of measuring units with higher order accuracy leads to an information and quality augmentation in the mass sensor data. This is achieved by distributed information integration and processing in a local communication range. The approach will be demonstrated with the example where cars measure rainfall indirectly by the wiper frequencies. The a priori unknown relationship between wiper frequency and rainfall is incrementally determined and refined in the sensor network. For this, neighboring information of both <b>stationary</b> rain <b>gauges</b> of higher accuracy and neighboring cars with their associated measurement accuracy are integrated. In this way, the quality of the measurement units can be enhanced. In the paper the concept for the approach is presented, together with first experiments in a simulation environment. Each sensor is described as an individual agent with certain processing and communication possibilities. The movement of cars is based on given traffic models. Experiments with respect to the dependency of car density, station density and achievable accuracies are presented. Finally, extensions of this approach to other applications are outlined...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo help {{monitor the}} {{evolution}} of stored CO 2, we have made precision seafloor gravity measurements at 30 seafloor stations above the Sleipner CO 2 plume in the years 2002, 2005 and 2009. Each epoch of gravity data has an intra-survey repeatability of about 3  μGal (standard deviation), obtained using state-of-the-art instrumentation on top of pre-deployed seafloor benchmarks, with typically three visits on each location during a survey. We used three relative quartz-spring Scintrex CG- 5 gravimeters in a unique offshore instrument package. Ocean tidal fluctuations and benchmark depths were determined using both pressure gauges on the gravity survey tool and <b>stationary</b> reference pressure <b>gauges</b> on the seafloor. We analyzed and accounted for multiple sources of changes in gravity to obtain an estimate of in situ CO 2 density. First, the injected CO 2, 5. 88  million tonnes during this time period, displaces denser formation water, causing a negative gravity change above the plume. This is the signal of interest for this study. At the same time, hydrocarbon gas production and water influx into the deep, nearby gas reservoir cause an increase in gravity of higher amplitude and longer wavelength. Finally, by observing vertical depth changes of the seafloor benchmarks between surveys to mm precision, we quantified vertical benchmark movements caused by sediment scouring. Some of the benchmarks have experienced more than 10  cm vertical movement over the 7 year duration of the experiment, and erosional topography {{can be seen in}} a > 10  m broad area around some of the benchmarks. The shifting sediment can also cause a change in the observed vertical gravity gradient. We inverted the gravity changes for simultaneous contributions from: (i) injected CO 2 in the Utsira Formation, (ii) water flow into the Sleipner gas reservoir, and (iii) vertical benchmark movements. We estimate the part of the change in gravity caused by CO 2 injection to be up to 12  μGal. If we assume a geometry of the plume as seen in 4 D seismic data, the best match to the 30 stations requires an average CO 2 density of 720 ± 80  kg/ m 3, neglecting dissolution of CO 2 into the formation water. While the CO 2 in the Utsira Fm. at Sleipner is supercritical, it is fairly close to the critical point; therefore only a slight increase in temperature could lower the density significantly. Density is also sensitive to impurities, which make up 1 – 2 % of the injected material at Sleipner and reduce the density slightly. In the absence of down hole gauges in the injection well, we estimate the well-bottom CO 2 temperature to be 48  °C and pressure to be hydrostatic (∼ 105  bar). These conditions give a calculated density of 485 ± 10  kg/ m 3 at the perforation. Density is expected to increase away from the well as CO 2 cools down from contact with the cooler formation, up to a maximum of about 710  kg/ m 3. The distribution of temperature and density within the plume is difficult to model exactly, but most of the CO 2 is expected to cool down to initial reservoir temperature (∼ 35. 5  °C at the perforation) except for a central high-temperature region where CO 2 is still near the injection temperature. Because the undisturbed formation temperatures and the injection temperature are fairly well known, the 2002 – 2009 gravity change can be used to constrain the rate of dissolution of CO 2 into the formation water. Dissolved CO 2 is invisible in seismic data. The contribution from gravimetric data could therefore be highly valuable for monitoring this process, which is important for long-term predictions of the CO 2 stored in the Utsira Fm. We give an upper bound on the dissolution rate of 1. 8 % per year...|$|R
