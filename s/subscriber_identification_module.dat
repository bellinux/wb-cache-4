40|$|Abstract. Despite a legal {{framework}} being {{in place for}} several years, the market share of qualified electronic signatures is disappointingly low. Mobile Signatures provide a new and promising opportunity for the deployment of an infrastructure for qualified electronic signatures. We analyzed two possible signing approaches (server based and client based signatures) and conclude that SIM-based signatures are the most secure and convenient solution. However, using the SIM-card as a secure signature creation device (SSCD) raises new challenges, because it would contain the user’s private key {{as well as the}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>identification.</b> Combining both functions in one card raises the question who will have the control over the keys and certificates. We propose a protocol called Certification on Demand (COD) that separates certification services from <b>subscriber</b> <b>identification</b> information and allows consumers to choose their appropriate certification services and service providers based on their needs. We also present some of the constraints that still have to be addressed before qualified mobile signatures are possible. ...|$|R

The main {{purpose is to}} enable cheap and quick acquisition of a large-scale dictionary from a large untagged text corpus {{with the aid of}} the information i a small tagged seed corpus. The basic model is based on a Viterbi reestimation technique. During the dictionary construction process, it tries to optimize the automatic segmentation and tagging process by repeatedly refining the set of parameters of the underlying language model. The refined parameters are then used to furtherget a better tagging result. In addition, a two-class classifier, which is capable of classifying an n-gram either as a word or a non-word, is used in combination with the Viterbi training module to improve the system performance. Two different system configurations had been developed to construct he dictionary. The configurations include (1) a Viterbi word <b>identification</b> <b>module</b> followed by a Viterbi POS tagging module and (2) a two-class classification module as the postfilter for the above Viterbi word <b>identification</b> <b>module.</b> With a seed of 1, 000 sentences and an untagged corpus of 311, 591 sentences, the performance for bigram word identification is 56. 88 % in precision and 77. 37 % in recall when the two-class classifier is applied to the word list suggested by the Viterbi word <b>identification</b> <b>module.</b> The Viterbi part of speech tag reestimation stage gives the figures of 71. 16 % and 71. 81 % weighted precision rates and 73. 42 % and 73. 83 % weighted recall rates for the 2 different configurations when using a seed corpus of 9676 sentences...|$|R
