We discuss two types of asymmetric responses to monetary interventions. One is the symmetry in the responses to positive and negative monetary shocks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive {{a model of}} {{aggregate}} investment that builds from the lumpy microeconomic behavior of firms facing stochastic fixed adjustment costs. Instead of the standard sharp (<b>S,s)</b> <b>bands,</b> firms' adjustment policies {{take the form of}} a probability of adjustment (adjustment hazard) that responds smoothly to changes in firms' capacity gap. The model has appealing aggregation properties, and yields nonlinear aggregate time series processes. The passivity of normal times is, occasionally, more than offset by the brisk response to large accumulated shocks. Using within and out-of-sample criteria, we find that the model performs substantially better than the standard linear models of investment for postwar sectoral U. S. manufacturing equipment and structures investment data. ...|$|E

In this model, inflation alternates stochastically between some positive rate g and zero inflation.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{detailed}} data set of high-frequency observations on inventory investment by a U. S. steel wholesaler. Our {{analysis of the}} data leads to six main conclusions: orders and sales are made infrequently; orders are more volatile than sales; order sizes vary considerably; there is considerable day-to-day variability in sales prices; inventory/sales ratios are unstable; and there are occasional stockouts.

We demonstrate that the firm's behavior at the product level is well approximated by an optimal trading strategy derived from a multi-dimensional nonlinear dynamic programming problem with continuous state and control variables which are subject to frequently binding inequality constraints.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive {{a model of}} {{aggregate}} investment that builds from the lumpy microeconomic behavior of firms facing stochastic fixed adjustment costs. Instead of the standard (<b>S,s)</b> <b>bands,</b> firms' optimal adjustment policies are probabilistic, with a probability of adjusting (adjustment hazard) that grows smoothly with firms' disequilibria. Depending upon the specification {{of the distribution of}} fixed adjustment costs, the adjustment hazards approach encompasses models ranging from the very non-linear (S,s) model to the linear partial adjustment model. Except for the latter extreme, the processes for aggregate investment obtained from adding up the actions of firms subject to aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, is highly non-linear. Estimating the aggregate model by maximum likelihood, we find clear evidence supporting non-linear models over linear ones for postwar sectoral U. S. manufacturing equipment and structures investment. For a given sequence of aggregate shocks, the nonlinear model estimated generates brisker expansions and - to a lesser extent - sharper contractions than its linear counterpart. These features fit well the observed positive skewness and large kurtosis of U. S. manufacturing sectoral investment/capital ratios. ...|$|E
40|$|In newly {{discovered}} topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), the unique crystalline {{protection of the}} surface state (<b>SS)</b> <b>band</b> structure {{has led to a}} series of intriguing predictions of strain generated phenomena, from the appearance of pseudo-magnetic fields and helical flat bands, to the tunability of the Dirac SS by strain that may be used to construct "straintronic" nanoswitches. However, practical realization of this exotic phenomenology via strain engineering is experimentally challenging and is yet to be achieved. In this work, we have designed an experiment to not only generate and measure strain locally, but to also directly measure the resulting effects on the Dirac SS. We grow heteroepitaxial thin films of TCI SnTe in-situ and measure them by using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Large STM images were analyzed to determine picoscale changes in the atomic positions which reveal regions of both tensile and compressive strain. Simultaneous Fourier-transform STM was then used {{to determine the effects of}} strain on the Dirac electrons. We find that strain continuously tunes the momentum space position of the Dirac points, consistent with theoretical predictions. Our work demonstrates the fundamental mechanism necessary for using TCIs in strain-based applications, and establishes these systems as highly tunable platforms for nanodevices...|$|R

40|$|Excessive daytime {{sleepiness}} (EDS) {{is one of}} {{the main}} symptoms of several sleep related disorders with a great impact on the patient lives. While many studies have been carried out in order to assess daytime sleepiness, the automatic EDS detection still remains an open problem. In this work, a novel approach to this issue based on non-linear dynamical analysis of EEG signal was proposed. Multichannel EEG signals were recorded during five maintenance of wakefulness (MWT) and multiple sleep latency (MSLT) tests alternated throughout the day from patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing. A group of 20 patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) was compared with a group of 20 patients without daytime sleepiness (WDS), by analyzing 60 -s EEG windows in waking state. Measures obtained from cross-mutual information function (CMIF) and auto-mutual-information function (AMIF) were calculated in the EEG. These functions permitted a quantification of the complexity properties of the EEG signal and the non-linear couplings between different zones of the scalp. Statistical differences between EDS and WDS groups were found in <b>ß</b> <b>band</b> during MSLT events (. p-value< 0. 0001).

40|$|A ~ 100 ka old {{laminated}} tufa (freshwater carbonate) deposit {{from central}} Greece was studied {{for evidence of}} a seasonal origin of the laminae. Annual laminar couplets (6 mm thick) consist of dense <b>ß</b> <b>bands</b> of spring–early summer calcified cyanobacterial bushes and porous a bands of autumn precipitated calcite on un-clustered cyanobacterial filaments. This is evidence of likely seasonal palaeoclimate during the last interglacial in Greece. d 18 O variability is explained by seasonal changes in stream water temperature; however, the total range in d 18 O translates to ~ 6 °C (± 1 °C) almost certainly underestimating the likely actual range of ~ 17 °C. As abrupt changes in d 18 O inferred temperatures (from warming to cooling and vice versa) occur exactly on sharp petrographic lamina boundaries, we infer that mid-summer and mid-winter precipitates are missing. We suggest that when stream conditions (summer drying and winter cold) are unsuited to cyanobacterial substrate development, no tufa build-up occurs. Laminated tufas are thus incomplete records of annual tufa formation, as are the d 18 O based palaeoclimate records they preserve. They require careful petrographic study linked to high resolution sampling for d 18 O to ensure that palaeotemperature ranges are not seriously underestimated...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To compare {{fracture}} {{patterns of}} posterior teeth temporized with: mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) glass–ionomer cement (GIC) interim restorations, stainless steel (<b>SS)</b> <b>bands,</b> GIC dome overlays and GIC dome overlays with occlusal temporary restorations. Methodology: The root canals of 92 extracted human premolars and molars were prepared with rotary NiTi instruments and dressed with calcium hydroxide paste prior to cavity preparation for standardized MOD restorations. Teeth {{were divided into}} four groups (n = 23) and temporarily restored with: GIC interim restorations (GIC group), stainless steel bands (SS group), GIC dome overlays (GIC-O group) or GIC dome overlays with intermediate restorative material (IRM) in the access cavities (GIC-IRM group). Teeth were subjected to compressive axial load until fracture; fracture forces and fracture modes were recorded. Statistical analysis included Kaplan–Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards model, one-way analysis of variance, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results: There was a significantly higher risk of failure in the GIC group compared with the SS (P < 0. 001), GIC-O (P < 0. 001) and GIC-IRM (P = 0. 001) groups. The mean fracture force for SS {{was significantly higher than}} GIC-O (P = 0. 03) and GIC-IRM (P < 0. 001). GIC fracture force was significantly lower than all other groups (P < 0. 001). Significantly fewer unfavourable fractures were observed in SS compared with GIC (P = 0. 001), GIC-O (P = 0. 007) and GIC-IRM (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Glass–ionomer cement dome overlays with reduced cuspal height and occlusal inclines may be recommended for broken-down posterior teeth, without any risk of poor aesthetics, gingival irritation or further proximal tooth structure loss. Stainless steel bands may only need to be used in extensively broken-down teeth or in the presence of parafunctional habits. No Full Tex...|$|E

Our {{analysis of these}} data leads to six main conclusions: orders and sales are made infrequently; orders are more volatile than sales; order sizes vary considerably; there is substantial high-frequency variation in the firm's sales prices; inventory/sales ratios are unstable; and there are occasional stockouts. We model the firm generically as a durable commodity intermediary that engages in commodity price speculation. We demonstrate that the firm's inventory investment behavior at the product level is well approximated by an optimal trading strategy from the solution to a nonlinear dynamic programming problem with two continuous state variables and one continuous control variable that is subject to frequently binding inequality constraints. We show that the optimal trading strategy is a generalized (S,s) rule. That is, whenever the firm's inventory level q falls below the order threshold s(p) the firm places an order of size S(p) - q in order to attain a target inventory level S(p) satisfying S(p) >= s(p), where p is the current spot price at which the firm can purchase unlimited amounts of the commodity after incurring a fixed order cost K. We show that the (<b>S,s)</b> <b>bands</b> are decreasing functions of p, capturing the basic intuition of commodity price speculation, namely, that it is optimal for the firm to hold higher inventories when the spot price is low than when it is high in order to profit from "buying low and selling high.

The multiplicity of starch biosynthetic enzymes is evolutionarily conserved in plants suggesting their functions are essential in starch biosynthesis. The overall goal of this research is to determine the specific molecular functions of the multiple starch branching enzyme (BE) isoforms in maize.;This dissertation first addresses what, if any, are the differences in enzymatic properties of BEIIa and BEIIb. Two polyclonal antisera were produced, alphaBEI and alphaBEIIab which specifically identify BEI and both BEII isoforms, respectively. Chromatographic purification techniques separated native BEIIa or BEIIb from the other two branching enzymes. The capacities to modify the structure of amylose were compared between native BEIIa and BEIIb and recombinant BEIIa (rIIa). The evolutionary conservation of BEIIa and BEIIb is not accounted for by their enzymatic differences. Differences in the glucan chain length distribution created by native BEIIa and rIIa suggest that in vivo there are factors affecting the activity of BEs.;This dissertation next addresses are branching enzymes involved in multi-subunit complexes (MSCs) ? This research provides direct evidence BEIIa and SSI interact with each other in MSC and that SSIII may be a component of the MSCs.

Measurements from a cross-shore {{array of}} {{pressure}} sensors and current-meters, deployed on the fringing reef of Ipan, Guam {{as part of}} the PILOT (Pacific Island Land-Ocean Typhoon) experiment, were analyzed to understand the processes driving the large water level oscillations observed at the shore during energetic wave events. Offshore, sea and swell (SS: 3 to 20 seconds period) energy is dominant, while on the reef flat, energetic oscillations are observed with periods in the infragravity (IG: 20 to 200 seconds) and far infragravity (fIG 200 to 1000 seconds) bands. The nonlinear processes that contribute to this low-pass transformation of wave energy across the reef are analyzed in terms of the energetics of the wave field in each frequency band. Wave transformation across the fringing reef is characterized by the strong breaking and dissipation of the incident SS energy which provides a driving force for the waves at lower frequencies. The SS energy on the reef flat is shown to be strongly dependent on the total reef flat water level that includes wave induced setup. The non linear transfer of energy between the SS and low frequency (LF: IG and fIG) bands is responsible for both the forcing and the loss of low frequency energy at the reef crest. In IG band, the low frequency oscillations resulting from the breaking SS envelope work against the incident bound waves and energy is transferred to the <b>SS</b> <b>band</b> similar to the nonlinear transfer observed on sandy beaches. The SS envelope oscillations at fIG frequencies force free fIG waves across the surfzone. Across the reef flat, low frequency oscillations at normal mode frequencies are preferentially excited. The development of standing waves on the reef flat is controlled by the strong depth dependent frictional dissipation of the LF waves reflected at the shoreline. During tropical storm Man-Yi, resonant standing modes in the fIG band were excited when a large increase in water level over the reef occurred due to wave setup that both reduced the effects of friction and the period of the fundamental mode...|$|R

Chains with DP 6 to 9 and DP 16 to 19 decreased while chains with DP 10 to 15 and DP 20 to 25 increased in the mutants amylopectin.

ROC analysis yielded the following AUC: NeuSeg, 0. 71; WBC, 0. 70; Fib, 0. 67; Alb, 0. 64; Fe, 0. 64; Band, 0. 59. Best combination of Sensitivity (SS) and Specificity (SP) was Fib (SS, 52. 7; SP, 77. 5 for 400 mg/dL cut-off) and <b>Band</b> (<b>SS,</b> 17. 6; SP, 98. 0 for 0. 3 K/μL cut-off). Conclusions: The correlation between CRP and other parameters (except LymphREA), is significant but low. The diagnostic power of each inflammatory marker compared with CRP is low but combining more parameters simultaneously the accuracy of APR is increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{systemic}} reaction to acute inflammation, {{also known as}} acute phase response, induces some hemato-biochemical changes, which can be evidenced in laboratory findings. The C Reactive Protein (CRP) is a main acute phase response protein elective in dogs to detect inflammatory disease. Other blood parameters {{have been described as}} useful inflammation markers i. e. Fibrinogen and Leukocytes (1, 2, 3). The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the CRP values in comparison to Fibrinogen (Fib), Albumin (Alb), and Iron (Fe) values, total White Blood Cell (WBC), Segmented Neutrophil (NeuSeg) and Band Neutrophil (Band) counts, and the occurrence of Toxic Neutrophils (Neu TOX), Activated Monocytes (Mon ATT), and Reactive Lymphocytes (Linf REA) in blood smears. For this purpose, data of 1, 837 blood samples was collected over a three-year period (2012 - 2015). Data collected for each sample included: Fib, Alb, Fe, WBC, NeuSeg, Band, Neu TOX, Mon ATT, Linf REA and CRP, as well as information regarding dog’s age, breed, and gender. Blood samples were divided into 2 groups: "inflammatory";; CRP ≥ 0. 30 mg/dL (# 1080) and non-inflammatory;; CRP ≤ 0. 29 mg/dL (# 757). The 2 groups were compared using: Chi squared for sex, breed, and age; Relative risk (RR) for age; Spearman Rank correlation test (SRct) for all parameters studied; Multiple regression (MR) to assess the relationship between CRP and other inflammation markers; Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for diagnostic accuracy of each parameter in comparison to CRP (MedCalc®, 14. 8). Dogs belonging to inflammatory group were significantly older (> 7 years old) than those of non-inflammatory group (P< 0. 05), (RR, 1. 38). Low yet significant (p< 0. 01) correlations between CRP and the other markers were noted using the SRct (R) : CRP/Fib, + 0. 26; CRP/NeuSeg, + 0. 26; CRP/WBC, + 0. 24; CRP/Alb, - 0. 21; CRP/Band, + 0. 14; CRP/Fe, - 0. 08; CRP/NeuTOX, + 0. 23; MonATT, + 0. 22. On the contrary, the MR analysis did not show any relationship between CRP and other markers (R 2 : 0. 05 for CRP ≥ 0. 30 mg/dL;; 0. 02 for CRP ≤ 0. 29 mg/dL). ROC analysis of the parameters yielded the following results: NeuSeg is a moderately accurate inflammation marker with Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0. 71. The other parameters are less accurate markers of inflammation (AUC) compared to CRP: WBC, 0. 70; Fib, 0. 67; Alb, 0. 64; Fe, 0. 64; Band, 0. 59. The markers with the best combination of Sensitivity (SS) and Specificity (SP) were: Fib (SS, 52. 7; SP, 77. 5 for 400 mg/dL cut-off) and <b>Band</b> (<b>SS,</b> 17. 6; SP, 98. 0 for 0. 3 K/μL cut-off). The correlation between CRP and all the parameters studied, except Linf REA, is significant but low because they are affected by many conditions aside from inflammation. None of them is able to predict CRP values. The diagnostic accuracy of each single inflammatory marker is lower in comparison to CRP. In order to increase the diagnostic accuracy of inflammation markers, an evaluation of several parameters simultaneously is warranted, particularly in the absence of CRP measurement...|$|R
