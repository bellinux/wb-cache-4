25|$|For many species, <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{determined}} by inherited traits, but instead by environmental factors experienced during development or later in life. Many reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination: the temperature embryos experience during their development determines {{the sex of}} the organism. In some turtles, for example, males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1–2°C.|$|E

In the United States, no barrier methods for use during oral sex have been evaluated as effective by the Food and Drug Administration. However, a barrier protection like a condom for fellatio or dental dam for cunnilingus can offer some protection from contact when practicing oral sex.|$|E

Sexual relations are forbidden during the time of the woman's period. After her period has ended, she will go to the mikveh (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during these times, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.|$|E

It may be because of these views that condom use with anal sex is often reported to be low and inconsistent across all groups in various countries.|$|E
2500|$|Female-female genital <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{exclusive}} to humans.

2500|$|Another {{theory is}} that sexual {{reproduction}} originated from selfish parasitic genetic elements that exchange genetic material (that is: copies of their own genome) for their transmission and propagation. In some organisms, sexual reproduction {{has been shown to}} enhance the spread of parasitic genetic elements (e.g.: yeast, filamentous fungi). Bacterial conjugation, a form of genetic exchange that some sources describe as <b>sex,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a form of reproduction, but rather an example of horizontal gene transfer. However, it does support the selfish genetic element theory, as it is propagated through such a [...] "selfish gene", the F-plasmid. Similarly, it has been proposed that sexual reproduction evolved from ancient haloarchaea through a combination of jumping genes, and swapping plasmids.|$|E

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with the contemporary world in which it takes place, the McOndo literary movement addresses the themes of sex and sexuality in a rather modern and unapologetic way. [...] Sex scenes tend to be described and explained realistically and are so detailed in some cases that they reach the point of coming off as vulgar. [...] <b>Sex</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a theme that is unnecessarily romanticized. [...] Furthermore, consistent with McOndo's contemporary and postmodern foundations, gender roles and homosexuality are not ignored as relevant themes in modern society. [...] While these roles and definitions are not shown or explained concretely, they are introduced and portrayed as real contemporary issues that also deal with the conflicts of identity that are ever present in modern Latin America.|$|E
2500|$|Swedish manuals {{of style}} treat [...] "hen" [...] as a neologism. Major {{newspapers}} like Dagens Nyheter have recommended against its usage, though some journalists still use it. The Swedish Language Council has not issued any general recommendations {{against the use}} of hen, but advises {{against the use of}} the object form henom ("her/him"); it instead recommends using hen as both the subject and object form. Hen has two basic usages: as a way to avoid a stated preference to either gender; or as a way of referring to individuals who are transgender, who prefer to identify themselves as belonging to a third gender or who reject the division of male/female gender roles on ideological grounds. Its entry will cover two definitions: as a reference to individual's belonging to an unspecified sex or third gender, or where the <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known.|$|E
2500|$|In this discussion, {{it should}} be {{understood}} that the controversial topic is inappropriate sexual conduct for a Buddhist practitioner, as the Dalai Lama has repeatedly [...] "voiced {{his support for the}} full recognition of human rights for all people, regardless of sexual orientation." [...] He explained in 1997: [...] "It's part of what we Buddhists call bad sexual conduct. Sexual organs were created for reproduction between the male element and the female element — and everything that deviates from that is not acceptable from a Buddhist point of view," [...] while penis-vagina non-procreative <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered to be sexual misconduct. The Dalai Lama admitted that {{there is a difference between}} the views of believers and unbelievers: [...] "From a Buddhist point of view, men-to-men and women-to-women is generally considered sexual misconduct.

2500|$|Crocodiles lay eggs, {{which are}} laid in either holes or mound nests, {{depending}} on species. A hole nest is usually excavated in sand and a mound nest is usually constructed out of vegetation. Nesting periods {{range from a}} few weeks up to six months. Courtship {{takes place in a}} series of behavioural interactions that include a variety of snout rubbing and submissive display that can take a long time. Mating always takes place in water, where the pair can be observed mating several times. Females can build or dig several trial nests which appear incomplete and abandoned later. Egg-laying usually takes place at night and about 30–40 minutes. Females are highly protective of their nests and young. The egg are hard shelled, but translucent at the time of egg-laying. Depending on the species of crocodile, 7 to 95 eggs are laid. Crocodile embryos do not have sex chromosomes, and unlike humans, <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> determined genetically. Sex is determined by temperature, where at [...] or less most hatchlings are females and at , offspring are of both sexes. A temperature of [...] gives mostly males whereas above [...] in some species continues to give males, but in other species resulting in females, which are sometimes called high-temperature females. Temperature also affects growth and survival rate of the young, which may explain the sexual dimorphism in crocodiles. The average incubation period is around 80 days, and also is dependent on temperature and species that usually ranges from 65 to 95 days. The eggshell structure is very conservative through evolution but there are enough changes to tell different species apart by their eggshell microstructure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contemporary}} sex {{and gender}} model corrects and broadens the horizons {{of the sex}} and gender ideologies. It revises the ideology of sex in that an individual's sex is actually a social construct which {{is not limited to}} either male or female. This can be seen by the Intersex Society of North America which explains that, [...] "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex". Therefore, <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a biological/natural construct but a social one instead since, society and doctors decide on {{what it means to be}} male, female, or intersex in terms of sex chromosomes and genitals, in addition to their personal judgment on who or how one passes as a specific sex. The ideology of gender remains a social construct but is not as strict and fixed. Instead, gender is easily malleable, and is forever changing. One example of where the standard definition of gender alters with time happens to be depicted in Sally Shuttleworth's Female Circulation in which the, [...] "abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England". In other words, this quote shows what it meant growing up into the roles of a female (gender/roles) changed from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, the contemporary sex gender model is accurate because both sex and gender are rightly seen as social constructs inclusive of the wide spectrum of sexes and genders and in which nature and nurture are interconnected.|$|E
