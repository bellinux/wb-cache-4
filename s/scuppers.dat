25|$|Hung copper gutters are {{supported}} by brass- or copper brackets or hangers, or by brass straps. Copper gutter linings are often built into wood framed supporting structures. <b>Scuppers</b> are used to provide an outlet through parapet walls or gravel stops on flat and built-up roofs to allow drainage of excess water. They {{can be used in}} conjunction with gutters and downspouts to divert water flow to the desired location. Copper roof sumps are generally used for draining small roof areas such as canopies. Roof sump drains are not recommended for general roof drainage systems.|$|E

Towards the stern is a rectangular pilothouse and a low cabin with a companionway which has a protruding stack.|$|E

500|$|The barge {{measures}} [...] {{long with}} a [...] beam. The {{depth of the}} hold is listed at [...] {{and it had a}} listed capacity of 311 tons. Clouette describes the Priscilla Dailey as having a [...] "nearly rectangular hull in profile, section and plan, with squared-off stern and bluntly rounded bow. Low bulwarks with <b>scuppers</b> rise slightly to a peak where they join the prominently projecting stem. There are several raised strakes in the bow. The superstructure consists mainly of a single low coaming which extends nearly the length of the vessel". Toward the stern is a small cabin that has the same width and height of the coaming. In 1978, the National Register of Historic Places nomination noted that the convex hatch covers likely floated away and that the squarish hood over the companionway had washed away.|$|E

500|$|Within a {{few days}} all the 14surviving fugitives in Tahiti had {{surrendered}} or been captured. Among Pandora's officers was former Bounty midshipman Thomas Hayward. Heywood's hopes that his former shipmate would verify his innocence were quickly dashed. Hayward, [...] "...like all worldlings raised a little in life, received us very coolly, and pretended ignorance of our affairs." [...] Pandora remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards tried without success to obtain information on Bounty's whereabouts. A cell was built on Pandora's quarterdeck, a structure known as [...] "Pandora's Box" [...] where the prisoners, legs in irons and wrists in handcuffs, were to be confined for almost five months. Heywood wrote: [...] "The heat ... was so intense that the sweat frequently ran in streams to the <b>scuppers,</b> and produced maggots {{in a short time}} ... and the two necessary tubs which were constantly kept in place helped to render our situation truly disagreeable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Primarily, the Miller Highway {{consisted}} of six lanes, supported above the street level on steel columns, which were located {{at regular intervals}} (~80 feet) at the outer edges and center of the roadway. [...] Longitudinal strength girders ran between the support columns along {{the direction of the}} roadway. [...] The longitudinal girders supported the industrial looking balustrades and the median. [...] Lateral strength girders ran between the support columns across the roadway, and was the location of the expansion joints. [...] Smaller longitudinal and transverse floorbeams formed a lattice structure between major girders to support the road deck. [...] The road deck {{consisted of}} reinforced concrete, on top of which the paved surface would sit. [...] Originally this was Belgian block, and was eventually substituted or paved over with asphalt as construction materials matured. [...] Drainage was provided at the expansion joints (on the older sections) or grated channels {{along the edge of the}} road (newest sections), with rainwater and snowmelt being plumbed to the street through <b>scuppers</b> and downspouts located at the main support columns. [...] It was not uncommon during the life of the highway that it would be supporting not only traffic, but 6 to 8 inches of standing water. [...] The high impermeable balustrades, the undersized <b>scuppers,</b> and the lack of drain cleaning / maintenance were all ingredients which contributed to the structure's demise.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence of Darlwynes history {{confirmed}} Barratt as {{its legal}} owner. [...] The court noted the general {{state of the}} vessel and the various alterations that had been carried out, affecting its seaworthiness. In particular, the cockpit floor was not watertight and had inadequate <b>scuppers,</b> so that water entering the cockpit [...] drained into the lower hull rather than back into the sea. Lacking watertight bulkheads, the hull would easily flood with any rapid ingress of water. The hull itself showed evidence of dry rot and other external damage. Poor communication between the various parties concerned with the vessel in the preceding months meant that these various shortcomings had been overlooked or ignored. Furthermore, the overloading of the vessel with 31 people meant that she lay low in the water, so that a modest heel of 30 degrees would allow water into the open cockpit.|$|E
