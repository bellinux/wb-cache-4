500|$|Of the cetaceans, pilot {{whales are}} among the most common <b>stranders.</b> Because of their strong social bonds, whole groups of pilot whales will strand. Single <b>stranders</b> have been {{recorded}} and these are usually diseased. Group stranding tends to be of mostly healthy individuals. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain group strandings. [...] When using magnetic fields for navigation, the whales have been suggested to get perplexed by geomagnetic anomalies or they may be following a sick member of their group that got stranded. The pod also may be following a member of high importance that got stranded and a secondary social response makes them keep returning. Researchers from New Zealand have successfully used secondary social responses to keep a stranding pod of long-finned pilot whales from returning to the beach. In addition, the young members of the pod were taken offshore to buoys, and their distress calls lured the older whales back out to sea.|$|E
500|$|Pilot whales eat squid primarily, {{and also}} fish. They are highly social, and {{studies suggest that}} {{both males and females}} remain in their mother's pod, an unusual trait among mammals, also found in certain killer whale communities. Short-finned pilot whales {{are one of the few}} mammal species in which females go through menopause, and post-reproductive females may {{contribute}} to the survival of younger members of their pods. Pilot whales are notorious for stranding themselves on beaches, and are among the most common cetacean <b>stranders.</b> Several theories have been proposed to account for this behavior. The conservation status of neither species has been determined, but they are subject to both direct and indirect bycatch in fisheries. [...] Whalers in a few countries continue to hunt pilot whales.|$|E

But first, they have to escape Glipwood Forest, the thieving <b>Stranders</b> of the East Bend, and the Fork Factory, where {{children}} get taken by the Black Carriage to make swords and weapons (and forks) for the Fangs.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1980s, beach music {{enjoyed a}} major revival in the Carolinas, {{thanks largely to}} the {{formation}} of a loose-knit organization known as The Society of <b>Stranders</b> (SOS).

5000|$|In 2010, {{well known}} Dutch theatre makers Jaïr <b>Stranders</b> and Bo Tarenskeen {{worried about the}} {{decreasing}} eloquence of the Remembrance of the Dead memorial service. According to them, {{the distance between the}} current generations and the Second World War was not only increasing, they also felt that the character of the annual ceremony had become too general and abstract. They felt that it threatened to make it impossible to properly reflect on the specific history of the Second World War.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} on-line decentralised {{algorithm}} for coordinating mobile sensors {{for a broad}} class of information gathering tasks. These sensors can be deployed in unknown and possibly hostile environments, where uncertainty and dynamism are endemic. Such environments are common {{in the areas of}} disaster response and military surveillance. Our coordination approach itself is based on work by <b>Stranders</b> et al. (2009), that uses the max-sum algorithm to coordinate mobile sensors for monitoring spatial phenomena. In particular, we generalise and extend their approach to any domain where measurements can be valued. Also, we introduce a clustering approach that allows sensors to negotiate over paths to the most relevant locations, as opposed to a set of fixed directions, which results in a significantly improved performance. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to two challenging and distinct information gathering tasks. In the first–pursuit-evasion (PE) –sensors need to capture a target whose movement might be unknown. In the second– patrolling (P) –sensors need to minimise loss from intrusions that occur within their environment. In doing so, we obtain the first decentralised coordination algorithms for these domains. Finally, in each domain, we empirically evaluate our approach in a simulated environment, and show that it outperforms two state of the art greedy algorithms by 30 % (PE) and 44 % (P), and an existing approach based on the Travelling Salesman Problem by 52 % (PE) and 30 % (P). ...|$|E
