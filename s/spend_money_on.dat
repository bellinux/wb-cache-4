5|$|Despite the success, {{chairman}} Derek Pavis {{refused to}} <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> transfers, {{and as a}} result fell out with Allardyce. Allardyce was eventually allowed to spend £50,000 on striker Kevin Rapley, who helped the club to steer clear of relegation {{at the end of the}} 1998–99 campaign. In the summer he signed midfielder Craig Ramage and utility player Clayton Blackmore. Allardyce remained in charge at Meadow Lane until 14 October 1999, when he resigned his post at Notts County to return to Bolton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|Lee was {{met with}} resistance, because the audio {{industry}} at the time didn't believe cables made an audible difference in the sound and wire {{was something that was}} normally provided for free. Lee did demonstrations at retailers comparing Monster cables to zip cord to convince consumers that expensive equipment was wasted on cheap wiring. Sales picked up as retailers saw the wiring as an opportunity for higher profit margins. This led Lee to provide incentives to retail salespeople to sell the cabling, rather than <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> advertising. This led to criticisms that his business model creates aggressive salespeople.|$|E

5|$|To {{allow his}} system {{to reach its}} full potential, Chapman {{encouraged}} his chairman to <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> new players. The club's first ever transfer fee, £400, was paid for Welsh international Lloyd Davies who remains Northampton's most-capped player, winger Fred McDiarmid and playmaking centre half David McCartney. With this new talent, {{in his first season}} in charge, Chapman led Northampton to eighth place; with additional new signings, such as inside forward Albert Lewis from Coventry City, he used this as a springboard to take the Southern League title in 1908–09, with Lewis finishing as top scorer.|$|E
5|$|The Warners {{starred in}} the feature-length, direct-to-video movie Wakko's Wish. The movie {{takes place in the}} fictional town of Acme Falls, in which the Warners {{and the rest of the}} Animaniacs cast are under the rule of a greedy king who conquered their home country from a {{neighboring}} country. When the Warners find out about a star that will grant a wish to the first person that touches it, the Warners, the villagers (the Animaniacs cast), and the king race to get to it first. Although children and adults rated Wakko's Wish highly in test-screenings, Warner Bros. decided to release it direct-to-video, rather than <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> advertising. Warner Bros. released the movie on VHS on December 21, 1999; the film was then released on DVD on October 7, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

5|$|The Morumbi Stadium {{failed to}} provide proof of funding for a R$630million {{renovation}} plan requested by FIFA to secure {{its status as a}} World Cup venue; the stadium was then excluded from the tournament on 16 June 2010. The Local World Cup Committee suggested to use Arena Corinthians instead. FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Journalist Wagner Vilaron from O Estado de S. Paulo deemed the exclusion of the Morumbi Stadium from the World Cup and the subsequent choice of Arena Corinthians as a venue for the event to be politically charged. After receiving several negative responses from FIFA about the renovation project for Morumbi, then-CBF-president Ricardo Teixeira lost patience with São Paulo Futebol Clube officers; he considered that they were delaying the decision by purposely failing to meet the requirements to force the government to <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the construction. São Paulo's opposition to Teixeira in the now defunct Clube dos 13 electionwhich was won by ruling-side Fábio Koff, aligned with São Paulo's Juvenal Juvêncioirritated the CBF president. At the same time, an affinity between Teixeira and then-president of Corinthians, Andrés Sanchezwho was chosen as the head of delegation for the national team during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and on the same side on Clube dos 13's electionwas noticed.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Norris {{arranged}} for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in contentious circumstances. With increased financial resources, the club established themselves as a permanent fixture in the division and was better able to <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> new players. In 1930, Arsenal beat Newcastle United to win its first major piece of silverware: the FA Cup. Success continued right throughout the decade, as they won five league championships and a further FA Cup in seven years. Following the Second World War, Arsenal won two more championships and a FA Cup, but their fortunes gradually declined. It was not until 1970 that the club won another trophy – the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a European club competition designed to promote trade fairs. A first league and cup double was completed a year later; {{by the end of}} the decade Arsenal added another FA Cup, beating Manchester United in the 1979 final. 1980 saw Arsenal lose two finals in quick succession, defeated by West Ham United in the FA Cup final and then to Valencia in the Cup Winners' Cup on penalties. The club won their first League Cup in 1987, but a year later failed to retain the trophy as outsiders Luton Town beat them in the final. In 1989, Arsenal won their first league championship in 18 years, courtesy of Michael Thomas' last-minute goal against closest challengers Liverpool in the final game of the season. The club did not build on their success, finishing fourth the following season, but regained the title in 1991. As champions, Arsenal were eligible to play in the European Cup, but their time in the competition ended abruptly as they were eliminated in the second round to Benfica.|$|E

The council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property.
