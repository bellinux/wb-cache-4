25|$|Victory went to Schumacher at {{the wheel}} of a Ferrari in appalling conditions. It was {{something}} of a farce, for in addition to the pit lane confusion, he was penalised 10sec for passing another racer under a yellow flag. The stewards failed to inform the teams of their decision in the proper manner so Schumacher took his <b>stop</b> <b>go</b> penalty in the pits, after the race was over! McLaren appealed to the FIA, but the appeal was rejected and the results were confirmed, with Häkkinen second in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine third in the second Ferrari.|$|E
500|$|The film {{includes}} four role-playing scenes. In the first, a man tells a girl {{that he will}} buy her a toy if she goes home with him. In the second, eight-year-old Natasha goes to her friend's house and finds that only her friend's father is home; after he intentionally spills water on her clothes, he tells her to take them off. The film cuts to Harris, who says, [...] "She should look him {{straight in the eye}} and tell him to <b>stop,</b> <b>go</b> away". In the third scene, a group of older boys try to lure young children into their [...] "special club"; they lead one young boy to a secluded, wooded area and try to convince him to remove his clothes. In the last role-playing scene, Sophie's father offers her a secret bubble bath; afterwards, he tells her not to tell anyone because he would go to jail and it would be her fault.|$|E
500|$|In , Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen became Schumacher's {{main title}} competition. Häkkinen {{won the first}} two races of the season, gaining a 16-point {{advantage}} over Schumacher. Schumacher then won in Argentina and, with the Ferrari improving significantly {{in the second half}} of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes. Ferrari took a 1–2 finish at the , the first Ferrari 1–2 finish since 1990, and the , which tied Schumacher with Häkkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points, but Häkkinen won the Championship by winning the final two races. There were two controversies; at the [...] Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start finish line and stopped for a ten-second <b>stop</b> <b>go</b> penalty. There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but, because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane, the win was valid. At Spa, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. After both cars returned to the pits, Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him.|$|E

50|$|Up at the front, Schumacher led Barrichello by 13 {{seconds at}} half-distance. By this point, the Ferraris were {{so far ahead}} that Barrichello {{retained}} an advantage of over half a minute over third-placed Montoya following a spin on lap 33. By making one fewer stop, Montoya managed {{to catch up with}} the Brazilian and overtake him on lap 41, but Barrichello repassed him five laps later and pulled away again. Ralf Schumacher benefitted from the misfortunes of the McLarens and the Renaults to regain fourth, only to have another pit <b>stop</b> <b>go</b> wrong when his fuel rig failed. This left four more Bridgestone drivers - Villeneuve, Heidfeld, Olivier Panis in the second BAR and Giancarlo Fisichella in the Jordan - occupying fourth to seventh.|$|E

50|$|At {{the third}} start, Patrese made a poor getaway {{and dropped to}} fourth behind Mansell, Alesi and Senna. Senna quickly overtook Alesi, while further back, Piquet and Prost dropped behind Modena and Prost also dropped behind the fast-starting Jordan of Andrea de Cesaris. Berger, meanwhile, {{suffered}} his third consecutive early retirement when his engine exploded on lap 5, the resulting oil causing Pierluigi Martini to spin off in his Minardi. Patrese started his recovery by overtaking Alesi and then out-braking Senna into turn 1, putting him into second behind Mansell. On lap 15, Patrese passed his team-mate, who was having engine overheating concerns, for the lead. Mansell fell back towards Senna, Piquet, de Cesaris, Moreno and Alesi (who had spun), but eventually the concerns faded and the Englishman pulled away again. Alesi passed Moreno and de Cesaris for fifth, only for his clutch to fail on lap 43, team-mate Prost having dropped out on lap 17 with an alternator failure. Piquet's race ended on lap 45 with a broken wheel bearing, and when Moreno had a pit <b>stop</b> <b>go</b> wrong, Bertrand Gachot found himself fifth in the second Jordan, before spinning off.|$|E
