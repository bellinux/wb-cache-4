40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to understand and identify prison male inmates who had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> in their history prior to their incarceration. The objectives were (1) the comparison of inmates who had indicated that they had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> in their past, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> inmates, 2 ̆ 2 with inmates who had not, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 non-suicide attempt inmates, 2 ̆ 2 on 33 behavioral and personal variables; (2) The development of a <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> scale by means of an item analysis on the responses of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> and non-suicide inmates to the items of the Bipolar Psychological Inventory (BPI). This scale was named the BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale; (3) The development of a comp o site <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> scale; the components selected for this scale would be the BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale, and/or {{one or more of the}} 33 personal and behavioral variables. This scale w 9 s named the Criminal <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale. Based on an original and a replication sample of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> inmates and non-suicide attempt inmates at the Utah State Prison, with those in the original sample being younger, the findings were: (1) of the 33 personal and behavioral variables only one of them, prior drug use, differentiated each of the two groups within each of the two samples; several other different ones of them differentiated each of the two groups within each of the two samples; (2) BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale, derived from the Bipolar Psychological Inventory which the inmates at the prison take usually soon after their incarceration, and developed on the two groups of the original sample, was able to differentiate the two groups of the replication sample at the. 001 level; (3) The Criminal <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale, which consisted of two weighted components, drug use variable and the BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale, correlated. 38 with the <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> vs. non-suicide attempt inmates of the replication sample and it was shown to have moderate accuracy in identifying <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> inmates. In an attempt to further validate the developed BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale, a supplementary study was included in this dissertation. It concerned the use of this scale on male inmates at the Utah State Prison who had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> at the prison, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 prison suicide attempters. 2 ̆ 2 It compared their scores on this scale with those of the two groups of the replication sample, and related their scores on the scales of the Bipolar Psychological Inventory (BPI) and a risk rating. The findings were (1) derived from their BPI, the scores on the BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale of the prison suicide attempters and of the non-suicide attempt inmates differed significantly at the. 02 level. The mean score of the prison suicide attempters was essentially the same as that of the <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> inmates of the replication sample; (2) the BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale scores of the prison suicide attempters correlated positively and significantly with their scores on 8 scales of the BPI. Six of these scales, depression, self-degradation, impulsiveness, psychic pain, family discord and dependence are related to factors indicated in the literature of suicidology to be associated with suicidal individuals; (3) the BPI <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Scale scores of the prison suicide attempters did not correlate with their risk factors scores on the risk-rescue rating of Weisman and Worden (1974) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the prevalence of suicidal ideation and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> among prisoners in New South Wales, Australia; and, among prisoners reporting suicidal ideation, to identify factors associated with <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt.</b> Methods A cross-sectional design was used. Participants were a random, stratified sample of 996 inmates who completed a telephone survey. The estimated population prevalence of suicidal ideation and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> were calculated and differences by sex and Aboriginality were tested using χ 2 tests. Correlates of suicidal ideation and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> were tested using logistic regression. Results One-third of inmates reported lifetime suicidal ideation and one-fifth had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide.</b> Women and Aboriginal participants {{were significantly more likely}} than men and non-Aboriginal participants, respectively, to report <b>attempting</b> <b>suicide.</b> Correlates of suicidal ideation included violent offending, traumatic brain injury, depression, self-harm, and psychiatric hospitalisation. Univariate correlates of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> among ideators were childhood out-of-home care, parental incarceration and psychiatric hospitalization; however, none of these remained significant in a multivariate model. Conclusions Suicidal ideation and attempts are highly prevalent among prisoners compared to the general community. Assessment of suicide risk is a critical task for mental health clinicians in prisons. Attention should be given to ensuring assessments are gender- and culturally sensitive. Indicators of mental illness may not be accurate predictors of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt.</b> Indicators of childhood trauma appear to be particularly relevant to risk of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> among prisoners and should be given attention as part of risk assessments. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{if there is a}} relation to low serum cholesterol, lipoprotein, serotonin or tryptophan levels in patients with depression who have recently <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide.</b> DESIGN: Biochemical and behavioural study. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient treatment at the Instituto Mexicano de Psiquiatría. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode. Eighteen of these patients had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> in the month {{before the start of the}} study; 15 patients had never <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide.</b> OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, serotonin (5 -HT) and tryptophan. Scores on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Carroll Depression Rating Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale and Beck <b>Suicide</b> <b>Attempt</b> Severity Scale. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between patients who had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> and those who had not in terms of serum cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels. Serum levels of 5 -HT and tryptophan were significantly lower in patients with depression who had a recent <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> than in those patients who had never <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide.</b> A comparison of patients not taking antidepressant medication found serum 5 -HT levels to be more than 3 times lower in those patients with a recent <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> than in patients with no history of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The study found no difference in lipid profiles between patients who had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> and those who had not.

5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the patient intake and treatment-related risk factors associated with a <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> in the 30 days before a 1 -year posttreatment assessment. Methods: A national sample of 8, 807 patients presenting for treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system were assessed at treatment intake and follow-up. Using the MacArthur Model, the risk and protective factors for <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> were identified at baseline and during treatment. Results: At follow-up, 4 % (314 / 8, 807) of the patients reported a <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> within the past 30 days. Baseline predictors of a <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> before follow-up included elevated suicidal/psychi-atric symptoms, more recent problematic alcohol use, and longer duration of cocaine use. Contact with {{the criminal justice system}} was a protective factor that reduced the likelihood of a future <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt.</b> Greater engagement in SUD treatment was also associated with a reduction in suicide risk. Conclusions: More involvement in SUD treatment reduced the likelihood of a future <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> in high-risk patients. Substance use disorder treatment providers interested in reducing future suicidal behavior may want to concentrate their efforts on identifying at-risk individuals and actively engaging these patients in longer treatment episodes...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Urgent {{psychiatric}} {{help and}} effective psychotherapeutic treatments are required soon after revival {{of a person}} after <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> by self-poisoning. The aim {{of this article was}} to define an assessment of actual psychological characteristics of a person after <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> by self-poisoning in order to apply psychotherapeutic crisis intervention after <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt,</b> as well as to show an approach to the treatment guided by the assessment that uses a psychodynamic model of suicidal crisis intervention based on our clinical experience. Methods. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Center for Epidemiological Studies- Depression Scale (CES-D), Defensive Questionnaire Scale (DSQ- 40), Scaling of Life Events (Paykel), and Pierce Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) were applied in 30 hospitalized persons following <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> by self-poisoning and in 30 patients who had asked for psychiatric examination at the outpatient clinic due to various life crises not resulting in <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt.</b> The examinees of both groups were matched by sex, age, and education, professional and marital status. Comparison of the patient groups was done by the ttest. Logistic regression analysis was used for suicidal risk assessment. Results. The suicide attempters were depressed (HAMD = 22. 60 ± 5. 93, CES-D = 29. 67 ± 7. 99), with medium suicide risk factor (SIS = 4. 5 ± 4. 17), using immature (projection, dissociation, devaluation, acting-out) and neurotic (altruism) defense mechanisms. The most important motives for <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> were separation problems, problems with parents and a problem of loneliness. The commonest feelings and thoughts of a subject preceding <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> were a wish to escape an unbearable situation, loss of control, desire to show love for a partner and wish to be helped. After a <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt,</b> 90 % of the persons felt relief because the attempt failed, although almost half of them intend to repeat it. The risk of repeated <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> was 1. 8 (90 % CI = 0. 09 - 37. 70, p < 0. 001) times higher if values on the SIS Total Score were increased and 1. 62 (90 % CI = 0. 03 - 81. 39, p < 0. 001) times higher if values on the SIS 1 (Circumstances Score) subscale were increased, too. Conclusion. Before starting with psychotherapy for persons after <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> by self-poisoning {{it is very important to}} define psychological assessment of a person, choose the treatment (out-patient clinic or inpatient/ hospital), assess indications for pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy that also must include a selection of patients for application of this therapeutic method. Assessment of conscientious and unconscientious conflicts leading to a <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> represents initial basis for a therapist's work with a patient after <b>suicide</b> <b>attempt</b> and for application of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention...|$|R

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from ethylene glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
