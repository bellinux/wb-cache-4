The {{purpose of this}} thesis is {{to contribute to the}} development of the next generation slewing antennas for spacecraft, ground or sea <b>systems.</b> Current antenna <b>slewing</b> <b>systems</b> may also benefit from the results. More specifically this thesis provides a new testbed for implementing slew maneuvers in a laboratory environment. The antenna slew testbed was built with in-house manufactured parts, 3 -D printed parts and commercial-off-the-shelf equipment. The approach for designing this testbed involved CAD analysis and rapid prototyping, the application of dynamic scaling and similitude concepts, and implementation of hardware and software to support experimentation of novel maneuver concepts. To illustrate this, a maneuver based on optimal control theory is implemented. The applicability of this testbed casts a wide net because of its scale size as compared to existing or future systems. Moreover, the testbed is designed in a modular form to allow a variety of different antenna systems to be represented for testing slews. These include ground, space, and shipboard antenna systems.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in this thesis}} is to control the power consumption of a lattice boom offshore crane {{in order to reduce}} frequency variations and prevent blackouts. After studying how the electrically powered offshore lattice boom cranes works and are put together, a dynamic model of the power consumption for a crane was developed. By using the moment balance for the different systems on the crane (hoisting, luffing and slewing) the torque needed to drive the system at a given speed is calculated. A model of a diesel generator was also implemented. This model was found in an technical article, and implemented mainly by using parameters for a 440 kW diesel generator. Some of the parameters had to be found in other literature. These values are "typical values" for diesel generators, and may be the cause of that the modelled diesel generator has a relatively slow response. Two datasets were received from National Oilwell Varco Molde AS(NOV) which shows total load in kW and the corresponding RPM of the diesel generator from an actual crane. The load sequences from these datasets were extracted in order to have realistic load scenarios for simulations. The next step was to set up three different simulation scenarios in order to explore the advantages of feeding the measured load forward to the regulator of the RPM of the diesel generator. The first scenario was made by using the model of the crane with a sequence of different reference speeds for the speed controllers for the three systems on the crane. The two other scenarios are using the load sequences from the two datasets received from NOV. After running these three simulation scenarios both with and without the feed forward and studying how this influenced the RPM of the diesel generator, the conclusion was that it reduced the variations of the RPM. The small variations were almost completely removed, while large variations in the load still caused peaks in the RPM even though they were reduced. The large peaks still remained because of that the diesel generator has a limit to how fast it can increase its produced power. When the total load consumed by the crane has a large instant increase, the diesel generator does not manage to follow and in worst case, it blacks out. Therefore this had to be prevented by limiting the rate of change of the load, so that it does not increase faster than that the diesel generator manages to increase its produced power. In this project a MATLAB function is used to limit the requested load from the different speed controllers for the three systems on the crane. In addition to the rate of change, it also has to control that the total consumed load does not exceed the maximum load that the generator is able to produce. When sharing the power between the different systems, the hoisting system has a 100 % priority, while the luffing and the <b>slewing</b> <b>system</b> shares the remaining power available based on how many percent of their maximum power consumed they requests. The effect of this limitation is shown by running a simulation by using the first simulation scenario. The reason for choosing the load sequence that is generated by running the crane model is that the loads for the different systems are available separately, whereas in the datasets received from NOV only the combined total load is available. The conclusion is that the combination of the feed forward and the limitation of the requested load and the rate of change of the requested load, helps reduce the variations in the RPM of the diesel generator significantly. Thereby the variations in the frequency are reduced and an eventual power blackout is prevented...|$|E

A key advantage of the proposed method is that the commands are described by closed-form functions of the system parameters and the desired move distance. Performance measures such as maneuver speed, maximum transient deflection, and robustness to modeling errors indicate that the commands are attractive alternatives to time/fuel optimal commands that must be determined using a numerical optimization. Experimental results from a system driven by on–off air thrusters verify the proposed method. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} the results of numerical analyses that were carried out in order to evaluate how a change in a size of a clearance in a <b>slewing</b> motion drive <b>system</b> of a telescopic crane influences the movement of a load and the dynamic loads of a struc-ture. A computational model was developed based on a real structure of an experimental crane by using the ADAMS software. The analyses showed that a circumferential clearance at the output of a reduction gear, which is less than 1 º, does not adversely affect the precision of the load movement. An excessive clearance leads to losing fluidity of a body slewing motion and to changes in the trajecto-ry of the load...|$|R
40|$|Multi-body {{spacecraft}} {{attitude and}} configuration control formulations {{based on the}} use of collaborative control theory are considered. The control formulations are based on two-player, nonzero-sum, differential game theory applied using a Nash strategy. It is desired that the control laws allow different components of the multi-body system to perform different tasks. For example, it may be desired that one body points toward a fixed star while another body in the <b>system</b> <b>slews</b> to track another satellite. Although similar to the linear quadratic regulator formulation, the collaborative control formulation contains a number of additional design parameters because the problem is formulated as two control problems coupled together. The use of the freedom of the partitioning of the total problem into two coupled control problems and the selection of the elements of the cross-coupling matrices are specific problems addressed in this paper. Examples are used to show that significant improvement in performance, as measured by realistic criteria, of collaborative control over conventional linear quadratic regulator control can be achieved by using proposed design guidelines...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{realization}} of digital arithmetic using analog arrays {{in the form of}} Cellular Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks replace the fast switching nodes of logic gates with slewing nodes using current sources driving into capacitors; this provides both low current spikes and low voltage <b>slewing</b> rates, reducing <b>system</b> noise and cross-talk in lowvoltage mixed-signal applications. In this paper we generalize the design methodology using a Symbolic Substitution (SS) technique, and we use a recently developed Double-Base Number System (DBNS) to illustrate our design technique. This choice is predicated {{on the fact that the}} DBNS representation is naturally 2 -dimensional and excites more degrees of freedom in the design space. Spatial configurations of the recognition/replacement patterns used in SS are defined based on the properties of the DBNS arithmetic operation. The SS recognition phases are implemented by dynamic evaluation of simple conditions defined based on an analysis of the cell dynamic routes. The replacement phases are automatically executed through switching current sources which force the transition of cell state voltages between logic levels. In effect, we build self-timed logic arrays with all nodes in the system under controlled slew. Simulation results from schematic level designs are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique. Keywords...|$|R
5000|$|The FPS-16 system {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Project Mercury tracking network did not have adequate displays and controls for reliably acquiring the spacecraft in the acquisition time available. Consequently, a contract was negotiated with a manufacturer to provide the instrumentation radar acquisition (IRACQ)RAnge Acquisition modifications. For the near earth spacecraft involved a major limitation of the FPS-16 was its mechanical range gear box, a wonderful piece of engineering. However, for a target at a range typically, say, [...] at acquisition of signal AOS, the radar was tracking second time around, that is, the pulse received in this interpulse period was that due to the previously transmitted pulse, {{and it would be}} indicating a range of [...] As the range closed the return pulse became {{closer and closer to the}} time at which the next transmitter pulse should occur. If they were allowed to coincide, remembering that the transmit-receive switch disconnected the receive (Rx) and connected the transmit (Tx) to the antenna at that instant, track would be lost. So, IRACQ provided an electronic ranging system, the function of which was to provide the necessary gating pulses to the Az and El receiver channels so that the system would maintain angle track. The system utilized a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO as the clock generator for the range counters. An early/late gate system derived an error voltage which either increased a closing target or decreased an opening target the clock frequency, thus causing the gates to be generated so as to track the target. It also, when the target reached an indicated range of less than 16000 yd, took over the generation of transmitter trigger pulses and delayed these by 16000 yd, thus enabling the received pulses to pass through the Big Bang, as it was called, of normally timed Tx pulses. The radar operator, would, while IRACQ maintained angle track be <b>slewing</b> the range <b>system</b> from minimum range to maximum so as to regain track of the target at its true range of <500 nmi (900 km). As the target passed through point of closest approach (PCA) and increased in range the process was repeated at maximum range indication. The most difficult passes were those in which the orbit was such that the target came to PCA at a range of, say 470 nmi. That pass required the radar operator to work very hard as the radar closed, and then opened in range through the Big Bang in short order. The IRACQ Console contained a C-scope associated with which was a small joy stick which gave C-scope operator control of the antenna angle servo systems so that he could adjust the pointing angle to acquire the signal. IRACQ included a scan generator which drove the antenna in one of several pre-determined search patterns around the nominal pointing position, it being desirable that IRACQ acquire the target as early as possible. An essential feature of this modification is that it allows examination of all incoming video signals and allows establishment of angle-only track. Once the spacecraft has been acquired, in angle range. Other features of the IRACQ system included additional angle scan modes and radar phasing controls to permit multiple radar interrogation of the spacecraft beacon. The addition of a beacon local oscillator wave meter permitted the determination of spacecraft-transmitter frequency drift.|$|R
