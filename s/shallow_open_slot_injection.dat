40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{from animal}} manure contributes to {{air pollution and}} ecosystem degradation, {{and the loss of}} reactive nitrogen (N) from agricultural systems. Estimates of NH 3 emission are necessary for national inventories and nutrient management, and NH 3 emission from field-applied manure has been measured in many studies over the past few decades. In this work, we facilitate the use of these data by collecting and organizing them in the ALFAM 2 database. In this paper we describe the development of the database and summarise its contents, quantify effects of application methods and other variables on emission using a data subset, and discuss challenges for data analysis and model development. The database contains measurements of emission, manure and soil properties, weather, application technique, and other variables for 1895 plots from 22 research institutes in 12 countries. Data on five manure types (cattle, pig, mink, poultry, mixed, as well as sludge and "other") applied to three types of crops (grass, small grains, maize, as well as stubble and bare soil) are included. Application methods represented in the database include broadcast, trailing hose, trailing shoe (narrow band application), and <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> <b>injection.</b> Cattle manure application to grassland was the most common combination, and analysis of this subset (with dry matter (DM) limited to < 15 %) was carried out using mixed- and fixed-effects models in order to quantify effects of management and environment on ammonia emission, and to highlight challenges for use of the database. Measured emission in this subset ranged from < 1 % to 130 % of applied ammonia after 48 h. Results showed clear, albeit variable, reductions in NH 3 emission due to trailing hose, trailing shoe, and <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> of slurry compared to broadcast application. There was evidence of positive effects of air temperature and wind speed on NH 3 emission, and limited evidence of effects of slurry DM. However, random-effects coefficients for differences among research institutes were among the largest model coefficients, and showed a deviation from the mean response by more than 100 % in some cases. The source of these institute differences could not be determined with certainty, but {{there is some evidence that}} they are related to differences in soils, or differences in application or measurement methods. The ALFAM 2 database should be useful for development and evaluation of both emission factors and emission models, but users need to recognize the limitations caused by confounding variables, imbalance in the dataset, and dependence among observations from the same institute. Variation among measurements and in reported variables highlights the importance of international agreement on how NH 3 emission should be measured, along with necessary types of supporting data and standard protocols for their measurement. Both are needed in order to produce more accurate and useful ammonia emission measurements. Expansion of the ALFAM 2 database will continue, and readers are invited to contact the corresponding author for information on data submission. The latest version of the database is available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The paper investigates {{analytically}} {{the effect}} of multiple <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> on skin friction for a representative fuselage shape (ogive-cylinder body) and evaluates the potential of <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> as a drag reduction system in subsonic flow. Typical CTOL cruise flight conditions (Mach number equals 0. 82 at altitudes of 11 km) were adopted for a fuselage 67. 06 m in length and with maximum diameter of 7. 32 m. The numerical method of Price and Harris (1972) was {{used to calculate the}} boundary-layer characteristics up to the first slot, while the finite-difference method of Beckwith and Bushnell (1971) was used to calculate the velocity profile downstream of one, three, five, or ten slots. An integral expression is proposed for characterizing skin friction reduction effectiveness, and it is seen that large reductions in viscous drag (50 %) are available through <b>slot</b> <b>injection.</b> Skin friction reduction is improved by increasing the number of <b>injection</b> <b>slots</b> but at a diminishing rate...|$|R

Effects of slot height, multiple <b>slot</b> <b>injection,</b> and injection {{mass flow rate}} on the surface skin friction downstream of the the slot have been investigated. Surface skin friction was {{a function of the}} injection mass flow rate for x/s 40. Large normal pressure gradient and relatively large turbulent intensity were found near the <b>slot</b> with small <b>injection</b> mass flow rate; the region the high turbulent intensity moved downstream with increasing injection mass flow rate. The results with two <b>slot</b> <b>injections</b> indicated that the distance between slots should be less than 30 slot heights in order to achieve some benefits from the first slot. Of significant importance in the present investigation is that the skin friction reduction obtained at transonic speed is of the same order as obtained in the hypersonic regime. Additional work is required in order to formulate a correlation between the turbulent intensity and the injection mass flow rate that may be used in future analysis...|$|R
40|$|Steady {{two-dimensional}} and axisymmetric compressible nonsimilar laminar boundary-layer flows with non-uniform <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> (or suction) and non-uniform wall enthalpy {{have been}} studied from {{the starting point of}} the streamwise co-ordinate to the exact point of separation. The effect of different free stream Mach number has also been considered. The finite discontinuities arising at the leading and trailing edges of the slot for the uniform <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> (suction) or wall enthalpy are removed by choosing appropriate non-uniform <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> (suction) or wall enthalpy. The difficulties arising at the starting point of the streamwise co-ordinate, {{at the edges of the}} slot and at the point of separation are overcome by applying the method of quasilinear implicit finite difference scheme with an appropriate selection of finer step size along the streamwise direction. It is observed that the non-uniform <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> moves the point of separation downstream but the non-uniform slot suction has the reverse effect. The increase of Mach number shifts the point of separation upstream due to the adverse pressure gradient. The increase of total enthalpy at the wall causes the separation to occur earlier while cooling delays it. The non-uniform total enthalpy at the wall (i. e., the cooling or heating of the wall in a slot) along the streamwise co-ordinate has very little effect on the skin friction and thus on the point of separation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain better performance, gas {{turbines}} always operate with high inlet temperature. This contributes to {{a high level of}} thermal load on the first stage vane endwall. To ensure safe operation of a gas turbine within a proper temperature range, the cooling performance of the vane endwall must be further investigated. In the present study, effects of the mainstream turbulence and upstream coolant flow direction on the endwall cooling and vane suction side surface phantom cooling were numerically investigated. Three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations combined with shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model were solved to conduct the numerical simulations on basis of the validated turbulence model. The calculated results indicate that both the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall and the phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane suction side surface are significantly influenced by <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> angle. For α=- 30 °, the coolant injection is driven towards the vane suction side, which contributes to the lowest adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall and the highest phantom cooling effectiveness level on the vane suction side surface. With the increase of the <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> angle, the adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall is enhanced significantly. In contrast, the phantom cooling (when the vane suction side is cooled by coolant originating from the endwall) of the vane suction side surface is reduced significantly. This is because a large <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> angle leads to a large coolant momentum towards the pressure side. Moreover, the case with a smaller <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> angle obtains a slightly higher area-averaged adiabatic cooling effectiveness level around the leading edge due to a relatively larger portion of coolant being confined near the leading edge. In addition, the inlet turbulence intensity has a small impact on the overall endwall cooling and the phantom cooling of the vane suction side surface compared to the <b>slot</b> <b>injection</b> angle...|$|R

40|$|Manure {{application}} to grassland and arable land {{is an important}} source of ammonia and nitrous oxide losses. For both gasses, national and international policies have been developed with the objective of reducing the emissions. Since the early 1990 s, measurements have been carried out in The Netherlands to assess the gaseous losses from manure application, especially for ammonia. Measurements of nitrous oxide emissions are relatively scarce. This paper presents the results of these measurements with the objective of providing an updated quantification of the effect of techniques for application and incorporation of manure, and to assess influencing factors. The manure application techniques differ in their spreading or placement of the manure onto the grass or soil surface or into the soil. The following techniques are treated in this paper: surface spreading, narrow-band application, <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> with <b>open</b> <b>slots</b> on grassland, and surface spreading, surface incorporation, deep placement on arable land. Low emission techniques such as narrow band application, shallow injection, incorporation or injection on arable land show a significant reduction of ammonia emission compared to surface spreading. On grassland, average emission factors (% of total ammonium nitrogen) were 74 % for surface spreading and 16 % for shallow injection. On arable land, the emission factors were 69 % for surface spreading and 2 % for deep placement. However, the nitrous oxide emission factor from manure applied with low ammonia emissions techniques is higher than the emission factor for surface applied manures. In a whole farm context, the higher nitrous oxide emission with shallow injection is partly offset directly by reduced emissions from fertiliser savings and indirectly from lower ammonia losses...|$|R

While the fuel did not ignite within the domain of the simulation, film-cooling induced drag reductions show that porthole injection can provide comparable performance when injectors are spaced sufficiently close.
