When canal shaping is not undertaken the term passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) {{can be used to}} describe the technique. In this paper the relevant literature on PUI is reviewed from a MEDLINE database search. Passive ultrasonic irrigation can be performed with a small file or <b>smooth</b> <b>wire</b> (size 10 – 20) oscillating freely in the root canal to induce powerful acoustic microstreaming. PUI can be an important supplement for cleaning the root canal system and, compared with traditional syringe irrigation, it removes more organic tissue, planktonic bacteria and dentine debris from the root canal. PUI is more efficient in cleaning canals than ultrasonic irrigation with simultaneous ultrasonic instrumentation. PUI can be effective in curved canals and a <b>smooth</b> <b>wire</b> can be as effective as a cutting K-file. The taper and the diameter {{of the root}} canal were found to be important parameters in determining the efficacies of dentine debris removal. Irrigation with sodium hypochlorite is more effective than with water and ultrasonic irrigation is more effective than sonic irrigation in the removal of dentine debris from the root canal. The role of cavitation during PUI remains inconclusive. No detailed information is available on the influence of the irrigation time, the volume of the irrigant, the penetration depth of the instrument and the shape and material properties of the instrument. The influence of irrigation frequency and intensity on the streaming pattern as well as the complicated interaction of acoustic streaming with the adherent biofilm needs to be clarified to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms of PUI...|$|E

40|$|The {{currently}} dominant {{method in}} the production of wafers is to use slurry wire-saw slicing. This paper reports a new wire-saw slicing technology, namely, semifixed abrasive wire-saw slicing. The traditional <b>smooth</b> <b>wire</b> is replaced by a patterned wire with a textured surface that can help the wire carrying the abrasives. It aims to improve the number of transient fixed abrasives in the machining process. Transient fixed abrasives can produce “scratch-indenting” processes that are similar to fixed-abrasive wire slicing thereby improving the efficiency of the wire-saw cutting. This study focuses on the behavioral mechanics of the abrasive grits in the slurry during the slicing process. The dynamic images of the movement of abrasive grits in the slicing process are obtained by a high-speed camera. At the microlevel, using statistical methods, the behavioral mechanics of the abrasive grits are investigated by changing the slicing parameters.

30|$|If {{the wire}} path that bends {{at the center}} of the pitch axis can be constructed, the path length of the 2 nd-axis and 3 rd-axis wires {{accompanying}} the pitch axis motion does not change. However, considering the durability of the wire and <b>smooth</b> <b>wire</b> operation, the bending wire path at the center is not adopted because it is necessary to maintain the radius. On the other hand, in the proposed wrist mechanism, arc-shaped guides are located on the upper and lower portions of the plane, including the pitch axis and the central axis of the supporting part. The arc-shaped guide provides sufficient bending radius of the wire and minimizes the change in the path length of the 2 nd-axis and 3 rd-axis wires arising from pitch axis motion. Compared with the case of using pulleys, there is concern about friction between the wire and circular arc-shaped surface, but the bending radius of the wire can be greatly increased and the number of parts can be greatly reduced.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of file type and {{activation}} time on the uncontrolled removal of dentin during in vitro ultrasonic irrigant activation in prepared curved root canals. Methods: Seventy-two curved mesial root canals of human mandibular molars were prepared to size 35 /. 04 taper. The specimens were randomly allocated to 4 groups (n = 18). Two milliliters of 2 % sodium hypochlorite were delivered 3 times to each root canal, and the irrigant was ultrasonically activated every time for 10 seconds at 35 % power either by a ultrasonic K-file (group A), an Irrisafe file (Acteon Satelec, Merignac, France) (group B), or a <b>smooth</b> <b>wire</b> (group C). The same specimens also received further activation continuously for another 30 seconds. No activation took place in group D. Specimens were scanned by micro–computed tomographic imaging before and after preparation and after the first and second activation period. Scans were coregistered and segmented, and the amount of dentin removed during activation was quantified by morphological operations. Results were analyzed by nonparametric statistical tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Defects with a maximum depth of 0. 18 mm were identified. Both the type of file and activation time affected the removal of dentin (P ≤. 002 and P ≤. 031, respectively). K-files removed more dentin than Irrisafe files and smooth wires in the coronal and middle third. All files removed comparable amounts in the apical third. Conclusions: All 3 types of files may result in uncontrolled removal of dentin. A longer activation time may increase this effect...|$|E

The successful operation of a liquid xenon proportional counter was recently reported. The liquid xenon camera promises better spatial resolution and higher counting rate than the existing NaI(Tl) scintillation camera.

In addition, the high counting rate capability makes possible dynamic studies which were previously unfeasible.
