5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed {{to find a place}} for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common <b>Sense,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E
25|$|In a nutshell, basic {{research}} is the search for knowledge and applied {{research is the}} search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even {{basic research}} can take unexpected turns, {{and there is some}} <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the scientific method is built to harness luck.|$|E

25|$|There is a <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{this kind}} of {{additivity}} expresses a fundamental postulate {{that goes beyond the}} simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author {{goes so far as to}} say that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E

25|$|The {{convention}} used to be, and in American English still is, to put full stops (periods) and commas {{inside the}} quotation marks, {{irrespective of the}} sense. British English has moved away from this style while American English has kept it. British style now prefers to punctuate according to the <b>sense,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> punctuation marks only appear inside quotation marks if they were there in the original. Formal British English practice requires a full stop to be put inside the quotation marks if the quoted item is a full sentence that ends where the main sentence ends, but {{it is common to}} see the stop outside the ending quotation marks.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a lama. A student may have taken teachings from many {{authorities}} and revere them all as lamas in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru. Often the teacher the student sees as root guru is simply the one who first introduced him to Buddhism, but a student may also change his personal view of which particular teacher is his root guru any number of times.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{offers a}} general {{account of the}} idea of {{impartiality}} and examines the <b>senses</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> adjudication is and is not impartial. Against those who would derive an account of impartiality from more general moral or political theories, the essay shows that ordinary thought embodies a coherent and reasonably rich conception of impartiality, some of the principal features of <b>which</b> are also <b>in</b> play in adjudication. Against those who claim that impartiality in adjudication is impossible or illusory, it is argued that there are some meaningful <b>senses</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> adjudication is indeed impartial. The essay concludes that in the adjudicative context impartiality might even be considered a virtue, albeit a limited one...|$|R
25|$|It was {{traditionally}} thought (especially by the Aristotelians) {{that the}} air did not have lateral weight: that is, that the kilometers of air above the surface did not exert any weight on the bodies below it. Even Galileo had accepted the weightlessness of air as a simple truth. Torricelli questioned that assumption, and instead proposed that air had weight {{and that it was}} the latter (not the attracting force of the vacuum) which held (or rather, pushed) up the column of water. He thought that the level the water stayed at (c. 10.3m) was reflective of the force of the air's weight pushing on it (specifically, pushing on the water in the basin and thus limiting how much water can fall from the tube into it). In other words, he viewed the barometer as a balance, an instrument for measurement (as opposed to merely being an instrument to create a vacuum), and because {{he was the first to}} view it this way, he is traditionally considered the inventor of the barometer (in the <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> we now use the term).|$|E
25|$|Example 6. Periodic {{sequence}} with {{period a}} power of two. This is a proper subalgebra of Example 5 (a proper subalgebra equals the intersection of itself with its algebra). These {{can be understood as}} the finitary operations, with the first period of such a sequence giving the truth table of the operation it represents. For example, the truth table of x0 in the table of binary operations, namely 2f10, has period 2 (and so can be recognized as using only the first variable) even though 12 of the binary operations have period 4. When the period is 2n the operation only depends on the first n variables, the <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the operation is finitary. This example is also a countably infinite atomless Boolean algebra. Hence Example 5 is isomorphic to a proper subalgebra of itself! Example 6, and hence Example 5, constitutes the free Boolean algebra on countably many generators, meaning the Boolean algebra of all finitary operations on a countably infinite set of generators or variables.|$|E

5000|$|After {{numerous}} {{attempts to find}} more characteristics of performatives, and after having met with many difficulties, Austin makes {{what he calls a}} [...] "fresh start", <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he considers [...] "more generally the <b>senses</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> to say something may be to do something, or in saying something we do something".|$|R
5000|$|In mathematics, {{there are}} many <b>senses</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a {{sequence}} or a series {{is said to be}} convergent.

500|$|There is a <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> some {{multiples}} of 2 are [...] "more even" [...] than others. Multiples of 4 {{are called}} doubly even, since {{they can be}} divided by 2 twice. Not only is zero divisible by 4, zero has the unique property of being divisible by every power of 2, so it surpasses all other numbers in [...] "evenness".|$|E
500|$|While many, if not all, {{agree that}} {{there is at least}} some <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the book can be said to be a [...] "dream", few agree on who the {{possible}} dreamer of such a dream might be. Edmund Wilson's early analysis of the book, The Dream of H. C. Earwicker, made the assumption that Earwicker himself is the dreamer of the dream, an assumption which continued to carry weight with Wakean scholars Harry Levin, Hugh Kenner, and William Troy. Joseph Campbell, in A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake, also believed Earwicker to be the dreamer, but considered the narrative to be the observances of, and a running commentary by, an anonymous pedant on Earwicker's dream in progress, who would interrupt the flow with his own digressions.|$|E
500|$|This {{resolution}} {{had been}} the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions. Particularly at issue was the <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the states were parties to the federal compact. The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that when the Virginians claimed that the [...] "states" [...] were parties to the federal Constitution, the referent of the word [...] "state" [...] was the sovereign people of the particular state. [...] Thus, to say that [...] "the state of Virginia ratified the Constitution" [...] was {{to say that the}} sovereign people of Virginia ratified the Constitution. The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40. At some point in the next two weeks, it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6.|$|E
30|$|Next, {{we review}} briefly the many <b>senses</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> “career” is used, {{and suggest that}} a new {{approach}} to career studies, Social Chronology Theorizing, captures this complexity and provides a useful approach to framing career success as a more contextualized concept. We conclude by considering some of the theoretical and methodological implications of this approach.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{at least}} two <b>senses</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the term {{philosophy}} is used: a formal and an informal <b>sense.</b> <b>In</b> the formal <b>sense,</b> philosophy is an academic study of the fields of aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, as well as social and political philosophy.

500|$|Yet, unlike Coleridge, {{and despite}} his own reservations, Hazlitt found much to admire in Measure for Measure, a [...] "play as full of genius as it is of wisdom." [...] He quotes at length {{passages}} of [...] "dramatic beauty", and also finds occasion to use this play as an example supporting his characterisation of the general nature of Shakespeare's genius, and the relation between morality and poetry. [...] "Shakespear was in one sense the least moral of all writers; for morality (commonly so called) {{is made up of}} antipathies [...] ". Yet [...] "in another [...] he was the greatest of all moralists. He was a moralist in the same <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> nature is one. He taught what he had learnt from her. He shewed the greatest knowledge of humanity with the greatest fellow-feeling for it." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, the <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> our wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the play}} and his {{newspaper}} work helped expose him to a wider audience, the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit. He made both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry, and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds whenever he performed. In an 1894 article, Hamlin Garland wrote that Riley's celebrity resulted from his reading talent, saying [...] "his vibrant individual voice, his flexible lips, his droll glance, united to make him at once poet and comedian—comedian in the <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> makes for tears {{as well as for}} laughter." [...] Although he was a good performer, his acts were not entirely original in style; he frequently copied practices developed by Samuel Clemens and Will Carleton. His tour in 1880 took him to every city in Indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures, including Maurice Thompson with whom he began to develop a close friendship.|$|E
