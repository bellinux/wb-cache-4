He {{was born at}} Châteauroux (Indre) and studied music at the Paris Conservatory under Alard (violin) and Reber (harmony). In 1855 he became conductor at the Théâtre Beaumarchais, and afterward leader at Musard's concerts, <b>subconductor</b> at the Folies-Nouvelles, and from 1860 to 1863 he was first violin at the Opéra-Comique. He was in turn feuilletoniste to Le Soir, La Tribune, L'Événement and Le Journal Officiel, besides being {{a frequent contributor to}} all the important French musical periodicals. His work in connection with Fétis's Biographie universelle, for which he prepared a supplement (two volumes, 1878-80), has, however, been found to be lacking in thoroughness.

40|$|The {{calculation}} of frequency-dependent cable parameters {{is essential for}} simulations of transient phenomena in electrical power systems. The simulation of transients {{is more complicated than}} the {{calculation of}} currents and voltages in the nominal frequency range. The model has to represent the frequency dependency and the wave propagation behavior of cable lines. The introduced model combines an improved <b>subconductor</b> method for the determination of the frequency-dependent parameters and a PI section wave propagation model. The <b>subconductor</b> method considers the skin and proximity effect in all conductors for frequency ranges up to few megahertz. The <b>subconductor</b> method method yields accurate results. The wave propagation part of the cable model is based on a cascaded PI section model. A modal transformation technique has been used for the calculation in the time domain. The frequency-dependent elements of the related modal transformation matrices have been fitted with rational functions. The frequency dependence of cable parameters has been reproduced using a vector fitting algorithm and has been implemented into an resistor-inductor-capacitor network (RLC network) for each PI section. The proposed full model has been validated with measured data...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{some aspects}} of modeling the wake-induced vibrations of the bundle conductors in transmission lines. The wake coupling between subconductors is modeled with the modified Simpson’s approach. In order to apply this model {{to the analysis of}} power transmission line (PTL), a modal representation of a span could be used. In present paper we study how application of Dynamic Reduction (Component Mode) technique may improve such analysis under finite-element approach. The present paper, to extent of authors’ knowledge, is the first where Component Mode method application is discussed to study the subspan oscillation. Finally, bundled conductors’ susceptibility to wake-induced vibrations is illustrated on an exemplary twin-bundle, three-subspan model. Effects of bundle parameters (initial <b>subconductor</b> spacing, frequency ratio, <b>subconductor</b> mass), and the means to account them when applying the component mode method are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{three-phase}} power lines operated by parallel power cables. In these systems each phase {{is made up}} of several parallel <b>subconductors</b> and {{it is well known that}} the sequence of the <b>subconductors</b> influences the magnetic field generated by the power line. This paper proposes a new approach to identify the optimal arrangement of the power cables that minimizes the stray magnetic field. Unlike the design methods covered by the literature, this paper proposes a deterministic procedure that is based mainly on a simple geometrical indicator. This geometrical quantity makes it possible to analyze all the configurations in order to create a small subset of candidate solutions. From this subset the optimal solution is then identified quickly and easily by computing and comparing the stray field. A full validation of the proposed approach is performed by comparing it with a standard method based on genetic algorithm. The results of the validation also provide a useful table that covers all the cases from 2 to 6 <b>subconductors</b> for each phase. Furthermore, it is shown that the geometrical indicator makes it possible to obtain a good cable arrangement in a direct way, without performing any magnetic field evaluation...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} short-circuit oscillations {{in power}} lines. Short-circuit currents generate electromagnetic {{forces on the}} conductors, exciting short-circuit oscillations. Since the short-circuit periods are very short, the short-circuit forces in single conductor overhead lines are usually low {{because of the large}} phase spacing. However these forces may have considerable impact on distribution lines due to the change in phase spacing during short-circuit occurrences. For bundle conductor lines, the short-circuit forces between <b>subconductors</b> are significantly higher due to the small distance between them. Methods for estimating the compressive forces on bundle conductor spacers or spacer dampers are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of bundled conductors following ice shedding from one <b>subconductor</b> is examined numerically using the finite-element method. An existing model of ice shedding {{from a single}} conductor is improved by developing a model of spacers which connect subconductors in the span. The resulting system {{makes it possible to}} simulate vibrations following ice shedding from one span of an overhead transmission line with twin, triple, or quad bundles. Vibration characteristics are evaluated as the following parameters are varied: thickness of shed ice, distance between adjacent spacers, and number of subconductors in the bundle. Simulation results will provide information on how the amplitude of vibration and the transient dynamic forces change with the application of spacers. The maximum jump height of the ice-shedding cable, the maximum drop of the loaded cable, and the maximum cable tension are approximated as power functions of ice thickness and the distance between adjacent spacers...|$|E
40|$|Ice {{accretion}} on cables of overhead {{transmission lines}} {{is a serious}} and frequently arising problem in cold regions. The accreted ice leads to heavy static load, while ice-shedding may result in high-amplitude vibrations which are usually associated with excessive transient dynamic forces. A widely used method to attenuate the vibration due to wind or ice-shedding, and reduce the resulting transient dynamic forces is the application of spacers between two, three or four conductors. The dynamic behavior of systems of two, three and four conductors with spacers following ice-shedding from one <b>subconductor</b> is examined in the present study. Modal analysis is carried out, which calculates the first few natural frequencies and provides the damping performance of the system. Results are compared with those obtained for a single cable and for a system of two cables with a cross-tie which is often applied in cable-stayed bridges. A numerical model is also constructed using the finite element method. Simulations with the constructed model show how the resistance of cable systems against vibrations following ice-shedding increases with the application of spacers...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} carried out to obtain the static {{aerodynamic}} characteristics of crescent iced 4 -bundled conductors with different ice thicknesses, initial ice accretion angles, bundle spaces, and wind attack angles. The test models were made of the actual conductors and have a real rough surface. Test {{results show that the}} influence of wake interference on the drag coefficients of leeward subconductors is obvious. The interference angle range is larger than 20 ° and the drag coefficient curves of leeward subconductors have a sudden decrease phenomenon at some certain wind attack angles. The absolute value of the lift and moment coefficient increases with the increase of the ice thickness. In addition, the galloping of the iced <b>subconductor</b> may occur at the angle of wind attack near ± 20 ° and the wake increases the moment coefficient. The variation of initial ice accretion angle has a significant influence on the aerodynamic coefficients. The aerodynamic coefficient curves exhibit a “moving” phenomenon at different initial ice accretion angles. The bundle spaces have a great influence on the moment coefficient of leeward thin ice-coated conductors. With the increase of ice thickness, the bundle spaces generally have little influence on the aerodynamic coefficients...|$|E

40|$|Effects of ice-shedding-induced cable {{vibration}} on spacer dampers are {{studied by}} applying a dynamic model. The model {{is based on}} the authors' recent development, which is improved here by applying spacer properties obtained experimentally. The model simulates cable vibration and bundle rotation at mid-span, where the spacer is attached to the cables, as well as the spacer deformation and forces acting on the spacer during the vibration of twin, triple and quad conductor bundles. Ice accumulation on a spacer may change the latter's elastic and damping properties, whose influence on the vibration is considered in the model together with the effect of varying cable properties. Simulation results show how the risk of bundle collapse and the load on the spacer is reduced when the number of <b>subconductors</b> in the bundle is increased. The model also predicts that the most important property which can reduce forces acting on the spacer during vibration is spacer damping, whereas the bundle rotation is affected to the greatest extent by cable damping...|$|R
40|$|Permanent magnet {{generators}} (PMG) {{represent the}} cutting edge technology in modern wind mills. The efficiency remains high (over 90 %) at partial loads. To improve the machine efficiency even further, every aspect of machine losses has to be analyzed. Additional losses are often given as a certain percentage without providing any detailed information about the actual calculation process; meanwhile, there are many design-dependent losses that {{have an effect on}} the total amount of additional losses and that have to be taken into consideration. Additional losses are most often eddy current losses in different parts of the machine. These losses are usually difficult to calculate in the design process. In this doctoral thesis, some additional losses are identified and modeled. Further, suggestions on how to minimize the losses are given. Iron losses can differ significantly between the measured no-load values and the loss values under load. In addition, with embedded magnet rotors, the quadrature-axis armature reaction adds losses to the stator iron by manipulating the harmonic content of the flux. It was, therefore, re-evaluated that in salient pole machines, to minimize the losses and the loss difference between the no-load and load operation, the flux density has to be kept below 1. 5 T in the stator yoke, which is the traditional guideline for machine designers. Eddy current losses may occur in the end-winding area and in the support structure of the machine, that is, in the finger plate and the clamping ring. With construction steel, these losses account for 0. 08 % of the input power of the machine. These losses can be reduced almost to zero by using nonmagnetic stainless steel. In addition, the machine housing may be subjected to eddy current losses if the flux density exceeds 1. 5 T in the stator yoke. Winding losses can rise rapidly when high frequencies and 10 – 15 mm high conductors are used. In general, minimizing the winding losses is simple. For example, it can be done by dividing the conductor into transposed <b>subconductors.</b> However, this comes with the expense of an increase in the DC resistance. In the doctoral thesis, a new method is presented to minimize the winding losses by applying a litz wire with noninsulated strands. The construction is the same as in a normal litz wire but the insulation between the <b>subconductors</b> has been left out. The idea is that the connection is kept weak to prevent harmful eddy currents from flowing. Moreover, the analytical solution for calculating the AC resistance factor of the litz-wire is supplemented by including an end-winding resistance in the analytical solution. A simple measurement device is developed to measure the AC resistance in the windings. In the case of a litz-wire with originally noninsulated strands, vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) is used to insulate the <b>subconductors.</b> In one of the two cases studied, the VPI affected the AC resistance factor, but in the other case, it did not have any effect. However, more research is needed to determine the effect of the VPI on litz-wire with noninsulated strands. An empirical model is developed to calculate the AC resistance factor of a single-layer formwound winding. The model includes the end-winding length and the number of strands and turns. The end winding includes the circulating current (eddy currents that are traveling through the whole winding between parallel strands) and the main current. The end-winding length also affects the total AC resistance factor...|$|R
40|$|Uncorrected OCR) Abstract of thesis {{entitled}} liField {{analysis in}} power supply lines by integraJ. equation methodll subm 1 tted by FOe, PIK YlJE for {{the degree of}} Ph. D at the University of Hong Kong in December, 1974. Abstract In this thesis, the integral equation (I. E.) method has been employed successfully to solve field problems in power supply lines. Though the I. E. method is mathematically quite involved, it is shown {{that it is possible}} to treat the integral equation as a system of linear equations. Hence the transformed simultaneous linear equations can be considered as the starting point for solving problems either in overhead lines or power cables. In overhead lines, especially in Extra-High-Voltage and Ultra- High-Voltage systems, an evaluation of the electric field near each conductor, especially the maximum electric field, is essential as corona and radio interference become important considerations in the design of such lines. The I. E. method has many advantages over the other existing methods in calculating the potential gradient at the surface of the overhead lines in that it yieldS reasonably accurate results with comparatively simple numerical computations. The difference between the present method and the existing methods is the basic assumption. In the I. E. method, <b>subconductor</b> surfaces are treated as equipotential lines whereas in other existing methods, the <b>subconductor</b> surfaces usually do not coincide with the simulated equipotential lines. The method can also be applied equally well to symmetrical or asymmetrical bundle conductors with or without ground wires. Other parameters such as capacitances, potential gradients at the earth surface etc. are also included in the computer program. In underground cable systems, the I. E. method proves to be very effective in tackling the thermal field problem, especially when the cables are buried shallow and thus the earth i s surface can no longer be treated as isothermal.. It has been found that the thermal resistance (external) obtained wi::;h a non-isothermal earth surface is considerably higher than that obtained under the assuumption of an isothermal earth surface. With non. -isothermal earth surface, the temperature difference on the earth surface between the spot vertically above the cable and the spot at a distance eClual to twice the depth of burial of the cable away could be as high as lOoe. The finite-difference or fini te-搪lement method could likewise be used to solve the problem of a non-isothermal ea>:>th surface, but the computer storage re'luired and the execution time would be much more than that using the I.

40|$|Wake-induced {{oscillations}} (WIO) in {{transmission line}} bundle conductors are simulated using finite-element nonlinear formulation. This allows obtaining the conductor oscillations {{in the line}} spans equipped either with spacers or with spacer dampers. Within this approach, the interaction of <b>subconductors</b> due to the wake is represented using Simpson’s aeroelastic model. A special force element is created to introduce the aerodynamic loads due to the wake. The aeroelastic properties of the wake force field are tuned to meet the wake-induced instability properties as measured by Price. Extension of the wake interaction sample onto the full line span is done {{taking into account the}} inertia-stiffness properties of the line fittings (spacer dampers). It is emphasized that in WIO the ability of spacer (spacer damper) to transfer the loads and motions plays essential role. Thus, the transfer matrix logic to simulate the spacer, established by Diana, Rawlins and other researchers, is now transferred into the finite element model of WIO. Some important structural specifics of transmission line fittings are thus highlighted by the performed simulations. All these developments are introduced into the FE package SAMCEF Mecano. Results of a series of calculations are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the established model. Comparison of FEM simulations to the benchmarking field test data is presented.

40|$|Wind excited {{vibrations}} {{generated by}} the vortex shedding are very common in high-voltage overhead transmission lines. Although such vibrations are barely perceptible due to their low amplitudes (less than a conductor diameter), controlling them, however, is extremely important since they may lead to conductor fatigue. Mathematical models are therefore necessary for the computation of these vibrations, not only to evaluate the risk of potential damage to the transmission line but also for studying {{the efficiency of the}} damping measures. For single conductor transmission lines, the so-called energy-balance method gives fairly good results for the estimation of vibration amplitudes. However, the problem becomes more involved for the conductor bundles attached with different damping devices. A modified form of the energy-balance method is thus needed. This thesis presents a mathematical-mechanical model for modeling the vibrations of the conductor bundles with many spacer dampers and Stockbridge dampers, by considering <b>subconductors</b> as continuous systems. External damping devices are incorporated into the model by means of their complex impedance matrices. The presented model results in a smaller system matrix in comparison to what is obtained while modeling the conductor as a discrete system. This modeling procedure yields a complex non-polynomial transcendental eigen- value problem (TEVP). Solving such a TEVP is simple for smaller systems, e. g., for single conductor transmission lines. However, for a comparatively bigger system like the one in case of conductor bundles, it is a formidable task to obtain all the system eigenvalues in a certain frequency domain. The first goal of the presented thesis is to find e±cient numerical methods for obtaining the solutions of TEVPs. Different numerical techniques are discussed and their results are compared. Newton's approach for the solution of the eigenvalue problem is found to be an e±cient solution technique for obtaining the complex eigenvalues of a TEVP of the current type. After obtaining the complex eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the system, an energy balance principle is presented in order to obtain the actual vibration amplitudes in the <b>subconductors.</b> In energy balance the energy input from the wind is equated with the energy loss due to external damping and the conductor's self damping. Wind power input is normally obtained using data from the wind tunnel experiments or from the experiments carried out with transmission lines in the field, for laminar and turbulent wind speeds. Wind power input data is only available for single oscillating rods/cylinders, as obtaining such data via experiments for different configurations of multi-cylinders, is a difficult task. The second goal of the presented work is to numerically obtain the wind power input for the oscillating cylinders in a tandem arrangement. A finite-volume approach is used for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moving grids are used to incorporate the movements of the cylinders. Firstly, accuracy and feasibility of the numerical results are verified by solving the flow around a single cylinder, and comparing the obtained results with the available experimental data. For similar setups as used in the experiments from different researchers, numerical wind power input for a single oscillating cylinder is obtained. Good agreement with the experimental results is found. The numerical approach is subsequently further extended to obtain the wind power input for two oscillating cylinders in a tandem arrangement. A considerable difference between the wind power inputs for the downstream cylinder in a cylinder-tandem and for a single oscillating cylinder is observed. The newly obtained wind power input is utilized for the energy balancing in a bundled conductor benchmark problem, and results are discussed...|$|R
