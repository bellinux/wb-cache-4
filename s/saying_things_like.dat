[...] He {{spoke out against}} Obama, <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "Obama would make the world suffer." [...] His anti-racist sister Kayla, who is two years younger than Paul, often argued with him about his racial beliefs. A few days before his arrest, a neighbor said he heard semiautomatic gunfire coming from an open field behind Schlesselman's house. After his arrest, Schlesselman's family expressed doubt that he seriously intended {{to carry out the}} plot; his father, Mike, said, [...] "I think it's just a lot of talk. He would never do something like this." [...] Kayla said she spoke with her brother after the charges were made public, and that Paul [...] "said he's sorry about everything he's done." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Pink Floyd {{returned}} to Abbey Road Studios {{to record their}} second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, [...] "Jugband Blues". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] and [...] "Corporal Clegg". Wright composed [...] "See-Saw" [...] and [...] "Remember a Day". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned {{how to use the}} recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on [...] "Remember a Day", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, [...] "Norman gave up on the second album... he was forever <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking [...] "like an architectural diagram".|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> 'What are you doing here? Go home! Why {{do you want to}} be on tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following the release of the album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him.

2500|$|During {{her time}} as a model, she tried hard to lose weight. At 1.67 meters (5feet 6 inches) and 44kilograms (97pounds), she was {{considered}} overweight for a model in Japan. At this time, she experienced mental and physical agony, being bullied by other models. According to a contemporary, those who teased Tsuchiya had recognized her as [...] "tough" [...] while other [...] "overweight" [...] models, like Kaela Kimura, were always called by extremely vulgar nicknames. Just a few, but some, praised Tsuchiya afterwards, <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] "well done." [...] When she was fifteen, she awoke one morning starving to find {{that she could not}} move her legs, a result of severe malnutrition, and she was forced to drag herself by hand to the refrigerator.|$|E

Begg said that, when first approached, he hesitated, [...] "I was worried that it might trivialise my experience", but that he would [...] "help to bring those issues to people who would not usually think about it". Although Begg had a financial stake in the game, {{he said that he had}} not received any money at that point. The software company said: [...] "We have had a lot of hate mail about this, mainly from America, <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> 'don't dare put out a game that shows them killing our soldiers'".|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} New York area accent {{is characterized}} as non-rhotic, {{so that the}} sound [...] does not appear {{at the end of}} a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as [...] "New Yawk." [...] There is no [...] in words like park [...] or [...] (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter , or here [...] In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [...] vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous [...] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like [...] "girl" [...] and of words like [...] "oil" [...] became a diphthong [...] This would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced [...] "goil" [...] and oil is pronounced [...] "erl"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Joizey" [...] (Jersey), [...] "Toidy-Toid Street" [...] (33rd St.) and [...] "terlet" [...] (toilet). The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s sitcom All in the Family (played by Carroll O'Connor) was an example of having used this pattern of speech, which continues to fade in its overall presence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking toward the entrance ramp saying, [...] "You're not coming back tonight. You're not coming back, I buried you alive." [...] After this, {{the lights in the}} arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker's former manager and Kane's (storyline) father, was heard screaming [...] "oh yes!". Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker's former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation {{at the top of the}} ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, [...] "my son...you're no son of mine." [...] He then turned back to face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his [...] "Deadman" [...] persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, and walked through the Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker raised his arms to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting at his brother repeatedly, <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] "I killed you!", [...] "I buried you alive!", and [...] "you're not real!", while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down, and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, which he sat up from shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam and Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12–0 record.|$|E
