40|$|Ultrasonography (USG) is a safe, easily available, and {{cost-effective}} modality, {{which has the}} additional advantage of being real time for imaging and image-guided interventions of the musculoskeletal system. Musculoskeletal interventions are gaining popularity in sports and rehabilitation for rapid healing of muscle and tendon injuries in professional athletes, healing of chronic tendinopathies, aspiration of joint effusions, <b>periarticular</b> <b>bursae</b> and ganglia, and perineural injections in acute and chronic pain syndromes. This article aims to {{provide an overview of}} the spectrum of musculoskeletal interventions that can be done under USG guidance both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{synovial}} osteochondromatosis is {{an unusual}} condition, which generally involves otherwise normal joints. Joints commonly affected in descending order of frequency are knee, hip, glenohumeral joint, elbow and ankle, though any articulation may be involved. Synovial osteochondromatosis has been also encountered in tendon sheaths and <b>periarticular</b> <b>bursa.</b> We report a case with the clinical findings, radiographic features, surgical and histological data of primary subacromial-subdeltoid bursa synovitis. X-ray radiographs of the right glenohumeral joint as well as CT and MRI of the right shoulder zone were performed. A soft tissue mass around the lateral margin of the proximal humerus without evidence of any calcification/ ossification or erosion of the adjacent cortex was detected on both X-Rays and CT images. Multiple nodules of almost equal size appeared that were isointense on T 1 -weighted spin-echo images and slightly hyperintense on T 2 weighted spin-echo images compared with the signal intensity of the surrounding skeletal muscles...|$|R

In the current case being reported, using ultrasound we were able to see development of synovial proliferation and increased Doppler flow, both suggestive of continued disease activity. Additionally, ultrasound can help to objectively give information on erosions and soft tissue details of <b>synovial</b> and <b>periarticular</b> tissues.|$|R
40|$|The {{intraperitoneal}} injection of peptidoglycan-carbohydrate fragments from Group A streptococci produces a chronic, polyarticular, erosive synovitis in rats. The cell wall material accumulates {{rapidly in the}} liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, where it causes little injury. At the same time, selective localization and persistence of the material in the <b>synovial</b> and <b>periarticular</b> tissues occurs. Its presence in the joint is associated with acute and recurrent inflammation with focal synotivitis, pannus formation, joint destruction, and ankylosis. Cell wall fragments become localized in the <b>synovial</b> and <b>periarticular</b> tissues {{at a time when}} there are leukocytes in the bloodstream, which appear to contain the material. During this early phase vascular lesions appear in the synovium and in periarticular tissues with collections of fibrin, neutrophils, macrophages, and cell wall fragments near the venules and capillaries. Recurrent episodes of inflammation and joint injury, associated with persistent cell wall antigen within macrophages, were observed over a period of 90 days...|$|R
30|$|Sequelae {{of trauma}} {{can lead to}} chronic {{compression}} of adjacent nerves. Displaced bone fragments and heterotopic ossification are easily visualised on plain radiographs [22]. Previously undetected fractures can cause internal joint derangements, which in turn lead to joint effusions and sometimes large <b>synovial</b> cysts compressing <b>periarticular</b> tissues and nerves.|$|R
40|$|MRL/l mice spontaneously {{develop an}} {{arthritis}} very similar {{in many respects}} to human rheumatoid arthritis. A detailed morphologic and serologic analysis of this disease revealed the following: (a) a 75 % incidence of <b>synovial</b> and <b>periarticular</b> inflammation, very similar to human rheumatoid arthritis, in 5 - 6 mo-old females, (b) close associations between presence of joint inflammation and subsynovial and/or periarticular vasculitis, and (c) a close correlation between presence of circulating IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) and demonstrable synovial and/or joint pathology, i. e., 95 % of mice with significant levels of IgMRF had synovitis and/or arthritis...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the antitumor drug bleomycin (BLM) on <b>synovial</b> membrane and <b>periarticular</b> deep dermis in 10 -wk-old young adult rats. BLM was found to induce edema, mononuclear cell infiltration and necrosis of the synovial membrane in the knee and tarsal joint, and inflammation in the deep dermis of the plantar hindfoot and digital pulvini in these rats after subcutaneous administration of 20 mg/kg for 3 days. After a 4 -wk recovery period, foci of degenerative collagen bundles were observed in the deep dermis of the plantar hindfoot in spite of complete recovery of the lesions in the other dermal and synovial membrane sites. The synovitis was determined to begin with vesiculation of the macrophage-type lining cells, followed by edema and cell infiltration, especially near ligament insertion sites in the knee joint. The early dermal lesion consisted of dissociation of endothelial and suben-dothelial cells in small blood vessels thought to be postcapillary venules, edema, and monocyte infiltration. The severity of arthritis was greater in young adults than juvenile rats. From these results, BLM was shown to have a toxic effect on synovial lining cells and to induce inflammation in the <b>synovial</b> membrane and <b>periarticular</b> dermis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) {{represents}} an increasing health issue worldwide. Regenerative medicine (RM) {{has raised the}} hope for introducing revolutionary therapies in clinical practice. Detection of autologus cell sources can improve accessibility to RM strategies. Objectives: To assess the presence and biological potential of mesehchymal stem cells in three tissues (subchondral bone, <b>synovial</b> layer, <b>periarticular</b> adipose tissue) in late stages osteoarthritic patients. Material and Methods: Samples were collected from subjects undergoing total knee replacement (TKR). MSCs were isolated and cultured in complete αMEM with β FGF. Cell morphology and growth potential was assessed. Flow cytometry was used for detection of several relevant cell surface markers. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of differentiation potential towards three mesenchymal lineages (osteogenesis adipogenesis chondrogenesis) was performed. Time lapse life cell imaging of nondiferentiated cells over 24 hours period {{was used to determine}} cell kinetics. Results: Mesenchymal cells derived from all donors and tissue types showed morphology, growth and surface cell markers associated with stemness. All cell types underwent differentiation toward three mesenchymal lineages with significant differences between tissues of origin, not between donors. Cell kinetics, as derived from life imaging records, was variable with tissue of origin, significant higher for adipose derived MSCS. Conclusion: Human late stage OA mesenchymal tissues, contain progenitors with proliferative and differentiation potential of MSCs. These populations can be used for research and autologus regenerative therapies. Further comparative studies with age matched non OA samples has the potential of contributing to deepening knowledge about disease occurrence and progression...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin (IL) - 1 is {{a proinflammatory}} {{cytokine}} that plays {{important roles in}} inflammation, host defense, and the neuro-immuno-endocrine network. IL- 1 receptor antagonist (ra) is an endogenous inhibitor of IL- 1 and is supposed to regulate IL- 1 activity. However, its pathophysiological roles in a body remain largely unknown. To elucidate the roles of IL- 1 ra, IL- 1 ra– deficient mice were produced by gene targeting, and pathology was analyzed on different genetic backgrounds. We found {{that all of the}} mice on a BALB/cA background, but not those on a C 57 BL/ 6 J background, spontaneously developed chronic inflammatory polyarthropathy. Histopathology showed marked <b>synovial</b> and <b>periarticular</b> inflammation, with articular erosion caused by invasion of granulation tissues closely resembling that of rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Moreover, elevated levels of antibodies against immunoglobulins, type II collagen, and double-stranded DNA were detected in these mice, suggesting development of autoimmunity. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1 �, IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor � were overexpressed in the joints, indicating regulatory roles of IL- 1 ra in the cytokine network. We thus show that IL- 1 ra gene deficiency causes autoimmunity and joint-specific inflammation and suggest that IL- 1 ra is important in maintaining homeostasis of the immune system. Possible involvement of IL- 1 ra gene deficiency in RA will be discussed. Key words: IL- 1 receptor antagonist • rheumatoid arthritis • autoimmunity • cytokine • animal mode...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxyapatite {{crystals}} {{have been}} found in <b>synovial</b> fluids and <b>periarticular</b> spaces in association with osteoarthritis. This study examined the morphology of the interaction of macrophages and synovial cells with hydroxyapatite {{in order to determine the}} fate of hydroxyapatite over an extended culture period. Mouse peritoneal macrophages and bovine synovial cells were grown as monolayers. The morphology of the interaction between hydroxyapatite crystals (HAC) and these cells was studied by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy for up to 14 days. Phagocytosis of HAC, phagosome formation, and concentration of crystal aggregates around the cells began within four minutes of their addition to the cultures. Phagocytosis and cellular aggregation continued after this time. HAC caused minimal cellular disruption despite the uptake of large amounts of crystalline material and significant cellular enlargement. HAC remained within cells for the duration of the study without any apparent dissolution by the cells. Whether macrophages are stimulated to produce interleukin I as a result of HAC uptake is currently under investigation...|$|R
40|$|Osteo{{arthritis}} (OA) is {{the most}} common form of arthritis and the prevalence of OA increases with age. It is the major contributor to functional impairment in older adults. Symptomatic knee OA prevalence is reported to be 13 % among adults over 55 years old. OA process not only affects the articular cartilage, but involves the entire joint, including the subchondral bone, capsule, ligaments, <b>synovial</b> membrane, and <b>periarticular</b> muscles and represents the failure of an organ (the synovial joint). OA is initiated by a mechanical damage to the joint and it is a manifestation of attempts to heal the joint and ameliorate the abnormal biomechanics. The distinction between primary and secondary OA is not meaningful as OA is always secondary to another disease or condition. The diagnosis of OA in clinical practice should be made on the basis of history and physical examination. Radiography is needed to confirm clinical suspicion and rule out other conditions. Other inflammatory diseases, predisposing diseases to OA and local causes of knee pain are potential differential diagnoses. Treatment modalities for knee OA are non-pharmacological, pharmacological, intra-articular and surgical. The management of OA should be tailored for each patient and treatment guidelines should be taken into consideration. In this article the current treatment guidelines are reviewed in details.

40|$|SummaryThe {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), TNF receptors and stromelysin [matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP- 3) ] in articular cartilage were evaluated in an iatrogenically induced model of osteoarthritis (OA). Eleven adult male dogs were assigned randomly to a control group (N = 4) or an OA group (N = 7). Osteoarthritis was created by surgical transection of the cranial cruciate ligament of one stifle joint. Both femoral condyles were sampled 3 months post-surgery at necropsy and immunohistochemically analyzed {{for the presence of}} the aforementioned cytokines and receptors. Chondrocytes stained for TNF-α and TNF receptors in control articular cartilage, spanning an area encompassing most of the middle and deep zones. Positive matrical and chondrocytic staining for TNF-α, TNF receptors, and stromelysin was present in OA articular cartilage. Staining varied in intensity and distribution and was dependent on the severity of the lesion. Smooth muscle cells of arteries and arterioles (<b>periarticular</b> <b>synovial</b> membrane) were stained for only one (p 55) of two TNF receptors; this staining was confined to control tissues. Results indicate that the differential expression of TNF-α and its receptors may be important in the normal maintenance of articular cartilage. The increased presence of TNF-α and its receptors in articular cartilage with mild osteoarthritic changes suggests a {{role in the development of}} early OA. Regulating TNF-α may be an important component in the treatment of OA...|$|R
40|$|Gout is a {{metabolic}} disease characterized by hyperuricemia and the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joints and soft tissues, {{consisting of a}} self-limited acute phase characterized by recurrent attacks of synovitis and a chronic phase in which inflammatory and structural changes of the joints and periarticular tissues may lead to persistent symptoms. Acute gout {{is characterized by a}} sudden monoarthritis of rapid onset, with intense pain, mostly affecting the big toe (50 % of initial attacks), the foot, ankle, midtarsal, knee, wrist, finger, and elbow. Acute flares also occur in <b>periarticular</b> structures, including <b>bursae</b> and tendons. The presence of characteristic MSU crystals in the joint fluid, appearing needle-like and showing strong negative birefringence by polarized microscopy, is pivotal to confirm the diagnosis of gout. The time interval separating the first attack from subsequent episodes of acute synovitis may be widely variable, ranging from a few days to several years. During the period between acute attacks the patient is asymptomatic even if MSU deposition may continue to increase silently. The factors that control the rate, location, and degree of ongoing deposition in gouty patients are not well defined. Chronic gout is the natural evolution of untreated hyperuricemia in patients with gouty attacks followed by pain-free intercritical periods. It is characterized by the deposition of solid MSU crystal aggregates in a variety of tissues including joints, bursae and tendons. Tophi can occur in a variety of locations including the helix of the ear, olecranon bursa, and over the interphalangeal joints. Their development is usually related with both the degree and the duration of hyperuricemia. About 20 % of patients with gout have urinary tract stones and can develop an interstitial urate nephropathy. There is a strong association between hyperuricaemia and the metabolic syndrome (the constellation of insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidaemia), and gouty patients often have a medical history of kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and signs of vascular illness such as coronary artery disease, heart failure and stroke, resulting with a poor overall quality of life...|$|R
