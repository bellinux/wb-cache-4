5|$|Birks' grave {{is in the}} Perth (China Wall) Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery near Ypres. A {{memorial}} {{was constructed}} at his old school in Wales in 1921,funded largely by contributions from local people. When the school was demolished the Memorial was moved to outside St. Matthews Church where it <b>stands</b> <b>now.</b> On Remembrance Sunday the local branch of the British Legion continues to place a wreath of poppies on the Memorial. A portrait of Fred is {{on display at the}} Australian War Memorial in Canberra, alongside his Victoria Cross. He is also remembered in the Museum in Ypres, Belgium (Cloth Hall). His service during the war earned him the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.|$|E

25|$|The {{settlement}} at Amer {{was founded}} by Raja Alan Singh, a ruler from the Chanda clan of Meenas in 967 CE. The Amer Fort, as it <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> was built over the remnants of this earlier structure {{during the reign of}} Raja Man Singh, the Kachwaha King of Amber. The structure was fully expanded by his descendant, Jai Singh I. Even later, Amer Fort underwent improvements and additions by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, coffeehouses {{were first}} {{established}} in North Sea ports, including Bremen (1673) and Hamburg (1677). Initially, this new beverage {{was written in}} the English form coffee, but during the 1700s the Germans gradually adopted the French word café, then slowly changed to the word Kaffee, where it <b>stands</b> <b>now.</b> In the 18th century the popularity of coffee gradually spread around the German lands, and was taken up by the ruling classes. Coffee was served at the court of the Great Elector, Frederick William of Brandenburg, as early as 1675, but the first public coffee house in his capital, Berlin, opened only in 1721.|$|E
25|$|Terminal 1 {{was opened}} on 3 May 1970, {{replacing}} the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 <b>stands</b> <b>now)</b> {{and has been}} greatly expanded since then. Today it {{is known as the}} International Terminal, located in the airport's north western sector. It has 25 gates (thirteen in concourse B numbered 8–37, and twelve in concourse C numbered 50–63) served by aerobridges. Pier B is used by Qantas, all Oneworld members and all Skyteam members (except Delta). Pier C is used by Virgin Australia and its partners (including Delta) as well as all Star Alliance members There are also a number of remote bays which are heavily utilised during peak periods and for parking of idle aircraft during the day.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

25|$|A major {{shrine of}} Lord Shiva worship since the {{classical}} period, {{there have been}} several renovations and offerings to Chidambaram by the Pallava, Chola, Pandya, Vijayanagara and Chera royals in the ancient and pre-medieval periods. The temple as it <b>stands</b> <b>now</b> is mainly of the 12th and 13th centuries, with later additions in similar style. Its bronze statues and stone sculptures depicting various deities and the famous Thillai trees (Excoecaria agallocha) of the surrounding forest reflect the highpoints of early Chola and Pallava art while its famed gold plated gopuram towers are medieval structural additions by the royals Aditya I, Parantaka Chola I, Kopperunchinga I, Krishnadevaraya and Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan. King Kocengannan Chola was born following prayers his parents offered at the temple and later in his life he refined its structure. The shrine gave the town its name.|$|E
25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
500|$|Pevensey Castle was {{constructed}} by the Romans on a spur of sand and clay that stands about [...] above sea level. In Roman times this spur was a peninsula that projected into a tidal lagoon and marshes, making it a strong natural defensive position. A harbour {{is thought to have}} been situated near the south wall of the castle, sheltered by a long spit of shingle where the village of Pevensey Bay <b>stands</b> <b>now.</b> A small river, Pevensey Haven, runs along {{the north side of the}} peninsula and would originally have discharged into the lagoon, but is now largely silted up.|$|E

500|$|Early Byzantine {{architecture}} {{followed the}} classical Roman model of domes and arches, but improved upon these elements, {{as in the}} Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul—albeit in ruins—is the Monastery of Stoudios (later converted into the Imrahor Mosque), which was built in 454. After the recapture of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantines enlarged {{two of the most}} important churches extant, Chora Church and Pammakaristos Church. The pinnacle of Byzantine architecture, and one of Istanbul's most iconic structures, is the Hagia Sophia. Topped by a dome [...] in diameter, the Hagia Sophia stood as the world's largest cathedral for centuries, and was later converted into a mosque and, as it <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> a museum.|$|E
500|$|Although Tomb Raider III {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics, {{it did not}} fare {{as well as its}} two predecessors. Edge considered Tomb Raider III [...] "a valid addition to the growing franchise", stating that it offers more attractive graphics and more innovation than Tomb Raider II, while Computer and Video Games described it as [...] "a perfect mix of the exploration and puzzles of the original, and the more-to-shoot nature of the sequel." [...] Other critics, however, felt that the game failed to change the same tried and tested formula. In its 1998 review, IGN said that Tomb Raider III [...] "solves none of its original dilemmas, and as it <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> the exploration-adventure genre—one that was revolutionized by Tomb Raider—is in the exact spot it was two years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Nagore Dargah (also called Nagoor Dargah or Hazrat Syed Shahul Hameed Dargah) is a dargah {{built over}} {{the tomb of the}} Sufi saint Nagore Shahul Hamid (1490–1579 CE). It is located in Nagore, a coastal town in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Outer doors kept open always. Internal doors opening time is from 4:30 am to 07:00 am and 6:25 pm to 9:30 pm. Friday alone {{additionally}} kept open from 12 noon to 2:30 pm also. Hazrath Shahul Hamid is believed to have performed many miracles in Nagore, and cured the physical affliction of king Achutappa Nayak, a 16th-century Hindu ruler of Thanjavur. He is locally referred to as Nagore Andavar, meaning the [...] "god of Nagore". Nagore dargah as it <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> {{is believed to have been}} built by ardent devotees of Hazrath Shahul Hamid, with major contribution from Hindus. There are five minarets in the dargah, with the Hindu Maratha ruler of Thanjavur Pratap Singh (1739–1763 CE), building the tallest minaret. The dargah is a major pilgrimage centre that attracts pilgrims from both Islam and Hinduism, symbolizing peaceful coexistence between the two religions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{old church}} {{building}} housed a famous organ, a masterpiece built by Wilhelm Sauer and often played in concerts, which burnt on 3 February 1945. The typical Protestant Kanzelaltar, combining pulpit and altar table, was removed in the remodelling for orthodox liturgy, needing an iconostasis. Other, movable furnishings were translocated, {{when the church}} was closed in 1941. The carrara statue of Jesus of Nazareth, created in 1898 by Prof. Adolf Brütt or his disciple Franz Tübbecke after Paul Heisler, from the old altar <b>stands</b> <b>now</b> in the chapel (since 29 May 2005 used as Bulgarian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Boris the Baptiser) on the Friedhof V der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. V of the congregations of Jerusalem Church and New Church) in Berlin-Rixdorf, Hermannstr. 83–90.|$|E

Nearby is a new Café Josty, opened early in 2001, while between the two is [...] "Josty's Bar," [...] which is housed in the Esplanade's former breakfast room.
