30|$|Profound weed {{management}} system {{changes will be}} necessary in the three major GE crops to first stabilize, and then hopefully reduce herbicide use, the costs of weed management, and herbicide-related impacts on {{human health and the}} environment. Weed management experts are largely in agreement that the percent of cropland area planted to glyphosate-based HR seeds must decline dramatically (e.g., by at least one-third to one-half) for farmers to have a realistic chance at success in preventing resistance [10, 12, 14]. Unfortunately, there appears little interest across the seed-biotech industry in increasing production of non-Roundup Ready or not-Bt transgenic <b>seed.</b> Since <b>the</b> decisions made by <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> industry in any given year determine the traits offered by the industry to farmers in next crop season, <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> industry <b>must</b> act first in order for farmers to turn the corner toward more sustainable weed and insect pest {{management system}}s. The many important ramifications of this practical reality – that <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> industry <b>must</b> act first -- have yet to be fully appreciated by farmers, weed management experts, and policy makers in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} {{dependent}} on wildfire. Its seeds require scarification in order to germinate. This is naturally accomplished during fires, when the heat breaks the tough outer layer of <b>the</b> <b>seed.</b> When plants are propagated by hand, <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>must</b> be scarified by nicking the outer surface with a blade or soaking them in acid or boiling water. A conservation plan for the species will include establishing a normal fire regime for the habitat.|$|R
50|$|After stratification, most seeds {{need some}} type of scarification. Scarification is the process that allows the hard shell of <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> to be {{penetrated}} by water. This is usually accomplished by soaking <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> in water {{for a period of}} time. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> shell <b>must</b> be scraped with an abrasive to speed up the process. In nature, this process typically occurs through <b>the</b> <b>seed’s</b> immersion in water during the spring melt of snow and ice. It can also occur through the digestive process of an animal that eats <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> and then passes it in its excretion.|$|R
50|$|B. proteoides is {{not often}} cultivated. It {{requires}} an extremely well drained soil, being particularly susceptible to poor drainage. It prefers full sun and is hardy to both drought and frost once established. Propagation is by seed, but this {{is by no means}} easy. It is thought that <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> <b>must</b> be no older than twelve months, and even germination is erratic and slow.|$|R
50|$|By seed: Streptocarpus seed is {{generally}} very fine. To germinate, <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> <b>must</b> be scattered thinly {{on top of}} potting mix, as they require light to germinate.

50|$|Digitaria exilis can be {{harvested}} in many ways. Some farmers just uproot {{them to get}} <b>the</b> <b>seeds,</b> but other methods may be more effective. People use sickles to cut <b>the</b> region with <b>seeds</b> instead of destroying the whole plant. Another process is threshing which can vary by region. One way of threshing is beating the straw to extract the grain {{or it can be}} done by trampling the straw to extract <b>the</b> <b>seeds.</b> After <b>the</b> grains <b>must</b> be dried usually for a few days.

50|$|Apparently, none of {{the races}} are capable of {{surviving}} on their own. Every time the player manages to fix something, there is another crisis several centuries later that, if unresolved, will destroy the society. <b>The</b> races <b>must</b> be guided to ensure they survive the 10,000 years of history. Often, the crises will involve politics, {{in which case the}} player will have to choose sides. If there are multiple nations on the planet, <b>the</b> player <b>must</b> ensure that <b>the</b> nation with <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> <b>must</b> not be destroyed. Usually, these problems are settled by communicating with <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> and suggesting <b>the</b> proper course of action. Politics can also involve the player choosing a leader from two or three candidates, each having different ideas on how to run the government. <b>The</b> player <b>must</b> gauge each race's best form of government and attempt to implement it. The Piscines, for example, are fine with both a monarchy and a democracy, while <b>the</b> hive-minded Entomon <b>must</b> have a queen to survive.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{one has to}} make a great {{journey of}} {{transformation}} to realize that divine spark which Iqbal calls [...] "Khudi". A similitude of this journey could be understood by the relationship of fragrance and seed. Every <b>seed</b> has <b>the</b> potential for fragrance within it. But to reach its fragrance <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> <b>must</b> go through all the different changes and stages. First breaking out of its shell. Then breaking the ground to come into the light developing roots at the same time. Then fighting against the elements to develop leaves and flowers. Finally reaching its pinnacle by attaining the fragrance that was hidden within it.|$|R
50|$|This African {{sandalwood}} grows from <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> in <b>the</b> natural veld. During <b>the</b> plantation <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>must</b> be sown fresh to the ground.

This plant needs special attention as the plant needs well drained clays or deep loans in the shady area, especially when still in early growth stage. These plants grow very slowly but highly adaptable to frost as well as drought. The propagation {{of the plant}} is done through air layering. Air layering {{is the process of}} removing a large branch or section of the trunk of a tree to create another tree.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> total <b>seed</b> {{dispersal}} (seeds m− 2) at the Fischer Fire varied {{significantly with}} fire severity and sample date. The Fischer high severity fire patches had their peak seed production in June. In comparison, <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> production of <b>the</b> Fischer low severity fire patches was considerably lower, but also peaked during June. The control (unburned) patches displayed a less varied <b>seed</b> production across <b>the</b> summer, {{with a small}} peak in July. Our data show that seed rains for both high and low severity fires at the Fischer Fire were predominantly composed of annual species. <b>The</b> large <b>seed</b> numbers we found support the contention by Stark et al. (2006) that <b>seed</b> dispersal in <b>the</b> first year following fire is an important mechanism in vegetation recovery. However, <b>seeds</b> from <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> bank <b>must</b> be important as well, and many of <b>the</b> plants dispersing <b>seeds</b> in <b>the</b> burned Fischer patches must have begun from <b>the</b> existing <b>seed</b> bank.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are various}} {{approaches}} to the cultivation of Key limes.

50|$|Quercus rubra {{is grown}} in parks and large gardens as a {{specimen}} tree.

50|$|The {{preferable}} {{job that}} the Nyimang tribes like is agriculture. They like farming and building crops {{that they find}} quite valuable. If a member of their tribe goes to the city they prefer to be soldiers or join the police force, to become butchers, to become waiters, and some become bakers. The Nyimang like farming that's why they have numerous crops per person. They include cucumbers, nuts, corn, wheat, and sesame <b>seeds.</b> <b>The</b> Nyimang tribe measures wealth not by money or land, but by cattle and land. Someone who has more cattle than other is considered wealthier. Cattle and land for the Nymang is like a currency.Their tribe also has a balanced trading system: they trade cattle for seeds with other tribes. <b>The</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>the</b> cattle <b>must</b> be balanced out. If the Amma tribe is short on cattle then <b>the</b> number of <b>seeds</b> they get while rise; it works in vice versa as well.|$|R

Plant <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> 12 to 36 inches apart and let harvest for 65-80 days. This plant is semi-annual and {{it is best to}} harvest in midsummer. One should transplant when plant is 6 inches high.|$|R
50|$|At {{his or her}} turn, {{the player}} takes all seeds from a hole and relay-sows them counterclockwise. If there are holes {{with more than one}} <b>seed,</b> then <b>the</b> player <b>must</b> sow {{starting}} from one such hole. If <b>the</b> last <b>seeds</b> fall in a hole of the inner row and the opposite hole in the opponent's half board is not empty, its contents are captured and removed from the game. If both the opposite hole and that behind it in the opponent's half board are non empty, all seeds are captured from both of them. The game ends when one of the players is left without any seed in his rows.|$|R
50|$|When seed {{is first}} {{separated}} from cones it {{is mixed with}} foreign matter, often 2 to 5 times the volume of <b>the</b> <b>seed.</b> <b>The</b> more or less firmly attached membranous wings on <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> <b>must</b> be detached before it is cleaned of foreign matter. <b>The</b> testa <b>must</b> not incur damage during the dewinging process. Two methods have been used, dry and wet. Dry seed may be rubbed gently through a sieve that has a mesh through which only seed without wings can pass. Large quantities of seed can be processed in dewinging machines, which use cylinders of heavy wire mesh and rapidly revolving stiff brushes within to remove the wings. In <b>the</b> wet process, <b>seed</b> with wings attached are spread out 10 cm to 15 cm deep on a tight floor and slightly moistened throughout; light leather flails are used to free <b>seed</b> from <b>the</b> wings. Wang (1973) described a unique wet dewinging procedure using a cement mixer, used at <b>the</b> Petawawa tree <b>seed</b> processing facility. Wings of white and Norway spruce seed can be removed by dampening <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> slightly before it is run through a fanning mill for the last time. Any moistened seed must be dried before fermentation or moulding sets in.|$|R

40|$|Permanent {{implantation}} {{of radioactive}} seeds {{is a viable}} and effective therapeutic option widely used today for early stage prostate cancer. In order to perform intraoperative dosimetry <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> locations <b>must</b> be determined accurately with high efficiency. However, <b>the</b> task of <b>seed</b> segmentation is often hampered by {{the wide range of}} signal-to-noise ratios represented in the x-ray images due to highly non-uniform background. To circumvent the problem we have developed a new method, the spoke transform, to segment <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> from <b>the</b> background. This method uses spoke-like rotating line segments within the two concentric windows. The mean intensity value of the pixels that fall on each rotated line segment best describing the intersection between <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> that we are trying to segment is chosen. The inner window gives an indication of the background level immediately surrounding <b>the</b> <b>seeds.</b> <b>The</b> outer window is an isolated region not being segmented and represents a non-seed area in need of enhancement and a detection decision. The advantages of the method are its ability (1) to work with spatially varying local backgrounds and (2) to segment <b>the</b> hidden <b>seeds.</b> Pd- 103 and I- 125 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the spoke transform...|$|R
