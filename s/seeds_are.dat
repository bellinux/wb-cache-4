5|$|A drupe is a {{fleshy fruit}} {{surrounding}} a stone, or pit, containing a seed. Some of these <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> culinary nuts as well.|$|E
5|$|Though {{plants are}} usually {{killed by a}} severe fire, mature {{specimens}} are able to resprout. <b>Seeds</b> <b>are</b> able to persist in the soil {{for more than five}} years, germinating after fire.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{presence}} of living insects on <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> an issue for the export market as no living insects are allowed for export. The presence of weevils in the seeds after harvest thereby decreases faba bean commercial value.|$|E
30|$|Twenty-five <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> cracked with a vice, and {{the initial}} weight of each <b>seed</b> <b>was</b> measured. The weights of 25 uncracked <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> also determined. Both sets of <b>seed</b> <b>were</b> then placed on Petri dishes (90 [*]mm[*]×[*] 20 [*]mm) lined with moist cotton and kept covered under {{identical}} laboratory conditions. Each <b>seed</b> <b>was</b> reweighed after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30 and 40 [*]h, and the percentage change in mass was averaged from the 25 seeds from each set.|$|R

5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Fat-rich plant {{products}} such as nuts and conifer <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> particularly important as winter food {{in the north of}} the woodpecker's range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird's energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, berries and tree sap, the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E

30|$|The {{seeds of}} the three {{transgenic}} rice lines were harvested in an environmentally isolated paddy field that had Andosol soils at Tohoku University, Japan, in 2005. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown on nursery beds for the experiment. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> size-selected by soaking in NaCl solution. The specific gravity of the NaCl solution was 1.13  g/cm 3 for the selection of NT, gNAS 1, and gNAS 1 [*]+[*]gNAAT <b>seeds.</b> Because there <b>were</b> not enough <b>seeds</b> from the gIDS 3 line, gIDS 3 <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> selected using 1.06  g/cm 3 NaCl solution. After size selection, the <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> soaked overnight in fungicide solution (Momi-guard, Hokuko, Japan) and then soaked in water at 20 °C for 6  days to break dormancy. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> then incubated in water at 30 °C overnight to accelerate germination. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown in nursery bed soil by 3 April 2006. Previously germinated <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown on brown soil (pH  5.5; Inaho Kumiai Muhiryou Baido, Agricultural Corporation, Japan) in small pots (3  ml) and then covered with the same soil. Three <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown per pot, covered with soil, and grown for 45  days in a greenhouse at the environmentally isolated field.|$|R
5|$|In the HPHT method, {{there are}} three main press designs used to supply the {{pressure}} and temperature necessary to produce synthetic diamond: the belt press, the cubic press and the split-sphere (BARS) press. Diamond <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> placed {{at the bottom of}} the press.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> produced. The tiny black seeds germinate {{in response to}} moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to germinate. Seeds of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist winter to germinate.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} {{threat to}} mass-producing plants for harvest is their susceptibility to diseases. Wild species have {{a range of}} genetic variability that allows some individuals to survive should a disturbance occur. In agriculture, resistance through variability is compromised, since genetically uniform <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> planted under uniform conditions. Monocultural agriculture thus causes low crop diversity, especially when the <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> mass-produced or when plants (such as grafted fruit trees and banana plants) are cloned. A single pest or disease could threaten a whole crop due to this uniformity. A well-known historic case was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1847, where a vital crop with low diversity was destroyed by a single fungus. Another example is when a disease caused by a fungus affected the monocultured 1970 US corn crop, causing a loss of over one billion dollars in production.|$|E
30|$|A {{subsample}} of 1500 <b>seeds</b> <b>was</b> used {{to examine}} the effect of seed weight on germination and seedling growth. Each <b>seed</b> <b>was</b> examined by the floatation method and 60 <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> found to be damaged. The remaining 1440 healthy <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> weighed individually. The number of seeds in each of three weight categories (light (<[*] 320 [*]mg), intermediate (320 – 480 [*]mg) and heavy (>[*] 480 [*]mg)) <b>was</b> determined. <b>Seeds</b> from each category were sown under laboratory conditions in plastic trays (26 [*]cm diameter, 8 [*]cm height) within 10 [*]days from the time of seed collection. A mixture of garden soil and sand media in the ratio of 3 : 1 was used for planting. Twenty-five <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown per tray. Germination was recorded at 3 -day intervals up to 6 [*]months and weekly up to 12 [*]months. The number of germinated <b>seeds</b> <b>was</b> recorded on each occasion. <b>Seeds</b> <b>were</b> considered germinated when the radicles protruded out of the soil surface.|$|R

5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|Polyphenols {{of several}} classes are {{widespread}} in medicinal plants; these substances likely fight infection and reduce grazing by herbivorous insects. They include hormone-mimicking phytoestrogens, and astringent tannins. In Ayurveda, the astringent rind of the pomegranate {{is used as}} a medicine, while polyphenol extracts from plant materials such as grape <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> sold for their potential health benefits despite the lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} the development of new cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. <b>Seeds</b> <b>are</b> generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about six years to bloom.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of some pre-treatments on seed {{germination}} of wild carob <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> investigated under two different conditions (germination cabinet and greenhouse). Twenty two pre-treatments were applied to the seeds. Pre-treated and control <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> placed under dark conditions at 25 °C. All treated <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> germinated at 27 °C temperature in the germination cabinet and greenhouse conditions. <b>Seed</b> germination rate <b>was</b> determined according to the pre-treatments for both conditions. The results showed that if the <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> soaked in pure (98...|$|R

5|$|<b>Seeds</b> <b>are</b> {{the primary}} way that trees {{reproduce}} and their seeds vary greatly {{in size and}} shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces {{one of the smallest}} tree seeds. The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The model postulates bubble nuclei with aqueous and/or lipid skin structure, in {{a number}} and size {{distribution}} quantified by an equation-of-state. Like the VPM, RGBM assumes the size distribution is exponentially decreasing in size. Unlike the varying permeability model, bubble <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> assumed permeable to gas transfer across skin boundaries under all pressures.|$|E
5|$|They {{drink at}} various places, from stock troughs to puddles, {{and do so}} in the early morning or late in the afternoon. Insect larvae and Fabaceae <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> among food {{reported}} to have been fed to young.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seeds</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} {{scheduled to}} be delivered in April 2014. In March 2016, delivery of <b>seeds</b> <b>was</b> forecast for 2016 on the Glowing Plant website.|$|R
30|$|Syzygium cumini <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> {{obtained}} from orchard of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. Collected <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> washed in distilled water for about 15  min. Washed <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> dried completely in an oven at 60  °C for 2 – 3  days to remove water content and grinded into fine powder. The dried fifteen grams powder of S. cumini <b>seed</b> <b>was</b> filled into the thimble {{and subjected to}} soxhlet extraction using methanol as solvent and isolated <b>seed</b> extract <b>was</b> concentrated by rotary evaporator. Concentrated extract was dissolved in PBS making a final concentration of 25  mg/ml for use in further study.|$|R
30|$|Fifty <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> washed by {{distilled}} water {{to clean the}} dust. Then, these <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> soaked for 6  h in each solution of water, neem extracts, and citrate-coated Ag NPs, and neem-coated Ag NPs.

5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency {{may be one reason}} why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (<b>seeds)</b> <b>are</b> {{left in the}} body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
30|$|Seed from P. radiata, P. patula and P. pinaster were {{obtained}} from commercial nurseries. Thirty seeds from each species were subjected to microCT scans (total of 90 seeds) to determine percentage porosity. <b>Seeds</b> <b>were</b> subjected to microCT scans (Phoenix V|Tome|X L 240 /NF 180) with 60  kV and 240  μA for the seed scans of 30 seeds in one scan, at a voxel resolution of 24  μm. After microCT scans, the <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> subjected to a water-floating test to verify viability. <b>Seeds</b> <b>were</b> placed in overnight glass beakers filled with distilled water at room temperature (25  °C). The number of submerged <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> counted and taken as viable. <b>Seeds</b> <b>were</b> then placed between moistened filter papers at room temperature and natural light (16 : 8  h light/dark). <b>Seeds</b> <b>were</b> taken as germinated when the radicle was at least 10  mm. Germination percentages were documented for 4  weeks.|$|R
30|$|Bollgard® cotton {{transgenic}} <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> {{provided by}} {{producers of the}} cotton product system of Baja California, Mexico. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> superficially disinfected by immersion in a 0.5 % sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min followed by washes with sterile deionized water. After disinfection, the <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> placed in single pots (0.3 L) containing a commercial potting soil mix combined with quartz sand and peat moss sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 2 h.
