5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fish inhabiting the river include Chinook salmon, {{threatened}} coho <b>salmon,</b> <b>and</b> rainbow trout. Fish populations are declining, however, due to low {{water quality and}} barriers such as dams and culverts.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery {{near the base}} of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook <b>salmon,</b> <b>and</b> summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> steelhead hatchery in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Fish steaks are cut {{perpendicular}} to the spine and include bones. Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from swordfish, halibut, tuna, <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked en papillote.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is limited}} to the lower reaches of the river.

5|$|Recreational fishing, {{particularly}} angling, {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular participation activities in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 3—4 million anglers in the country.

5|$|Sheet Harbour was {{the first}} {{community}} in North America to use a lime doser, which sprays limestone into the water, to lower acid rain levels, starting in September 2005 in the West River.

5|$|The fishing industry, {{although}} still operating significantly below the Soviet level of production, remains profitable, supplying 20% of Russia's fish in 2006 {{and with the}} volumes steadily growing in 2007–2010.

5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> Arctic grayling.

Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope cutthroat trout.|$|E
5|$|Horseback {{riding and}} {{mountain}} biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. Kayaking is popular along the seacoast {{and in the}} various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River, which is the longest undammed river remaining in California. Fishing for <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> steelhead, a highly prized anadromous form of rainbow trout over , is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby National Forests.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon hatchery.|$|E

5|$|Malawian cuisine is diverse, with tea {{and fish}} being popular {{features}} of the country's cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy.

Nsima is a food staple made from ground corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the park, the {{free-flowing}} reaches of Balch Creek support a population of resident cutthroat trout. Near the west end, furthest from the city center, Miller Creek retains much of its historic nature and supports a greater diversity of aquatic organisms than other Forest Park streams. Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run cutthroat trout, coho <b>salmon,</b> <b>and</b> short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> Lake Cascade is stocked with coho <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
