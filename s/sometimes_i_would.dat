500|$|Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 {{and worked}} on the film with the filmmakers {{on a daily basis}} for almost two years. He {{considered}} it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, [...] "I would sit with Pete [...] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} the songs, Gunn revealed he [...] "started {{the process by}} reading the Billboard charts {{for all of the}} top hits of the '70s", downloading [...] "a few hundred" [...] songs that were [...] "semi-familiar — ones you recognize but {{might not be able to}} name off the top of your head" [...] and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he [...] "would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house — <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best." [...] Most of the songs were played on set to help [...] "the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot", with David Bowie's [...] "Moonage Daydream" [...] the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with [...] "Hooked on a Feeling" [...] in mind; however once Gunn discovered [...] "Come and Get Your Love", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a [...] "better fit." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy {{as to what}} his exact role was, Page often points {{out that it is}} hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time. In a radio interview he explained that [...] "I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session... I was able to fit all these different roles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marcel Duchamp {{began to}} view the {{manufactured}} objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called [...] "readymades". He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called [...] "readymade aided" [...] or [...] "rectified readymades". Duchamp wrote: [...] "One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry {{the mind of the}} spectator towards other regions more verbal. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'" [...] One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed [...] "R. Mutt", titled [...] "Fountain", and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that we talked of the past, and speculated on the future. As the day grew older and less wistful, we forgot everything, and worked on, singing, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> recite him verses as we went, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> tell him about books. Life was full of glamour for us both.|$|E
6000|$|On these {{occasions}} I frequently found Richard absent. At {{other times}} he would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of his, so covered with papers, which was never disturbed. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come upon him lingering {{at the door of}} Mr. Vholes's office. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> meet him in the neighbourhood lounging about and biting his nails. I often met him wandering in Lincoln's Inn, near the place where I had first seen him, oh how different, how different! ...|$|E

60|$|All methods I tried. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{send them}} forth {{accompanied}} by a curt business note of the take-it-or-leave-it order. At other times I would attach to it pathetic appeals for its consideration. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give value to it, stating that the price was five guineas and requesting that the cheque should be crossed; at other times seek to tickle editorial cupidity by offering this, my first contribution to their pages, for nothing--my sample packet, so to speak, sent gratis, one trial surely sufficient. Now I would write sarcastically, enclosing together with the stamped envelope for return a brutally penned note of rejection. Or I would write frankly, explaining elaborately that I was a beginner, and asking to be told my faults--if any.|$|E
60|$|For {{two weeks}} I {{lay on my}} back feeling like a Hindoo widow on a burning ghat. Old Atasca, an untrained Indian nurse, sat near the door like a petrified statue of What's-the-Use, {{attending}} to her duties, which were, mainly, to see that time went by without slipping a cog. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fancy myself back in the Philippines, or, at worse times, sliding off the horsehair sofa in Sleepytown.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some people! <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> feel it <b>would</b> {{be good to}} {{meet with}} a single person--a single one--I could agree with! But tell me of yourself--are you in the grange movement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My present feelings," [...] {{the prince}} declared, [...] "I {{do not wish}} to conceal. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like you to know them. But as words are <b>sometimes</b> clumsy, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like, if it were possible, to let you see into my heart, or, in these days, shall I not say my consciousness? I should feel, then, that without fear of {{misunderstanding}} you would know certain things which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like you to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,--you don't. You {{must love}} me best, but I won't be called good. I {{do not know}} why it has been so. Do you know, Paul, <b>I</b> have <b>sometimes</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do as he would have me, out of sheer gratitude. I {{did not know how to}} refuse such a trifling thing to one who ought to have {{everything}} that he wants.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once a week Harrison used {{to bring}} me up provisions, passing them through the pantry window, which I left open for the purpose. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> steal out at night and walk under the stars once more, with the cool breeze upon my forehead; but this I had at last to stop, for I was seen by the rustics, and rumours of a spirit at Cliffe Royal began to get about. One night two ghost-hunters--" ...|$|E
60|$|Very {{frequently}} {{from this}} settlement did I use {{to visit my}} boat, and keep her in very good order. And <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> venture in her a cast or two from shore, but no further, lest either a strong current, a sudden stormy wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from the island as before. But now I entreat your attention, whilst I proceed to inform you of a new, but most surprising scent of life which there befel me.|$|E
6000|$|I {{called her}} often [...] "Alice," [...] right before him; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> address her as Miss [...] "Don't Care," [...] and I {{exhausted}} myself in nonsensical chatter without succeeding once in taking {{her out of}} her peevish and tragic self. There were moments when I felt I must break out and start swearing at her till all was blue. And I fancied that had I done so Jacobus would not have moved a muscle. A sort of shady, intimate understanding seemed to have been established between us.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2010 it was {{confirmed}} that Agnes's third French single <b>would</b> be <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> Forget and <b>would</b> {{serve as the}} follow-up to the massive success of [...] "Release Me" [...] and [...] "On and On", which combined had sold over 160,000 copies in France.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} people, without whose support and {{contributions}} this thesis {{would not have}} been possible. I am specially grateful to my supervisor, Gaël Dias for his constant support and help, for professional and personal support, and for getting me interested in the subject of Natural Language Processing and for introducing me to the summarization field. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to express my sincere thanks to Guillaume Cleuziou, for all his help and suggestions about how to use his clustering algorithm, for making available its code and always being there at an e-mail distance. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to thank all my friends, but in a special way to Ricardo, Suse, Eduardo and Rui Paulo for all their help and support when <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not make it; for being really good friends. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> also like to thank the HULTIG research group {{and the members of the}} LIFO of the University of Orléans (France) in particular Sylvie Billot and one more time to Guillaume who helped me feeling less lonely in France and helped me in the beginning of this work. Finally, I am eternally indebted to my family. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> specially like to thank m...|$|R
6000|$|... 79. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> tell my {{condition}} {{to the people}} of God, which, when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell me of the promises; but they had as good have told me that I must reach the sun with my finger as have bidden me receive or rely upon the promise; and as soon as I should have done it, all my sense and feeling was against me; and I saw I had a heart that would sin, and 'that' lay under a law that would condemn.|$|E
6000|$|After that I {{gave more}} time than ever to {{trying to think of}} a solution. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> lie awake at night, and my manner towards Wilberforce, my man, became so distrait that it almost caused a rift. He asked me one morning which suit I would wear that day, and, by Jove, I said, [...] "Oh, any of them. I don't mind." [...] There was a most frightful silence, and I woke up to find him looking at me with such a dashed wounded {{expression}} in his eyes that I had to tip him a couple of quid to bring him round again.|$|E
60|$|I {{would walk}} about the streets always till very late. I dreaded the echoing clang {{of the little}} front door when I closed it behind me, the {{climbing}} of the silent stairs, the solitude that waited for me in my empty room. It would rise and come towards me like some living thing, kissing me with cold lips. Often, unable to bear the closeness of its presence, I would creep out into the streets. There, even though it followed me, I was not alone with it. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> pace them the whole night, sharing them with the other outcasts while the city slept.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he {{were here}} again, what should I do? I cannot wish him here--and yet I cannot bear his dead face. I was a coward. I {{ought to have}} borne contempt. I ought to have gone away--gone and wandered like a beggar rather than to stay {{to feel like a}} fiend. But turn where <b>I</b> <b>would</b> there was {{something}} I could not bear. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> thought he <b>would</b> kill me if I resisted his will. But now--his dead face is there, and I cannot bear it." ...|$|R
60|$|Meantime {{the wind}} dropped, and Mr. Burns {{began to make}} disagreeable remarks about my usual bad luck. I believe it was his devotion for me which made him {{critically}} outspoken on every occasion. All the same, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have put up with his humours {{if it had not}} been my lot at one time to nurse him through a desperate illness at sea. After snatching him out of the jaws of death, so to speak, it would have been absurd to throw away such an efficient officer. But <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> wished he <b>would</b> dismiss himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 208. Thus I went on {{for many}} weeks, {{sometimes}} comforted, and sometimes tormented; and especially at sometimes my torment would be very sore, for all those scriptures forenamed in the Hebrews, would be set before me, as the only sentences that would keep me out of heaven. Then again <b>I</b> <b>would</b> begin to repent that ever that thought went through me; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> also think thus with myself: Why, how many scriptures are there against me? There are but three or four; And cannot God miss them, and save me for all them? <b>Sometimes</b> again <b>I</b> <b>would</b> think, Oh! {{if it were not}} for these three or four words, now how might I be comforted! And I could hardly forbear at some times, to wish them out of the book.|$|R
6000|$|One {{afternoon}} I {{happened to}} be the centre of a small group in the playground. I had been holding forth and they had been laughing. Whether I had delivered myself of anything really entertaining or not I cannot say. It made no difference; they had got into the habit of laughing when I talked. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say quite serious things on purpose; they would laugh just the same. Wakeham was among them, his eyes fixed on me, watching me as boys watch a conjurer in the hope of finding out [...] "how he does it." [...] Later in the afternoon he slipped his arm through mine, and drew me away into an empty corner of the ground.|$|E
60|$|I found a {{thousand}} difficulties. I am an extremely unhandy man (my schooling was over before {{the days of}} Slojd); {{but most of the}} requirements of a raft I met at last in some clumsy, circuitous way or other, and this time I took care of the strength. The only insurmountable obstacle was that I had no vessel to contain the water I should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled seas. I would have even tried pottery, but the island contained no clay. I used to go moping about the island trying with all my might to solve this one last difficulty. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give way to wild outbursts of rage, and hack and splinter some unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I could think of nothing.|$|E
60|$|While {{this was}} going on within me, I never could bear that the child should see me looking at him, and yet I was under a fascination which made it a kind of {{business}} with me to contemplate his slight and fragile figure and think how easily it might be done. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> steal up-stairs and watch him as he slept; but usually I hovered in the garden near the window of the room in which he learnt his little tasks; and there, as he sat upon a low seat beside my wife, I would peer at him for hours together from behind a tree; starting, like the guilty wretch I was, at every rustling of a leaf, and still gliding back to look and start again.|$|E
60|$|During {{the evenings}} of my {{convalescence}} she {{would talk to}} me of her nursing experiences. <b>I</b> have <b>sometimes</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> put down in writing the stories that she told me, but they would be sad reading. The majority of them, <b>I</b> fear, <b>would</b> show only the tangled, seamy side of human nature, and God knows there is little need for us to point that out to each other, though so many nowadays seem to think it the only work worth doing. A few of them were sweet, but I think they were the saddest; and over one or two a man might laugh, {{but it would not}} be a pleasant laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so {{glad you}} do," [...] the countess answered, heartily. [...] "I don't care {{for a life of}} perfect frivolity and fashion, such as one gets in London. If it were not for Gladys's sake <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give it up entirely. Do you know, I often wish my life had been cast very differently--cast among another set of people from the people I have always mixed among. Whenever I meet clever people--literary people and scholars--I always feel so sorry I haven't moved all my life in their world. From one point of view, I quite {{recognize}} what you said just now, that these artificial distinctions should not exist between people who are really equals in intellect and culture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{there such}} idle rumors?" [...] asked Beatrice, {{with the music}} of a {{pleasant}} laugh. [...] "Do people say that I am skilled in my father's science of plants? What a jest is there! No; though I have grown up among these flowers, I know no more of them than their hues and perfume; and <b>sometimes</b> methinks <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fain rid myself of even that small knowledge. There are many flowers here, and those not the least brilliant, that shock and offend me when they meet my eye. But pray, signor, do not believe these stories about my science. Believe nothing of me save what you see with your own eyes." ...|$|R
