40|$|Abstract. This {{paper was}} written {{based on the}} testing of {{resistance}} to stretch & set and bond strength for 10 different kinds of automotive <b>seating</b> <b>fabrics</b> and their corresponding surface monolayer fabrics, according to the standard GMW 3211, FZT 01034 - 2008 /FZT 70006 - 2004, GMW 3220. And the results indicated that, resistance to stretch & set of knitted automotive <b>seating</b> <b>fabrics</b> decreased and that of woven fabrics increased after composited; bond strength of fabric/sponge was {{higher than that of}} sponge/bottom, and bond strength of <b>seating</b> <b>fabrics</b> which had different structures were also different. Studying the performance of automotive <b>seating</b> <b>fabrics</b> had important implications on the production of <b>seating</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and the improvement of product quality and innovation in future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Automotive <b>seating</b> <b>fabrics</b> are {{assembled}} into complete trims by sewing process, {{which plays}} an important role on the quality of automotive seat. This paper was written based on study of the influence of the distance between stitch and selvage, gauge distance, and the type of sewing thread on automotive woven <b>seating</b> <b>fabric.</b> Furthermore, the influences of each factor and the optimum parameters were obtained by the single-factor experiments and orthogonal experiment. The results showed that sewing strength and breaking elongation are increased with increasing the distance between stitch and selvage, and are decreased with the gauge distance. On the other hand, when the distance between stitch and selvage is 8 cm, the gauge distance is 2 cm, and the fineness of sewing thread is 168 tex, its twist is 34. 18, and the break strength 72. 44 N, sewing strength and elongation of this kind of <b>seating</b> <b>fabric</b> are the highest...|$|R

5000|$|In 1937 she was {{selected}} by the London Passenger Transport Board to design the moquette <b>seat</b> <b>fabrics</b> for use on the seats of London buses and tube trains. The new <b>seat</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{were part of a}} customer-experience centered redesign, spearheaded by Christian Barman and Frank Pick, focusing on interior fabrics and surfaces. The moquettes were designed to very specific standards, with patterns meant to hide wear and dirt but avoid the problem of [...] "dazzle," [...] their term for the potentially nauseating effects of a pattern in motion. Four of Marx's thirteen original designs are known to have been produced as a part of this redesign, including a [...] "shield" [...] pattern that was used in the London Underground for decades.|$|R
