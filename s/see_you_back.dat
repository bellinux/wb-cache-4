6000|$|... "--East a Hundred and Eighteenth.... Well, I'm glad to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Wrenn. Didn't {{expect to}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> so soon, but always {{glad to see}} you. Going to be with us?" ...|$|E
60|$|LEXY (hastening {{to shake}} hands with Candida). How do you do, Mrs. Morell? So glad to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{wish you}} a {{pleasant}} voyage," [...] Captain O'Halloran said. [...] "I suppose we shall <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> here again, before long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, Countess, you are {{weary and}} over-wrought. We {{have had enough}} talking to-night. Let me <b>see</b> <b>you</b> safe <b>back</b> to your hotel. Is it far from here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't, please don't!" [...] said Tom, all sympathy at once. [...] "It's Crabtree's work, and he shan't harm <b>you.</b> I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> safe <b>back</b> to Dora and home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> safe <b>back,</b> Mr. Bathurst," [...] Mrs. Hunter said, going {{up to him and}} taking his hand. [...] "We have all been very anxious since you left." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily. Uncle Jack! Oh, I {{am pleased}} to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back.</b> But what horrid clothes you have got on! Do go and change them.|$|E
60|$|GEN. I {{shall not}} forget, Prince. But shall we not <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to the palace? The State ball is almost over {{and you are}} expected.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again," [...] {{said the}} young man, turning {{to speak to}} him. [...] "I hoped you had struck {{something}} better than this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Will, Dave is so {{mean and}} little and noisy--the shrimp! You're so calm. When he's cutting up at parties I <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{standing}} <b>back</b> and watching him--the way a mastiff watches a terrier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks {{a little}} to me like more snow," [...] {{observed}} Dunston Porter, who was present to see them depart. [...] "I shouldn't be surprised to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> coming <b>back</b> {{in the midst of}} another fall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Master Dick!" [...] exclaimed {{the hired}} man, with a grin. [...] "An' Tom an' Sam! Glad to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> boys <b>back,</b> indeed I am. Here, give me them bags. I'll put 'em {{in the back}} of the sleigh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{thankful to}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> safe, Ralph, and hear you have news for me," [...] she said. [...] "Lawrence Calvert, {{the same applies}} to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm glad to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again," [...] John told her, {{after he}} had ordered the cocktails. [...] "Louise has been quite lost without you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{when are}} we to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again?" [...] said Sir John, as Margaret arose from her chair on being told that the {{carriage}} was there.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well, if {{you must}} go, you must. It {{remains to be seen}} what I shall get by it, except perhaps a good laugh when I <b>see</b> <b>you</b> come <b>back</b> with your head bent and your eyes on the ground.' ...|$|R
60|$|SIR PEARCE [forcing a note {{of extreme}} geniality]. Thank you, Mrs O'Flaherty. Well, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> we've brought <b>you</b> <b>back</b> your son safe and sound. I hope you're proud of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "When are <b>you</b> coming <b>back</b> to me? After Sark I [...] fear {{you will}} find home a little dull. Nevertheless, I [...] should like to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again. Come <b>back</b> before Christmas, [...] at any rate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] he cried, {{springing}} to {{his feet}} when he saw us. [...] "How glad I am to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back!</b> When did you return? Isn't this splendid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> sir," [...] Bull said, heartily. [...] "I {{have been}} in a funk all this morning that {{something}} might happen to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, captain," [...] {{said the}} head of the firm, rising and {{grasping}} the other's hand with effusion, [...] "I am glad to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> safe and well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm goin' to {{stay here}} an' find the Magic Umbrella," [...] she replied. [...] "Bein' invis'ble, Cap'n, I'm safe enough. What I {{want to do is}} to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> safe <b>back</b> with the Pinkies, an' then I'll manage to hold my own all right, never fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your gold {{is nothing}} to me," [...] said Aylward shortly, [...] "nor would you buy my loyalty if you filled my wallet with rose nobles, {{so long as you}} were not a man after my own heart. But I have <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> the yellow horse, and I have <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> face the Abbot of Waverley, and you are such a master as I would very gladly serve if you have by chance a place for such a man. I have seen your following, and I doubt not that they were stout fellows in your grandfather's time; but which of them now would draw a bow-string to his ear? Through you I have left the service of the Abbey of Waverley, and where can I look now for a post? If I stay here I am all undone like a fretted bow-string." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{get some}} more oranges, and begin {{right at the top}} of the line," [...] he said. [...] "If that doesn't <b>see</b> <b>you</b> through, come <b>back</b> to me for another bill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> boys," [...] {{said their}} father, in a low but clear voice. [...] "It seems like a long while since you went away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You old darling, it's {{perfectly}} splendid to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. It {{seems like}} an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, {{how did you get}} along?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Will," [...] she said, {{rising and}} putting the {{sleeping}} child down in a neighboring room. As she gave him her hand, he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grant, for God's sake, don't {{sit there}} like that! I'll admit I've been negligent and careless. I can't {{understand}} it all myself. But {{let me do}} something for you now. I've sent to New York for five thousand dollars. I've got terms on the old farm. Let me <b>see</b> <b>you</b> all <b>back</b> there once more before I return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just looked}} in to <b>see</b> if <b>you</b> got <b>back</b> comfortably last night, that's all," [...] she said gently. [...] "I was afraid {{afterwards}} {{that you might}} have met with any mishap?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} light enough by half-past six. Do not delay later {{in taking the}} road. And <b>see</b> that <b>you</b> are <b>back</b> here by nightfall; I shall be anxious till you are returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir--I {{am glad to}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> safe. If Greenly {{were here}} now, he would inquire about his masts, but I wish to know the {{position}} of the ships." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven forbid!" [...] said Jolyon. [...] "What a damnable position! Will {{you stay}} to dinner? No? Well, let me <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to town; I {{wanted to go}} up this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again, Kennedy," [...] {{the duke}} said, heartily. [...] "It is {{something}} to have recovered one friend from the wreck. Now, what is your news?" ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{signed off}} {{at the end of}} her nightly {{broadcast}} with [...] "I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> right <b>back</b> here tomorrow night." [...] The show, like the competing evening newscasts, ended the year with ratings 14% below that of the preceding year. Until 2014 she was the anchor of ABC's flagship broadcast World News and the network's principal anchor for breaking-news coverage, election coverage, and special events.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} with a shyness she could not overcome. [...] "Indeed I was startled when you came in, but of course it's {{pleasant}} to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> safely <b>back.</b> I knew Colonel Challoner had given orders for you to be traced if possible, and that you had been found, but that was all Mrs. Keith told me. I suppose she didn't know--didn't think, I mean--that I was interested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} more lively since you got such a {{pleasant}} answer to your telegram. I wish the General would offer to let me keep my own money and as much more as I wanted. Not that he is close-fisted, poor man! That reminds {{me to tell you}} that you must stay the evening. He wants to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> as bad as can be--never stops asking me to bring you up some time when he's at home. You mustnt excuse yourself: the General will <b>see</b> <b>you</b> safe <b>back</b> to your place." ...|$|R
