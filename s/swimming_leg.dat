25|$|Eurypterus did not swim to hunt, {{rather they}} simply swam {{in order to}} move from one feeding site to another quickly. Most of the time they walked on the {{substrate}} with their legs (including their <b>swimming</b> <b>leg).</b> They were generalist species, equally likely to engage in predation or scavenging. They hunted small soft-bodied invertebrates like worms. They utilized the mass of spines on their front appendages to both kill and hold them while they used their chelicerae to rip off pieces small enough to swallow. Young individuals may also have fallen prey to cannibalism by larger adults.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Halicyclops aberrans sp. n. {{from two}} localities of the River Capim, Pará State, Brazil, is {{described}} and figured. It differs from all previously described {{species of the}} genus in possessing the inner apical spine of the third endopodal segment of <b>swimming</b> <b>legs</b> 3 and 4 reduced and turned upwards, and by the spinal formula of the third exopodal segment of the <b>swimming</b> <b>legs</b> (2. 3. 3. 2) ...|$|R
50|$|Onychopterella is {{distinguishable}} {{from other}} Eurypteridae by its long last walking leg, and the inconspicuous paddle on the <b>swimming</b> <b>leg,</b> which {{ends in a}} spur. Its body, which is medium sized (for a eurypterid), tapers gradually.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, {{several species}} {{distinguishable}} by closer placed eyes and spines on their <b>swimming</b> <b>legs</b> were split {{off into the}} separate genus Eiropterus by Erik Kjellesvig-Waering. Another split was proposed by Lief Størmer in 1973 when he reclassified some Eurypterus to Baltoeurypterus based {{on the size of}} some of the last segments of their <b>swimming</b> <b>legs.</b> O. Erik Tetlie in 2006 deemed these differences too insignificant to justify a separate genus. He merged Baltoeurypterus back into Eurypterus. It is now believed that the minor variations described by Størmer are simply the differences found in adults and juveniles within a species.|$|R
50|$|Members of the Platycopiidae have a {{primitive}} form, {{thought to be}} similar to the most recent common ancestor of all copepods. Few synapormorphies have been found to unite the family, but they include the presence of a second dorsal seta (hair) on particular segments of the legs. They share with calanoid copepods the possession of Von Vaupel Klein's organ, a sensory organ near the base of the first <b>swimming</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{is public}} access via Beaver Lake Park, {{located at the}} {{southwest}} corner of the lake. Boaters are not allowed to use gasoline motors, but fishing is still a popular recreational activity on the lake.

Finishing in twenty-fourth place at both swimming and first transition phases, Radová-Zemanová had moved her way into {{a small group of}} competitors chasing the breakaways of the 40-km cycling race, until she crashed her bike and did not finish the race.|$|E
50|$|Hall was {{selected}} to represent Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the women's triathlon alongside Helen Jenkins and Vicky Holland. Hall, who was ranked 148th in the world points list {{at the time of}} her selection, was chosen ahead five British athletes ranked in the world's top 100 because of her ability to perform a domestique role for Jenkins. In preparation for the triathlon, Hall trained in Bridgend for 10 days with Jenkins. The triathlon took place in Hyde Park with the swim being held in the Serpentine. The cycle involved athletes leaving the park via Queen Mother's Gate, travelling through Wellington Arch, down Constitution Hill and on to Birdcage Walk in front of Buckingham Palace before returning to the park to complete the event with a four lap run around the Serpentine. After leading the pack in the <b>swimming</b> <b>leg</b> and much of the cycling, Hall placed 33rd with a final time of 2:04:38 - she had the best swim relay of all.|$|E
50|$|Corona {{started out}} her {{sporting}} {{career as an}} adventurer and cross-country racer in 2000, until she began with triathlon at the ITU Triathlon Pan American Cup in Puerto Vallarta two years later. In 2005, she finally reached into the international scene, and made a comeback in triathlon after pursuing her full-time sporting career in mountain biking. In the same year, she had also achieved her first medal, by claiming the silver at the ITU Triathlon Pan American Cup in Ixtapa. Corona competed at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, where she won gold medals in the women's individual and team events, along with her compatriot Melody Ramirez. Corona's best result in these games contributed to her qualifying place for the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, where she placed seventh in the women's event, and consequently, for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At the Olympics, Corona maintained her pace {{in a field of}} fifty-five competitors during the <b>swimming</b> <b>leg,</b> but she got lapped by the leader in the road cycling course.|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} and {{aspects of}} the histomorphology of Chonopeltis victori, parasitic on Labeo rosae, L. congoro, L. ruddi, L. cylindricus and Barbus marequensis, are described from scanning electron micrographs and transverse sections. Chonopeltis victori is characterised by sharply pointed tips of the abdomen which are directed outward. Sexual dimorphism is particularly evident from {{the structure of the}} natatory lobes on the fourth <b>swimming</b> <b>legs</b> and the accessory copulatory structures on the second, third and fourth <b>swimming</b> <b>legs</b> of males. The most striking feature on leg four of the male is the peg. The elevated peg appears tubular, but the sides are not fused. On the inner collar elliptical projections, each with a central, circular pore, are present. On the elongated outer collar small indentions occur peripherally. The dorsal surface of the peg is subterminally covered by elongated scales. The ventral surface of the thorax and <b>swimming</b> <b>legs</b> are covered with different shapes of posteriorly directed scales. Interspersed amongst these scales, {{as well as on the}} dorsal surface, eight types of setae are present in large numbers. The possible function of the peg and other structures are described...|$|R

50|$|Campbell was {{selected}} to the national team, along with Carolyn Murray and Kathy Tremblay, for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and awarded a qualifying place in the women's triathlon. After finishing second at the Pan American Championships and posting a pair of thirteenth-place finishes on the World Cup circuit, she was in good physical form to compete at the Olympics, yet overcame with knee problems that had plagued her most of the year. In the women's event, Campbell {{started out as a}} possibility of a top ten finish, and maintained her pace in the <b>swimming</b> <b>leg.</b> Finishing only in thirty-first place at both the swimming and first transition phase, Campbell had moved her way into a small group of competitors chasing the breakaways of the 40-km cycling race, until one of them went down in front of her, and crashed her bike. Unfortunately, she got lapped into the cycling course, and did not finish the race. While the other competitors crossed the finish line in the final leg, Campbell found herself en route to the hospital, where the medical staff confirmed that she had a fractured radial head bone in her left elbow. With Campbell being injured, her teammates, Murray and Tremblay, finished the event in twenty-ninth and thirty-first place, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Two new monospecific genera of the harpacticoid family Laophontidae T. Scott, 1905 are {{described}} here. Apistophonte wasiniensis gen. et sp. n. was found along the Kenyan coast and Propephonte duangitensis gen. et sp. n. {{along the northern}} coast of Papua New Guinea. They differ from most other laophontid genera {{in the absence of}} sexual dimorphism in the endopods of the <b>swimming</b> <b>legs.</b> At first sight, both new species resemble each other very closely in habitus, integumental ornamentation, chaetotaxy of the <b>swimming</b> <b>legs</b> and absence of sexual dimorphism in the endopods. However, the detailed characteristics of A 1, maxilla and male P 5 show that the species are not congeneric. The structure of the first antennular segment of Propephonte gen. n. suggests a close relationship with Peltidiphonte Gheerardyn and Fiers, 2006. The exact affinities of Apistophonte gen. n. however remain difficult to assess...|$|R
