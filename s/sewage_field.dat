40|$|Former sewage {{farms are}} areas where complex {{interactions}} occur {{in between the}} manifold chemical contaminants, the soils and the living organism. The reforesting attempts in such an area were confronted with unexpected difficulties. Over a three years period we investigated the influence of sewage farm soils and laboratory spiked sewage farm soils over Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) and witchwoods (Sorbus aucuparia). The woods were cultivated in Mitscherlich-containers under controlled conditions. The main questions were weather the residues in the sewage farm soils have any detectable effects on the plant development and weather the use of selected contaminants (PCB 52, BaP, Cu and Cd) and their combinations in the laboratory spiked soils facilitate to clarify and to interpret this effects. The biomass production of the plants grown in sewage soils was, according to the chemical contamination and physical characteristics of the soils, lower then in the controls. The organic contaminants in the spiked soils had alone no influence on the plant growth. We could not detect any uptake of those substances via the soil-roots pathway. The heavy metals had a negative effect over the plant growth. We measured increased concentrations of those metals in different compartments of the plants. The combination of organic chemicals and heavy metals had no influence over the uptake of the firsts in plants. Still PCB 52 and BaP showed the tendency to inhibit partially the toxic effect of the heavy metals. For the analysis of PCBs in <b>sewage</b> <b>field</b> soil and plant debris a VDLUFA method for soil, sewage sludge, and compost was established. The artificial contamination of <b>sewage</b> <b>field</b> soil in a multi-tier process yielded a sufficiently homogeneous distribution of the organic contaminants for all the contamination variants. A decrease of PCB 52 due to aging was measurable, primarily {{during the first year}} of storage. After two years of storage, no further reduction of the extractable contents of active ingredient could be observed. For benzo(a) pyren, based on the data available no aging during the entire storage period could be detected with certainty. However, BaP degradation in soil is known to be slow. (orig.)

40|$|Investigation {{sites were}} {{situated}} on partly afforested sewage fields (six sites) {{and in an}} uncontaminated forest (one site) north of Berlin (Germany). Field investigations were accompanied by laboratory tests concerning the influence of soil water content and soil pH on enchytraeids. In addition, effect concentrations for mortality and reproduction for two enchytraeid species were determined for zinc under different moisture and pH conditions. Abundances and species composition showed relatively small differences between the examined sewage fields. On the most contaminated site enchytraeids were found sporadically only. For the other sites no connection seemed to exist between density of enchytraeids and heavy metal contents of the soil. The enchytraeid population of the sewage fields only comprised six to nine species. Most dominant were r-selected species of the genus Enchytraeus and also Henlea ventriculosa and Fridericia bulbosa. All dominant species {{can be considered as}} indicators of slightly acid to slightly alkaline soils. The laboratory tests were conducted with two species occurring on the investigation sites, Enchytraeus christenseni and Enchytraeus sp. (RefB 5). Test substrate was LUFA 2. 2 standard soil, a commercially available sandy soil. The reproduction of both species was significantly reduced at a water content of £ 15 % DW (= 31. 4 % WHC). Further, reproduction of E. christenseni was inhibited at pH 4. 2 and 4. 8 in acidified LUFA 2. 2. In connection with the ecotoxicological tests zinc contents of the LUFA 2. 2 soil were analysed as total contents (aqua regia extract) and mobile fraction (ammonium nitrate extract). Effect concentrations are thus given based on total contents as well as on mobile contents. The LC 50 for zinc for E. christenseni is 271. 8 mg/kg (total) and 81. 4 mg/kg (mobile) respectively. For E. sp. (RefB 5) the following LC 50 -values were determined: 423. 6 mg Zn/kg (total) and 131. 5 mg Zn/kg (mobile). The reproducion test with E. christenseni produced EC 50 -values of 75. 9 mg Zn/kg (total) and 16. 7 mg Zn/kg (mobile). The corresponding effect concentrations for E. sp. (RefB 5) are on a similar level: 73. 0 mg Zn/kg (total) und 15. 8 mg Zn/kg (mobile). The EC 50 of acidified soil (pH 4. 9) was estimated 70. 6 mg/kg which is only marginally lower than without acid (pH 5. 2). The EC 50 in acidified soil calculated on the basis of mobile zinc was 20. 2 mg/kg. On most sewage fields the zinc contents exceeded the EC 50 -values of both examined species. On one site the zinc contents were even beyond the LC 50. Further, soil moisture in the field was often below water contents that caused considerable inhibition of reproduction under laboratory conditions. Soil acidification had negative effects on the dominant enchytraeid species {{as well as on the}} mobility of heavy metals. In total, the habitat function of the contaminated <b>sewage</b> <b>field</b> soils is considered seriously impaired.

40|$|Submarine outfall {{disposal}} {{of domestic and}} industrial sewage is a method of {{disposal of}} steadily growing importance. The flow from an ocean outfall is essentially that of a submerged horizontal or vertical jet. Thus {{a study of the}} hydrodynamics of such jets is needed to evaluate the dilution of the sewage flow. A study of this kind is presented for the case of jets issuing vertically upwards and for jets issuing horizontally into heavier homogeneous ambient fluid. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 - 3, 2 - 5, 3 - 7 and 3 - 14, which show how the dilution along the axis of the jet depends on the initial difference in density between the jet and the ambient fluid and on the velocity of the jet at the nozzle. In. case of jets issuing vertically upwards into lighter ambient fluid, the fluid of the jet cannot penetrate in a vertical direction beyond a certain ceiling level. For the case of homogeneous lighter ambient fluid the ceiling level is given by Eqs (4 - 13) and (4 - 24). For the case of stratified lighter ambient fluid the ceiling level is given by Eqs (5 - 11) and (5 - 20).

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} design of marine sewage disposal systems in accordance with the criteria of the EU Bathing Water Directive is developed and applied to the design of the outfall of the sewage from Athens, Greece. The model calculates the reduction of fecal coliforms due to initial and subsequent dilutions and die-off due to the effect of solar radiation and predicts the concentrations of fecal coliforms at the bathing area for specific hours and current velocities. A combination of these results with the probability distribution of the velocity of the sea currents results in a frequency distribution of fecal coliform concentrations at the bathing area thus enabling evaluations with respect to conformity to the statistical criteria of the EU Directive. The application of the model to the disposal system for the sewage of Athens shows that conformity, without the use of effluent disinfection, can be achieved for the nearest bathing area, located at a distance of 3. 4 km from the outfall, irrespective of the definition of the bathing hours (8 am- 8 pm or 24 hrs) and for a sufficiently conservative mortality rate. These results indicate that under Mediterranean or similar conditions, with typical wind induced currents, a <b>sewage</b> <b>field</b> travel distance of a few kilometres is sufficient to ensure bathing areas against infection, without the need for sewage disinfection. It should, however, be stressed that these conclusions are valid {{on the assumption that the}} sampling procedures outlined in the EU Directive refer to uniformly distributed sampling throughout the bathing period of the day or season...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{the late}} 19 th and early 20 th century, {{industrialization}} and burgeoning town populations in Europe flooded rivers with waste water; rivers with restricted drainage became noticeably polluted. Berlin exemplified {{these problems and}} challenges {{and the kinds of}} responses and solutions that were brought to bear. Upstream of Köpenick, the Müggelspree could cope with the discharge of several small industrial establishments. The situation at Dahme River was different, however, because chemical and pharmaceutical plants had been located on its riverbanks since the late 1860 ’s. Their waste water caused significant pollution. By the end of the 19 th century, about 200 laundries had been established in the town of Köpenick. Their discharged waste water was contaminated with soap, washing blue and bacteria, and these discharges affected biocenosis in the river. After 1870, many companies removed their production from the city of Berlin toward the south-east, upstream of the city. Most of the textile and chemical plants discharged their waste water into the river and caused severe, sometimes devastating, water pollution. By the end of the 19 th century, communities on Berlin’s outskirts had constructed a separated sewer systems to solve the problem, by collecting waste water from the factories and settlements. Nevertheless, the pollution of the Spree River increased although the Berlin Magistrat had constructed a sewer with <b>sewage</b> <b>fields</b> in the 1870 s, to reduce the discharge of waste water from houses and crafts. Berlin’s sewer system had not been constructed to deal with hard rain but such deluges took place from time to time. When this occurs, the run-off fill the sewers and cannot be transported as quickly as necessary to the <b>sewage</b> <b>fields.</b> To avoid flooded cellars in the city, emergency exits were installed at the pumping stations of the sewers located at the river banks. During hard rain, not only water but also organic waste is transported into the river. As a result, fish-die offs occurred regularly beginning in the 1880 ’s, especially after hot summer periods that ended with heavy rains. Another source of continuous contamination was the small water bodies that drained the <b>sewage</b> <b>fields</b> around Berlin. This drainage was contaminated by bacteria, nitrate and phosphate, hence a lot of pollutants had already entered the Spree River upstream of the city. At the same time, the river was used as a major source of drinking water and became increasingly dangerous for the health of the citizenry. Eventually, the water works were removed to Lake Müggelsee in 1893, a place that was not affected by pollutants. Due to river pollution and fish-die offs, the Prussian ministries and administration took measurements and demanded scientific advice. In spite of the regulations and frequent inspections that were implemented in 1909, water pollution remained a continuing problem. Contributing factors were natural conditions like low discharge of the water bodies {{and the fact that the}} city is in a plain, with little run-off. In addition, there were various anthropogenic impacts like locks and weirs, which caused sedimentation and accumulation of pollutants. Eventually, a 2 m layer of sediment accumulated on the riverbed which remains contaminated by heavy metals and other pollutants. The only way to cope with the problem was to develop technical systems to clean up waste-water efficiently and to support research for improving waste water management and advances in controlling water pollution problems. As a result, Berlin became a center of research on water science...|$|R

40|$|Polyzyklische Aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAKs) und Polychlorierte Biphenyle (PCBs) sind organische Stoffverbindungen mit einer ubiquitären Umweltverbreitung. Aufgrund ihrer Toxizität für den Menschen, ihrer geringen Abbaubarkeit und ihrer hohen Persistenz in der Umwelt werden PAKs und PCBs in den Listen prioritärer Schadstoffe vieler Länder geführt. Obwohl der größte Anteil der PAKs und PCBs in terrestrischen Ökosystemen gespeichert vorliegt, sind die Kenntnisse über die Toxizität dieser organischen Verbindungen für Bodenorganismen und Bodenprozesse sehr gering. Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, die Auswirkungen einer Belastung von Streu und Boden mit den Referenzsubstanzen Benzo(a) pyren (BaP; PAK) und 2, 2 '- 5, 5 '-Tetrachlorbiphenyl (PCB 52; PCB) auf die Bodenfauna zu charakterisieren und zu bewerten. Der experimentelle Ansatz wurde so gewählt, dass der Einfluss von BaP und PCB 52 auf Bodenorganismen auf verschiedenen Stufen biologischer Organisation untersucht werden konnte. Zwei Streuabbauversuche bildeten die Hauptuntersuchungen dieser Arbeit. Der erste wurde auf einer ehemaligen Rieselfeldfläche in der Nähe von Berlin mit standorttypischer Grasstreu durchgeführt. Im zweiten Versuch, der unter semi-Freiland-Bedingungen stattfand, wurde radioaktiv markiertes BaP und PCB 52 eingesetzt, im Gegensatz zu den 'kalten' Substanzen in den Freilandversuchen. Bereits nach einer kurzen Exposition im Freiland sanken in der Streu die Konzentrationen an extrahierbarem BaP und PCB 52 stark ab. Eine vollständige Verbrennung der Streu aus den Versuchen mit radioaktiven Referenzsubstanzen zeigte jedoch, dass ein großer Anteil der anfänglich applizierten 14 C-Aktivität weiterhin vorhanden war. Die Ergebnisse von Dünnschichtchromatographien belegen einen hohen 'echten' Verlust von PCB 52 und seinen Metaboliten während der Exposition im Freiland. Benzo(a) pyren dagegen lag zwar zu einem höheren Anteil transformiert vor, aber stark an die organische Matrix gebunden. Die Kontamination der Streu mit bis zu 11 mg PCB 52 x kg- 1 hatte keine nachweisbaren Effekte auf die Dekomposition der Grasstreu. Benzo(a) pyren bewirkte dagegen eine deutliche Steigerung der Streuabbauraten, mit maximalen Abweichungen zwischen der hochkontaminierten Variante (100 mg BaP x kg- 1 Streu) und der unbelasteten Kontrolle von 18 %. Die Besiedlungsdynamik der Streu durch Mikroarthropoden belegte eine differenzierte Antwort der einzelnen Collembolen- und Oribatidenarten auf die Kontamination mit BaP und PCB 52. Es wurde keine Art gefunden, die mit verminderten Besiedlungsdichten auf Benzo(a) pyren reagierte. In den Streuabbaucontainern, die mit PCB 52 belastet wurden, wiesen dagegen einzelne Arten geringere Individuendichten auf. Der Einfluss von BaP und PCB 52 auf die Reproduktionsraten von Collembolen wurde in Labortests nach DIN-ISO-Vorschriften untersucht. Folsomia candida zeigte höhere Vermehrungsraten in den kontaminierten Böden. Die höheren Besiedlungsdichten von Mikroarthropoden in der mit BaP kontaminierten Streu, die in den Freilandcontainern nachgewiesen wurden, könnten direkt für die beobachteten höheren Streuabbauraten verantwortlich sein. In einer ersten Risikoabschätzung über die Auswirkungen einer Belastung mit BaP und PCB 52 auf Bodenorganismen konnte gezeigt werden, dass auf den untersuchten Rieselfeldflächen bereits Konzentrationen an organischen Schadstoffen erreicht sind, die als maximal für die Erhaltung schützenswerter Bodenfunktionen nach dem Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz zu bewerten sind. Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are organic chemicals ubiquitous in the environment. Because of their toxicity to man, their recalcitrance to degradation and their persistency in the environment, PAHs and PCBs {{are listed in}} the inventory of priority pollutants compiled by several Environmental Protection Agencies. The far greatest amount of PAHs and PCBs are stored in the soil. Despite of this fact, the amount of data available on the toxicity of these organic compounds to soil animals and soil processes is very scarce. Aim of this thesis was to assess the response of soil fauna to a contamination of soil and litter with the chosen reference substances benzo(a) pyrene (BaP; PAH) and 2, 2 '- 5, 5 ' tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 52; PCB). The overall experimental approach was designed so to investigate the impact of BaP and PCB 52 on terrestrial ecosystems at different level of biological organization. Two litter decomposition experiments were the core experiments of this study. The first was carried out on a former <b>sewage</b> <b>field</b> near Berlin, Germany, employing the litter of the typical grass species of the study area. The second decomposition experiment was performed under semi-field conditions with radio-labeled compounds, in contrast to the 'cold' BaP and PCB 52 used to contaminate the litter in the field experiment. After a brief exposure in the field, the solvent extractable concentrations of BaP and PCB 52 in the litter decreased sharply. The complete combustion of the radio-labeled litter and the results of thin layer chromatographies gave evidence for 'real' PCB 52 losses during the exposure in the field, while BaP, metabolized to a higher extent, was strongly bound to the organic matrix and did not move into the soil. The contamination of the litter with PCB 52 had no detectable effect on the litter decay rates up to the tested concentration of 11 mg PCB 52 x kg- 1 litter. Benzo(a) pyrene, on the contrary, enhanced markedly the decomposition process, with maximum differences in the highly contaminated variants (100 mg BaP x kg- 1 litter) of 18 % compared to the uncontaminated controls. The colonization of the litter by microarthropods revealed a differentiated response of single Collembola and oribatid mite species to the grass litter contamination with BaP and PCB 52. No species was found that reacted with decreased colonization densities to a contamination with BaP. In the PCB 52 treated litter, some species with low dominance displayed reduced individual densities. When the reproductive performance of Collembola was tested according to ISO standard procedures, Folsomia candida showed higher reproduction rates in soils contaminated with PCB 52 and BaP. Summarizing the gained insight achieved within this thesis on the reaction of the decomposer community to a contamination with BaP and PCB 52, we may point to the reported higher colonization densities of soil organisms in the field BaP treatments as responsible for the higher litter decay rates. Finally, in a first risk assessment, I applied simple extrapolation methods to the achieved data on the response of soil animals and soil processes to a contamination with BaP and PCB 52. In the investigated sites the maximum soil concentrations at which the soil decomposer community may still be protected from adverse effects are reached. Concerning their loads with organic contaminants, the <b>sewage</b> <b>field</b> soils have no security margin in respect to the compliance of protection targets as defined in the German Soil Protection Act...|$|E

We compared the denitrification activity of strain TR 2 with those of various denitrifiers in an artificial medium that was derived from piggery wastewater. Strain TR 2 exhibited strong denitrification activity and produced little N 2 O under all conditions tested. Its growth rate under denitrifying conditions was near comparable to that under aerobic conditions, showing a sharp {{contrast to}} the lower growth rates of other denitrifiers under denitrifying conditions. Strain TR 2 was tolerant to toxic nitrite, even utilizing it as a good denitrification substrate. When both nitrite and N 2 O were present, strain TR 2 reduced N 2 O in preference to nitrite as the denitrification substrate. This bacterial strain was readily able to adapt to denitrifying conditions by expressing the denitrification genes for cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase (NiR) (nirS) and nitrous oxide reductase (NoS) (nosZ). Interestingly, nosZ was constitutively expressed even under nondenitrifying, aerobic conditions, consistent with our finding that strain TR 2 preferred N 2 O to nitrite. These properties of strain TR 2 concerning denitrification are in sharp contrast to those of well-characterized denitrifiers. These results demonstrate that some bacterial species, such as strain TR 2, have adopted a strategy for survival by preferring denitrification to oxygen respiration.

Leach field sites were sampled in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of each tributary. A water sample was collected every other week during the summer of 2006 (n= 14), with increased sampling effort during peak holiday use. Physiochemical and biological analyses included biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, turbidity, human sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (HSBB), fecal coliforms (FC) and total coliforms (TC) tests. Membrane filtration was used to isolate human sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (HSBB), fecal coliforms (FC) and total coliforms (TC). Most probable number was also used to enumerate fecal coliforms (FC) and ensure quality control. Isolated fecal coliforms (FC) were confirmed and identified to species using Micro-Id testing kits. Results of the physiochemical parameters measured were consistent with unpolluted water. None of the sites exceeded United States Environmental Protection Agency???s fecal coliform level for full body contact in recreational waters (0. 05) indicated no statistically significant difference between the fecal coliform (FC) concentrations in the lower reaches and {{the upper reaches of the}} sampling sites associated with leach fields. A statistically significant difference was found between sites associated with leach fields and reference sites. Bacteriological analyses strongly indicate that septic system leaching into nearby creeks, in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, California, is not occurring...|$|R
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of PFOA in biota of remote regions is another topic of concern. It was shown that PFOA accumulates in food webs and findings in top predators are reported [4]. PFOA is {{toxic for reproduction}} (Cat 1 B) and has carcinogenic potential (in accordance with opinion of Risk Assessment Committee of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), [61, 62]). Furthermore, PFOA has a long residence time of 3.5 [*]years in human blood and is present in breast milk [63, 64]. One exposure pathway for humans is nutrition [65]. For example in fish, meat, and vegetables PFOA {{has been found in}} low levels [46, 66]. The PFOA load of these food items results most probably from environmental concentrations in water and biota. Also the transfer of PFOA from soil into plants [67], i.e. after application of PFOA contaminated <b>sewage</b> sludge on <b>fields,</b> or the migration from food packages can be a source for PFOA in food [46]. Another potential human exposure pathway is the {{occurrence of}} PFOA in drinking water [48, 68]. In cases where surface waters are used for the production of drinking water, PFOA is not effectively removed by common purification methods [69]. Therefore, the occurrence in surface waters is of concern from a human health point of view as well.|$|R

The published article can be found at: [URL] reefs are in decline worldwide, and land-derived sources of pollution, including sewage, are a major force driving that deterioration. This review presents evidence that sewage discharge occurs in waters surrounding at least 104 of 112 reef geographies. Studies often refer to sewage as a single stressor. However, we show {{that it is more}} accurately characterized as a multiple stressor. Many of the individual agents found within sewage, specifically freshwater, inorganic nutrients, pathogens, endocrine disrupters, suspended solids, sediments, and heavy metals, can severely impair coral growth and/or reproduction. These components of sewage may interact with each other to create as-yet poorly understood synergisms (e. g., nutrients facilitate pathogen growth), and escalate impacts of other, non-sewage–based stressors. Surprisingly few published studies have examined impacts of <b>sewage</b> in the <b>field,</b> but those that have suggest negative effects on coral reefs. Because sewage discharge proximal to sensitive coral reefs is widespread across the tropics, it is imperative for coral reef–focused institutions to increase investment in threat-abatement strategies for mitigating sewage pollution...|$|R

Inbred W 22 plants homozygous for wx-C {{were used in}} a study to detect the possible mutagenic properties of 32 pesticides or combination of pesticides under modern agricultural conditions. The large numbers of pollen grains analyzed and the ease in detecting mutant pollen grains enabled us to treat the experimental plants with field recommended rates of pesticides. In a current study we are evaluating the possible mutagenicity of Chicago municipal sewage sludge. We are measuring the frequency of mutant pollen grains in inbred M 14 at both the wx-C and wx- 90 heteroalleles. These plants were exposed to various concentrations of municipal <b>sewage</b> sludge under <b>field</b> conditions. We have inbred Early-Early Synthetic for five generations and tested this inbred with known mutagens. Early-Early Synthetic is a rapidly maturing inbred growing from kernel to anthesis in approximately 4 weeks and attaining a height of approximately 50 cm. Plants of this inbred have been chronically treated with ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) or maleic hydrazide (MH) under laboratory conditions and forward mutation at the wx locus was measured in the pollen grains. EMS and MH were mutagenic at concentrations of 1 microM and 10 nM, respectively. The concentrations of EMS and MH were calibrated in Early-Early Synthetic to a linear increase {{in the frequency of}} forward mutant pollen grains. The construction of a maize monitor for environmental mutagens is currently in progress. This assay will measure forward or reverse mutation at the wx locus in pollen grains, point mutation in somatic cells and will incorporate a cytogenetic endpoint in root-tip cells...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{examines}} {{the current situation}} of sewage sludge management at the waste-water treatment plant in Murska Sobota. The export of sewage sludge to neighbour countries {{was found to be}} an unsuitable solution at the given knowledge in this <b>field.</b> <b>Sewage</b> sludge from the municipal waste-water treatment plant in Murska Sobota is not waste but has energetic potential, among others. Analyses were performed, following procedures which are regulated by the current legislation. These analyses from the municipal waste-water treatment plant in Murska Sobota indicate that the sludge is harmless waste and is suitable for composting. The thesis discusses alternative sludge treatment options, sludge treatment in foreign countries, what can be expected in the future and the current legislative framework in this field. Based on the data collected, the most suitable use for sewage sludge from the municipal waste-water treatment plant in M. Sobota is for fertilization of suitable agricultural areas in the municipality of M. Sobota. The nutritional substances in sludge are more suitable and friendly to environment and plants, compared to mineralised fertilizers. Using sludge this way, means recycling of important nourishments for plants, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, the latter being the most valued element of sludge. It is known that in approximately 50 years from now all known supplies of apatite (source of phosphorus) will be exhausted and therefore it is urgent to set up a system of substance circulation wherever possible. Suitable areas for sludge use in the municipality of M. Sobota are consolidated into two larger areas which enable an economic way of spreading the sludge in the periods of fertilization. A cost analysis was performed regarding the use of sludge in agricultural areas. For comparison with sewage sludge we used the currently best selling mineralised fertilizer in Slovenia, NPK 15 - 15 - 15 and found, that we could anually save up to 200. 000 EUR using sewage sludge...|$|R
40|$|Phase II-A is {{a project}} that is an {{extension}} of a recently completed 4 -yr project (July 1975) entitled "Recycling of Sewage Effluent by Irrigation: A Field Study on Oahu," hereinafter referred to as Phase I. The main purpose of Phase I was to apply secondarily-treated sewage effluent from the Mililani STP to thirty 0. 04 -ha (O. 1 -acre) test plots of sugarcane located in Oahu Sugar Company's (OSC) Field No. 246 in central Oahu, Hawaii. The results of this study showed that sewage effluent applied for irrigation during the first year and Waiahole Ditch water the second year of the 2 -yr sugarcane crop cycle increased the sugar yield by 6 % over control plots, whereas, sewage effluent applied during the full 2 -yr cycle reduced the sugar yield by 6 % below the control plots. Sewage-borne viruses and coliform bacteria in the applied sewage effluent were inactivated within the shallow root zone; and salts, including nitrogen, did not appear to leach below the root zone in any greater quantities than that of the companion ditch-irrigated plots. The results of Phase I appear promising in terms of increased sugar yield, an additional irrigation water source, and alleviation of a sewage effluent disposal problem; however, it is not presently considered economically feasible to construct and maintain a separate ditch water and <b>sewage</b> effluent <b>field</b> distribution system, thus, the question arises as to the optimum dilution of sewage effluent with ditch water for a single field distribution system so that sugar yield will not be decreased and hopefully increased over present plantation practices. The Phase II-A portion of the project attempts to determine the dilution necessary for an optimal balance of water disposal and sugar yield. Secondary objectives of the project are to monitor the quantities of nitrogen leaching past the root zone and continued monitoring of sewage effluent for the presence of human enteric viruses. The reporting period for this progress report is from October 1976, when the sugarcane was planted in the test plots, to June 1977. The same 30 test plots and sugar cane variety (Hawaiian variety 593775) as used in Phase I were incorporated in Phase II-A. Five irrigation treatments for the 2 -yr cycle with six replicates in a randomized block design were: (1) ditch water, (2) 12. 5 %, (3) 25 %, (4) 50 % effluent diluted with ditch water, and (5) effluent the first year and ditch water the second year. Irrigation rounds of up to 10 cm (4 in.) were applied bi-weekly, and tensiometers in selected test plots monitored water stress conditions. Representative soil samples were collected and analyzed shortly after sugarcane planting. Commercial fertilizer applications of N, P, and K to the test plots were completed in June 1977. Four crop logs were made on sugarcane growth in the test plots. The physical appearance of that growth was very good; however, the relatively low K-H 2 O index and the high total sugars from the crop log indicate a possible growth imbalance. Rainfall during this period, due to a very dry winter, was nearly one-half of normal, whereas, evaporation was more than 50 % above normal. Secondary effluent from the Mililani STP is typical of domestic sewage, although it has a higher BODs than experienced during Phase I. The effluent is monitored on a routine basis at the STP, and also when the test plots are irrigated. Soil leachates are collected during each irrigation from representative plots through 5 -cm (2 -in.) diameter by 1. 52 -m (5 -ft) long porous plastic "Porvic" samplers placed horizontally in the subsoil beneath the root zone. The concentration of nitrogen in the leachates collected beneath the root zone fluctuates with fertilizer applications, but after fertilizer applications were completed, increases with the higher percentage of effluent in the irrigation water were observed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental {{study to determine}} the feasibility of using zeolite addition for the in situ treatment of soils contaminated with heavy metals. The aim of the present work {{was to examine the}} effectiveness of three synthetic zeolites to reduce plant available metal pools in contaminated soils. Three contaminated soils were studied, which are representative of typical contamination sites in the UK: Prescot, site of a copper refmery, Trelogan, an old lead/zinc mine spoil, and Gateacre, a <b>sewage</b> sludge treated <b>field.</b> The action of zeolites to reduce available metal concentrations in soils is due to their ion-exchange properties. To investigate the decrease of metal bioavailability by zeolites, laboratory and greenhouse trials were performed to clarify the mechanism of heavy metal fixation by synthetic zeolites and to quantify the effect of different zeolites for land remediation. For this approach, it was necessary to measure the metal concentration in the soil and the soil solution in zeolite-amended soils and to determine the zeolite specific isotherms of all the metals studied. Cation exchange studies involved exchanging the sodium form of the zeolites with different metals in solution, {{in order to determine the}} zeolite affinity for the metals copper, cadmium, zinc and lead. The resulting isotherms demonstrated that all three zeolites showed a preference for the heavy metal ions over sodium ions. The changes in metal speciation in zeolite-treated contaminated soils were evaluated using sequential extraction procedures. After incubation with synthetic zeolites, metals extracted with ammonium acetate were significantly decreased (31. 4 % - 72. 4 %) in amended soils compared to the controls. This decrease in heavy metal availability is extremely significant. The exchangeable metal fraction is the most available for uptake by plants. Long term soil solution experiments with zeolite-amended soils showed that the metal concentrations in the aqueous leachate were significantly reduced than in the leachate from the same substrates without zeolite addition. Greenhouse pot trials were carried out with sunflower (Helianthus annuus), maize (Zea mays), willows (Salix viminalis) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne) plants grown in zeolite amended contaminated soils. There were significant improvements in visual appearance and growth of plants from the zeolite-treated soils compared to the controls. In addition, metal content of plant tissues was reduced when compared to the controls. Optimum zeolite concentrations were noted for each zeolite. Zeolite P and 4 A were more effective at reducing the phytotoxicity at 0. 5 % and 1 %, whilst zeolite Y had to be added at 5 % to achieve a similar effect. In order to link the laboratory test results and soil data to a pilot field scale, in which the actual soil and environmental conditions are required to give a complete evaluation of the proposal technique when applied to a given hazardous waste site, a field trial was initiated, at a copper contaminated site at B. I. C. C., Prescot to examine the effectiveness of zeolite amendments under field conditions. Zeolites P and 4 A applied at 1 % level proved to be an effective treatment for the remediation of the contaminated site, as indicated by improved plant growth and low metal concentrations in the water soluble fraction of the soil. The results show that zeolite addition, particularly zeolites P and 4 A, provide an effective method for decreasing plant heavy metal bioavailability in polluted soils, under glasshouse and field conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis {{is part of a}} wider EU-LIFE project, the WaterRenew project. The WaterRenew concept can be described as the recovery of nutrients from wastewater which can lead to eutrophication of surface waters, by irrigation of short rotation coppice in order to fertilise them. Such systems have been proven to function properly as nutrient removal systems when studied for N removal and have already been successfully and commercially implemented in different countries. However, the factors potentially preventing them from operating sustainably have not been identified nor their upper limits quantified with confidence. A WaterRenew system can indeed be looked at as a unit composed with three main compartments; soil, soil water and plant. Therefore, the sustainability of such a system will be compromised if {{at least one of these}} compartments is changed irreversibly. The limits can be hydrological with constant runoff or drainage being induced. They can also be chemical with inadequate amounts of nutrients removed from the effluent applied or irreversible accumulation of nutrients in soil. Finally, these limits can be physiological with the trees’ health being irreversibly compromised. Moreover, the relevance and effectiveness of such a system under UK conditions has not been established yet. In this context, a field trial was set up at Cranfield University sewage treatment works where the secondary treated effluent was irrigated on to Salix viminalis, Populus trichocarpa and Eucalyptus gunnii trees planted at a density of 13, 060 trees. ha- 1, on a chalky clayey soil, in order to maintain soil water content at field capacity. To tackle more specifically P fate processes understanding, an independent P leaching soil column experiment was also set up. With the latter settings, it was possible to apply high volumes of effluent (3625 mm for willow, 2895 mm for poplar and 3345 mm for eucalyptus for the 2 years of irrigation) and high amounts of nutrients (1023 kg-N. ha- 1 and 134 kg-P. ha- 1 for willow, 834 kg- N. ha- 1 and 108 kg-P. ha- 1 for poplar and 946 kg-N. ha- 1 and 127 kg-P. ha- 1 for eucalyptus for the 2 years of irrigation). It was found that irrigation with effluent increased significantly tree yields so that they were within the range reported in the literature for willow and eucalyptus but slightly lower for poplar. The trees uptook between 20 % and 50 % of the total amounts of N and P applied with eucalyptus uptaking more nutrients than willow, which in turn took up more than poplar. Then, it was found that irrigation did not have any significant effect on N and P in soil and the amounts applied remained very low compared to the existing nutrients soil pools. However, irrigation did have a significant effect on increasing K and Na in soil. Na increased enough to induce a significant increase in soil SAR but soil remained neither saline nor alkali. The trees had a smaller impact on soil chemistry. Finally, it was found also that irrigation did not have any significant effect on N and P in soil water with no P detectable in any of the soil water and groundwater samples during the whole experiment. Irrigation did, however, increase significantly K and Na concentrations in soil water and for K also in groundwater. From the point of view of nutrients removal, although a tree effect was measurable, it was not as important as the functions of the soil. Thus, when a WaterRenew system is maintained under a hydrological constraint, with the soil moisture kept at field capacity, it was still possible to apply high volumes of effluent, even on a clayey soil. In addition, the consequent high amounts of nutrients applied were efficiently retained between tree uptakes and mainly soil organic and inorganic nutrients’ pools. Indeed, the amounts of nutrients lost by drainage remained low (< 10 % of the total amounts applied) for N and P and groundwater was efficiently protected from pollution on this site. On P dynamic processes understanding, it was found that P leaching patterns depend highly on soil moisture and to a lesser extent on the amount of P applied. When soil is saturated, P will start leaching even when applied at a very low concentration. A model, the WR_MODEL, was developed which integrates the observations, measurements and understanding of Cranfield University <b>sewage</b> treatment work <b>field</b> trial and soil column experiment into a model. The purpose of WR_model is to help the design and implementation of a WaterRenew system in any location as long as climatic and soil data are available.

40|$|The {{structure}} and dynamics of sponge-dominated assemblages living on both shallow and deep coastal and estuarine reefs in temperate NSW, Australia were quantified by examining their {{spatial and temporal}} variability {{at a number of}} scales. The effect of the discharge of sewage effluent on these assemblages was also examined. Quantifying the natural spatial and temporal variability in these assemblages has received inadequate attention because of the difficulty in sampling these habitats. Following assessment of the efficacy of photoquadrats and appropriate levels of taxonomic resolution, I sought to determine i) spatial and temporal patterns of variability and ii) assess the effects of point source sewage pollution on these assemblages. A reliable quantitative technique using photo-quadrats was therefore developed and tested for sampling the macrobenthic assemblages living on hard substrata. No loss in the accuracy of the data was detected whilst the increased efficiency of the method enabled these assemblages to be sampled at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Both univariate and multivariate techniques determined that sufficient taxonomic resolution was attainable at the level of phylum for assemblages in kelp forests, whilst the level of order was necessary for assemblages in crustose habitats. Furthermore, as taxonomic resolution increased towards species level, the detection of differences associated with sewage became less likely. Patterns and processes in deep-water macrobenthic assemblages have largely been inferred from the study of such assemblages on shaded artificial structures or in relatively shallow water. Patterns in the diversity and abundance of sponges on the coastal reefs off Sydney were examined using photo-quadrats to provide estimates of species richness and percentage cover. Spatial and temporal variability was measured by sampling three nested sites within each of three reefs at each of three depths (20, 30 and 50 m) on three occasions. Sponge richness generally increased with depth, as did the number of erect or massive forms. In contrast, cover decreased with depth particularly for encrusting sponges. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed considerable small-scale spatial and temporal variation in sponge distribution and abundance. A significant positive relationship between richness and cover was also apparent. In general, there were greater temporal changes in the patterns of abundance for the shallow reef assemblages at 20 m, relative to those at 30 m and 50 m. The {{structure and}} dynamics of sponge-dominated assemblages were further examined by contrasting these assemblages on both exposed and sheltered reefs at the same depth. Four sheltered estuarine and four open coastal reef locations were examined where three nested sites were sampled within each location over time. Generally, richness of erect species was greater for the assemblages on sheltered reefs whilst there was greater temporal variability on reefs exposed to wave energy. The effect of discharging sewage effluent on shallow, nearshore and deep-water macrobenthic assemblages was examined at various spatial and temporal scales. In shallow water kelp forests, the assemblages were sampled according to an experimental design that had two sites nested within each of three outfall and three reference locations. Apart from the richness of sponges, univariate and multivariate analyses determined that there were no obvious patterns associated with the discharge of sewage effluent from these low volume and highly mixed cliff-face outfalls. In general, the assemblages showed natural spatial patchiness that could not be attributed to the effects of sewage. In contrast, using a 2 ̆ 7 Beyond BACI 2 ̆ 7 experimental design, the cover and the number of encrusting macrobenthic species inhabiting a nearshore reef in the vicinity of an ocean outfall changed rapidly following the discharge of secondary treated sewage effluent. Within 3 months, significant reductions in the cover of crustose and foliose algae were apparent when compared to reference locations. The cover of several species of sponge, including Cymbastela concentrica, Geodinella sp. and Spongia sp. also underwent marked declines coincident with the commissioning of the outfall. Multivariate analyses revealed marked shifts {{in the structure of the}} assemblage at the outfall relative to the reference locations. The overall composition of the community at the outfall changed from one in which algae and sponges were well represented to an assemblage dominated by silt and ascidians. Finally, the macrobenthic assemblages living on reefs in the vicinity of a newly commissioned deep-water ocean outfall were sampled using an experimental design that had three sites nested within each of three reef locations. After 18 months, significant effects of the outfall were detected for the total number of species, bryozoans, cnidarians and the abundances of two bryozoan species and a non-descript silt matrix. Small-scale interactions among sites through time also occurred for many taxa which represented inherent 2 ̆ 7 noise 2 ̆ 7 and some evidence for the effects of the outfall at smaller spatial scales To partition out variation associated with the discharge of <b>sewage,</b> a manipulative <b>field</b> experiment was done to examine some of the processes that may be causing some of the observed patterns within sponge-dominated assemblages. The phototrophic sponge, Cymbastela concentrica was used to test its response to increased shade, silt and nutrients. Furthermore its response to a salinity gradient was also examined. The results indicated that sponge growth and reproductive status were influenced by shading and siltation, and the relationship between the host sponge and its macroalgal symbiont were also affected. Nutrients did not affect the sponge in any way, whereas a decreasing salinity gradient affected the growth, reproductive status and symbiotic algae within the sponge. In general, the structure and dynamics of sponge-dominated assemblages was found to be highly variable at many scales with natural and anthropogenic disturbance playing a critical role in the dynamism of the assemblages. Water authorities with the responsibility of managing the disposal of sewage effluent to the marine environment commonly use poorly designed 2 ̆ 2 post-commissioning 2 ̆ 2 sampling programs to assess environmental impact. The utility of monitoring programmes that do not sample at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is compromised because of the considerable variability inherent within spongedominated assemblages...|$|R
