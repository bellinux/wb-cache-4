National Agriculture Statistics Service {{reported}} that in 2014 and 2015 over 6 million hectares of sorghum were planted in the United States {{and the value of}} grain sorghum was over $ 1. 6 billion. Sorghum is an important staple crop for many countries and is used as mainly fodder for livestock. Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid,</b> is a new invasive pest of sorghum in southern U. S. It was first observed in sorghum in 2013 in Texas, but high infestations caused important losses in 2014 in several southern states (Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma). The novelty and the speed of invasion of this pest caught the industry by surprise, and today few control options are available. In order to develop sustainable control strategies a life table analysis was first conducted of the <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> on five sorghum hybrids. These included both grain, sweet and photoperiod sensitive sorghum hybrids.

40|$|Switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., a perennial, warm-season grass {{native to}} North America, is a {{candidate}} for development as a bioenergy crop. Previously, warm-season grasses were considered to be relatively pest free in their native habitats. However, recent studies using the hemipteran family Aphididae have shown phloem-feeding insects can lead to significant injury in switchgrass. The objectives of this research were to: 1) gain physiological, biochemical, and anatomical insights into insect-bioenergy switchgrass interactions to determine potential insect resistance mechanisms among susceptible and resistant switchgrass genotypes; and 2) to generate and evaluate diverse segregating populations of switchgrass, both resistant and susceptible, to assess for insect herbivory. ^ Recently, select aphids including greenbugs, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), and yellow <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphids,</b> Sipha flava (Forbes), have been identified as potential pests of switchgrass. However, limited research has been devoted to selecting insect-resistant switchgrasses and understanding the physiological responses of susceptible and resistant switchgrasses to aphid feeding. Using a series of photosynthesis studies, differences in photosynthetic activity were detected among the switchgrasses evaluated in response to aphid feeding. Overall, the lowland ecotype (Kanlow) assimilated carbon dioxide more efficiently than the upland ecotype (Summer) and the hybrid KxS when exposed to aphid herbivory. These observations suggest the antibiotic population, Kanlow, has mechanisms similar to those observed in tolerant plant systems where changes in photosynthetic rates occurred in response to aphid herbivory. ^ Feeding by greenbugs and yellow <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphids</b> on plants can elicit a number of stress-related responses. Our studies investigated the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes and defensive response genes in resistant and susceptible switchgrass populations using biochemical protocols along with gene expression studies. Genes of interest involving greenbug-switchgrass interactions were identified from previous Illumina ® Solexa data, specifically RNAseq. These data provide valuable insight into the physiological, biochemical, and anatomical response of switchgrass when challenged by cereal aphids. Furthermore, continued screening of susceptible and resistant switchgrass germplasm will help researchers better understand the defensive systems operating in segregating switchgrass populations. ...|$|R

40|$|Switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., {{along with}} two other {{perennial}} warm-season grasses, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and indiangrass, (Sorghastrum nutans L), compose {{a majority of the}} grasses found in North American tall grass prairies and have recently received attention as potential bioenergy feedstock. Limited research has been carried out on the relationship of arthropods on these three warm-season grasses in North America. Due to this limited research, the first objective of this research was to document the arthropods associated with switchgrass, big bluestem and indiangrass in Nebraska and Wisconsin over three sampling seasons. More than 10 arthropod orders and over 67 families were collected between the two locations {{with some of the most}} abundant families collected including: Carabidae, Chloropidae, Cicadellidae, Figitidae, and Thripidae. Previous research has documented greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) and yellow <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphids</b> (Sipha flava Forbes) as potential pests of switchgrass, but limited information is available on the host suitability of big bluestem and indiangrass to these two aphid species. Therefore, the second objective of this research was to document aphid feeding preference among these three grass species through a series of choice studies and to characterize greenbug feeding behaviors using the electric penetration graph (EPG) technique. Choice studies identified differences in the preference of two aphid species in response to the three grasses with switchgrass being most preferred by Schizaphis graminum at 1, 2 and 4 h; whereas switchgrass was the least preferred by S. flava starting at 24 h after aphid introduction. Feeding behavior studies of S. graminum on switchgrass, big bluestem and indiangrass indicated that greenbugs took significantly more time before achieving the first sieve-element phase (salivation and ingestion of sieve element phloem sap) when feeding on indiangrass compared to both switchgrass and big bluestem, suggesting resistance factors in indiangrass are associated with phloem tissue. These studies are the first to examine the feeding preference of S. graminum and S. flava on big bluestem and indiangrass. This research provides important baseline information about the arthropod communities associated with the three warm-season grasses, and advances our understanding of the plant-insect interactions within this system.

(1) The kind of aphid appearing on {{the leaves of the}} sorghum varieties was only the <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid,</b> Melanaphis sacchari in the field. The number of aphids infesting a leaf was ca 0, 30 and 3, 500 in the resistant, moderately resistant and susceptible varieties at the middle of August, respectively. (2) The amount of leaf surface wax was approximately constant among these three varieties. (3) The total sugar content was slightly higher in the two resistant varieties than in the susceptible variety. (4) The total free amino acid concentration was higher in the two resistant varieties than in the susceptible variety. (5) These findings suggest that neither leaf surface wax nor nutritional components seem to affect the aphid populations on the leaves of the three sorghum varieties, showing that biogenic substances such as dhurrin, benzylalcohol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, aconitic acide, etc. may affect the aphid populations. ヒエノアブラムシの寄生密度にソルガム葉の葉面ワックス、栄養成分である糖と遊離アミノ酸がどのように影響するかを明らかにするために、抵抗性、中間、感受性の 3 系統のソルガムを用いて、これらの物量の含量を比較した。（ 1 ）ソルガムに寄生するアブラムシとしては、ヒエノアブラムシのみであった。 8 月中旬のアブラムシ寄生数は抵抗性系統で 0 、感受性系統で約 3, 500 頭、その中間系統で約 30 頭であった。（ 2 ）葉面ワックス量は 3 系統ともほぼ同じであった。（ 3 ）全糖含量は抵抗性、中間系統の方が感受性系統に比べわずかに高い傾向であった。（ 4 ）全遊離アミノ酸含量は抵抗性、中間系統の方が、感受性系統よりも高かった。（ 5 ）これらの結果、葉面ワックス、糖、遊離アミノ酸はソルガムのアブラムシの寄生に影響を及ぼさないようにみえた。二次代謝産物であるデューリン、ベンジルアルコール、パラヒドロキシベンズアルデヒド、アコニット酸等が、ソルガムでのアブラムシの寄生密度を制御していると思われる...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sugarcane</b> <b>aphid,</b> Melanaphis sacchari, is {{emerging}} as a serious pest of sorghum during periods of prolonged drought or low humidity. Host plant resistance can be deployed to minimize the losses due to this pest.

Aphid infestation was lower on 1 st and 2 nd leaves as compared to that on the 5 th and 6 th leaves. Aphid infestation resulted in an 18. 5 - 55. 8 % decrease in total phenol content over the healthy leaves.

40|$|Switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., is a {{perennial}} warm-season grass {{that is a}} model species {{for the development of}} bioenergy crops. However, the sustainability of switchgrass as a bioenergy feedstock will require efforts directed at improved biomass yield under a variety of stress factors. The objectives of this research were to: (1) elucidate greenbug and yellow <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding behavior on resistant and susceptible switchgrasses using electronic penetration graphs (EPG), (2) define transcriptional changes before and during insect feeding through RNA-seq to identify candidate resistance genes in a hybrid switchgrass cultivar, and (3) utilize methods in RNA sequencing of insects to uncover key transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in switchgrass-aphid interactions. Electronic penetration graphs on V 3 switchgrass corroborated previous work detailing greenbug feeding behavior on V 1 grasses. Greenbugs were unable to sustain phloem ingestion on resistant Kanlow plants. However, significant differences were not documented for yellow <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding behavior on V 1 and V 3 switchgrass. Transcriptional changes during insect feeding revealed that both aphids induced remodeling of the transcriptome in the hybrid switchgrass cultivar, KxS. KxS upregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolizing enzymes and downregulated genes in primary metabolism. Downregulation of genes associated with primary metabolism could effectively starve aphids of nutrients and/or direct resources to the production of defense-related metabolites. However, greenbugs and yellow sugarcane aphids induced divergent defense responses, including phytohormone signaling pathways and metabolite expression. KxS plants responded to yellow <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding, but not greenbugs, by inducing genes associated with a flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Characterizing the molecular response of greenbugs and yellow sugarcane aphids revealed an induction of genes associated with carbohydrate synthesis/metabolism on switchgrass, potentially to compensate for insufficient nutritional resources from the plants. Genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism were increased in aphids that had been starved or fed switchgrass, including Cytochrome P 450 s. Moreover, proteases were broadly induced in greenbugs that had feed on switchgrass, presumably to overcome plant protease inhibitors. Together, these studies present critical information for improving our knowledge of the plant-aphid interactions within this system and may help in characterizing specific mechanisms of resistance.

The possibility of identifying genotypes with multiple resistance to these pests and transferring the relevant genes into high-yielding varieties and hybrids has been considered as an attractive approach to reducing yield losses. A set of 12 cytoplasmic male-sterile and maintainer lines, 12 restorer lines and their F 1 hybrids were evaluated for resistance to sorghum shoot fly Atherigona soccata Rondani, spotted stemborer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) and <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) under field conditions.

The A 1 cytoplasm-based hybrids have been reported to be highly susceptible to insect pests (Sharma 2001; Sharma et al. 2004; Dhillon et al. 2006). Therefore, it is important to diversify the CMS systems to safeguard against outbreaks of insect pests and diseases.

Choice studies for S. flava indicated a lack of antixenosis, with no preference by aphids among any of the switchgrass populations at any time point.

No obvious differences were observed for the leaf surfaces between the three populations. Feeding behavior studies for S. graminum on switchgrasses indicated no differences for the time to first probe or time to first sieve element phase among switchgrass populations. However, duration of sieve element phases for S. graminum was significantly less on Kanlow compared to K×S and Summer. S. graminum also had a significantly lower potential phloem ingestion index (PPII) and few aphids showing sustained phloem ingestion on Kanlow as compared to K×S and Summer plants.

Using the current issue of the invasive species, <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> [Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) ] on sorghum, training materials were developed to provide south Texas clientele outreach educational opportunities around identification of the pest and estimating populations, two key skills necessary to manage this pest. Audiences gathered from areas of southern Texas were pre-evaluated in their ability to accomplish these two tasks, then they viewed either the video or slideshow training. Both skills were then re-evaluated to determine learning differences. The numerical trends for both groups suggested improvement off skills. The overall results showed a significant change for the better in the ability of participants who viewed the demonstrational training video to estimate closer to actual pest densities. The same was not found for the slideshow group, though it had a similar trend. Nevertheless, when scores were compared between the two groups there was no significant difference. The value of demonstrational training videos is that they can be viewed multiple times, typically have a shorter viewing time, but they require greater investment from extension personnel. The value of slideshow presentations is that they require minimal investment from extension personnel, but they cannot be easily re-viewed and typically require greater time investment from learners. The results also reveal the tendency of managers to underestimate pest densities and the difficulty of the tasks which are expected of pest managers. Additional training opportunities like hands-on training are warranted to further improve performance...|$|E
40|$|Geographic {{isolation}} plays a {{major role}} in population divergence, but host-plants can also generate selective forces that drive genetic differentiation. Host-plant associations of insects can also be mediated by their associations with microorganisms, some of which are linked to pest status on crops. However, the ecological and evolutionary roles these microorganisms play in plant-insect interactions are not fully understood, neither are their implications for pest management. My dissertation applied an interdisciplinary approach to explore the potential role of microorganisms in plant-insect interactions. Two important agricultural pests, cotton fleahopper (CFH) (Pseudatomoscelis seriatus), a cotton pest, and <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> (Melanaphis sacchari), an invasive pest of sorghum, were used as model organisms in my studies. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) I sampled CFH from 12 host-plants. I found that CFH genotypes are distinct on only 2 out of 12 uncultivated plant species. My results suggest that several uncultivated hosts likely constitute a source of CFH for cotton. To determine whether bacterial symbionts correlated with genetic variation in CFH host-association, I compared bacterial communities within CFH using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. There was no correlation between the two. Although CFH is widely distributed across cotton-growing regions in the U. S., it is considered a major cotton pest only in certain regions while in others it is rarely a pest. I compared bacterial communities within CFH using 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing to test the potential for bacterial symbionts to influence variation in CFH pest status. Results from this bacterial survey failed to find any correlation between variation in pest status of CFH and bacterial community composition. I also explored the roles of potentially beneficial symbiotic fungi (i. e., fungal endophytes) in improving plant development and providing resistance against herbivory. Soaking sorghum seeds in liquid suspensions of two fungal endophytes increased seedling height and fresh biomass. Additionally, I detected that endophyte treatment significantly affected the reproduction and behavior of sugarcane aphids, but performance was conditional on the identity of the endophyte and the part of the plant where aphids were located. Overall, findings from my studies improve our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary implications of plant-microbe-insect interactions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sugarcane</b> <b>aphid</b> Melanaphis sacchari (Zehnt.) {{has become}} a serious pest of sorghum, {{particularly}} during the post-rainy season in India and East and Southern Africa. Therefore, we tested a number of techniques to screen sorghum genotypes for their resistance to M. sacchari. Infesting the plants with aphid-infested leaf cuttings and covering with a nylon net was effective in screening sorghum genotypes for their resistance to M. sacchari. Sprinkling the plants with aphids (filled in an 0. 5 ml eppendorf tube) in the greenhouse was also used to confirm whether the resistance of genotypes selected is less susceptible to the aphids under natural infestation. Nine genotypes (Line 61510, ICSV 12001, ICSV 12002, ICSV 12003, ICSV 12004, ICSV 12005, SLR 41, PU 10 - 1 and DJ 6514) exhibited moderate levels of resistance to M. sacchari. These genotypes also exhibited a lower rate of aphid multiplication in the clip cage and leaf disc assays. The rates of aphid multiplication were lower on the genotypes IS 21807, IS 40615, IS 40616 and IS 40618 than on the susceptible check, Swarna in the clip cage assay under the field conditions. Also, lower rates of aphid increase were also recorded on IS 21807 and IS 40615 in the leaf disc assay under laboratory conditions. Some of the genotypes that exhibited resistance to aphid damage under field conditions showed comparatively higher rates of aphid increase than the susceptible check, Swarna in the clip cage assay, indicating that antixenosis {{could be one of}} the components of resistance to M. sacchari in these genotypes. Therefore, the clip cage assay could be used to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to M. sacchari. There is a need to assess the role of antixenosis and colonization in genotypic reaction against M. sacchari to identify the lines with different mechanisms of resistance to this pest. The results suggested that the nylon net technique could be used to screen sorghum genotypes for resistance to M. sacchari. The genotypes exhibiting resistance to M. sacchari can be used to develop aphid-resistant sorghums for sustainable crop production...|$|E
