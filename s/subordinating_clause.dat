In {{the first chapter}} there is a description of some terms regarding these clauses (infinitive, subordination and coordination, expliciteness and implicitness, congruence of subjects of main and <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> etc.). The second chapter presents a classification {{of all kinds of}} implicite clauses with infinitive, including the restrictions of their formation. The third chapter deals with explicite kinds of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses.</b> The last chapter is more practical, because it is dedicated to the possibilities of translation of the Italian <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> with infinitiv into Czech.

40|$|In this article, {{we aim to}} {{contribute}} to the debate about the use of subordination as a measure of language proficiency. We compare two theories of SLA—specifically, processability theory (PT; Pienemann, 1998) and dynamic systems theory (de Bot, Lowie, & Verspoor, 2007) —and, more particularly, their addressing of the development of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses.</b> Although DST uses measures from the complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) research tradition (see Housen & Kuiken, 2009), PT uses the emergence criterion to describe language development. We will focus on the development of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> and compare how subordination as such is acquired and how the processing procedures related to a specific <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> word order is acquired in the interlanguage (IL) of second language German and Swedish learners. The learners’ language use shows that the use of subordination (as measured by a subordination ratio) fluctuates extensively. From the beginning of data collection, all learners use <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> but their use of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> does not increase linearly over time, which is expected by DST. When focusing on processability and the emergence of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> word order, however, a clear linear developmental sequence can be observed, revealing a clear difference between the nonacquisition and the acquisition of the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> word order rules. Our learner data additionally reveal a different behavior regarding lexical and auxiliary or modal verbs...|$|R

5000|$|In <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> the syntax {{differs from}} that of main <b>clauses.</b> In the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> {{structure}} the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{description}} of three types of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> in Surui: adverbial <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> complement clauses, and quotative clauses. In adverbial and in one type of complement clauses, reflexive forms are used to show coreference with {{the subject of the}} independent clause. This type of complement clause is closely linked with its complementizer, whereas another type is only in loose construction with a demonstrative complementizer. In this paper, we will survey different types of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> in Surui. 1 One of the first things one notices about <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> in Surui is their scarcity: ignoring direct quotations for the moment, only about 11 % of all <b>clauses</b> are <b>subordinate</b> in text count, compared with 34 % in English (Mithun 1984 : 493).

50|$|Sentences can {{be simple}} or compound, {{depending}} on whether they contain just one verb or more than one. In the sentences {{with more than one}} verb, they can be on an equal footing (juxtaposition or coordination), or there may be one main verb and other subordinate ones. Within the main <b>clause,</b> <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> can be the subject and object (direct or prepositional), which in simple sentences are usually expressed by noun phrases. <b>Subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> can also contain other <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R

40|$|Traditional English grammar {{is still}} not clear on how to define and {{classify}} subordinators for finite clauses in that grammarians mix up relative clauses, which are dependent on NPs, and <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> which are dependent on other clauses. And different functions of the markers of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> are not fully investigated. The author of this aritcle found, through comparative studies, that relative clauses should be distinguished from <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> which implies that words introducing relative clauses are not subordinators, and even among the markers of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> some of them, such as before, because and if that indicates condition, are actually prepositions. There leaves a small class of subordinators for finite clauses, namely, that, whether and if that indicates interrogation...|$|R

This work is meant to contribute to the discussion by providing a far-reaching typology of word order change. The results suggest that <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> are indeed conservative, but with nuances...|$|R
40|$|In Amerindian {{languages}} {{and in many}} other agglutinative languages subordination is often a matter of nominalisation.

30|$|Different {{types of}} <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> require {{different}} processing efforts (Nir & Berman 2010), {{due to the}} existence of two distinct types of connection between the main <b>clause</b> and the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b> One type is a logical connection between the main <b>clause</b> and the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b> To this type belong descriptive clauses that reflect material logical relations such as cause, result and condition. Descriptive clauses can indicate a high degree of complexity as long as they reflect material logical relations to the main clauses.
