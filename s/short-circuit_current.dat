First part describes short-circuit types, {{reasons for their}} commencement and also consequences of their functioning. The thesis further shows waveforms of <b>short-circuit</b> <b>currents</b> and its components. A method of calculating <b>short-circuits</b> <b>currents,</b> using the constituent systems and the basic equations for calculating short-circuit impedances are also mentioned here.

25|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are rated}} {{both by the}} normal current that {{they are expected to}} carry, and the maximum <b>short-circuit</b> <b>current</b> that they can safely interrupt. This latter figure is the ampere interrupting capacity (AIC) of the breaker.|$|E
25|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are also}} rated by the maximum fault current {{that they can}} interrupt; this allows use of more economical devices on systems unlikely to develop the high <b>short-circuit</b> <b>current</b> found on, for example, a large commercial building distribution system.|$|E
25|$|Under {{short-circuit}} conditions, {{the calculated}} maximum prospective <b>short-circuit</b> <b>current</b> may be {{many times the}} normal, rated current of the circuit. When electrical contacts open to interrupt a large current, {{there is a tendency}} for an arc to form between the opened contacts, which would allow the current to continue. This condition can create conductive ionized gases and molten or vaporized metal, which can cause further continuation of the arc, or creation of additional short circuits, potentially resulting in the explosion of the circuit breaker and the equipment that it is installed in. Therefore, circuit breakers must incorporate various features to divide and extinguish the arc.|$|E
30|$|To {{illustrate}} the inconsistency of this <b>short-circuit</b> test, <b>short-circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are calculated {{as shown in}} Table  4. It {{is clear that the}} <b>short-circuit</b> <b>currents</b> vary greatly with the formulae; the difference between the maximum and the minimum is up to 1.064 kA, and the unbiased standard deviation is 434.8 A. Thus, the inconsistency of this test can be confirmed. In fact, Ip of this test is up to 42.164 %. To sum up, the proposed index, Ip, is able to comprehensively show the consistency level of the short-circuit measurement and can be used for consistency evaluation.|$|R

2500|$|A high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25°C cell temperature, {{may produce}} 0.60V {{open-circuit}} (VOC). The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25°C air temperature, {{will probably be}} close to 45°C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55V per cell. The voltage drops modestly, {{with this type of}} cell, until the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>current</b> is approached (ISC). Maximum power (with 45°C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the open-circuit voltage (0.43V in this case) and 90% of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>current.</b> This output can be up to 70% of the VOC x ISC product. The <b>short-circuit</b> <b>current</b> (ISC) from a cell is nearly proportional to the illumination, while the open-circuit voltage (VOC) may drop only 10% with an 80% drop in illumination. Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2VOC at 1/2ISC. The usable power output could thus drop from 70% of the VOC x ISC product to 50% or even as little as 25%.

Some fuses are designated High Rupture Capacity (HRC) and are usually filled with sand or a similar material. Fuses for small, low-voltage, usually residential, wiring systems are commonly rated, in North American practice, to interrupt 10,000 amperes. Fuses for commercial or industrial power systems must have higher interrupting ratings, with some low-voltage current-limiting high interrupting fuses rated for 300,000 amperes. Fuses for high-voltage equipment, up to 115,000 volts, are rated by the total apparent power (megavolt-amperes, MVA) of the fault level on the circuit.|$|E

40|$|A general {{method for}} calculating the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of a {{squirrel-cage}} (SCIG) and a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) using crowbar protection is presented. The method {{results in an}} approximate analytic expression that allows calculating the SCIG and DFIG <b>short-circuit</b> <b>currents</b> {{as a function of}} time for symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in the power system. The presented theoretical analysis highlights some important differences between the short-circuit behavior of the SCIG and the DFIG with high crowbar resistance. A comparison with time simulations of the same model shows that the proposed approach leads to results whose accuracy is comparable to those obtained through dynamic simulations and may be sufficient to replace the use of simulations in many contexts, e. g. calculation of maximum current, calculation of its DC and AC components and short-circuit calculations for protection relay settings.
