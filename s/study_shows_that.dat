5|$|A recent <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation {{of the eggs}} in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|The A. sp. is {{from the}} latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, {{although}} a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near {{the coast of the}} Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have distributary channels of sand and terrigenous material.|$|E

25|$|The {{per capita}} {{immigration}} rate to Canada {{has been relatively}} constant since the 1950s, and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada.
