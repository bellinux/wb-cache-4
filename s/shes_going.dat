beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa

tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all IS at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two

cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting

it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at I S my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and

auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round

50|$|In 1926, SH 99 was {{a minimal}} highway from Fort Stockton to San Angelo. By 1933, SH 99 had {{extended}} to Alpine. By 1935, this route {{was transferred to}} SH 10. In 1960, a new route was made for <b>SH</b> 99, <b>going</b> from Denton to the Oklahoma line, replacing the old routing of SH 10. SH 10 then was changed to SH 99 to match OK 99 at its border.

5000|$|Actress Flávia Monteiro, who portrayed Carol in the {{previous}} version, has supported the remake by saying [...] "Im pretty sure that itll be a huge hit. I hope they maintain that magic and sensibility (...). Its essential not to lose all that ludic and joy that existed". Fernanda Souza also demonstrated positive thoughts on the 2013 series, stating that Chiquititas is a beautiful work which children and teenagers are in need. Its innocence is missing". About the portrayal of Mili, she declared, [...] "She was a very special role to me, and Im sure <b>shes</b> <b>going</b> to change her Grigios life as well".|$|E
50|$|Theres no {{chemistry}} between Astrid and the Doctor, she delivers her {{lines with}} a real lack of conviction and thus we never really believe in Astrid as a character. Where Catherine Tates Donna in last years special was overbearing, Kylie Minogues Astrid is hardly there at all. It does make you wonder why casting Kylie {{was regarded as a}} coup. Shes a pop star - of course <b>shes</b> <b>going</b> to say yes to being beamed into millions of homes in the run-up to Christmas. Shes got a duff album to sell. In truth, Kylie should be grateful to Who.|$|E
5000|$|An {{interview}} with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who was originally cast as Rapunzel, reveals {{that at some}} point Rapunzel was intended to be a squirrel. As directors, Greno and Howard felt it essential that Rapunzel resemble a less [...] "passive" [...] heroine than the way she is depicted in the original fairy tale. [...] "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model in a way. We wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesnt wait around for anything ... shes a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and <b>shes</b> <b>going</b> to get what she wants out of life." [...] Tangleds production was surrounded by rumors that it would be Disneys last princess film.|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{received}} some critical comments as well. The Oregonian's reviewer thought the characters were too [...] "extreme," [...] {{felt that the}} narrative took too long to get going, and concluded that Shed's method of communicating in sentence fragments (often missing a verb or subject) difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, while these elements were [...] "irritating", the reviewer concluded: [...] "he exasperation is worth it: There is something triumphant about a novelist who risks this much and manages {{to find his way}} home." [...] The same reviewer also found that some passages might make some readers queasy: [...] "Spanbauer's book, his second novel, is not for the squeamish (or Mormons without a sense of humor). The descriptions of love-making and violence done to the flesh are pretty graphic. Shed is a clear-eyed, unflinching observer, after all; and if someone is going to have her legs amputated, <b>Shed</b> is <b>going</b> to report the dismembering in detail. That makes sense in terms of the character, but it can be heavy going for the sensitive." [...] The Los Angeles Times critic noticed a resemblance between Spanbauer's novel and other novels from several years earlier which attempted to shock with sex and violence, and wondered whether the novel was [...] "irresponsible" [...] in the age of AIDS.|$|R

50|$|The major route {{traveling}} through Cleveland is U.S. Highway 59, {{soon to be}} renamed Interstate 69, traveling southwest towards Houston and north east into East Texas, to have interstate 69 come through Cleveland, all intersections {{would need to be}} removed and frontage roads will be built to the side so it could be upgraded to interstate standards because at grade intersections with other roads are prohibited on interstate highways. U.S. 59 goes through the cities of Livingston, Lufkin, and Nacogdoches, and onward to Texarkana, Texas. US 59 is designated as the TTC-I-69 Corridor. U.S. Highway 59 Business is the original route of US 59, which runs north and south through the center of Cleveland, known locally as Washington Avenue and Loop 573. A current limited access bypass for US 59 was created due to traffic densities in downtown Cleveland that rivaled those of many large cities. SH 105 travels east and west, and Cleveland is roughly the halfway point between Beaumont and Navasota. SH 105 runs concurrently with SH 321 until <b>SH</b> 105 splits, <b>going</b> eastbound to Beaumont; while SH 321 continues roughly 20 mi further south into Dayton. Construction was recently completed on a loop coming off SH 105 near Pin Oak Road, along the southern side of Cleveland, crossing I 69 and FM 1010, and terminating at SH 321 near New Salem Road.|$|R

5000|$|Martin-Green {{received}} much praise for her {{performance in the}} fifth season, particularly the second half. On his review for the episode [...] "Them", Ron Hogan for Den of Geek felt Sonequa Martin-Green delivered the best performance of the episode. For the episode [...] "Forget", he felt that Sashas breakdown at the party of Alexandria served as the episodes highlight. He said: [...] "A few days ago, she was eating beans out of a can; now shes {{at a dinner party}} with people eating potato puffs off little plastic swords and drinking beer like theres nothing happening just beyond those corrugated steel walls. But there is. Sasha knows this, and Sonequa Martin-Green plays this perfectly." [...] He went further to say, [...] "I understand what <b>shes</b> <b>going</b> through completely, and her lashing out makes perfect sense, both in ferocity and in timing." [...] He also felt that the direction complimented Martin-Greens performance. Matt Fowler for IGN also felt the scene involving Sasha was a highlight.|$|E
5000|$|The series {{develops}} relationship triangles: some love triangles, others {{designed to}} catch characters in [...] "philosophical debates". Kreisberg provides one such example: [...] "Every week, Oliver will be facing a bad guy, {{but the truth}} is, his real nemesis is Detective Lance, whos trying to bring him into justice.... His daughter {{is going to be}} caught in the middle, because she loves and respects her father, and shes always believed in what he believed, but at the same time, <b>shes</b> <b>going</b> to see this dark urban legend out there thats actually doing a lot of good; the kind of good that she wants to be doing in her role as a legal aid attorney." [...] Learning from previous experiences working in television, the producers worked early on identifying the major story arcs for the series, specifically the first season, including [...] "mapping out" [...] how to accomplish them. Taking inspiration from Christopher Nolans Batman film series, the creative team decided to [...] "put it all out there" [...] and [...] "not hold back" [...] from episode to episode.|$|E
5000|$|Martin {{continued}} his review in part two, where he lauded {{the writing of}} Sinons backstory and sufferance of PTSD as [...] "masterful", writing [...] "The way she falls apart even in her Sinon persona {{when faced with a}} particular stressor is quite credible, as is the way she struggles to cope with her crushing fear; she is desperately afraid to die, but even more afraid of living with the fear ... It almost seems like a deliberate message is being sent to the audience, and the way she finally finds her resolve and fights back when her life is in serious jeopardy is heartening." [...] He also praised Michelle Ruffs voice acting in the English dub. Anime News Networks Rebecca Silverman also praised Sinons portrayal, noting her to be [...] "a much more interesting character" [...] than both Kirito or Asuna, as [...] "what makes Sinon a more successful character than any to previously appear in the main series is that she has more depth. Rather than being just a scared or traumatized character, shes someone who is actively working to change herself ... it feels like this is a turning point for Kawaharas writing skill. Sinon isnt perfectly depicted, but <b>shes</b> got more <b>going</b> on than previous characters." [...] Sam of The Otakus Study similarly noted how Sinon already established herself as [...] "one of the most developed Sword Art Online characters" [...] despite appearing in only 7 episodes thus far, praising her backstory and contrast between her in-game and out-of-game personas.|$|R
5000|$|Chris {{was arrested}} for murder but {{eventually}} released, and the relationship suffered, with Bloomfield explaining: [...] "Rachel feels confused because she naively assumed everything {{would go back to}} normal post prison. And even though she knows it cant, its her way of coping ... Its more about not recognizing Chris because hes changed and that scares her." [...] Following Chris brain injury in 2013, the couple were at odds following an apparent personality change in Chris, Bloomfield explained, [...] "Rachel realises she has to start to get on board with Chriss new way of thinking. But everything he is doing is completely the opposite of what hed usually do. Rachel finds it really hard to relate to this new Chris ... Rachel thinks its fine for Chris to let his new ideas loose at home and she needs to accept that." [...] Chris suggested the couple have a baby, but according to Bloomfield, Rachel thought it was, [...] "a stupid idea. She cant have children and she doesnt want them. She had a terrible upbringing and isnt prepared to risk raising a child." [...] Instead Chris proposed to Rachel to which she declined, Bloomfield believed the two could work it out, [...] "I think love will prevail for the pair of them, but Rachels still going to be herself. <b>Shes</b> not <b>going</b> to change for him. Shes making a choice to love him regardless of hows hes changed." [...] However, following a talk from Grace Kwan (Lynette Forday), Rachel herself proposed to Chris, to which he accepted. Only moments later, a bomb rigged by Josh Gallagher (Chris Tempest) under the influence of his hero syndrome, exploded, collapsing the deck underneath the couple and leaving their fate ambiguous as the season ended. The two characters survived the cliffhanger but Galvin noted the road to marriage was going to be [...] "problematic" [...] as, [...] "Rachels a bit contemptuous of the idea of marriage, but .... Chris is fully into that sentimental idea of getting it put in writing". Bloomfield was surprised at the story liners decision to marry Rachel and Chris due to her previous resignation from the show as a result of Rachels no marriage sentiment, but was told that Rachel would go along with the marriage, [...] "to be with him and that means going along with what he wants." [...] Both Galvin and Bloomfield believed the intention of the marriage was to secure a long running relationship on the show and Bloomfield believed if they were to break up, it would be a [...] "bad pay-off" [...] to fans. The wedding episode aired in February 2014 with Harry serving as Chris best man and Harper (Ria Vandervis) acting as Rachels bridesmaid. Bloomfield enjoyed the way Rachel was engaged in the storyline, [...] "The whole premise of this storyline is that Rachel has never wanted to be a bride, never needed or wanted to get married. So when she finally concedes, shes the anti-bride. She goes Im not wearing white, Im not doing this or that." [...] Galvin believed the wedding episode dealt with very little drama as producers wanted one marriage that was, [...] "happy". Galvin also believed Chris and Rachels marriage was Chris most believable, due to he and Bloomfields long lasting friendship. In late 2014 the couple broke up following the revelation Chris knew his baby daughter had not miscarried. Rachel began an affair with Garrett Whitley (Spencer Falls) but Galvin believed Chris was determined to win her back, [...] "He has decided that Rachel is the great love of his life and, for that reason he .... is convinced if he just preserves for long enough she will come to her senses and fall into his arms." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{final three}} girls learn all about charity {{and will have}} to go on the streets of Hollywood Boulevard to collect items such as pens, tampons, etc. from the people walking by and whoever gets the most profit from the items donated would be safe from expulsion. Because this {{challenge}} is tougher for one person, theres a twist to this challenge: each girl will be teamed up with their former enemy from the past. Lacey is paired up with Heather, Brandi M. is paired up with Megan, and Destiney is paired up with Brandi C. During the challenge, Megan cheats and puts the donated items in Laceys basket instead of Brandi M.s and when she gets caught, Brandi M. only puts some of the items in the correct basket, and realizes <b>shes</b> <b>going</b> to have to do all the work on her own. Megan also accepted many donated items and left them behind and only collected the cheapest item on the list, pens. Lacey and Heather start off strong, but after getting rejected by many of the people, Lacey yells at one lady, accusing her of not caring about homeless people and gains a lot of negative attention.

5000|$|On January 12, 2012, The CW was {{preparing}} {{a new series}} centered around the character Green Arrow, developed by Andrew Kreisberg, Greg Berlanti and Marc Guggenheim. A week later, the series, now known as Arrow, was ordered to pilot, which was directed by David Nutter, who also directed the pilot for Smallville, a series following Clark Kent on his journey to become Superman. At {{the end of the}} month, Stephen Amell was cast in the titular role of Oliver Queen. When developing the series, producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to [...] "chart their own course, their own destiny", and avoid any direct connections to Smallville, which featured its own Green Arrow/Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), opting to cast a new actor in the role of Oliver Queen. Unlike with Smallville, the series does not initially feature super-powered heroes and villains. Instead, the creative still took inspiration from Smallville, as one of the main themes of Arrow was to [...] "look at the humanity" [...] of Oliver Queen, as Smallville had done with Clark Kent. The decision not to include superpowers was, in part, based on the executives desire to take a realistic look at the characters in this universe. The series was given a full season pick up on October 22, 2012. [...] "I think the idea is to—not all the time, and not with a set regularity—but I think it is critical to explore how he went from the person that he was when he left the island—which is extremely different: hes spoiled, hes entitled, hes a bit of a jerk—and he comes off it something very, very different. So were going to explore how he gets there." [...] —Stephen Amell on the use of flashback storytelling.

Kreisberg provides one such example: [...] "Every week, Oliver will be facing a bad guy, but the truth is, his real nemesis is Detective Lance, whos trying to bring him into justice.... His daughter is going to be caught in the middle, because she loves and respects her father, and shes always believed in what he believed, but at the same time, <b>shes</b> <b>going</b> to see this dark urban legend out there thats actually doing a lot of good; the kind of good that she wants to be doing in her role as a legal aid attorney." [...] Learning from previous experiences working in television, the producers worked early on identifying the major story arcs for the series, specifically the first season, including [...] "mapping out" [...] how to accomplish them. Taking inspiration from Christopher Nolans Batman film series, the creative team decided to [...] "put it all out there" [...] and [...] "not hold back" [...] from episode to episode.|$|E
