5|$|In 1906 a major {{explosion}} at a colliery in Courri√®res, northern France, caused {{the deaths of}} more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes {{to the health and}} <b>safety</b> <b>culture,</b> the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E

40|$|Objective: An {{electronic}} Incident Information Management System implemented system-wide by the Department of Health, New South Wales, Australia was evaluated. We {{hypothesized that}} health professionals (i) {{would support the}} system via utilization and favourable attitudes and (ii) that their usage and attitudes would vary according to profession with nurses being most, and doctors least, favourably disposed. Design, setting and participants: An online, anonymous questionnaire survey of 2185 health practitioners. Main outcome measures: Undertaking system training, satisfaction with training, reporting incidents, incident reporting rates since system introduction and attitude questions focusing on use, security and evaluation {{of the system and}} workplace <b>safety</b> <b>cultures.</b> Results: The first hypothesis received partial support. The majority of respondents had undertaken training and rated it highly. Most had reported incidents and maintained their previous reporting levels. Most attitudes regarding using the system and its security were favourable. Mixed attitudes were held about workplace <b>safety</b> <b>cultures</b> and the value of the system. Deficiencies in quality of reporting, feedback on incident reports and resources to analyse incident data were problems identified. The second hypothesis was confirmed. Nurses were most, and doctors least, likely to undertake training, report incidents and express favourable attitudes. Allied health responses were intermediate to those of the other professions. Conclusions: The system implementation was relatively successful, but more so with some professions. Problems identified indicated that expectations as to the goals achievable in the short term were optimistic, but these are amenable to planned interventions. 8 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|In 1997, Indian Point Unit 3 {{was removed}} from the NRC's list of plants that receive {{increased}} attention from the regulator. An engineer for the NRC noted that the plant had been experiencing increasingly fewer problems during inspections. On March 10, 2009 the Indian Point Power Plant was awarded the fifth consecutive top safety rating for annual operations by the Federal regulators. According to the Hudson Valley Journal News, the plant had shown substantial improvement in its <b>safety</b> <b>culture</b> in the previous two years. A 2003 report commissioned by then-Governor George Pataki concluded that the [...] "current radiological response system and capabilities are not adequate to...protect the people from an unacceptable dose of radiation {{in the event of a}} release from Indian Point". More recently, in December 2012 Entergy commissioned a 400-page report on the estimates of evacuation times. This report, performed by emergency planning company KLD Engineering, concluded that the existing traffic management plans provided by Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester Counties are adequate and require no changes. According to one list that ranks U.S. nuclear power plants by their likelihood of having a major natural disaster related incident, Indian Point is the most likely to be hit by a natural disaster, mainly an earthquake.

Students from different backgrounds may differ in their perceptions towards patient safety. We investigated whether and how patient <b>safety</b> <b>cultures</b> may differ between students from different countries. We used a validated instrument, the ‚ÄòAttitudes to Patient Safety Questionnaire (APSQ) -III‚Äô, to study two cohorts of second-year medical students from Singapore (SG) and Hong Kong (HK). None had received any previous teaching on patient safety. The APSQ-III consisted of 26 items covering nine key patient safety factors. The responders included 81 (31. 3 %) students from HK and 178 (68. 7 %) from SG. The overall response rate was 66. 4 %. Significant differences were found in two key factors ‚Äì students from HK were more likely to report having more patient safety training (P = 0. 007) whereas SG students reported less confidence in error disclosure (P < 0. 001). Both groups considered medical error as inevitable, and that long working hours and professional incompetence were important causes of medical errors. The importance of patient involvement and team functioning received relatively less emphasis. In summary, The APSQ-III could identify differences in patient <b>safety</b> <b>cultures</b> and possibly teaching needs amongst students from different medical schools. Students with no prior teaching on the subject may differ in their self-efficacy possibly due to underlying differences between their local cultures and healthcare environments.
