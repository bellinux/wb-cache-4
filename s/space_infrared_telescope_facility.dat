40|$|The {{response}} of the <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility's</b> attitude control system to a nod command is studied under {{a wide variety of}} conditions. Several engineering issues are explored: the effects of variations in the structural model, relocation of sensors and actuators, the influence of the fine guidance sensor sampling period, resolution and noise on the system response, torque and rate integrating gyro noise and disturbances.

40|$|Reflective baffles are {{proposed}} to reject off-axis light entering a telescope. Toroidal surfaces and adjacent cones are positioned so that off-axis rays make multiple reflections {{between these two}} surfaces. Meridional rays are reflected approximately parallel to the entering direction. Skew rays are reflected obliquely, but leave the telescope aperture. The range of incident angles for which these reflections are obtained is approximately 45 deg. A system is described that is designed specifically for the <b>Space</b> Shuttle <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (SIRTF). Because of its reflective properties, the proposed baffle system rejects about 90 deg of the heat load from the SIRTF sunshade that would be absorbed in systems of conventional black baffles...|$|R
5000|$|The Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) {{observes the}} {{infrared}} spectrum. It {{was launched in}} 2003 aboard a Delta II rocket into an earth-trailing solar orbit; {{it was called the}} <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (SIRTF) before launch. Depletion of its onboard liquid helium coolant in 2009 reduced its functionality significantly, leaving it with only two short-wavelength imaging modules.|$|E
5000|$|The {{success of}} IRAS lead to {{interest}} in the 1985 Infrared Telescope (IRT) mission on the Space Shuttle, and the planned Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility which eventually transformed into the <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility,</b> SIRTF, which in turn was developed into the Spitzer Space Telescope, launched in 2003. [...] The success of early infrared space astronomy led to further missions, such as the Infrared Space Observatory (1990s) and the Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS instrument.|$|E

30|$|The {{interstellar}} extinction law {{is one of}} {{the primary}} sources of information about the interstellar grain population, and one often obtains direct information on the composition of interstellar dust from spectral features in extinction (Draine, 2003). These spectral features also provide strong constraints on interstellar grain models. With the advent of ground-based and <b>space</b> borne <b>infrared</b> (IR) <b>telescope</b> <b>facilities,</b> the IR extinction continuum and absorption features have been receiving increasing attention and play an essential role in recovering the intrinsic energy distribution of celestial objects and inferring the characteristics of interstellar dust.|$|R
40|$|On 1998 November 14, Saturn and its rings occulted {{the star}} GSC 0622 - 00345. We {{observed}} atmospheric immersion with NSFCAM at the National Aeronautics and <b>Space</b> Administration's <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Immersion occurred at 55. 5 ∘ S planetocentric latitude. A 2. 3 μm, methane-band filter suppressed reflected sunlight. Atmospheric emersion and ring {{data were not}} successfully obtained. We describe our observation, light-curve production, and timing techniques, including improvements in aperture positioning, removal of telluric scintillation effects, and timing. Many of these techniques are known within the occultation community, but have not been described in the reviewed literature. We present a light curve whose signal-to-noise ratio per scale height is 267, among the best ground-based signals yet achieved, despite a disadvantage of up to 8 mag in the stellar flux compared to prior work.

5000|$|The {{launch of}} the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, an Explorer-class {{satellite}} designed to conduct the first infrared survey of the sky led to anticipation of an instrument using new infrared detector technology. By September 1983 NASA was considering the [...] "possibility of a long duration free-flyer SIRTF mission." [...] The 1985 Spacelab-2 flight aboard STS-51-F confirmed the Shuttle environment was not well suited to an onboard infrared telescope, and a free-flying design was better. The first word of the name was changed from Shuttle {{so it would be}} called the <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, astronomers began to {{consider}} the possibility of placing an infrared telescope above the obscuring effects of Earth's atmosphere.In 1979, a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s, identified a <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (SIRTF) as [...] "one of two major astrophysics facilities be developed for Spacelab", a Shuttle-borne platform.

50|$|Later, NASA {{designated}} IPAC as the U.S. science support {{center for}} the European Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), which ceased operations in 1998. About that same time, IPAC was designated as the science {{center for the}} <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (SIRTF) -- renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope after launch. IPAC also assumed the lead role in various other infrared space missions, including the Wide-field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) and the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX). IPAC also expanded its support to include ground-based missions with the assumption of science support responsibilities for the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), a near-infrared survey of the entire sky conducted by twin observatories in the Northern and Southern hemispheres.|$|E
50|$|Brotherton's {{specialty}} is studying supermassive black {{holes in the}} centers of galaxies and how they shine when in their active phase. Brotherton's research seeks to improve our understanding of active galactic nuclei {{and their relationship to}} host galaxies, and their mutual evolution. His work is primarily observational in nature, the bulk of which rests on optical and infrared spectroscopy. He uses a wide assortment of telescopes/observatories operating across the electromagnetic spectrum including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), the Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> the <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility,</b> and the Very Large Array, and optical telescopes including Keck, Lick, and Kitt Peak. He works both on large samples that enable the phenomenology to be explored for an entire active galactic nuclei population, as well as individual objects of special interest that may reveal important physics because of their extreme nature.|$|R
40|$|At {{the cloud}} top level of Venus (65 - 70 km altitude) the {{atmosphere}} rotates 60 {{times faster than}} the underlying surface, a phenomenon known as superrotation. Whereas on Venus's dayside the cloud top motions are well determined and Venus general circulation models predict a mean zonal flow at the upper clouds similar on both day and nightside, the nightside circulation remains poorly studied except for the polar region. Here we report global measurements of the nightside circulation at the upper cloud level. We tracked individual features in thermal emission images at 3. 8 and 5. 0 μ m obtained between 2006 and 2008 by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS-M) onboard Venus Express and in 2015 by ground-based measurements with the Medium-Resolution 0. 8 - 5. 5 Micron Spectrograph and Imager (SpeX) at the National Aeronautics and <b>Space</b> Administration <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (NASA/IRTF). The zonal motions range from - 110 to - 60 m s^- 1, consistent with those found for the dayside but with larger dispersion. Slow motions (- 50 to - 20 m s^- 1) were also found and remain unexplained. In addition, abundant stationary wave patterns with zonal speeds from - 10 to + 10 m s^- 1 dominate the night upper clouds and concentrate over the regions of higher surface elevation.

40|$|The {{identification}} of planetary companions around the nearby millisecond radio pulsar PSR B 1257 + 12 implies that planetary formation {{has occurred in}} the past evolutionary history of this system. If planetary formation is common around millisecond pulsars and if it occurs by coalescence of small dust particles within a protoplanetary disk, as is thought to have occurred during the formation of the Solar System, then {{it may be possible to}} detect the presence of protoplanetary dust or a remnant debris disk via thermal infrared emission. We summarize an attempt to detect this emission via a series of 10 ¯m observations made toward PSR B 1257 + 12 and four other nearby millisecond pulsars using the National Aeronautics and <b>Space</b> Administration (NASA) <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (IRTF) 3 -meter <b>telescope</b> and the <b>facility</b> bolometer. We also present a model for thermal emission from a protoplanetary disk containing grains heated from the pulsar spin-down luminosity. Further, we describe possible sp [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Infrared {{light can}} {{penetrate}} the cosmic dust clouds, {{allowing us to}} peer into regions of star formation and the centers of galaxies. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope is the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space. The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility)</b> was launched into space by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003. During its mission, Spitzer will obtain images and spectra by detecting the infrared energy, or heat, radiated by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 micrometres. Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. The findings from the Spitzer already revitalized the studies of cosmic dust. A recent report from a Spitzer team shows some evidence that cosmic dust is formed near a supermassive black hole.|$|E
50|$|Wright {{takes an}} {{interest}} in infrared astronomy and cosmology. He has studied fractal dust grains which are able to absorb and emit efficiently at millimeter wavelengths, and other aspects that may be important factors in drawing secrets from the cosmic microwave background. As an interdisciplinary scientist on the <b>Space</b> <b>InfraRed</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (SIRTF) Science Working Group, Wright has worked on the SIRTF project (renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope) since 1976. He was {{an active member of}} the teams working on the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) since 1978. He is the principal investigator of the Wide field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) project. Wright is also a member of the current science team on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), which was launched in June 2001. WMAP is a mission to follow up the COBE discovery of early fluctuations in the developing Universe.|$|E
5000|$|Low {{was named}} to serve as {{facility}} scientist for NASA's <b>Space</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility,</b> later renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope. The effort had been delayed by cost overruns, until Low had an inspiration at a 1993 retreat for the project's scientists; the passive cooling technique could be used - rather than place the entire telescope in a bath of liquid helium to cool the unit to temperatures near absolute zero, the unit could {{be exposed to the}} vacuum of space to radiate most of its heat while the detectors themselves were the only components cooled using liquid helium, a design change that allowed the Spitzer project to go ahead towards its launch in 2003. [...] Timothy Hawarden has been recognized by NASA {{for the development of the}} passive cooling technique, which has also been included in other space probes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, a partial successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that will search for the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
40|$|Irregular {{satellites}} of Jupiter {{with their}} highly eccentric, inclined and distant orbits suggest that their capture took place {{just before the}} giant planet migration. We aim to improve {{our understanding of the}} surface composition of irregular satellites of Jupiter to gain insight into a narrow time window when our Solar System was forming. We observed three Jovian irregular satellites, Himalia, Elara, and Carme, using a medium-resolution 0. 8 - 5. 5 micro m spectrograph on the National Aeronautics and <b>Space</b> Administration (NASA) <b>Infrared</b> <b>Telescope</b> <b>Facility</b> (IRTF). Using a linear spectral unmixing model we have constrained the major mineral phases on the surface of these three bodies. Our results confirm that the surface of Himalia, Elara, and Carme are dominated by opaque materials such as those seen in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Our spectral modeling of NIR spectra of Himalia and Elara confirm that their surface composition is the same and magnetite is the dominant mineral. A comparison of the spectral shape of Himalia with the two large main C-type asteroids, Themis (D 176 km) and Europa (D 352 km), suggests surface composition similar to Europa. The NIR spectrum of Carme exhibits blue slope up to 1. 5 microm and is spectrally distinct from those of Himalia and Elara. Our model suggests that it is compositionally similar to amorphous carbon. Himalia and Elara are compositionally similar but differ significantly from Carme. These results support the hypotheses that the Jupiter irregular satellites are captured bodies that were subject to further breakup events and clustered as families based on their similar physical and surface compositions...|$|R
