2500|$|Velox was not {{a success}} in service, {{partly due to the}} very high fuel consumption. This was not helped {{by the fact that the}} {{cruising}} engines could only drive the ship at [...] which was less than the cruising speed of the fleet. Other problems included <b>slow</b> <b>astern</b> speeds (about [...] only) together with an inability to quickly change the engines to run astern and problems associated with the location of the condensers. The cruising engines were replaced by cruising turbines in 1907.|$|E
40|$|Upon berthing, delayed {{main engine}} {{movements}} due to malfunctioning control unit card. Dead <b>slow</b> <b>astern</b> and dead slow achieved after 30 seconds delay. Vessel berthed without incident. with tug assistance. 20 / 06 / 2015 MA 201500083 2 : 37 UTC+ 8 No Port Hedland Golden Queen IMO No 9497359 Equipment failure On approach to port under pilotage, main engine over speed activated when {{an increase of}} rpm was requested as the vessel passed through shallow water. Main engine rpm reduced, engine fired and vessel proceeded safely to berth without further incident. 22 / 06 / 2015 MA 201500084 22 : 15 UTC+ 10 No Risdon, Tasmania Kuniang IMO No 9481623 Equipment failure After departure from berth under pilotage, main engine set to full ahead, 6. 3 kts and 125 revs. At 0. 7 nm from the Tasman Bridge, speed suddenly reduced to 5. 4 kts and 85 revs due to low level main engine lubrication alarm. Due to proximity to the bridge, vessel was swung and returned to berth without further incident...|$|E
40|$|On {{approach}} to berth under pilotage, main engine was stopped and slow ahead was ordered. However the main engine {{was put to}} <b>slow</b> <b>astern,</b> the pilot immediately noticed and requested the main engine to be stopped and put to slow ahead. After approx. 15 seconds the order was complied with. The ship berthed safely without further incident. 17 / 06 / 2015 MA 201500081 10 : 20 UTC+ 9 No Port Giles Ocean Maple IMO No 9624172 Serious injury During inspection of cargo holds, the chief officer, rested {{his hand on the}} hinge bar of an opening hatch cover. He sustained crush injuries to his hand and fingers and landed ashore for further treatment. Note: For the purpose of subsection 49 (2) of the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 (TSI Act) any On-Board Recordings (OBR) relating to a matter that the ATSB has decided not to investigate, as identified in this publication, are not to be treated as OBR on and after the date of publication of this weekly summary. Section 48 of the TSI Act contains a definition of an OBR. The voice component of a Voyage Data Recorder normally meets the requirements of an OBR. Part 6 Division 1 of the TSI Act provides for certain confidentiality protections which must be applied to OBR. When an OBR is declared not to be an OBR other protections may continue to apply such as thos...|$|E
2500|$|When the Japanese ship <b>slowed</b> <b>astern,</b> Lent came to [...] {{and fired}} four Mark XIV torpedoes – all his stern tubes, the first American {{submarine}} torpedo shots of World War II – on sonar bearings (in keeping with prewar doctrine). He heard a dull explosion 58 seconds later and believed one torpedo had hit, {{then went to}} [...] and cleared the area. (No sinking was recorded, and Lent was not credited with one.) After their initial repulse on December 11, the Japanese returned with two aircraft carriers, Hiryū and Sōryū; {{thanks in part to}} the confusion at Pearl Harbor, Lent was not informed, and Triton made no attacks on them, so any chance to delay or prevent the invasion was lost, as was a chance (always exceedingly rare) of sinking or damaging a Japanese aircraft carrier. Neither did he make any effort to evacuate the 350 Marines. On December 21, he was ordered to return to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on December 31.|$|R
50|$|Assigned to Submarine Division 62, Triton made a {{training}} cruise to Midway from 30 August to 15 September, then participated in local and fleet {{operations in the}} Hawaiian area. On 19 November, the submarine headed west to conduct a practice war patrol and arrived off Wake Island on 26 November. On 8 December, she saw columns of smoke rising over the island but assumed it was caused by construction work being done ashore. That night, when she surfaced to charge her batteries, she was informed by radio Wake that Pearl Harbor had been bombed and was ordered {{to stay out of}} range of Wake's guns. The next morning, Triton observed the Japanese bombing the island. On the night of 10 December, she was surfaced, charging her batteries, when flashes of light from Wake revealed a destroyer or light cruiser on a parallel course. The submarine was silhouetted against the moon, and the enemy ship turned towards her. Triton went deep and began evasive action. When the Japanese ship <b>slowed</b> <b>astern,</b> the submarine came to 120 ft and fired four stern torpedoes—the first American torpedoes shot during World War II—on sonar bearings. She heard a dull explosion 58 seconds later and believed one had hit the target, then went to 175 ft and cleared the area. (No sinking was recorded, and she was not credited with one.) After their initial repulse on 11 December, the Japanese returned with two aircraft carriers, Hiryū and Sōryū; Triton was not informed, and made no attacks on them. Neither did she make any effort to evacuate the 350 Marines. On 21 December, the submarine was ordered to return to Hawaii, and she arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 31 December.|$|R
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the <b>slower</b> boats. <b>Astern</b> of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|R
40|$|While {{the ship}} was at sea, a crewmember was scalded on the legs when a pot of boiling soup spilled. He was treated on board and then taken to {{hospital}} when the ship arrived in Port Hedland. He was treated in theatre and required skin grafts. 25 / 08 / 2015 MA 201500111 19 : 07 UTC+ 10 No Chapman Island Coral Knight IMO No 9696280 Machinery failure While approaching Chapman Island, Coral Knight needed to be slowed from 6 knots to 2 knots. Both main engines were put to Dead <b>Slow</b> <b>Astern</b> and stalled. They were restarted 2 minutes later. 29 / 08 / 2015 MA 201500112 2 : 50 UTC+ 10 No Keeper Reef STI Regina IMO No 9686728 Machinery failure While transiting the Great Barrier Reef, en route to Mackay, STI Regina had to stop for main engine repairs.

The master noticed the helmsman had maintained 25 ° of starboard helm. Midships was ordered and the decision taken to complete a round turn and re-enter the channel. The ship continued to berth without further incident. 29 / 08 / 2015 MA 201500109 19 : 54 UTC+ 10 No Prince of Wales Channel RTM Flinders IMO No 9629732 Equipment failure At 1930, while transiting the Prince of Wales Channel, RTM Flinders had to anchor to investigate a high temperature in the jacket cooling water system.

60|$|He moved, {{climbing}} high up, disappearing low down, with a restless, purposeful industry, {{and when}} he stood still, holding the guard-rail {{in front of the}} starting-gear, he would keep glancing to the right at the steam-gauge, at the water-gauge, fixed upon the white wall in the light of a swaying lamp. The mouths of two speaking-tubes gaped stupidly at his elbow, and the dial of the engine-room telegraph resembled a clock of large diameter, bearing on its face curt words instead of figures. The grouped letters stood out heavily black, around the pivot-head of the indicator, emphatically symbolic of loud exclamations: AHEAD, <b>ASTERN,</b> <b>SLOW,</b> Half, STAND BY; and the fat black hand pointed downwards to the word FULL, which, thus singled out, captured the eye as a sharp cry secures attention.|$|R
