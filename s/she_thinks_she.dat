Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present.

Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat.

Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation.

500|$|In {{order to}} become the {{character}} of Dot Cotton, Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot's 1950s [...] "Italian Boy" [...] hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985. Although Brown now wears a wig, for many years the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress. Brown has stated {{that as soon as}} Dot's hairpiece is on, she becomes the character. The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers, that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth, the producers refused to allow it, arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping. Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose. Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered. She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985.

[...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her.
