40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes two dynamic capital allocation {{methods of}} hedging foreign exchange risks of payables denominated in foreign currencies. One strategy is <b>synthetic</b> call <b>option</b> strategy based on currency pricing formula; the other strategy is constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategy based on linear rule. Monte Carlo simulation {{is used to}} test the performance of the strategies. For <b>synthetic</b> call <b>option</b> strategy, the effect of changing initial wealth on saving performance and hedging performance is revealed. I find that increasing initial wealth can improve both saving performance and hedging performance of <b>synthetic</b> call <b>option</b> strategy. For CPPI strategy, extensive combinations of initial wealth cases and multiples are tested. I find that different multiples change the distribution pattern of CPPI strategy dramatically. In general, bigger multiples will reduce the hedging performance but as long as the multiple is smaller than 21, the floor level can always be protected. Because of effect of changing multiples on saving performance of CPPI is complicated, I propose saving premium at risk and minimum saving ratio to seek the optimal multiple for each initial wealth case. The performance comparisons between <b>synthetic</b> call <b>option</b> strategy and CPPI strategy show that CPPI strategy dominates the competitor in terms of hedging performance while <b>synthetic</b> call <b>option</b> strategy has better saving performance on average. I find that the CPPI strategy is more attractive to hedgers if foreign currency is expected to appreciate while the <b>synthetic</b> call <b>option</b> strategy is more attractive if foreign currency is expected to depreciate. I propose a method to improve the hedging performance of <b>synthetic</b> call <b>option</b> strategy and find that it cannot be used if initial wealth is not sufficient enough...|$|R

40|$|The {{market for}} equity options and related {{derivatives}} is staggering, covering {{trillions of dollars}} worth of assets. As a result, the taxation of these instruments is inherently important. Moreover, the importance is made even more acute by the use of options in creating more complex transactions and in avoiding taxes. Consider an equity call option, which entitles, but does not obligate, its holder to buy stock at a set price at a set time in the future. Option theory gives us a way to break the option down into more fundamental units. For example, an equity call option over 10, 000 shares of stock might be equivalent to buying 7500 shares of stock itself. This financially equivalent <b>synthetic</b> <b>option</b> should serve as the model for taxing an actual option. That is not the approach of current law. Nevertheless, a Monte-Carlo simulation I wrote shows that current law does a good job of approximating the tax liability generated by the <b>synthetic</b> <b>option</b> - but only when we view the option in isolation. The results are radically different when the investor already owns some of the stock subject to the option. If such an investor sells (rather than buys) a call option, she has effectively sold a portion of the owned stock at fair market value. For example, the issuer of a call option over 10, 000 shares may have effectively sold 7500 shares that she already owns. Option theory gives us a way to measure how much stock she has effectively sold. Taxing the sale of stock implied by many option and related contracts would reflect economic reality and curtail tax-motivated investments...|$|E

This paper examines whether forwards performs better than over-the-counter option for a New Zealand exporter in hedging NZD/USD transaction exposure.

Muller and Ward (2013) have done extensive research into the efficiency of various equity styles on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), and made a meaningful contribution to the topic in the South Africa arena by using a sophisticated style engine and good quality data to prove the effectiveness of certain styles in outperforming the JSE All Share Index. This research builds on Muller and Ward’s methodology by combining the style-based investment approach {{with the concept of}} portfolio insurance, using synthetic replication of a put option over the style-based portfolio to provide protection. We found that the application of synthetic portfolio insurance is effective in lessening the effect of market downturns, and that optimising the desired level and time period of protection can lead to outperformance of the unprotected style-based portfolio as the implied cost of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>option</b> is negated by the avoidance of large downturns in the market.

40|$|This thesis investigates a {{methodology}} for quantification of model risk in option pricing. A set of different pricing models is specified and each model is assigned a probability weight {{based on the}} Akaike Information Criteria. It is then possible to obtain a price distribution of an exotic derivative from these probability weights. Two measures of model risk inspired by the regulatory standards on prudent valuation are proposed based on this methodology. The model risk measures are studied for different equity options which are priced using a set of stochastic volatility models, with and without jumps. The models are calibrated to vanilla call options from the S&P 500 index, {{as well as to}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>option</b> prices based on market data simulated using the Bates model. For comparable options, the model risk is higher for up-and-out barrier options compared to vanilla, digital and Asian options. Moreover, the model risk measure, in relative terms of option price, increases quickly with strike level for call options far out of the money, while the model risk in absolute terms is lowest when the option is deep out of the money. The model risk for up-and-out barrier options tends to be higher when the barrier is closer to the spot price, although the increase in risk {{does not have to be}} monotonic with decreasing barrier level. The methodology is flexible and easy to implement, yielding intuitive results. How-ever, it is sensitive to different assumptions in the structure of the pricing errors...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 50 's, Markowitz {{introduced}} the modern portfolio selection theory which, {{to this very}} day, constitutes the basis of many investment decisions. Given different correlated assets, how does an investor create a portfolio maximizing the expected utility?

The validity of the mean-variance approximation to exact utility maximization has been verified, {{but only in the}} unrealistic case of choosing among 10 - 20 securities.

40|$|The {{right of}} lenders to request for top-ups of {{negative}} equity when the property value falls below the loan outstanding {{is a little}} known, yet widely adopted provision in mortgage documents in many Asian markets. We analyze {{the effect of the}} top-up option by appealing to a contingent claim framework. Specifically, we model the top-up option as a <b>synthetic</b> <b>option</b> comprising a long put to request for a top-up, a short put that cancels out the first option {{in the event of a}} default, and a binary put option once triggered will yield a value equivalent to the difference between the mortgage outstanding and the property value. The results of comparative analyses show that the lender's right to request for top-ups is valuable when the negative mortgage equity increases, especially in a market where price is highly volatile. The top-up clause fundamentally affects the mortgage values for both the borrower and the lender. We show that lender's inaction by not calling for top-ups when negative mortgage equity occurs is suboptimal. On the other hand, the lenders' exercise of the in-the-money top-up options may lead to early default by the mortgagor. This is one of the reasons why lenders exercise this option only very sparingly in practice. This mortgage design has economic value to the lenders, it is, however, not optimal in time of volatile market. The policy implication of the findings is that the sub-optimal top-up feature should be removed from the mortgage contract, and it will not severely jeopardize the lender's ability to enforce payments in the mortgages.

Here, RV {{is defined as the}} sum-of-squared-returns (SSR) and is a proxy for integrated volatility (IV), which is unobservable. The study focuses on a subset of the universe of RV estimators. We examine three categories of estimators: historical, high-frequency (HF) and implied. The need to estimate RV is predominantly in the hedging of options and is not concerned with speculation or forecasting. The main research questions are; (1) what is the best RV estimator in a historical study of S&P 500 data? (2) What is the best RV estimator in a Monte Carlo simulation when delta hedging <b>synthetic</b> <b>options?</b> (3) Do our findings support the stylized fact of `Asymmetry in time scales' (Cont, 2001) ?

Secondly, the Monte Carlo simulation generates stock price paths with random components in the stock price and the volatility at each time point. The distribution of the input volatility is varied. The question of asymmetry in time scales is addressed by varying the term and frequency of historical data. The results of the historical and Monte Carlo simulation are compared.
