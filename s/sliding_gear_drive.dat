40|$|The basic {{hypothesis}} {{of the paper}} is that machine part surfaces are membranes that divide inner and outer space, receive disturbance power from inner space and emit it to the surroundings. Additionally, machine systems operation causes numerous disturbances such as collisions, <b>sliding,</b> rolling, etc. <b>Gear</b> <b>drives</b> are a very interesting case for analysis of teeth impacts, which cause restorable free vibrations and spreading of disturbance power through elastic structure. The gear unit housing has a dominant role in the transformation of disturbance power and modulation of the sound emitted to the surroundings. This is an important detail for monitoring and diagnostics by emitted noise measurements. By combination of theoretical, numerical and experimental analyses, using a classical <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> unit (reducer), this article explains the process of spreading disturbance power through the elastic structure, especially {{the role of the}} gear unit housing. Its role in the noise frequency spectrum modulation is determined by modal sensitivity to disturbances and noise isolation ability of the housing. The analysis of modal behavior of the housing and its modal shape excitation presents the main content of the paper...|$|R

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> These contributions would improve engineering applications of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, design solutions of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> without <b>gear</b> tooth modifications {{are not to}} be constructed. Thus, in this study, a design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with micro-punch webs is proposed. A calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs is constructed, an example case of a micro-punch web for a low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> is calculated, which is based on the proposed calculation procession, and the noise elimination effect of the example case is predicted. Meanwhile, the impacts of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs on sound resonant frequencies are discussed. Furthermore, an experiment of the example case is conducted to check the effect of micro-punch webs on noise reductions and the proposed calculation procession and design solution. The experimental results indicate that the noise reductions of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accomplished by micro-punch webs under the almost same dynamic response conditions, and the fidelity of the proposed calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs and design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accepted.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} capacity of the <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> {{can be achieved by}} changing the tooth thickness of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given spur <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R
