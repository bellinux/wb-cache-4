Representatives {{of the student body}} (the Senior Chapel Prefect, who is the Head Boy or Girl) and of the Old Malvernian Society then place wreaths at the foot of St. George.

5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, <b>silence</b> <b>is</b> used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E

5|$|<b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> a 2016 {{historical}} period drama film {{directed by}} Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, {{based on the}} 1966 novel {{of the same name}} by Shūsaku Endō. Set in Nagasaki, Japan, the film was shot entirely in Taiwan around Taipei. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciarán Hinds. The plot follows two 17th-century Jesuit priests who travel from Portugal to Edo-era Japan to locate their missing mentor and spread Catholic Christianity. The story is set in the time when it was common for Christians to hide from persecution following the suppression of Japanese Roman Catholics during the Shimabara Rebellion (1637–1638) against the Tokugawa shogunate.|$|E
5|$|The first {{points of}} the match were scored by New Zealand's Grant Fox from a penalty kick, during which the South African {{supporters}} counted Fox's steps in a divergence from rugby etiquette where normally <b>silence</b> <b>is</b> kept during kicks. South Africa also had a penalty kick at goal, but this was missed by Naas Botha. The first try of the match came from New Zealand's Zinzan Brooke following a quick tap penalty which was converted by Fox. South Africa then pressured the All Blacks but failed to score, with the score {{at the end of}} first half 10–0 to New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Even though Breton by 1946 responded rather {{negatively}} {{to the subject}} of music with his essay <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> Golden, later Surrealists, such as Paul Garon, have been interested in—and found parallels to—Surrealism in the improvisation of jazz and the blues. Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition included performances by David Honeyboy Edwards.|$|E
50|$|Gene <b>silencing</b> <b>is</b> often {{considered}} {{the same as}} gene knockdown. When genes <b>are</b> <b>silenced,</b> their expression <b>is</b> reduced. In contrast, when genes are knocked out, they are completely erased from the organism's genome and, thus, have no expression. Gene <b>silencing</b> <b>is</b> considered a gene knockdown mechanism since the methods used to silence genes, such as RNAi, CRISPR, or siRNA, generally reduce {{the expression of a}} gene by at least 70% but do not completely eliminate it. Methods using gene <b>silencing</b> <b>are</b> {{often considered}} better than gene knockouts since they allow researchers to study essential genes that are required for the animal models to survive and cannot be removed. In addition, they provide a more complete view on the development of diseases since diseases are generally associated with genes that have a reduced expression.|$|R

Leeds were only able to draw the return leg at Elland Road and went out of the competition. A minute's <b>silence</b> <b>is</b> held every year at the match closest to the anniversary of the {{incident}} to remember Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight.|$|E
25|$|Clair's {{first film}} {{on his return}} to France was the romantic comedy Le silence est d'or (<b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> Golden) (1947), which was set in 1906 and nostalgically evoked the world of early French film-making; its plot also created {{variations}} on Molière's L'École des femmes. Clair considered it {{one of his best}} post-war films. Literary inspirations also underpinned other films: Faust for La Beauté du diable (Beauty and the Devil) (1950); and Don Juan for Les Grandes Manœuvres (1955). In these two films and the intervening Les Belles de nuit (Beauties of the Night) (1952), the leading actor was Gérard Philipe who became a friend and a favourite performer for Clair. Porte des Lilas (1957) was a sombre film, set once again in a popular district of Paris with its picturesque inhabitants, for which the singer Georges Brassens was persuaded to give his first and only film performance.|$|E
