40|$|A cost {{effective}} {{alternative to the}} existing treatment steps of the refining by-ptoducts, is the “on site” energetical valorization through 2 comparable technologies: thermal oxidation and anaerobic digestion combined with boiler. In a thermal multifluid oxidizer Cinclus®, the mixture is injected with atomisation and combustion air at high velocity into the oxidation chamber. The jet creates a local under-pressure and thus an internal recirculation in the oxidation chamber. This results in a controlled and homogeneous temperature and residence profile that ensure an optimal combustion with low emissions. To prevent persistent boiler fouling, the gases are cooled to below 750 °C in the gas conditioning chamber by mixing the hot gases with recycled gases taken from behind the de-dusting device. Divert investment for fossil fuel boiler and <b>soap</b> <b>stock</b> splitting to install Cinclus <b>soap</b> <b>stock</b> boiler will allow: no acid waste water, no interphase, no sulfuric acid consumption, no fossil fuel consumption. The Dranco process is a well-known and reliable anaerobic digestion technology. Its simple digester design, no moving parts within the digester, provides a high reliability and low maintenance costs. The Dranco process parameters are roughly: digester loading: 10 to 20 kg COD/m 3 reactor. day. The temperature range of the thermophilic organisms is 50 to 58 °C. The retention time in the digester is about 15 to 30 days. The biogas production is above 300 m 3 of biogas per ton of waste. The electricity production: above 500 kWh per ton of waste.

40|$|Abstract Background Extracellular {{bacterial}} lipases {{received much}} attention for their substrate specificity {{and their ability}} to function under extreme environments (pH, temperature [...] .). Many staphylococci produced lipases which were released into the culture medium. Reports of extracellular thermostable lipases from Staphylococcus sp. and active in alkaline conditions are not previously described. Results This study focused on novel strategies to increase extracellular lipolytic enzyme production by a novel Staphylococcus sp. strain ESW. The microorganism needed neutral or alkaline pH values between 7. 0 and 12. 0 for growth. For pH values outside this range, cell growth seemed to be significantly inhibited. Staphylococcus sp. culture was able to grow within a wide temperature range (from 30 to 55 °C). The presence of oils in the culture medium leaded to improvements in cells growth and lipolytic enzyme activity. On the other hand, although chemical surfactants leaded to an almost complete inhibition of growth and lipolytic enzyme production, their addition along the culture could affect the location of the enzyme. In addition, our results showed that this novel Staphylococcus sp. strain produced biosurfactants simultaneously with lipolytic activity, when soapstock (The main co-product of the vegetable oil refining industry), was used as the sole carbon source. Conclusion A simultaneous biosurfactant and extracellular lipolytic enzymes produced bacterial strain with potential application in <b>soap</b> <b>stock</b> treatment</p...|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel is {{produced}} through a chemical process called transesterification, {{which refers to}} a catalysed chemical reaction involving vegetable oil and alcohol to yield fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol as a by product. Biodiesel is petroleum substitution in which its quantity continually decreases due to increasing of demand. Plenty of plants {{could be used as}} raw material for biodiesel, for example is avocado (Persea gratissima) seed. This is a waste that being thrown out after the flesh is taken. Therefore, avocado has a higher economic value to be used for consumption. Avocado is not only as an edible commodity but also as feedstock for production of biodiesel. The purposes of this research are producing biodiesel from avocado seed oil (Persea gratissima) so it can be used for alternative fuel, studying the effect of molar ratio avocado seed oil to methanol and reaction temperature to yield the highest methyl ester content, and also studying the effect of washing method and comparing between the conventional method (using water) and dry washing method to reach the highest methyl ester content. Variables that are used in this research are molar ratio of methanol to avocado seed oil, reaction temperature, and washing method. Transesterification process runs for 60 minutes, with NaOH as base catalyst concentration is 1 % by weight. Avocado seed oil contains free fatty acid less than 2 %, so that transesterification process can be carried out with no addition step to convert free fatty acid content become esters. Crude biodiesel which is yielded from transesterification process still contains of impurities, such as traces of glycerine, unreacted methanol, rest of base catalyst, and <b>soap</b> <b>stock.</b> So it needs to be washed out. There are two washing methods, which are water washing and dry washing. The use of dry washing method is expected to be technically feasible with less complexity than the water washing method, thereby making it a competitive alternative to commercial biodiesel production. From this research, it can be concluded that the characteristic of biodiesel from avocado seed oil is acceptable for alternative fuel. The optimum condition is obtained at molar ratio of 1 : 6 (alcohol to oil) and temperature 60 C. Washing method with water is resulting methyl ester content of 82. 7119 %, while for dry washing method resulting methyl ester content of 84. 5678 %. Therefore, the best washing method is dry washing in difference of 1. 8559 %...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{safety and}} {{environment}} protection play {{key role in}} the sustainable development of our country. As an environment friendly renewable energy, bodiesel is considered as a promising alternative of fossil diesel. Refined rapeseed and soybean oils in China are too expensive to make biodiesel competitive in the market. High price of feedstock becomes the bottleneck for biodiesel development. This research focus on the utilization of low cost feed stock, such as used frying oil, trap grease, <b>soap</b> <b>stock</b> and jatropha oil with high acid value. Comparison and optimization of the technologies related to different feedstocks have been conducted in this work. Biodiesel production from used frying oil and trap grease via acid catalysis was carried out in a pressurized reactor. Through central rotatable design, two quadric polynomial models were obtained. Methanol, sulfuric acid loading and the reaction time were the significant factors influenced the ester content of the biodiesel. This result provided reliable data for acid catalyzed both esterification and transesterification. Studies on the activity of solid acid (Amberlyst- 15) concluded that used frying oil could be esterified at 60 ℃ and jatropha oil with about 5 % free fatty acids, trap grease with 50 % free fatty acids should be treated at 90 ℃, 95 ℃. A novel separation process of soapstock at room temperature was developed through dilution with water, pH control of the followed acidulation. Yield of acid oil can be achieved at 97 % and 91 ~ 93 % based on fresh soapstock and fermented soapstock respectively. Water content of excess methanol and reaction time were taken as two independent variables, the acid values of jatropha oil were taken as response surface, and a quadric polynomial model was established through a full factorial design. A high efficient method was developed by 20 verification experiments carried out based on this model. The total sulfuric acid and the average reaction time were decreased significantly, which is valueble for biodiesel commercialization using jatropha oil as feedstock. A small pilot plant with a capacity of 200 tons/year was designed {{based on the results of}} the experiments in the laboratory. Tung oil with an acid value of 7. 12 mgKOH/g was esterified in the fixed reactor, and then it was transesterified in the plug flow reactor continuously. Economic analysis showed that the profitability of biodiesel production from trap grease was sensitive to the change of prices of trap grease and biodiesel. Budget deficit is expected if the price of trap grease increases 10 % or the price of biodiesel decreases 10 % while other factors are stable. The effect of biodiesel price is more significant than the price of trap grease. The change of methanol and glycerol price is less important because of the sum of them relative to the trap grease and biodiesel is small. 保证能源安全和控制环境污染是我国实现可持续发展的前提，生物柴油作为环境友好的可再生能源已经成为重点研究开发的一种化石燃料的替代品。目前欧美普遍使用的大豆油和菜籽油在中国油料市场价格昂贵，原料成本过高是我国生物柴油商业化生产的瓶颈。本研究根据具有代表性的煎炸废油、地沟油、豆油皂脚和高酸价麻疯树油等低价位、高酸价生物柴油生产原料的各自特点，采取了不同工艺进行了生物柴油的合成研究。 使用承压反应装置，在酸催化剂的作用下，完成了利用煎炸废油和地沟油一步法生产生物柴油的优化实验。通过旋转中心组成实验设计和结果分析，得到了两个二次多项式模型。结果证明在确定反应温度的条件下，甲醇加入量、催化剂用量和反应时间在反应过程决定了产物甲酯含量，这样为酸催化同步酯化和酯交换反应提供了广泛适用的理论依据。 比较研究了硫酸和固体酸催化剂（Amberlyst- 15 ）在煎炸废油、地沟油和高酸价麻疯树油预酯化过程的催化效果，总结出利用固体酸催化剂在 60 ℃完成煎炸废油的预酯化，在 90 ℃和 95 ℃完成麻疯树油和地沟油的预酯化的两条绿色工艺路线。 通过先用水稀释豆油皂脚，再控制硫酸加入速度和加入量的方式，在室温条件下分离出豆油皂脚内的游离脂肪酸和甘油酯（酸化油）。对于未发酵皂脚，分离率达 97 %；对于发酵皂脚，分离率为 91 ~ 93 %。 通过全析因实验设计及实验结果分析，建立以过量甲醇内含水量和反应时间为自变量，以预酯化后麻疯树油的酸值为因变量的二次多项式模型。设定预酯化后麻疯树油的酸值，根据模型完成理论计算，得到重复使用过量甲醇和硫酸预酯化麻疯树油所需要的反应时间，并通过实际的 20 次实验验证了该模型的准确性和实用性。该预处理方法减少了硫酸加入总量，缩短了反应时间，对实际工业化生产具有应用价值。 在小试实验数据的基础上设计完成年产 200 吨生物柴油的小型中间试验装置，并利用固体酸催化剂在该装置上进行了酸值为 7. 12 mgKOH/g的桐油预酯化反应实验，及随后在活塞流反应器上的碱催化转酯化反应。 商业化生产的技术分析表明，地沟油和生物柴油的价格变化对项目经济效益的影响表现很敏感。其它因素不变的情况下，地沟油价格增加 10 %或生物柴油降低 10 %都会出现亏损。从亏损额上分析，生物柴油的市场价格对盈利能力影响更大。甲醇和甘油的变化对盈利水平影响较小，主要是因为是它们在整个物料平衡过程中物质总量相对于地沟油和生物柴油...|$|E
