40|$|To {{understand}} the compatibility of the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> gauge with tritium handling during fusion experiments, tritium gas and/or gas mixtures of hydrogen isotopes were measured with the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> gauge in pressure ranges of 10 - 5 to 10 Pa. It was observed {{that it is}} possible to determine the absolute pressure of tritium gas and/or gas mixtures of hydrogen isotopes within several percent errors as well as determining the absolute pressure of pure gas by using the mole fraction of the component gases in the mixture. Additionally, it was found that the sensitivity and the offset value do not change with a tritium exposure amounting to 1. 9 x 105 Pa・s. Therefore, we concluded that the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> gauge is free from any tritium β-ray effects.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new concept for {{attitude}} actuation for small satellites that uses active magnetic bearings to support and tilt a <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> to provide 3 -axis attitude control of the satellite using a single actuator. A controlled 3 D motion in the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> provides a conventional torque output about the momentum axis and a gyroscopic torque output about any direction in the plane normal to the spinning axis. Therefore, a single tilting momentum-wheel can generate torque along the three principal axes of the satellite, providing mass and power savings, or redundancy.

The control loop that levitates and tilts the rotor is discussed. The 3 - axis actuation of this wheel is demonstrated with simulations of the wheel fitted to the TopSat small satellite. The bandwidth and torque output of the wheel are compared with a conventional momentum wheel’s. The power consumption, operation and stiffness of the magnetic bearing are discussed.
