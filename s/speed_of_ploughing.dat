FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) {{is a new}} method to analyze potential reliability problems in the development cycle of the project, {{making it easier to}} take actions to overcome such issues, thus enhancing the reliability through design or process. Anticipating these failure modes, being the central step in the analysis, needs to be carried on extensively, in order to prepare a list of maximum potential failure modes. Risk is measured in terms of Risk Priority Number (RPN) that is a product of occurrence, severity, and detection difficulty. This study attempted to improve clod mean weight diameter and soil inversion as indicators of tillage quality by FMEA methodology. The results showed that low soil moisture, slow <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> and great depth of ploughing is the most important factors that increase clod MWD with 900, 630 and 560 RPN, respectively. Also for soil inversion the slow <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing,</b> not using coulter, low soil moisture and great depth of ploughing are important factors with 720, 648, 490 and 420 RPN. Using a split - split factorial experiment with 16 treatments and three replications also acknowledged the results of this method. After reforming the conditions and re-testing the experiment, results showed that clod MWD was reduced 20 % and soil inversion increased 2 % approximately. This study proposes the use of this technique in agricultural management...|$|E

A single furrow swing mouldboard plough-Maun Series, {{and the same}} type enamel-coated plough both ox-drawn, are compared under similar working conditions such as soil moisture content, depth and width of cut and approximately constant <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing.</b> It {{was found that the}} enamel-coating reduces both the plough draught and the specific draught. The percentage reduction of the plough draught for enamel-coated plough compared to uncoated plough varied from 12. 7 % at 25 % soil moisture content to 18. 1 % at 32 % soil moisture content (dry basis). It was also found that the percentage reduction of the specific draught achieved with the enamel-coated plough in comparison with the uncoated plough varied from 20. 3 % at 32 % soil moisture content to 25. 7 % at 25 % soil moisture content (dry basis) ...|$|E
40|$|Tillage is a soil's {{machining}} process {{in order to}} make its structure suitable for plant growing. The efficiency of the tillage is measured by the power consumption or the tillage force. It is related to the soil's mechanical characteristics, the work parameters (depth and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing)</b> and the tillage tool geometry. During the last foor decades, many parametric studies about the interaction soil/tool have been conducted. These studies were quasistatic based on the equilibrium soil/tool. After that, with the development of the numerical modelling, more studies were conducted. These ones took into consideration the dynamic aspect of the tillage process. However, concerning the big strains of the soil, few research are present in the literature. Other works used the fluid dynamics to simulate the big deformations of the tilled soil. In our work, to optimise the tillage tool design, we used the finite element method to model the soil ploughing. The preliminary results are qualitatively interesting. The confrontations with the experimental measurements is possible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Ploughing</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} power {{consuming}} and expensive processes in agricultural production. It {{is known that}} the draft resistance <b>of</b> <b>ploughs,</b> the energy requirement for <b>ploughing,</b> the quality <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> and expenses depend on the plough body design, which {{is determined by the}} share-mouldboard parameters and the parameters of its supporting surfaces, as well as on such soil properties as its hardness, density, friction and adhesion, values of which are depending on soil mechanical composition, structure and humidity. Studies are carried out to determine the impact of the soil humidity on the <b>ploughing</b> resistance <b>of</b> the main soil types: sandy soil, loam and clay soils. It was cleared up that humidity most of all impacts the soil hardness and cutting resistance which considerably dominates in the summary resistance <b>of</b> the <b>plough</b> body. Increase in the soil humidity leads to decrease in the ploughing resistance that is more remarkable on clay soils. The working <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plough</b> influences also the ploughing resistance. The optimum humidity of sticky clay soils when ploughing at the speed 2 … 2. 5 m s- 1 is 18 … 22 %. Key words: <b>ploughing</b> resistance, impact <b>of</b> soil humidity, soil hardness, soil density, soil friction, soil adhesion, dynamics of soil properties...|$|R
40|$|Tractive force models at {{different}} tillage speeds were developed using dimensional analysis, describing the tractor tyre - soil interaction. In this research study, disc ploughing on an experimental plot at twenty different soil moisture levels in {{loamy sand soil}} was carried out using trace tractor techniques. The independent variables: drawbar pull force, rolling (motion) resistance, wheel slip, moisture content, cone index, wheel numeric, contact pressure, <b>speed,</b> width <b>of</b> <b>plough,</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>plough,</b> and dependent variable (Tractive force) were measured and compared to computed values. High coefficients of determination R 2 = 0. 9492, 0. 9555 and 0. 9447 for <b>ploughing</b> at tillage <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were obtained respectively. Standard errors of 0. 3672552, 0. 8628 and 0. 8047 and the percentage (%) errors of - 2. 272608059 and 2. 45655144,- 2. 304946155 and 2. 523126085,- 1. 424947801 and 2. 020155232 at minimum and maximum values, were obtained. These results are clear evidence of the test of goodness of fit of the models between predictive and measured parameters for ploughing {{at different}} tillage speeds. The models were verified and validated by comparing the predicted with the measured tractive forces, and shown to closely followed the experimental results...|$|R

These and other factors all {{contribute to the development of}} stress on the agricultural machine elements which may either lead to breakdowns or failures of some parts. As part of an effort to investigate into the frequent failures of the Steyr tractor lift system, the effects of ploughing speed on the development of stress on the Steyr tractor lift system (stabilizers and brackets) on a clay loam soil of Bauchi-Nigeria in the Northern Guinea Savannah were investigated using quarter-bridge strain gauge circuit with temperature compensation. It was found that stress on these parts of the three-point linkage system increased with increase in <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing.</b> The average stress values obtained were relatively higher when compared with the yield point stress (0. 23 kN/mm 2) of bracket material.

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of setup of three point linkage on {{energetic}} and performance parameters of tractor aggregate. For this purpose were made two series of measurements. The first series was realized with the tractor NewHolland T 7050 aggregate with 5 -furrow reversible plough plough KUHN HUARD VM 150 5 NS. Data such as engine load, engine revolution, diesel fuel consumption, diesel fuel temperature, were got from CAN Bus network during the measurement. Then were measured following parameters total time <b>of</b> <b>ploughing,</b> dephth <b>of</b> <b>ploughing,</b> time <b>of</b> turning and swath of the tractor aggregate. The specific consumption of diesel fuel and the efficiency of the aggregate were calculated using the aforementioned parameters. The second series of measurements was realized with the tractor Zetor Proxima Plus 115 aggregate with four-furrow plough Kverneland 150 B. During the measurement the data such theoretical and actual <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the tractor and force in the top link of three point hitch were recorded in the computer. Then were measured following parameters such as main time <b>of</b> <b>ploughing,</b> dephth <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> and swath <b>of</b> the tractor aggregate. By the first and second tractor aggregate were approved linear dependence of slip, performance and fuel consumption on the force in top link of three point linkage...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is force effect {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> rigs. MSC Adams software was used for mathematical-physical model drafting and subsequent evaluation of measured data from tensometrical load sensing. Designed model was utilized for force reactions calculations under the driving wheels of a tractor using analysis of spatial system of forces of tractors three point hitch. Field measurement data and data from MSC Adams software were tabular and graphically processed. Dependencies between plough and tractor connection setting and output performance <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> rigs were clarified. Results from experimental measurement with fully-mounted plough point out on the utilization of longitudinal and lateral position <b>of</b> <b>ploughs</b> CG for reducing of difference in load between furrow and land wheel with properly adjusted connection between plough and tractor. A result from experimental measurement with semi-mounted plough confirms the fact of significant difference in vertical load between rear axle wheels. This negative phenomenon could be eliminated with usage of traction cylinder localized in construction <b>of</b> semi-mounted <b>ploughs</b> over the horizontal joint. Correct adjustment of tractors three point hitch in case <b>of</b> fully-mounted <b>ploughs</b> and utilization <b>of</b> traction cylinder in case <b>of</b> semi-mounted <b>ploughs</b> have got positive influence on fuel consumption and field performance <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> rigs...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the impact of different management systems of grass-clover (various cutting and/or mulching combinations) and date <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> (autumn or spring) {{on the fate of}} nitrogen (N) and the yield of succeeding wheat. The 3 -cut system resulted in nitrate losses below the limit of the EC Nitrate Directive (91 / 676 /EEC), even with ploughing in autumn. When ploughed in spring, treatments with frequent cutting and/or mulching induced nitrate leaching below the critical value. In contrast, losses from swards mulched only once were considerably above the threshold value, independently <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> time. With swards mulched and ploughed in autumn, nitrate concentrations exceed the EC-limit. The management of grass-clover swards did not affect the yield <b>of</b> wheat, whereas <b>ploughing</b> in autumn increased the yield.
