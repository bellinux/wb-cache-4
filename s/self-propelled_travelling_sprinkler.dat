40|$|A set of {{equations}} {{suitable for}} describing {{the dynamics of}} a liquid droplet - gas mixture (spray) have been developed. The equations are arrived at by considering the spray as a multiphase continuum within which the gas and droplets of different sizes constitute individual phases. By ignoring droplet-droplet interactions and considering the gas phase as an inviscid fluid a simplified form of the equations of motion has been arrived at. The equations are considered in one dimension and {{used to describe the}} dynamics of the interior of spray produced by a large or medium scale irrigation sprinkler. When combined with data representing the distribution of droplet diameters within the spray this model can be used to predict the water application produced by a sprinkler operating in windy conditions. Such simulations have been undertaken to predict the water application from static sprinklers and the results validated by comparison with data obtained experimentally. A simulation methodology is used to determine the uniformity of water application produced by a <b>travelling</b> <b>sprinkler.</b> By considering the results of large number of simulations produced using meteorological data spanning several years {{the manner in which the}} simulation can be used for determining optimum irrigation practice is demonstrated. A simple model has been developed for predicting the water application from a <b>travelling</b> <b>sprinkler</b> operating in still air. The model can be used for obtaining first approximations to optimum operating conditions and provides a means for easily quantifying the performance of a given sprinkler. Further use of the model may be made for aiding in the design and control of irrigation sprinklers...|$|R

For {{the health and well-being}} of citizens walking and cycling between their homes, workplaces, shops and other locations is already being encouraged. Undoubtedly these self-propelled systems will be integrated into future cities, avoiding the modern day perils of mixing pedestrians, cyclists and powered vehicles. For distances and occasions where <b>self-propelled</b> <b>travel</b> is impractical then future cities will need to strike a balance between mass public transport (buses and trams), individually-hired vehicles (taxis and rental cars) and individually owned vehicles. Various technologies already in development will impinge upon the choices made, such as self-driving vehicles [106, 107], electric vehicles [108, 109] and Aero-Mobil [110]. Aero-Mobil is a flying car that integrates existing infrastructure used for automobiles and planes. As a car it can fit into any standard parking space, uses regular gasoline, and can be used in road traffic just like any other car. As a plane it can use any airport in the world, but can also take off and land using any grass strip or paved surface just a few hundred meters long. It is now finalised and has been in regular flight-testing program in real flight conditions since October 2014. The Aero-Mobil is built from advanced composite material includes its body shell, wings, and wheels. According to company authorities the final product will include all the standard avionics and, an autopilot plus an advanced parachute deployment system [110].|$|R

40|$|To our knowledge, {{this work}} {{describes}} {{the first example}} of electro-guided, self-propelled droplets composed solely of an ionic liquid (IL), namely trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride ([P 6, 6, 6, 14][Cl]). These <b>self-propelled</b> droplets <b>travel</b> along an aqueous-air boundary to desired destinations within the fluidic network. Electrotactic movement of the droplets is due to asymmetric electro-stimulated release of a constituent of the IL droplet, the [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+ ion, {{which is a very}} efficient cationic surfactant, through electrochemically generated Cl− gradients. The direction and speed of movement can be controlled by switching the impressed voltage (typically 5 − 9 V) ON or OFF, and by changing the polarity of the electrodes in contact with the electrolyte solution. The Cl− gradients required for droplet movement are electrochemically generated using 3 D printed electrodes which are embedded within the fluidic channels. On demand creation of these Cl− gradients electrochemically allows reversible droplet movement over expended periods of time, and provides a means for precise control over the droplet trajectory...|$|R
40|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems usually use a {{large volume}} gun-sprinkler that {{requires}} high operating pressure. These sprinklers deliver water at high application rates with large drops that can damage plants and destroy soil surface structure {{and in some}} cases lead to surface sealing which, in turn, reduces soil infiltration and leads to an increase in runoff. They can also be characterised as having low application uniformity, especially in windy conditions. The use of a line with medium- or low-pressure sprinklers, mounted on the system-moving vehicle, instead of the gun-sprinkler, can be an alternative to the use of traveller systems in some crops and topographic conditions. Smaller sprinklers require less operating pressure, the water drops are smaller and the overlapping of water jets can increase irrigation uniformity. Field tests were used to compare the performance of the traveller machine using a line of four sprinklers (250 kPa) and a gun-sprinkler (350 kPa), at three different travelling speeds, corresponding to three different application depths. The evaluated parameters were: irrigation uniformity, evaporation and wind drift losses, runoff and sediment yield. With wind speeds between 14 and 40 m/s, the traveller with the line of sprinklers allowed better irrigation uniformity for all travelling speeds. Evaporation and wind drift losses were similar for both system options, presenting significant differences only for the lowest machine velocity. Runoff increased along the irrigation events, with the gun-sprinkler option presenting higher values. However, due to some variations in the soil water content and water depths that occurred in the field tests, {{it was not possible to}} prove that the significant differences observed were caused only as a result of the use of a different system option. Sediment yield was higher in the events with the gun-sprinkler due to higher amounts of runoff and more soil detachment by the larger drops of this system option. From these field tests it is possible to state that the line of sprinklers option has some management disadvantages compared to the gun-sprinkler option. It is more labour intensive, and its height from the soil can be a limiting factor for use with some crops. In cases where its use does not interfere with the crop canopy it can allow irrigations with higher performance. It can also be used as an alternative for the first irrigation events, especially in poor-structured soils that present more crust formation problems...|$|R

These issues have greater significance when the irrigation is applied within or near the crop canopy. Key issues that must be addressed to ensure equal {{opportunity to}} sprinkler irrigation applications are irrigation application symmetry, spatial orientation of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>travel</b> with respect to crop rows, and the seasonal longevity of the sprinkler pattern distortion caused by crop canopy interference.

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{unsteady}} computational fluid {{dynamic analysis}} of the manoeuvring performance of a self-propelled ship requires a large computational resource that restricts its use {{as part of a}} ship design process. A method is presented that significantly reduces computational cost by coupling a blade element momentum theory (BEMT) propeller model with the solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations. The approach allows the determination of manoeuvring coefficients for a <b>self-propelled</b> ship <b>travelling</b> straight ahead, at a drift angle and for differing rudder angles. The swept volume of the propeller is divided into discrete annuli for which the axial and tangential momentum changes of the fluid passing through the propeller are balanced with the blade element performance of each propeller section. Such an approach allows the interaction effects between hull, propeller and rudder to be captured. Results are presented for the fully appended model scale self-propelled KRISO very large crude carrier 2 (KVLCC 2) hull form undergoing static rudder and static drift tests at a Reynolds number of 4. 6 × 106 acting at the ship self-propulsion point. All computations were carried out on a typical workstation using a hybrid finite volume mesh size of 2. 1 × 10 ^ 6 elements. The computational uncertainty is typically 2 – 3 % for side force and yaw moment. <br/...|$|R

Aluminium-Magnesium (Al-Mg) alloys have very good formability properties and have been used extensively for interior structural components of automotive body-inwhite (BIW).

The two factors caused the components made out of Al-Mg alloy sheet to be susceptible to softening during paint bake cycle. During studies, softening behaviour is under the influences of time, temperature and pre-strain.

40|$|Here {{we report}} {{for the first time}} electro-guided, {{self-propelled}} droplets, which are composed solely of an ionic liquid (IL), namely trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride ([P 6, 6, 6, 14][Cl]). These <b>self-propelled</b> droplets <b>travel</b> along an aqueous-air boundary and are guided to specific destinations within the fluidic network through the use of electro-chemically generated Cl- gradients. The direction of movement can be controlled by switching the impressed voltage (9 V, ON or OFF) and polarity of the electrodes in contact with the electrolyte solution. Controlled release of surfactants has been investigated previously as a method of controlling surface tension in aqueous systems in order to achieve spontaneous movement of droplets at the air-liquid interface [1, 2]. When a surfactant is released into an aqueous solution, the surface tension is lowered. Liquid flows from areas of low surface tension to areas of high surface tension, a phenomenon known as the Marangoni effect. Using stimuli-responsive surfactants, smart droplets have been designed which can solve complex mazes [1] or can be attracted or repelled by light [2], in a contactless manner. Electro-tactic movement of the droplets is due to the controlled release of the [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+, a very efficient cationic surfactant, which is a constituent of the IL droplet (Fig. 1). The asymmetric release of the cationic surfactant is controlled through modulation of the IL counter anion (Cl-) solubility, as this controls the rate of release of the cationic surfactant in order to maintain electroneutrality within the droplet. The solubility of the [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+ is limited in aqueous solutions and is dependent on the local ionic strength of the solution (Fig. 2). Therefore in ionic strength gradients there is a differential release of the surfactant from droplet boundary into the solution, which in turn results in an asymmetrical surface tension gradient around the droplet. This leads to Marangoni like flows, which propel the droplet from areas of low surface tension to areas of high surface tension. The chip used in this work was 3 D printed (Objet 350 Connex printer) as were the titanium mesh electrodes (Realizer SLM- 50) embedded in the chip. By applying an external electric field to the solution, a [P 6, 6, 6, 14][Cl] droplet can be moved from the cathode (-) to the anode (+) (Fig. 3). The external electric field causes migration of ions, which results in concentration enrichment of ions in the proximity of the electrodes [3], Na+ at the cathode (starting position) and Cl- at the anode (destination). The resulting ion migration towards the electrodes creates an ionic strength gradient within the channel which controls the movement of the droplet. Additionally, the applied electric field causes Faradic arrangement of the charged ions within the IL droplet [3]. This also creates concentration gradients of the ions within the droplet, reinforcing the droplet movement mechanism. The electro-generation of gradients therefore provides a simple means to control the speed and direction of movement of droplets within fluidic channels in a very flexible manner. ...|$|R
