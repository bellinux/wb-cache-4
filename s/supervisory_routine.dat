40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} for animating simulated characters to perform controlled steps. The desired step {{is controlled by}} high-level goals, namely step position and step duration. These stepping goals guide the desired time-varying values for the center of mass and the stepping foot which in turn lead to objectives dictating the desired changes in momentum and joint angles over {{the duration of the}} step. Our approach employs a multiobjective optimization to solve for joint accelerations from the objectives and uses inverse dynamics to compute joint torques. Our approach can guide a character with purposeful, directable steps for controlling careful navigation of the character’s position and orientation. In addition, the same system can be used to create protective steps to prevent falling as a reaction to a disturbance. A novel <b>supervisory</b> <b>routine</b> automatically chooses when and where to step based on an analysis of the momentum conditions for the character. We contrast thisapproach toprevious methods for steprecovery usingthe inverted pendulum.

40|$|Stepping is a {{fundamental}} skill involved in common bipedal activities such as walking, foot repositioning and step recovery. Generating these stepping activities requires characters that are controllable and responsive. This dissertation describes a goal-directed controller and a momentum supervisor for characters that perform both believable and robust steps {{under a variety of}} conditions. The desired step is controlled by generic task goals, namely step position and step duration, which allow characters to step in arbitrary directions with various speeds. These high-level goals guide desired changes of a character's center of mass and swing foot over the duration of the step. To produce realistic and flexible steps, the desired time-varying values for the center of mass and the swing foot are derived from parametric curve generators which are built on empirical evidence extracted from motion capture data of stepping. Controlling these two values along with regulation of angular momentum in vertical axis produces characters with coordinated full-body movements including natural arm swings during stepping. The system can guide a character with purposeful, directable steps to precisely follow user-specified foot placements and to carefully control the character's position and orientation. Moreover, the same system can be used to create protective steps to maintain the character's balance in response to a perturbation. A novel <b>supervisory</b> <b>routine</b> automatically chooses when and where to step with a straightforward goal: removing all linear and angular momenta induced by a push. In contrast to previous methods for push recovery using the inverted pendulum, the proposed momentum supervisor introduces a nice clean formulation to determine when and where to step and provides better prediction of a character's stability under perturbations by considering both linear and angular momenta of the character. In addition to responding to a perturbation, this dissertation also presents an approach for characters that anticipate impending perturbations with examples taken from human motion capture data. I focus on the motion interpolation sysnthesis technique which allows a character to anticipate by blocking or dodging a threat coming from a variety of directions and targeting any part of the body...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the expert}} {{observation}} that the teacher “supervisor’s role is, in part, culturally defined” (Bailey, 2006, p. 6), and the perceived gap that few supervisors receive formal training, in the current study, the researchers report on the views of Ministry of Education (MOE) teachers and supervisors in the Iranian context as to what constitutes the knowledge base of supervisors. Having conducted qualitative content analysis on the data gleaned from interviews with the teachers and supervisors and open-ended questionnaires, {{we came up with}} a framework of supervisory skill/knowledge domains – one encompassing public relations skills, subject matter knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and contextual sensitivity. The results show that teachers by and large, by voicing their discontent with current <b>supervisory</b> <b>routines,</b> opt for humanistic supervisory procedures. The study, hoping to be taken up with more supervisory knowledge base studies, ends with advice on building supervisory preparation courses into existing teacher development programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} time {{dedicated}} to child care has potentially {{positive effects on}} children's life chances. However, the determinants of parental time allocation to child care remain largely unexplored. We assess two main explanations for differences among parents {{in the amount of}} time spent with children. The first, based on the relative resources hypothesis, links variation in time spent with children to the relative attributes (occupation, education or income) of one partner with the other. The second, derived from the social status hypothesis, suggests that variation in time spent with children can be attributed to the relative social position of the couple (i. e. higher status couples spend more time with children regardless of within-couple difference). To investigate these questions, we use a sample of parents living in a partnership with children younger than 10 years old from the 2002 to 2003 Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS) (n = 7438). We find little support for the ‘relative resources hypothesis’, although it has some explanatory power on <b>supervisory</b> and <b>routine</b> activities performed with children. Instead, consistent with the ‘social status hypothesis’, we find that time spent on child care is attributable to the social position of the couple, regardless of between-parent differences in income or education. The ‘social status hypothesis’ is especially relevant for explaining the time that parents devote to activities that have a higher potential for the development of the child's cognitive and social capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Strategy (IMCI), {{developed}} by WHO/UNICEF, aims {{to contribute to}} reducing childhood morbidity and mortality (MDG 4) in resource-limited settings. Since 1996 more than 100 countries have adopted IMCI. IMCI case management training (ICMT) {{is one of three}} IMCI components and training is usually residential over 11 consecutive days. Follow-up after ICMT {{is an essential part of}} training. We describe the barriers to rapid acceleration of ICMT and review country perspectives on how to address these barriers. Methods A multi-country exploratory cross-sectional questionnaire survey of in-service ICMT approaches, using quantitative and qualitative methods, was conducted in 2006 - 7 : 27 countries were purposively selected from all six WHO regions. Data for this paper are from three questionnaires (QA, QB and QC), distributed to selected national focal IMCI persons/programme officers, course directors/facilitators and IMCI trainees respectively. QC only gathered data on experiences with IMCI follow-up. Results 33 QA, 163 QB and 272 QC were received. The commonest challenges to ICMT scale-up relate to funding (high cost and long duration of the residential ICMT), poor literacy of health workers, differing opinions about the role of IMCI in improving child health, lack of political support, frequent changes in staff or rules at Ministries of Health and lack of skilled facilitators. Countries addressed these challenges in several ways including increased advocacy, developing strategic linkages with other priorities, intensifying pre-service training, re-distribution of funds and shortening course duration. The commonest challenges to follow-up after ICMT were lack of funding (93. 1 % of respondents), inadequate funds for travelling or planning (75. 9 % and 44. 8 % respectively), lack of gas for travelling (41. 4 %), inadequately trained or few supervisors (41. 4 %) and inadequate job aids for follow-up (27. 6 %). Countries addressed these by piggy backing IMCI follow-up with <b>routine</b> <b>supervisory</b> visits. Conclusions Financial challenges to ICMT scale-up and follow-up after training are common. As IMCI is accepted globally as one of the key strategies to meet MDG 4 several steps need to be taken to facilitate rapid acceleration of ICMT, including reviewing core competencies followed by competency-driven shortened training duration or 'on the job' training, 'distance learning' or training using mobile phones. Linkages with other 'better-funded' programmes e. g. HIV or malaria need to be improved. Routine Primary Health Care (PHC) supervision needs to include follow-up after ICMT. </p...|$|R
