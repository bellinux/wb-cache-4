25|$|The Japanese Akita and American Akita {{began to}} diverge in type during the Post–World War II era. It {{was during this}} time, that US {{servicemen}} serving {{as part of the}} occupation force in Japan first came into contact with the Akita, the breed so impressed them that many servicemembers chose to bring an Akita back home with them upon completion of their tour. American servicemembers were typically more impressed with the larger more bear-like fighting Akita or German <b>Shepherd</b> <b>type</b> than they were with the smaller framed and fox-like Akita-Inu; the types of dogs they brought back with them to the US reflected this sentiment. Japanese Akita fanciers focused on restoring the breed as a work of Japanese art or to 'Natural Monument' status. American Akita fanciers chose to breed larger, heavier-boned and more intimidating dogs. Although, both types derive from a common ancestry, there are marked differences between the two. First, while American Akitas are acceptable in all colors, Japanese Akitas are only permitted to be red, fawn, sesame, white, or brindle. Additionally, American Akitas may be pinto and/or have black masks, unlike Japanese Akitas where it is considered a disqualification and not permitted in the breed standards. American Akitas generally are heavier boned and larger, with a more bear-like head, whereas Japanese Akitas tend to be lighter and more finely featured with a fox-like head.|$|E

2500|$|Almost 100 years later, {{another book}} in English, De Canibus Britannicus by the author/physician John Caius, {{translated}} (Fleming) from Latin in 1576, attempts the first systematic approach to defining {{different types of}} dogs in various categories, demonstrating an apparent increase in types, and population. [...] "English dogs": the gentle (i.e. well-bred) kind, serving game—harriers, terriers, bloodhounds, gazehounds, greyhounds, limers, tumblers and stealers; [...] "the homely kind"; [...] "the currish kind", toys. [...] "Fowling dogs"—setters and spaniels. As well as the pastoral or <b>shepherd</b> <b>types,</b> mastiffs or bandogs, and various village dogs. Sub-types describing the function of dogs in each group were also included.|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the exact}} dog breeds used in the gene pool for the Kunming wolfdogs is {{ambiguous}} {{due to the lack}} of proper pedigrees and the fact that a majority of them were crossbreeds although the German Shepherd and some wolfdog crosses are known to play a huge part in the breed's origin. The Kunming wolfdog was created in the early 1950s to meet the need for military dogs in Yunnan. A group of ten <b>shepherd</b> <b>type</b> dogs mixed with unknown breeds were brought to Kunming from a military K9 training program in Beijing in 1953. These ten dogs were insufficient for the immediate need, and so fifty suitable household dogs from Kunming were recruited as well as forty similar dogs from the city of Guiyang in Guizhou province (like the first ten, the exact breeds of these dogs are unknown other than that they were crossbreeds). After training, the best twenty of these ninety dogs were then selected. Ten wolfdogs bred in Beijing, twenty 'civil dogs' plus an additional ten 'shepherd dogs' imported from East Germany were added to the pool from which the Kunming Dog was developed. The Chinese Public Security Bureau officially recognized the Kunming Dog as a breed in 1988. Kunming Dogs are used by the Chinese military and police, and have also found their way into use as civilian watchdogs and guard dogs.|$|E

50|$|The Dutch Shepherd was {{discovered}} as a naturally occurring <b>shepherd's</b> dog <b>type</b> {{living in the}} rural areas of the larger region that today includes the Netherlands. When the first breed standard was written in 1898, the coat could be any colour. But, in 1914, it was decided to allow only brindle to distinguish the breed from the then similar German Shepherd and Belgian Shepherd. The breeds eventually diverged into the three distinct breeds as known today. However, the Dutch Shepherd remains nearly the same dog it was more than 100 years ago. Today, the Dutch Shepherd is distinguished from the Belgian and German Shepherds by the details specified in the breed standard, primarily of the head.|$|R

40|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) {{of the brain}} using perfusion tracers allows estimation of regional brain perfusion. This allows in vivo examination of brain function {{in the setting of}} neuropsychologic and pathophysiologic changes. However functional imaging data on brain perfusion in dogs are limited. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the scintigraphic regional perfusion pattern of the normal canine brain. Ten healthy <b>shepherd</b> <b>type</b> dogs were injected with 925 MBq Technetium- 99 m ethyl cysteinate (ECD) 20 minutes before the examination. Acquisition was performed using a triple head gamma camera equipped with fanbeam collimators. Uniform attenuation correction and triple energy window correction were applied. Computed tomographic images were obtained from the same dogs, reoriented along the orbito-meatal axis and SPECT perfusion data were coregistered to the CT-volume data. Based on morphological and suggested brain divisions, regions-of-interest (ROIs) were defined for the bilateral frontocerebral, temporocerebral, parietocerebral, occipitocerebral, cerebellar, thalamic, and striatal area. Regional count density was normalized on total counts. All dogs had the highest uptake in the thalamic/striatal area compared to a rather homogeneous cerebral uptake. No significant left/right count differences were found, but a rostro-caudal gradient (+ 12 - 13 %) was present. In this group, age and gender did not influence the perfusion pattern. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|New Zealand Heading Dogs {{are very}} aware of their {{surroundings}} {{and are able to}} adapt to quick movements that are in their line of sight, suiting their <b>shepherding</b> requirements. These <b>types</b> of dogs are specifically bred and trained to work in farms to circle sheep. They are classified as medium to large dogs with long, smooth, straight hair. Purebred New Zealand Heading Dogs are usually black and white, but some may be tan or other colors. The breed requires an agrarian environment and are generally not intended to be kept as house pets. New Zealand Heading Dogs are extremely intelligent, active dogs with instinct to herd animals; if left alone for too long, they may try to escape and or herd small animals or children.|$|R
40|$|Flocking {{behavior}} {{is very common}} in nature, {{and there have been}} ongoing research efforts to simulate such behavior in computer animations and robotics applications. <b>Shepherding</b> is one <b>type</b> of flocking behavior in which an outside agent guides or shepherds the members of the flock. Simulating this shepherding {{behavior is}} interesting because of its commonality in nature. A sheep dog guiding a flock of sheep, cowboys driving a herd of cattle, a predator hunting a group of its prey, and a flock of geese following a mother goose are all examples of shepherding behaviors found in nature. Currently, little work has been done on simulating these types of behaviors. In this work, we investigate ways to improve existent methods of simulating singleagent shepherding behaviors. We define the locomotion of a shepherd, and we explore methods of increasing the efficiency of a shepherd in herding a flock from a start to a goal position. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Interventional cardiac {{procedures}} are traditionally performed using fluoroscopy, or, more recently, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Neither modality is widely available to practicing cardiologists worldwide. We examined whether balloon valvuloplasty of pulmonic stenosis (PS) and transarterial occlusion of {{patent ductus arteriosus}} (PDA) in dogs could be performed safely with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Animals, materials and methods: A prospective consecutive case series of 26 client-owned dogs with PS (n = 10) and PDA (n = 16). The cardiovascular procedures were performed using TTE. Each dog was positioned on a standard echocardiography table in right lateral recumbency (dogs with PS) or left lateral recumbency (dogs with PDA). Guide wires, balloon catheters, Amplatz® Canine Ductal Occluder (ACDO) delivery sheaths, and ACDO were imaged by standard echocardiographic views optimized to allow visualization of the defects and devices. Results: Procedures were performed successfully without major complications in 20 dogs. In 2 dogs (German <b>Shepherds)</b> with <b>Type</b> III PDA, ACDO placement was unsuccessful; 2 other German Shepherds {{were excluded from the}} procedure because their ductal diameters, measured echocardiographically, exceeded the limits of the maximal ACDO size. Two dogs weighing ≤ 3. 5 kg had suboptimal echocardiographic visualization of the PDA and were considered too small for safe ACDO deployment. All intravascular devices {{at the level of the}} heart and great vessels appeared hyperechoic on TTE image and could be clearly monitored and guided in real-time. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that TTE monitoring can guide each step of pulmonic balloon valvuloplasty and PDA occlusion without fluoroscopy...|$|R
40|$|We {{should also}} {{consider}} the difficulties that the operator has to overcome during the implantation of this stent. Passage of the MGS through tortuous, calcified or small diameter vessels is very challen-ging, if not impossible. The few cases, where we failed to advance the stent through the lesion, were <b>shepherds</b> crook <b>type</b> of RCA anatomy. Another important issue is the compromising of side branches {{by the presence of}} polymer mesh sleeve on its external surface. In addition, there are no data about its behavior in high-thrombotic volume, especially when no other EPD were used. In our study, there were a few cases with thrombus load grade five, where M-Guard was used with the aspiration catheter and the effectiveness of their combination was impressive, resulting in TIMI 3 flow with satisfactory blush score. The limitations of our study concern the relatively small number of patients, taking mostly into consideration the subgroup of patients from theMGS group that TAwas not performed. Another aspect is also the lack of a randomized design. In conclusion, in the setting of pPCI, MGS proved to be effective and safe with low TVR and low thrombosis rates at 1 and 12 months, considering the high risk group of STEMI patients. In addition, final TIMI flow and MBG are higher and the incidence of no-reflow is less. That benefit from its use is independent from the performance of TA in pPCI. The authors report no relationships that could be construed as a conflict of interest. References [1] Vlaar Pieter J, Svilaas Tone, van der Horst Iwan C, et al.

40|$|Recently {{proposed}} space missions such as Darwin, LISA and NGGM {{have encouraged}} {{the development of}} electric propulsion thrusters capable of operating in the micro-Newton (N) thrust range. To meet these requirements, radio frequency (RF) gridded ion thrusters need to be scaled down to a few centimetres in size. Due to {{the small size of}} these thrusters, it is important to accurately determine the thermal and performance parameters. To achieve this, an RF ion thruster model has been developed, composed of plasma discharge, 2 D axisymmetric ion extraction, 3 D electromagnetic, 3 D thermal and RF circuit models. The plasma discharge model itself is represented using 0 D global, 2 D axisymmetric and 3 D molecular neutral gas, and Boltzmann electron transport sub-models. This is the rst time such a holistic/comprehensive model has been created. The model was successfully validated against experimental data from the RIT 3. 5 thruster, developed for the NGGM mission. Afterwards, the computational model was used to design an RF gridded ion thruster for an Ion Beam <b>Shepherd</b> (IBS) <b>type</b> space debris removal mission. Normally, the IBS method requires two thrusters: one for impulse transfer (IT) and one for impulse compensation (IC). This thesis proposes a novel thruster concept for the IBS type missions where a single Double-Sided Thruster (DST) simultaneously producing ion beams for the IT and IC purposes is used. The advantage of DST design is that it requires approximately half the RF power compared with two single-ended thrusters and it has a much simpler sub-system architecture, lower cost, and lower total mass. Such a DST thruster was designed, built and tested, with the requirements and constraints taken from the LEOSWEEP space debris removal mission. During the experimental campaign, a successful extraction of two ion beams was achieved. The thesis has shown {{that it is possible to}} control the thrust magnitudes from the IT and IC sides by varying the number of apertures in each ion optics system, proving that the DST concept is a viable alternative for the LOESWEEP mission...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{treatment}} of canine pyoderma {{has become increasingly}} difficult due {{to the development of}} antimicrobial resistance and recurrence of infection. The development and spread of antimicrobial resistance has major implications because treatment failures have been associated with increased mortality, morbidity and costs related to disease. All canine skin samples submitted to Vetdiagnostix Veterinary Pathology Services for microbiological culture and sensitivity between January 2007 and June 2010, from which Staphylococcus intermedius was isolated, were selected for this investigation. A total of 319 samples from dogs of various ages, sexes and breeds from various locations throughout South Africa were obtained. In addition to the antimicrobial susceptibility data, data relating to dog signalment (age, gender, breed), case history and any other aspects of the history provided e. g. diagnosis, sample type and geographical location of the patient were collected. The number of skin samples yielding Staphylococcus intermedius was high in dogs up to the age of 6 years and, then decreased with only a few cases in dogs aged 11 years or older. The distribution of samples collected in 2010 was unusual in that there were two peaks, one in dogs two years old or less and one in 6 to 9 -year-old dogs. With the exception of skin samples taken in 2008, a high percentage of dogs were under the age of one year old. 2008 had a lower percentage of affected dogs less than one year of age compared to the other years. Staphylococcal pyoderma is more common in dogs below the age of five years. Dogs above this age are less likely to contract this condition. The genders tended to be equally distributed throughout the years, with almost equal proportions of affected males and females present. The Bull Terrier <b>types</b> and <b>Shepherd</b> <b>types</b> were grouped separately as they were over-represented and are known to be prone to pyoderma. Large short haired dogs were consistently worse affected throughout the years sampled, followed by the Bull Terrier types. In 2010, small short haired breeds were worse affected compared to the numbers between 2007 and 2009. The monthly distribution, with the exception of 2009, tended to be consistent throughout the years. The unusual temporal distribution in 2009 could be associated with a general distribution in the number of samples compared to the other years sampled. Samples tended to be mainly from practices located in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. This is most likely {{due to the fact that}} the laboratory is located in this province, with a courier network that arranges collection from these practices. Practices in other regions send their samples to the laboratory via private courier companies and the South African Post Office. Antimicrobial resistance of S. intermedius was greatest to ampicillin followed by tetracycline and then potentiated sulphonamides. The results also showed that, in general, antimicrobial resistance was low. Very few methicillin resistant isolates were detected. Temporal trends were not noted, with the exception of ampicillin where isolates became more susceptible and potentiated sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) where isolates were becoming more resistant. Staphylococcus intermedius is significantly less resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, cephalexin, oxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin and gentamicin, with most strains being susceptible to these drugs. Resistance to penicillin and tetracycline is frequently found in Staphylococcus intermedius and is on the increase. Resistance to most other antimicrobials, particularly newer generation antimicrobial agents such as the fluoroquinolones, is still comparatively low. In general, both the Kirby-Bauer and broth dilution MIC tests yielded similar results for the antimicrobial agents tested. The main difference between the two tests was evident in the over-estimation of resistance by the Kirby-Bauer test in the cases of ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, penicillin and doxycycline. This could be related to the instability of these particular drugs in vitro. Inoculum densities may also have played a role, with denser inocula producing smaller zone sizes for the drugs tested. Using the MIC method, all of the isolates tested were found to be completely sensitive to ticarcillin, oxacillin, amoxicillinclavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, gentamicin, amikacin and co-trimoxazole. Of the isolates tested using the MIC method, between 2 - 40 % showed some level of resistance to the following antimicrobials: erythromycin, penicillin, ampicillin, enrofloxacin, clindamycin and marbofloxacin. The highest level of resistance observed was shown to erythromycin. The increase in resistance to the lincosamides, lincomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin may be attributed to the increased use of these drugs in the last decade. Knowledge of trends in bacterial resistance is important for veterinarians when determining treatment for canine skin infections. The information obtained from the analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Staphylococcus intermedius isolated from canine pyoderma cases will provide veterinarians with valuable information on choosing the most appropriate drug to treat S. intermedius skin infections as well as re-enforcing the need for the prudent use of antimicrobial drugs in companion animals.
