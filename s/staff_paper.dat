His mother played organ in the local Presbyterian Church and his older sister learned {{classical}} piano at home, but Lincoln himself did not play until he saw the film Rhapsody in Blue as a young teenager, and rushed home to scribble notes on musical <b>staff</b> <b>paper.</b> He began learning popular songs such as Ary Barroso's Aquarela do Brasil. Playing piano at age 16, Lincoln formed a trio with a cousin and a friend, and performed on a weekly program on Radio Iracema. Lincoln was {{at the same time}} the sports editor for the newspaper Diário do Povo.|$|E

2500|$|A 2003 IMF <b>Staff</b> <b>Paper</b> by Karl Habermeier and Andrei Kirilenko {{found that}} FTTs are [...] "positively related to {{increased}} volatility and lower volume". A {{study of the}} Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges says the FTT created significant increases in volatility because it [...] "would influence not only noise traders, but also those informed traders who {{play the role of}} decreasing volatility in the stock market." [...] A French study of 6,774 daily realized volatility measurements for 4.7 million trades in a four-year period of index stocks trading in the Paris Bourse from 1995 to 1999 reached the same conclusion [...] "that higher transaction costs increase stock return volatility". The French study concluded that this volatility measures [...] "are likely to underestimate the destabilizing role of security transactions since they – unlike large ticks – also reduce the stabilizing liquidity supply".|$|E

2500|$|Allenby was {{promoted}} to temporary lieutenant general on 10 October 1914. As the BEF was expanded in size to two Armies, he was rewarded by being made commander of the Cavalry Corps. On 6 May 1915, Allenby voluntarily left the Cavalry Arm to take up command of V Corps which was engaged at that moment in severe fighting at the Second Battle of Ypres. Commanding a corps seemed to make Allenby's bad temper even worse where anything from a split infinitive in a <b>staff</b> <b>paper</b> to discovering a corpse in the field without the tin helmet that Allenby ordered his men to wear sent Allenby off into a rage. The V Corps was victorious in defeating the German assault but incurred controversially heavy losses in the process through Allenby's tactical policy of continual counter-attacks at the German attacking force. In September 1915, V Corps attempted a diversion of German strength to facilitate the concurrent British offensive at Loos. They executed a minor attack in the Hooge Sector in the Ypres Salient under Allenby's direction, which once again incurred substantial losses to its units involved in the affair. In October 1915, Allenby {{was promoted}} to lead the British Third Army, being made lieutenant-general (substantive rank) on 1 January 1916. In mid-Summer 1916, he was the Army Commander {{in support of the}} launch of the Battle of the Somme offensive, with responsibility for the abortive assault by 3rd Army troops on the trench fortress of the Gommecourt salient, which failed with severe casualties to the units under his command in the operation. By this time in 1916, Archibald Wavell who was one of Allenby's staff officers and supporters, wrote that Allenby's temper seemed to [...] "confirm the legend that 'the Bull' was merely a bad-tempered, obstinate hot-head, a 'thud-and-blunder' general". Allenby harboured doubts about the leadership of the commander of the BEF, General Sir Douglas Haig, but refused to allow any of his officers to say anything critical about Haig. However, despite Allenby's rages and obsession with applying the rules in a way that often seemed petty, Allenby's staff officers found an intellectually curious general who was interested in finding new ways of breaking the stalemate. J. F. C. Fuller called Allenby [...] "a man I grew to like and respect", a man who always asked his staff if they had any new ideas about how to win the war. Allenby had wider interests than many other British generals, reading books on every conceivable subject from botany to poetry and was noted for his critical intellect. An officer who had dinner with Allenby at his headquarters in a French château recalled: ...|$|E
