After the ensuing kickoff, Jacksonville cornerback Aaron Beasley intercepted Marino's first pass {{of the game and}} returned it five yards to the Dolphins 41-yard line, setting a 45-yard field goal from Mike Hollis. Following a three-and-out for Miami, Tom Hutton's 57-yard punt pinned the Jaguars back at their own 9-yard line. But two plays later, Taylor took off down the right sideline for an NFL playoff record 90-yard touchdown run. Then on Miami's next possession, defensive end Tony Brackens forced a fumble from Marino and dove on the ball. With most players on both teams thinking he was down by contact, Brackens got up and started celebrating while the Dolphins offense walked off the field, but his teammate Bryce Paup realized that no one had touched Brackens and the play was still ongoing. He ran up to Brackens, <b>shoved</b> <b>him</b> in the back, and told him to start running, and Brackens ended up returning the ball 16 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

Throughout the match, the Roadie distracted the referee, allowing Jarrett to perform illegal tactics to gain an advantage. Michaels managed to escape a sleeper hold minutes later, gaining {{the upper hand in}} the process. After several highspot moves by Michaels, The Roadie shook the ring-ropes while Michaels was on the top rope, grounding Michaels in the process. Jarrett attempted to regain the advantage by performing the Figure four leglock, but Michaels reversed the hold into a near-fall. Jarrett went for the submission hold again, but Michaels <b>shoved</b> <b>him</b> into the referee, sending the official to the ground. Michaels tried to seize the advantage with a Superkick, but the Roadie grabbed Michaels. Jarrett performed a Crossbody, getting a near-fall in the process. The finish to the match came when the Roadie accidentally tripped Jarrett. Jarrett got back up only to walk into Michaels's Superkick. Michaels pinned him and became Intercontinental Champion. It was revealed later in the show that Jarrett and The Roadie were involved in a backstage confrontation with each other, signaling an end to their on-screen friendship.|$|E

Before the match began, RVD {{attacked}} Matt Hardy from behind with a steel chair. The match started {{back and forth}} with a quick pace. Hardy gained the advantage after a dropkick to the back. After Hardy missed a crossbody, RVD performed a standing moonsault, a lifting double underhook facebuster, and a rolling thunder. RVD then climbed the turnbuckles, but Hardy <b>shoved</b> <b>him</b> outside. Outside, Hardy walked the barricade, but RVD sent him into the crowd. After a moonsault from the barricade, Hardy was placed over the barricade, and RVD performed a spinning heel kick off the apron. Hardy fought back with a sunset flip powerbomb from the apron, took out a ladder, and climbed it. However, RVD tipped the ladder, causing Hardy to fall. RVD attempted to use a chair, but Hardy used the ladder. After Hardy hit RVD with the chair, RVD came back with a Van Daminator, sending Hardy off the stage. Back in the ring, RVD performed a Chair Surf, and attempted a split-legged moonsault, but Hardy blocked it with his knees. Hardy followed with a DDT, a German suplex, and a sitout jawbreaker. Later on, RVD avoided a Swanton Bomb, RVD placed the title belt on Hardy, and performed a Five Star Frog Splash onto the title. RVD then pinned Hardy to win the Hardcore title.|$|E
25|$|Three Israeli commandos were {{captured}}. The first captured soldier, {{the commanding}} officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed his helmet, and <b>shoved</b> <b>him</b> into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier {{was surrounded by a}} team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued. The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off {{with his back to the}} hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang onto the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a chain around his neck and choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck, where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, and dragged him into the lounge. The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed. One of the soldiers said that he was beaten after he began moving and yelling that one of the soldiers needed a doctor, and another said that he was placed onto a couch, beaten, and threatened that he would be beaten every time he moved. Although radical activists attempted to harm them further, more moderate passengers intervened and protected the soldiers. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. Hasan Huseyin Uysal, a Turkish doctor, cleaned the blood off their faces and tended to facial cuts.|$|E

Amid the uproar, recalled Barras, Saint-Just [...] "did not leave the platform, in spite of the interruptions which would have driven any one else away. He only came down a few steps, then mounted again, to continue his discourse proudly... Motionless, unmoved, he seemed to defy everyone with his calm." ...|$|E

Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance.

500|$|The feud between The Mega-Maniacs (Brutus Beefcake and Hulk Hogan) and WWF Tag Team Champions Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) {{stemmed from}} a {{legitimate}} parasailing accident in 1990 that forced Beefcake to undergo reconstructive surgery to his face. He was unable to wrestle again until the February 15, 1993, episode of Raw. He faced DiBiase in his return match, after which DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to {{hit him in the}} face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart, who managed Money Inc., repeatedly got in the way before Schyster <b>shoved</b> <b>him</b> out of the ring. Schyster then hit Beefcake in the face with the briefcase. Hart later claimed that he felt the need to [...] "step up and do the right thing" [...] and that he [...] "had a change of heart", and his intervention led to him becoming a babyface, or crowd favorite. Shortly thereafter, Hulk Hogan made his return to the WWF and joined with Beefcake, and manager Jimmy Hart, to form The Mega-Maniacs and challenge Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first group}} of three {{officers}} was turned away by Major Andrew M.

2500|$|National media {{attention}} {{was given to}} a 15-second video clip that appeared to show Corwin's Assembly chief of staff, Michael Mallia, repeatedly asking the 78-year-old Davis why he had skipped a campaign debate, followed by Mallia shrieking as Davis apparently <b>shoved</b> <b>him</b> or flapped at the camera. The video clip was circulated by local and national Republican organizations and prompted bipartisan criticism of both Davis and Mallia. Requests to see a longer tape and a tape made by second camera were refused by Corwin and her campaign. In {{an interview with the}} National Journal, Corwin said she thought the video was self-explanatory, and indicated that Mallia had been acting on his own free time, and not as her employee while he was tracking and taping her opponent, Davis. In response to Davis' complaints that he had been harassed, Corwin said, [...] "I've had cameras on me for two months now, and I've never hit anybody ... and I think that's the difference is how you handle a situation like that." [...] One week after the election, Mallia resigned his position as Corwin's chief of staff {{as a result of the}} controversy.|$|E
