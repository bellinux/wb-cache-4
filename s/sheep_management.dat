Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior. This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep.

50|$|Per the NRHP registration, {{the ranch}} was deemed notableas {{a rare and}} well-preserved example of a twentieth-century western sheep {{ranching}} operation in Wyoming as it evolved in the Powder River Basin. The ranch represents traditional Spanish <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> practices that developed in Wyoming, rather than the English system utilized in the early Atlantic colonies. In Wyoming, large herds of sheep were grazed by individual herders across the public domain rather than in fenced pastures. Because of its proximity to the Bighorn Mountains, the practice of transhumance was incorporated into yearly <b>sheep</b> <b>management.</b> Flocks were trailed into the mountains {{during the summer months}} to take advantage of abundant water and forage. During the remainder of the year, herders and their flocks radiated out from Beaver Creek Ranch headquarters in all directions, grazing freely on the public domain, until the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 required permits and grazing fees on public lands. After that date, <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> practices became more orderly, and sheep were required to graze within predetermined boundaries on the public lands surrounding the ranch. The site is also associated with French Basque ethnic influences dating from 1951, when the ranch was acquired by the Harriet family, who were a part of the larger Basque community that developed around Buffalo in the early 1900s.|$|E

40|$|Intensification {{of sheep}} farming in the uplands has caused concern {{in terms of}} {{over-production}} and conservation of wildlife and landscape. Changes in UK agricultural policy to combat these problems are {{likely to result in}} reduced pasture improvement and sheep grazing in the uplands. This paper examines the effects, on three adjacent uplands grasslands, of different intensities of <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> on the soil biota. The effects of short-term removal of sheep grazing by fenced exclosure were also studied. After preliminary investigations the soil Collembola, in particular the fungal-feeding species Onychiurus procampatus, were selected for further study. Field sampling revealed simultaneous trends of decreasing Collembola numbers and increasing total hyphal length and biomass of fungi in the surface soil, together with differences in chemical and physical soil properties, along a gradient of reduced <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> intensity. Similar changes occurred when sheep grazing was removed by fenced exclosures. The abundance of fluorescein diacetate-active hyphae within the surface soil was shown to vary little along the same gradient of reduced <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> intensity. The relative abundance of the seven most commonly isolated species of litter fungi varied along the same gradient of <b>sheep</b> <b>management.</b> The findings are discussed in relation to other grassland studies...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{describes}} {{and compares}} the extensive reindeer management {{to the more}} intensive, but grazing based, <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> system in Sweden. Differences and similarities between the two production systems will be investigated by elucidating the economy, land use and possibilities to influence production and economy through breeding, feeding and product development. The reindeer management area covers {{the northern part of}} Sweden whilst the <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> is dispersed over the country. Both reindeer and sheep are ruminants and have relatively high demands on the quality and digestibility of the feed however reindeers graze on mountain-and forest lands whilst sheep often graze inaccessible areas or cultivated grasslands. Selection intensity is generally lower in the reindeer management compared to the intensity in sheep breeding. The size of the annual income for a reindeer owner with 400 reindeer is calculated to approximately 100 000 SEK. The annual income for a sheep farmer with 400 animals can vary between 80 000 and 200 00 SEK. In both cases the income is based on the sale of meat and other products from the animals, but also from allowances. The conclusion is that reindeer- and <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> in Sweden differs in many ways despite the animals not being much different from each other. The <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> is often small-scale whereas the reindeer management usually is large-scale. The way the animals are kept differs since in most cases there is only one person owning the sheep and the land they are kept on. In reindeer management the companies have several owners, each having a different amount of reindeers, not owning the land themselves...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDespite {{the overall}} {{progress}} of sheep farming in Brazil, infections with the gastrointestinal parasite Haemonchus contortus represent one {{the most important}} problems in sheep production, aggravated by the increasing resistance of nematodes to traditional anthelmintic drugs caused by inadequate <b>sheep</b> flock <b>management</b> by breeders. Ethnopharmacological data indicate Annona muricata as a promising alternative for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes because of its general anthelmintic properties. The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro anthelmintic effects of A. muricata aqueous leaf extract against eggs, infective larvae and adult forms of parasitic nematode H. contortus. At higher doses, A. muricata extract showed 84. 91 % and 89. 08 % of efficacy in egg hatch test (EHT) and larval motility test (LMT), respectively. In the adult worm motility test, worms were completely immobilized within the first 6 – 8 h of nematode exposition to different dilutions of extract. Phytochemical analysis indicated the presence of phenolic compounds in A. muricata aqueous leaf extract that {{may be responsible for}} the anthelmintic effects observed.

40|$|Recent {{development}} in automatic <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> systems based on radio frequency tags, in-race readers and automatic drafting equipment creates opportunities for strategic nutritional management of individual animals. This paper describes a simple simulation model for investigating {{the implications of}} different supplementary feeding systems in terms of potential benefits of increased lambing percentages. Four different feeding systems are compared: (i) feeding each animal according to its individual requirements to reach a weight of 52 kg prior to joining; (ii) feeding 0. 3 kg daily to each animal; (iii) feeding {{the same amount of}} feed as in (ii) but given twice per week to the whole group; and (iv) as for (iii), but with variation in intake randomly allocated across all weight ranges. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was set at 8 : 1 for twice weekly feeding and at 5 : 1 for daily feeding. Although the highest lambing percentage was achieved using the feeding system in scenario (i), the most profitable feeding regime was (ii). The results confirm that feeding restricted amounts of supplement twice weekly may not be a cost-effective way of increasing ovulation rate and lambing percentage. On the other hand, precision nutrition, in conjunction with electronic <b>sheep</b> <b>management</b> systems, may increase efficiency and profitability of the ewe flock. Although the current study deals only with lambing rate, it is likely that precision nutrition may be cost-effective in managing ewe nutrition prior to lambing.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} effect of flooding upon PCDD/F and PCB levels in milk, beef and lamb, produced on the floodplains of industrial river catchments. Our unique dataset included more than 200 samples analysed for PCDD/Fs and PCBs over two data collection phases (1998 - 1999 & 2008 - 2010) from working farms. A robust paired study design was adopted with samples taken from flood-prone farms and nearby control farms not subject to flooding. On industrial river catchments regular flooding is associated with higher PCDD/Fs and PCBs levels in soils and grass. This contamination may be transferred to food but the impact varied by food type. These contrasts {{may be due to}} physiological differences between animals, the ages at which they are sent to market and differences in animal husbandry. To minimise the risks of producing food on flood-prone land in catchments with a history of industrialisation, as well as on any land with elevated PCDD/F and PCB levels this research suggests a number of options. The choice of livestock may be important and as an example in our study beef cattle appeared to accumulate PCDD/Fs to a higher degree than <b>sheep.</b> Land <b>management</b> may also play a role and could include minimising the time that livestock spend on such land or feeding commercial feed, low in PCDD/Fs and PCBs, where appropriate...|$|R
