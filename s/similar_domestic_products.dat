Dumping is the practice of selling a product in export destination countries at a price below the normal price which aims to dominate the market abroad. Dumping is often made by a country to capture the international market, so {{it is the case}} that is high figure in international trade. Indonesia is ranked five on charges of dumping. Dumping is the practice of dishonest trading, but the dumping was not prohibited by the WTO. Importing countries can apply anti-dumping duties against dumping of products to prevent or reduce the effects of serious losses on <b>similar</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>products.</b> Islam recognizes the term dumping by the term 'siyasah al-ighraq' or slam the price. In contrast to world trade law, Islam prohibits the dumping as in the provision of the Prophet hadith, because it will cause misery or bankruptcy of producers of similar goods...|$|E

40|$|The WTO leaves {{discretion}} over {{environmental policies}} to its members, but requests that a fundamental non-discrimination principle is respected: National Treatment (NT). The provision seeks to prevent protectionist use of domestic policy instruments, requesting that when an imported product is sufficiently <b>similar</b> to a <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> {{they are treated}} identically. WTO adjudicators will often face severe informational problems in environmental disputes. Important for the practical implementation of NT is therefore the allocation {{of the burden of}} proof (BoP). This paper highlights basic implications of the BoP for the occurrence of judicial errors, for the environment and for welfare, using a setting where NT serves its intended role of supporting negotiated tariff liberalization. The paper suggests that NT may indeed constrain environmental policies, but that this may be desirable from an efficiency point of view. Also, BoP rules that benefit the environment may not benefit global welfare, and conversely. National Treatment Burden of proof Environment GATT WTO Trade agreements...|$|R

Given the economic changes that Greece and Europe in general has undergone during the years from 2001 to 2013, {{the purpose of this}} study is first to present the number of Greek productions and co-productions in three major European Film Festivals during the years 2001 - 2013 and secondly to compare Greece and European countries with <b>similar</b> Gross <b>Domestic</b> <b>Product</b> (GDP) in 2007 and 2011, before and during the economical crisis and with similar amount of population, in terms of their co-productions in the three above mentioned film festivals. Our findings show that although there was a decline in film production and co-production in Greece during the years from 2004 to 2009, Greek cinema in general witnesses a revival from 2009 onwards. In addition, the number of co-productions is closely linked to the fame of a director. The comparison of European countries with similar GDP and similar or equal amount of population to Greece has shown that the number of co-productions is probably dependent on their geographical position, the more centrally in Europe are located the more co-productions they present, as well as their multicultural environment and the proximity of languages spoken in the countries involved. However, given that Greece is not a centrally located country in Europe, some recommendations are made in terms of legal framework and tax incentives which will facilitate Greek European co-productions with subsequent benefits for Greek society...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{traditional}} indicator of Green GDP and EDP, which ignored the ecological content when {{used to assess}} the regional sustainable development level, we proposed a new indicator, "EcoDP". which consists of five sub-indicators: eco-service <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> eco-disaster <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> eco-construction <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> eco-threat <b>domestic</b> <b>product,</b> and eco-protection cost input, to distinguish {{the traditional}} EDP; we also suggest that the "EcoDP" should rather be divided into two main types: the "EcoDP value-stocked" and the "EcoDP value-added". An analysis is carried out of China's "EcoDP" change from 1999 to 2008, providing the following figures for the past 10 years: eco-service <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> rose by 0. 11 trillion yuan; eco-disaster <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> increased by (sic) 1. 03 trillion; eco-construction <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> dropped by (sic) 9. 8 billion; eco-threat <b>domestic</b> <b>product</b> rose by (sic) 114. 4 billion; eco-protection cost input grew by (sic) 431. 1 billion; and then we discussed the reasons for this change in China's "EcoDP" from the perspectives of ecosystem, environment, resources and energies.
