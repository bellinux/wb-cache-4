50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>energy</b> is {{produced}} by the consumption of energy carriers. It is official policy worldwide and also in Ethiopia to replace primary energy consumption through <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and energy carriers are the vehicles to store this <b>secondary</b> <b>energy.</b> By doing so, the need to use primary energy sources for daily life {{will be replaced by}} the need to use energy carriers. This will relieve some pressure from the primary energy sources of Ethiopia (wood, forests) and will also prevent the country from using its own domestic and non-renewable primary energy sources such as coal and oil shales.|$|E
50|$|EROEI is {{only one}} {{consideration}} {{and may not be}} the most important one in energy policy. Energy independence (reducing international competition for limited natural resources), decrease of greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide and others), and affordability could be more important, particularly when considering <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> sources. While a nation's primary energy source is not sustainable unless it has a use rate less than or equal to its replacement rate, the same is not true for <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> supplies. Some of the energy surplus from the primary energy source can be used to create the fuel for <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> sources, such as for transportation.|$|E
30|$|THERESIA {{assumes that}} all primary energy sources are once {{converted}} into <b>secondary</b> <b>energies,</b> i.e., thermal energy, petroleum products and electricity, although some sectors actually use primary energy sources directly. Under the constraints on monetary balance conditions and technological constraints, THERESIA maximizes the discounted {{sum of the}} aggregated consumption functions.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} semiempirical {{model for}} singly and doubly differential and total ionization cross sections for electron production by electron impact is presented. The model {{is discussed in}} relation to several theoretically required constraints. Available experimental data for hydrogen and helium targets are examined, and recommended values of the data are given for all ranges of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>energies</b> and angles of ejection...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} which gives cross sections (differential in the ejected <b>secondary</b> electron <b>energy)</b> for the ionization of atoms and molecules in proton or electron collisions. The model {{is in the}} form of an analytical equation which holds for all primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>energies</b> and for any target gas for which certain parameters are known. The accuracy is estimated to be 15 - 20 %. The model is based on the classical binary encounter model modified to agree with the Bethe theory at high energies and, for proton impact, with the molecular promotion model at low energies. For multi-shell targets, the partial cross sections for the shells, are added. The model equation may be integrated to yield such quantities as the total ionization cross section, the stopping cross section due to ionization, and the average <b>secondary</b> electron <b>energy.</b> For proton impact the integrations must be done numerically or by using approximations. For electron impact the equation is simpler and may easily be analytically integrated...|$|R
50|$|Primary {{energy is}} {{converted}} {{in many ways}} to energy carriers, also known as <b>secondary</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{energy mix}} {{is the group}} of {{different}} primary energy sources from which <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> for direct use - usually electricity - is produced. Primary {{energy in the form}} of fossil fuels is nowadays still mostly used directly for motor-driven vehicles, i.e. transport. Further energy conversion of the co-produced waste heat after burning is not possible.|$|E
50|$|Mild {{hypothermia}} {{helps prevent}} disruptions to cerebral metabolism both during and following cerebral insults. Hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and oxygen {{and reduces the}} loss of high energy phosphates during hypoxia-ischaemia and during secondary cerebral energy failure, and reduces delayed cerebral lactic alkalosis. The simultaneous increase in cytotoxic oedema and loss of cerebral cortical activity that accompanies <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> failure is also prevented.|$|E
30|$|To {{measure the}} {{sustainability}} of Asia nations from 2008 to 2014, this study proposes a new use of a DEA intermediate approach, analytically locating between conventional (radial and non-radial) approaches. Using the new approach, this study is interested in measuring how to improve the level of sustainability in Asian from an efficient usage of their primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>energies.</b> That {{is the purpose of}} this research.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the sensitivity of}} the MONK criticality code to a variety of nuclear data parameters. The number of equiprobable bins for both <b>secondary</b> <b>energies</b> and <b>secondary</b> angles are varied; the effect of varying the background cross section employed by the sub-group representation in the unresolved region is examined; and variations in cross section resonance reconstruction tolerances are considered. To validate these options we use integral data including results from the GODIVA, JEZEBEL and ZEBRA- 8 H experiments. The results from this study will be used to optimise data used in the MONK criticality code. ...|$|R

5000|$|Striker - Transforms into a Stegosaurus, Striker {{is deeply}} {{loyal to the}} Maximal cause. His hide is {{constructed}} of specially treated poly-alloy armor, and plates across his back serve as <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> receptors. His tail can cause seismic variations in the gravitational field, and contains a unique grappling rocket that penetrates all Vehicon armor. He is a recolored version of Saberback from Beast Wars Neo.|$|E
50|$|Gas is a {{storable}} {{primary energy}} resource, whereas electricity is an instantaneous <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> vector. Energy {{flows from the}} gas grid, but vice versa. 250 times more energy is stored as gas in UK than as electricity. The capital cost of gas transmission is 1/15th the cost per MWkm of electricity transmission. 5 times more energy flows through the gas grid than the electricity grid at the Winter demand peak.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the SWNHs, the scientists made efforts to study the structure of this new material. In 2000, a detailed X-ray diffraction examination showed that the interhorn-wall distance was 0.4 nm, greater than the interlayer spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). Thus SWNH aggregates should have both microporosity and mesoporosity originating from the above specific structure. An exact surface characterization of SWNHs can extend the application possibilities to <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> storage.|$|E
40|$|Discrepancies between {{previous}} experimental {{values of}} differential cross sections for electron-impact ionization of water vapor and recent model calculations {{have been largely}} resolved. A new measurement with improved suppression of spurious electrons has removed most of the discrepancy in the midrange of detected electron energies. A second discrepancy at <b>secondary</b> <b>energies</b> just below the primary energy has been explained by a more accurate accounting for electrons scattered at angles between zero and the minimum angle of the experimental apparatus. The improved data show more clearly the oxygen K-shell edge in the spectra at small angles and the Bethe ridge at angles up to 902 ̆ 2. The forward peak seen in the earlier data is no longer present...|$|R
40|$|The {{convergent}} close-coupling (CCC) {{method is}} applied to the calculation of electron–helium ionization doubly differential cross sections (DDCSs) at low to intermediate incident energies. We re-examine the CCC calculations and measurements of Röder et al (1997 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 30 1309 – 22) by making allowance for the step-function behaviour of the underlying CCC-calculated amplitudes. As done previously, the experimental DDCS were normalized at energies below 100 eV using the 100 eV CCC calculation to determine analyser properties at several <b>secondary</b> <b>energies.</b> In addition, substantially larger calculations are presented, to check the convergence. The agreement between the experiment and the calculations as a whole is much improved on the situation reported earlier...|$|R
50|$|Glycogen {{serves as}} the <b>secondary</b> {{long-term}} <b>energy</b> storage in animal and fungal cells, with the primary energy stores being held in adipose tissue. Glycogen is made primarily by the liver and the muscles, but can also be made by glycogenesis within the brain and stomach.|$|R
5000|$|Energy {{dependence}} {{in general}} refers to either mankind's general dependence on primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> for energy consumption (fuel, transport, automation, etc.). In a narrower sense, it may describe {{the dependence of}} one country on energy resources from another country. Energy dependency shows {{the extent to which}} an economy relies upon imports in order to meet its energy needs. The indicator is calculated as net imports divided by the sum of gross inland energy consumption plus bunkers. Eurostat ...|$|E
50|$|Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) is a {{term used}} to {{indicate}} the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes. For the whole world TPES nearly equals primary energy PE but for countries TPES and PE differ in quantity and quality. Usually <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> is involved, e.g., import of an oil refinery product, so TPES is often not PE. P in TPES has not the same meaning as in PE. It refers to energy needed as input to produce some or all energy for end-users.|$|E
5000|$|Flocculation {{occurs when}} the {{dispersed}} drops group together throughout the continuous phase, but don't lose their individual identities. The driving force for flocculation is a weak van der Waals attraction between drops at large distances, which {{is known as the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> minimum. An electrostatic repulsion between the surfaces prevents the drops from touching and merging, stabilizing the macroemulsion. The rate of diffusion limited encounters is equal to the upper limit for the decrease in droplet concentration and can be represented by the following equation: ...|$|E

40|$|An Incremental Dynamic Programming {{program is}} {{developed}} to optimize both the rm and <b>secondary</b> <b>energies</b> of hydroelectric generation at monthly periods. First, the six-stage flood routing program {{developed in a}} previous study is applied sequentially to the Yedigöze, Catalan, and Seyhan dams, all on the Seyhan River in Turkey, for 18 combinations resulting from dierent active storages, and optimum flood operation policies for all three dams are determined. Second, the Dynamic Programming program is applied to these three dams with 18 combinations, and optimum hydroelectricity generation policies for all three dams are computed. Finally, the optimum active and flood retention storages for the three dams are determined so as to maximize the net dierence of the probability-weighted present worths of (hydroelectricity benets) -(flood damage costs) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} {{ranges of}} photoelectron primaries and Auger electrons {{depend on their}} respective energies. These energies depend on the energy of incident radiation and on {{the composition of the}} resist. There is considerable room for optimum selection (reference 3 of the article). When Auger electrons have lower energies than primary photoelectrons, they have shorter ranges. Both decay to secondaries which interact with chemical bonds. When <b>secondary</b> <b>energies</b> are too low, they fail to break the chemical bonds and cease to affect print resolution. Experiments prove that the combined range is less than 20 nm. On the other hand, the secondaries follow a different trend below ≈30 eV: the lower the energy, the longer the mean free path though they are not then able to affect resist development.|$|R
5000|$|In thermodynamics, {{the thermal}} {{efficiency}} (...) is a dimensionless performance {{measure of a}} device that uses thermal energy, such as an internal combustion engine, a steam turbine or a steam engine, a boiler, a furnace, or a refrigerator for example. For a power cycle, thermal efficiency indicates {{the extent to which}} the energy added by heat (primary energy) is converted to net work output (<b>secondary</b> <b>energy).</b> In the case of a refrigeration or heat pump cycle, thermal efficiency indicates {{the extent to which the}} energy added by work is converted to net heat output.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{carriers}} are obtained through a man-made conversion process from primary energy sources. Most {{suitable for the}} production of energy {{carriers are}} abundant and renewable primary energy sources (like sun, water, wind, etc.) while the use of precious and limited non-renewable sources like oil is not necessary and is usually avoided as much as possible. A direct use of abundant renewable primary energy sources (sun, water, etc...) is usually not possible in technical processes, so it is better to use them to produce energy carriers to store energy that can later be consumed as <b>secondary</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
50|$|DESSTinEE is {{designed}} to investigate assumptions about the technical requirements for energy transport - particularly electricity - and {{the scale of the}} economic challenge to develop the necessary infrastructure. Forty countries are considered in and around Europe and ten forms of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> are supported. The model uses a predictive simulation technique, rather than solving for either partial or general equilibrium. The model projects annual energy demands for each country to 2050, synthesizes hourly profiles for electricity demand in 2010 and 2050, and simulates the least-cost generation and transmission of electricity around the region.|$|E

40|$|The {{profiling}} of {{end walls}} in turbines {{has proved to}} be effective in reducing secondary flows and losses in turbines, both in cascades and in a turbine representative rig. This paper presents a simple method for the design of end walls using the philosophy that the blade (or rather flow) curvature causes the cross passage pressure gradient, so that mirroring the blade curvature on the end-wall should assist in canceling this effect. Three alternative end-wall profiles have been designed based on the camber line of the blades. From a CFD investigation into the effects of these profiles, they should all be effective in reducing the secondary flow within the cascade. The best profile extended upstream and downstream of the blades to attempt to overcome the problems associated with sharp curvature at inlet and exit from the blade row. For the best profile the CFD predicts a 6 % reduction in secondary loss and a 61 % reduction in <b>secondary</b> kinetic <b>energy.</b> Whilst the loss predictions are not expected to be accurate, the reduction in <b>secondary</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> is likely to be similar to that achieved if the profile were tested experimentally. Experience with testing of an earlier end wall (Hartland et al [1]) suggests that there {{is likely to be a}} substantial reduction in secondary loss accompanying this level of reduction in <b>secondary</b> kinetic <b>energy...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{dispatching}} {{problems of}} instantaneous reserve and spinning reserve of power {{system will be}} more and more outstanding with the increase of the proportion of renewable energy sources, and the security of <b>secondary</b> and end-use <b>energies</b> will be severely challenged. Without strong and reliable wide-area transmission grids, and intelligent and flexible initiative power distribution networks, it is impossible to replace fossil fuels with electric power on a large scale or coordinate the optimization of various primary, <b>secondary</b> and end-use <b>energies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Subcoal {{technology}} {{is used to}} process paper plastic waste fractions into a substitute for coal or lignite. The fuel pellets {{can be used as}} <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> source in industrial furnaces, such as lime kilns and cement kilns, coal-fired power stations and blast furnaces. Subcoal has a caloric value comparable with lignite. The technology was developed by the Dutch chemical company DSM. A study by CE Delft revealed that for the paper-plastic fraction of household waste, the Subcoal route has a better climate and overall environmental score as compared to the incineration in a waste incineration plant.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid power trains use {{diesel-electric}} or turbo-electric {{to power}} railway locomotives, buses, heavy goods vehicles, mobile hydraulic machinery, and ships. A diesel/turbine engine drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump, which powers electric/hydraulic motor(s) - strictly an electric/hydraulic transmission (not a hybrid), unless it can accept power from outside. With large vehicles conversion losses decrease, and the advantages in distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical elements become more prominent, especially when powering multiple drives — e.g. driven wheels or propellers. Until recently most heavy vehicles had little <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> storage, e.g. batteries/hydraulic accumulators — excepting non-nuclear submarines, {{one of the}} oldest production hybrids, running on diesels while surfaced and batteries when submerged. Both series and parallel setups were used in WW2 submarines.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrogen}} bomb primarily has 2 units, an atomic bomb, {{which was the}} primary unit and a <b>secondary</b> <b>energy</b> unit. The first stage of the {{hydrogen bomb}} resembled the layer cake type design, except the main {{difference is that the}} explosion is carried out by an atomic device, rather than a conventional explosive. This design was initially postulated by Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller in 1941. Teller insisted that they should ignite deuterium by some fission weapon. The hydrogen bomb was a challenge, and would be more powerful and destructive than the atomic bomb. The fusion cell itself was not very powerful, coming out to about 17.6MeV, but the quantity of hydrogen fuel can be scaled up to make the weapon as large as desired.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the ideal}} <b>secondary</b> <b>energies</b> in the future and has {{attracted}} considerable attention all over the world. The storage of hydrogen is the most critical issue for the application of hydrogen energy. The application of hydrogen requires the development of an efficient and effective method for hydrogen storage that can store hydrogen safely and supply it at near room temperature and ambient pressure. In recent years, attention has been mainly focused on 'solid hydrogen storage materials. Borohydrides, alanates and amides composed of light elements possess quite high hydrogen storage capacity and good safety so that they are viewed {{as one of the most}} promising hydrogen storage materials. The recent studies of these light elements hydrogen storage materials and their composite systems are reviewed in this paper. At the same time, the development trend of light elements hydrogen storage materials is also introduced...|$|R
