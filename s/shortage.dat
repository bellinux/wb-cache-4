5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver <b>shortage.</b> , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated <b>shortage</b> of 20,000 drivers. That <b>shortage</b> was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual <b>shortage</b> of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E

40|$|Skill <b>shortages</b> {{are often}} {{portrayed as a}} major problem for the economies of many {{countries}} including the Australian economy. Yet, there is surprisingly little evidence about their prevalence, causes and consequences. This paper attempts to improve our understanding about these issues by using econometric methods to analyse the Business Longitudinal Database, an Australian panel data-set with information about skill <b>shortages</b> in small- and medium-sized businesses during 2004 / 05. We use this information to: (1) explore the incidence of skill <b>shortages</b> and the business attributes that are associated with them; (2) identify which businesses face more complex skill <b>shortages,</b> as measured by the number of different causes reported simultaneously; and, uniquely, (3) examine how this complexity affects a business response to skill <b>shortages</b> and aspects of their subsequent performance. We show that complex skill <b>shortages</b> are more likely than simpler (single-cause) skill <b>shortages</b> to persist and to trigger defensive responses from businesses. We reject the conception of skill <b>shortages</b> as a homogenous phenomenon, and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between skill <b>shortages</b> according to whether they have simple or complex causes...|$|R
40|$|Concern {{has been}} {{increasing}} about drug <b>shortages</b> inCanada. The literature, especially empirical, on this topic and {{on the topic of}} cross-border drug trade is lim-ited. Similar concerns about drug <b>shortages</b> in the United States began to appear in the literature in the late 1990 s and have continued into the third millennium. 1, 2 These <b>shortages</b> increase with each passing year, with one American centre reporting annual increases in <b>shortages</b> from 1996 through 2002, 3 along with a 600 % increase from 1996 to 2000 in the number of <b>shortages</b> that actually affected patient care. 4 While some research has been done on the frequency and impact of drug <b>shortages</b> on hospi-tal and health system pharmacies in the US, {{little is known about the}} frequency and impact of <b>shortages</b> on commu-nity pharmacies. 3, 5 What causes drug <b>shortages?</b> The causes of drug <b>shortages</b> are multivariate and can be categorized as either supply or demand problems. 6 Drug supply problems may be related to manufacturing (e. g., raw material <b>shortages),</b> communication (e. g., no advance notice of removal of drugs from the market), or regulatory issues 7 (such as manufacturer compliance problems or drug recalls). Demand-related factors include economics (e. g., generic products), distribution, and drug use pat-terns. In 1996, the Drug Information Service of the University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics began tracking drug <b>shortages</b> in its health system.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Different {{causes of}} drug <b>shortages</b> {{can be linked}} to the {{pharmaceutical}} legal framework, such as: parallel trade, quality requirements, economic decisions to suspend or cease production, etc. However until now no in-depth study of the different regulations affecting drug <b>shortages</b> is available. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an analysis of relevant legal and regulatory measures in the European pharmaceutical framework which influence drug <b>shortages.</b> METHODS: Different European and national legislations governing human medicinal products were analyzed (e. g. Directive 2001 / 83 /EC and Directive 2011 / 62 /EU), supplemented with literature studies. RESULTS: For patented drugs, external price referencing may encompass the largest impact on drug <b>shortages.</b> For generic medicines, internal or external reference pricing, tendering as well as price capping may affect drug <b>shortages.</b> Manufacturing/quality requirements also contribute to drug <b>shortages,</b> since non-compliance leads to recalls. The influence of parallel trade on drug <b>shortages</b> is still rather disputable. CONCLUSION: Price and quality regulations are both important causes of drug <b>shortages</b> or drug unavailability. It can be concluded that there is room for improvement in the pharmaceutical legal framework within the lines drawn by the EU to mitigate drug <b>shortages.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a <b>shortage,</b> and that the <b>shortage</b> should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} skilled and unskilled labour <b>shortages</b> on productivity and wages in the United Kingdom. Skill <b>shortages</b> are higher on average and more variable over the business cycle in the United Kingdom than in comparable economies. Unskilled <b>shortages</b> are comparatively rare, so most of our work concentrates on skill <b>shortages.</b> The bulk of evidence suggests that <b>shortages</b> are related to educational attainment rather than the failure of firms to adjust wages. There are two potential effects of <b>shortages</b> on productivity. First, we argue that <b>shortages</b> add {{to the cost of}} employing skilled workers since a firm must wait longer than usual to fill its vacancies. This may lead firms to employ less skilled and more unskilled workers. Second, labour <b>shortages</b> make it less easy for firms to extract effort from their workers. Both of these effects reduce productivity. We provide empirical evidence from two panel data sets of UK manufacturing from 1980 - 89. We use data from 81 manufacturing industries and also from 33 engineering industries where there is better information on the skill composition of the workforce. Both data sets suggest that the growth of skill <b>shortages</b> in the 1980 s reduced productivity growth by about 0. 4 % per annum (average productivity growth was 5 % per annum). Unskilled <b>shortages</b> had no effect. Finally labour <b>shortages</b> might increase nominal wage growth by putting workers in a stronger bargaining position. Both our data sets suggest that skill <b>shortages</b> raised wage growth over the period by about 1 % per annum (average wage growth was 7 %).

40|$|Objectives: The <b>shortages</b> of {{medicines}} {{have become an}} issue in many countries. This negatively impacts on the quality and efficiency of the care of patients. The scientific evidence regarding drug <b>shortages</b> {{in terms of their}} extent and rationale is still scarce. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize, compare and evaluate potential solutions and legislative frameworks which exist within health care systems across a range of European countries, aimed at preventing or mitigating drug <b>shortages.</b> Methods: The survey was distributed among national health authority and health insurance company experts knowledgeable of the European pharmaceutical markets. It included questions pertaining to: 1) general characteristics of drug shortages; 2) alertness on drug <b>shortages</b> and description of information systems; 3) public service obligations; 4) regulations associated with the problem of drug <b>shortages.</b> Results: The findings are based on feedback from 16 European countries. In the majority of countries formal definitions of drug <b>shortages</b> currently don’t exist. <b>Shortages</b> have occurred in all countries throughout the last decade and have typically been increasing. The types {{of medicines}} experiencing <b>shortages</b> are generally well recognized, however the frequency and duration of <b>shortages</b> are varied and unpredictable. The notification-related obligations of Marketing Authorization Holders in cases which could lead to drug <b>shortages</b> exist in almost all countries. At least one institution per country is involved in national reporting system but access to information is often limited to the public. In the majority of countries, there exist formal obligations associated with supplying medicines to cover patients’ needs so as not to compromise patient care. A few countries have attempted to limit parallel exports to cope with drug <b>shortages.</b> Conclusions: Drug <b>shortages</b> have become an increasingly important public health problem. Its characteristics varies across the European countries. Several lessons can be drawn based on a collective international experience. status: publishe...|$|R
