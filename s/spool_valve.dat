Valves like these could also be useful in terrestrial temperature-regulation systems, including automobile air-conditioning systems and general refrigeration systems. These valves are required to provide smoother actuation over a wider temperature range than the flow-splitting, thermally actuated <b>spool</b> <b>valves</b> used in the Mars Explorer Rover (MER). Also, whereas the MER valves are unstable (tending to oscillate) in certain transition temperature ranges, these valves are required not to oscillate. The MER valves are actuated by thermal expansion of a wax against spring-loaded piston rods (as in common automotive thermostats). The MSL valves contain similar actuators that utilize thermal expansion of a silicone oil, because silicone-oil actuators were found to afford greater and more nearly linear displacements, needed for smoother actuation, over the required wider temperature range. The MSL valves also feature improved spool designs that reflect greater understanding of fluid dynamics, consideration of pressure drops in valves, and a requirement for balancing of pressures in different flow branches...|$|R
50|$|All Matrixes {{dating back}} to the E Matrix have been {{designed}} around a balanced <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> design. Rather than utilize a hammer that strikes a poppet valve, the bolt functions simultaneously as the valve, alternately opening and closing based on air flow from the solenoid.

50|$|Unlike other {{electropneumatic}} <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> markers on the market, {{which use}} a solenoid valve to actuate {{the movement of}} the bolt, the SLG operates using a <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> actuated by a mechanical solenoid and sear. This unique single-tube, sear-tripping, blow-forward operation is comparable to, though not identical to, the operation of the Automag. In the SLG, the recocking mechanism is air pressure acting on a smaller, forward-facing area to push the bolt back open when the pressure in the dump chamber—which acts on a larger, rearward-facing area—reaches a low pressure from firing and venting the dump chamber. In the Automag, this is accomplished by the return spring. If the sear is tripped but the dump chamber is not vented due to the bolt failing to close, the bleed button on the back cap can be depressed, which vents the dump to the outside through the back cap, thus allowing the bolt to recock.|$|E
5000|$|When the transbrake {{is engaged}} at the drag race track {{starting}} line (driver holding the pushbutton depressed), {{the car is}} held stationary regardless of how much engine power {{is applied to the}} drive line. The driver typically applies full throttle at this time, and the car remains stationary at the starting line under full engine power. When the driver sees the desired visual cue before him, the driver promptly releases his finger (or thumb) from the pushbutton. This button release opens the contacts within the pushbutton switch signaling the delay box and the delay box now begins an internal countdown. When the countdown timer reaches zero, the delay box stops current flowing to the solenoid in the transmission and that causes the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> to return to its normal position. With the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> in its normal position hydraulic fluid pressure in the transmission is removed from the reverse clutch pack (but maintained in the forward clutch pack), this causes the drag race car to [...] "launch" [...] (often with great thrust) from the starting line, accelerating rapidly forward toward the finish line.|$|E

Three different tests were conducted, depending on the motion profile of the <b>valve</b> <b>spool,</b> from which an important conclusion drawn is that a long duration in the <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> return motion has the most noticeable effect on the maximum vertical travel of the load as it significantly reduces the load oscillation amplitude after the load has reached its topmost position. What follows is an increase of the residual pressure in the hydraulic cylinder top chamber with a lesser effect on the load maximum velocity.

50|$|The Matrix uses a <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> {{system to}} propel a paintball. The <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> {{utilizes}} an airspace with a fixed volume and a regulated air source {{to deliver a}} consistent amount of force to each ball that is shot. The valve works {{in the matter of}} a spool that slides back and forth much like a piston. In one position the spool allows the fixed air chamber to be filled. In the firing position the spool moves forward and dumps the contents of the fixed air chamber into the breech of the marker, which in turn fires the paintball. The movement of the spool is controlled by the flow of air to it. This flow of air is controlled by a solenoid (electronically actuated valve). The Matrix has a sleek look and lacks external hoses that can become damaged over time. The gas is instead routed through passages inside the body of the marker and plugs in the front and rear of the marker keep these passages airtight. A low pressure regulator can also be attached {{to the front of the}} marker to help the consistency and help lower the force of the air hitting the ball.|$|E
50|$|Wheel speed {{transducers}} in each {{main wheel}} axle induce an AC frequency on the DC voltage input proportionate to the wheel speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a normal deceleration curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected wheel control valve which shunts braking pressure to the return line {{by means of a}} <b>spool</b> <b>valve.</b> As the wheel rotation speed accelerates to normal tolerance limits, normal braking pressure is restored.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> has {{at least}} one O-ring that {{undergoes}} a shear and compression duty cycle for every shot, leading to faster wear and less reliability. Additionally, smaller valve openings and longer opening times makes them less gas efficient than their poppet-valve counterparts. Since spool-valve markers have reduced reciprocating mass, and can be operated at lower pressures, they have less recoil and a reduced sound signature. Examples of markers that utilize this mechanism are the Dye Matrix, Smart Parts Shocker, Smart Parts Ion, and the MacDev Clone.|$|E

50|$|The Mark I cannon {{was made}} out {{of a set of}} valves, a hose, and a freon tank. Iron pipe {{fittings}} were affixed to the freon 22 tank, which provided the pressure that powered the gun. Small water valves were used to fill the tank, and to supply pressure to an O-ring <b>spool</b> <b>valve.</b> When the gun was not in the fire position, the O-ring separated the pressure source from the magazine hose; however, when the radio control unit was activated the servo moved the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> into position, allowing freon to flow from the pressurized tank to the magazine hose. As the magazine was pressurized, BBs flowed into the restrictor tube until the pressure built high enough to force the BBs through the restrictor and out of the barrel. The exit velocity of the BBs was high enough to punch holes in the model ship’s 1/32 inch balsa wood skin. However, this linear magazine and barrel assembly was too bulky to be fit to a small model ship’s gun turret. To improve scale appearance, a brass elbow fitting was added to reduce the above deck size of the gun. This enabled the magazine to exit the deck vertically, with the BBs running into the base leg of the elbow before entering the restrictor. This {{led to the development of}} the new Mk II breach/barrel assembly. The first Mk II was installed on Stan Watkins' model of the USS Arizona (l/144 scale). The BBs (about 100) were loaded into a clear hose which, when pressurised, would feed the BBs into a smaller clear plastic tubing behind the barrel brass tubing. The pressure would build until the force pushed the BBs through the restrictor tubing and out the barrel. The force of this design had adequate power to penetrate the 1/32 balsa hull skin. The design of the restrictor caused a number of BBs to “spurt” out each time the pressure was great enough, however to have sufficient pressure to get more than one spurt, the warship combatant had to rapidly close the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> after the start of the spurt. This was made possible as the freon feed hoses were very thin, and had low flow.|$|E

5000|$|The Quick Dump Valve is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the choices of valves for spudding. A QDV is a <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> that is balanced under pressure with {{one end of the}} spool oriented toward the barrel. The spool is manually unbalanced allowing pressure between the end of the spool and the projectile in the barrel. The air pressure then forces the spool back and the projectile forward. Since the valve is triggered with no pilot pressure, the valve snaps open with no pilot pressure to hinder it. Currently it is not commercially for sale and must be hand built by the hobbyist like most piston valves.|$|E

In mobile hydraulic equipment, conventional hydraulic <b>spool</b> <b>valves</b> with pressure compensators have already been replaced by valve assemblies with four-valve independent metering with electronically controlled pressure compensation.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} {{on the influence of}} geometrical characteristics on the locking force acting on spools in tapered clearances exposed to decentralizing pressure drops. An estimation is presented of the different results in locking force prediction deriving from the comparison of the "classical" one-dimensional approach of flow and a more complex description represented by the Reynolds equation. A sensitivity analysis on the influence of clearance geometrical parameters is performed, showing the limits of application of the one-dimensional approach. Two non-dimensional geometric variables are identified, which can be adopted to define some polynomial corrective functions correlating one-dimensional results with more reliable two-dimensional solutions. The determination of the locking force can therefore be performed by an analytical process, involving the "classical" one-dimensional solution and a polynomial correction which is a simple two-variable function of the clearance geometry. In comparison with results coming from the direct solution of the Reynolds equation, the process leads to errors confined within the range of a few per cent, considering clearances in a wide dimensional range representing a large amount of couplings actually encountered in hydraulic <b>spool</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
