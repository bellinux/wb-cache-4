40|$|Eight commercially {{available}} thread lubricants were evaluated {{to determine the}} best replacement for Red Lead and Graphite in Mineral Oil (RLGMO). The evaluation included coefficient of friction testing, high temperature anti-seizing testing, room temperature anti-galling testing, chemical analysis for detrimental impurities, corrosion testing, off-gas testing, and a review of health and environmental factors. The coefficient of friction testing covered a wide variety of factors including <b>stud,</b> <b>nut,</b> and washer materials, sizes, manufacturing methods, surface coatings, surface finishes, applied loads, run-in cycles, and relubrication. Only one lubricant, Dow Corning Molykote P 37, met all the criteria established for a replacement lubricant. It has a coefficient of friction range similar to RLGMO. Therefore, it can be substituted directly for RLGMO without changing the currently specified fastener torque values for the sizes, materials and conditions evaluated. Other lubricants did not perform as well as Molykote P 37 in one or more test or evaluation categories...|$|E
40|$|The Space Shuttle is {{connected}} to the mobile launch platform (MLP) by four aft skirt hold down studs on each solid rocket booster (SRB). Prior to lift-off, the frangible nuts inside the aft skirt blast containers are severed into two nut halves by two pyrotechnic booster cartridges. This action releases the Space Shuttle and allows the hold down studs to eject through the aft skirt bore and then down into the MLP. USBI has been tasked to upgrade the blast container for two specific reasons: (1) To eliminate lead for environmental concerns, and (2) To reduce the chance of nut recontact with the holddown <b>stud.</b> <b>Nut</b> recontact with the stud has been identified as a likely contributor to stud hang-ups. This upgrade will replace the lead liner with a unique open cell aluminum foam material, that has commercial and military uses. The aluminum foam used as an energy absorber is a proven design in many other aerospace/defense applications. Additional benefits of using the open cell, energy absorbent aluminum foam in place of the solid lead liner are: (1) Lead handling / exposure and possible contamination, along with hazardous waste disposal, will be eliminated; (2) Approximately 200 lbs. weight savings will be contributed to each Space Shuttle flight by using aluminum foam instead of lead; (3) The new aluminum liner is designed to catch all shrapnel from frangible nuts, thus virtually eliminating chance of debris exiting the HDP and causing potential damage to the vehicle; (4) Using the lighter aluminum liner instead of lead, allows for easier assembly and disassembly of blast container elements, which also improves safety, operator handling, and the efficiency of operations...|$|E
40|$|The Space Shuttle vehicle (SSV) is {{connected}} to the mobile launch platform (MLP) by four aft skirt hold down studs on each solid rocket booster (SRB). Prior to lift-off, the frangible nuts inside the aft skirt blast containers (BC) are severed into two nut halves by two pyrotechnic booster cartridges.

This upgrade will replace the lead liner with an aluminum foam material. The aluminum foam used as a energy absorber is a proven design in many other aerospace/defense applications. Additional benefits of using the open cell, energy absorbent aluminum foam in place of the solid lead liner are: A. Lead handling/ exposure, and possible contamination, along with hazardous waste disposal will be eliminated; B. Approximately 200 lbs. weight savings will be contributed to each Space Shuttle flight by using aluminum foam over lead; C. The new aluminum liner is designed to catch all shrapnel from frangible nuts thus virtually eliminating chance of foreign object debris (FOD) exiting the HDP, and causing potential damage to the vehicle; D. Potential of using the lighter aluminum liner over lead, allows for easier assembly and disassembly of blast container elements, also allowing for improvements in safety, operator handling, and efficiency of operations. Six BC firing tests will be required to determine if the new liner material will perform in a way to decrease the chance of stud hangups and enhance the ability of the BC to retain blast debris. Testing will be performed at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) facility known as the Launch Equipment Test Facility (LETF), and will simulate the SRB hold- down post, with actual BC hardware and pyrotechnics assembled, and then test fired. Initial testing was performed in 1997 using a frangible nut in a static drop test over lead and aluminum foam sheet materials. The aluminum foam showed a dramatic improvement of energy absorption over the lead liner material. Proof-of-Principle testing at the KSC-LETF commenced in May, 1998, and is expected to be completed by June, 1998...|$|E
5000|$|... is a {{modification}} of spot welding. In this process, the weld is localized by means of raised sections, or projections, on {{one or both of}} the workpieces to be joined. Heat is concentrated at the projections, which permits the welding of heavier sections or the closer spacing of welds. The projections can also serve as a means of positioning the workpieces. Projection welding is often used to weld <b>studs,</b> <b>nuts,</b> and other screw machine parts to metal plate. It is also frequently used to join crossed wires and bars. This is another high-production process, and multiple projection welds can be arranged by suitable designing and jigging.|$|R

50|$|The {{cylinder}} heads are machined from aluminum billets. As such, they, too, lack water jackets and rely {{entirely on the}} incoming air/fuel mixture and lubricating oil for their cooling. The original Chrysler design of two large valves per cylinder is used. The intake valve is made from solid titanium and the exhaust from solid Nimonic 80A or similar. Seats are of ductile iron. Beryllium-copper has been tried but its use is limited due to it's toxicity. Valve sizes are around 2.45 in for the intake and 1.925 in for the exhaust. In the ports there are integral tubes for the push rods. The heads are sealed to the block by copper gaskets and stainless steel o-rings. Securing the heads to the block is done with aircraft-rated steel <b>studs</b> and <b>stud</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{fastening}} of the National Compact Stellarator Experiment's (NCSX) modular coils {{presented a}} number of engineering and manufacturing challenges due to the high magnetic forces, need to control induced currents, tight tolerances and restrictive space envelope. A fastening method using high strength <b>studs,</b> jack <b>nuts,</b> insulating spacers, bushings and alumina coated shims was developed which met the requirements. A test program was conducted to verify the design. The tests included measurements of flatness of the spacers, determination of contact area, torque vs. tension of the <b>studs</b> and jack <b>nuts,</b> friction coefficient tests on the alumina and G- 10 insulators, electrical tests, and tension relaxation tests due to temperature excursions from room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperatures. This paper will describe the design {{and the results of}} the test program...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] twin {{cylinder}} engine produced [...] and {{was capable of}} 85 mph. A single camshaft behind the cylinders operated the valves via long pushrods passing through a tunnel in the cast iron block. This system needed {{a considerable number of}} <b>studs</b> and <b>nuts</b> to fasten down the cylinder head and rockerboxes, many of them deeply recessed and requiring well-made box spanners or the then uncommon sockets. As with other British motorcycles of the period, this kind of set-up regularly led to oil leaks.|$|R

50|$|Fasteners join, or affix, {{two or more}} objects. Although {{they are}} usually used to attach pipe and {{fittings}} to mechanical supports in buildings, they do not connect the pipes to each other. Fasteners commonly used with piping are a <b>stud</b> bolt with <b>nuts</b> (usually fully threaded, with two heavy, hexagonal nuts); a machine bolt and nut; or a powder-actuated tool (PAT) fastener (usually a nail or threaded stud, driven into concrete or masonry).|$|R
50|$|The latest {{iteration}} of this engine, {{used from}} 1948 to 1953, was initially designated the 8BA (see above) in automobiles and the 8RT in trucks. 8RT remained the truck engine designation {{throughout the entire}} run from 1948 through 1953. They were essentially identical. Earlier Ford V8s had the unique Ford designed distributor driven directly from the forward end of the camshaft, which was an inconvenient location for maintenance. This final flathead used a more conventional distributor driven at a right angle to the crankshaft and located at the right front of the engine where it was readily accessible. The water inlets and thermostat housings were moved to {{the front end of}} the heads, and the 24 <b>studs</b> and <b>nuts</b> that attached the heads on the old engine were replaced by 24 bolts.|$|R
50|$|Owing {{to their}} high {{compression}} ratios and their high bmep, diesel engines place a high tensile stress on their cylinder block. Light alloy cylinder blocks have their usual weight advantages, but these must also withstand the high forces. Some designs, {{such as the}} US Hercules, achieve this by using long through bolts. In the Hercules design these are long <b>studs</b> with a <b>nut</b> at both top and bottom; they are prevented from rotating by an eccentric collar in the middle.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet {{and early}} Russian Federation Order of Alexander Nevsky was a silver, 50 mm wide and high ruby-red enamelled, five-pointed convex star {{superimposed}} on a decagon composed of polished diverging rays. The star had gold-plated rims and edges. In {{the center of}} the star, a central medallion bearing the left profile relief image of a helmeted Alexander Nevsky and the inscription along the left and right circumference in prominent letters [...] "ALEXANDER NEVSKY" [...] («АЛЕКСАНДР НЕВСКИЙ»). The central medallion was surrounded by a gilt laurel wreath bisected at its base by a silver shield bearing the hammer and sickle, the shield is superimposed over gilded sword, spear, bow and quiver of arrows. Two gilt pollaxes cross behind the central medallion, their outward facing blades protruding {{on either side of the}} five pointed star's top arm and extending slightly past the decagon's outer edge, their base visible just inside of the star's two lower arms. The original Order was suspended by a ring through a suspension loop to an early Soviet rectangular mount covered by a red silk moiré ribbon. This was changed in 1943 to a threaded <b>stud</b> and <b>nut</b> attachment on the reverse.|$|R

In addition, the ejection port has no dust cover. Approximately 500 old models were produced. The first 200 of these have no cocking lever retaining stud {{on the underside of the}} magazine tube. Old models made after the first 200 have a <b>stud</b> or locking <b>nut</b> to hold the cocking lever in place. The barrels of the old models are marked “Evans Repeating Rifle/Pat.

40|$|The cyclic {{strength}} of the axially loaded threaded joints is considered and the procedural method to increase their lifetime through the unloading of cracked sections is presented. The method operates by varying the mutual positions of the <b>stud</b> and the <b>nut.</b> It was shown how to exploit resources of the threaded joint after opening of the crack without reduction of the safety. The developed mathematical model allows control the accumulation of the fatigue damage {{as well as the}} crack growth in the roots of the stud thread. Increase of the cyclic lifetime is theoretically evaluated by the ratio of the numbers of loading cycles required to initiate cracks in the roots of unengaged and the most dangerous engaged turns of the stud. Performance of the elaborated technique is demonstrated by considering the crack growth in depth of the nut. The relative safety of the unloaded cross-sections containing cracks is studied.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a single 7 / 8 ” nominal diameter <b>stud</b> bolt and <b>nuts</b> assembly would fail to perform its required function in a flange assembly when the nut was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206. 8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B 16. 5 - 2003 Pipe Flanges and Flanges Fittings. A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206. 8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS 12. 0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the <b>nut</b> and <b>stud</b> at the thread roots. It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a > 60 % material loss from the nut. The failure mode experienced was deformation of the flange plate. This analysis proved that a nut can experience significant effective material loss without damaging the flange integrity...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this {{exhibition}} is in itself a line lent, snipped from the timeworn bridal prescription that begins by begging 'Something old'. The saying now seems likely to outlast the very institution that it was created to safeguard, but its echoes of traditions and superstitions tightly held, grace the assembled works with a charm-like significance. Jo Lawrence's marionettes are brought to life by the borrowed. Assembling lanky human forms from cutlery, brooms and other domestic tools, she <b>studs</b> them with <b>nuts</b> and bolts, but it is their human faces - the wistful, faraway gazes of forgotten matinee idols - that truly animate them. A thing borrowed comes with an alien history. Like Jo Lawrence, Natasha Kerr borrows photographs, snaps that hint at many possible tales. Setting them at the centre of textile collages, she quite literally fabricates a moment in time, glossing it with snatches of handwritten text. To borrow is to remove an item from its original context, and in Cleo Mussi's figures and objects, the borrowed unite to create fresh composites: teacup handles become delicate ears, fragments of tableware cluster in bright, mosaic surfaces. The imagery that new member Daniel Allen appends to his ceramic characters is also borrowed, yet it alludes to inner truths - the red nose and sad clown's smile on the baggy, pale man, for instance, describe a lonely autobiography. A thing borrowed is necessarily to be returned, and Robert Dawson enacts both deeds in his complex tile pieces. Using optical illusions, he draws the viewer's eye from the particular {{back out into the}} whole, an effect as dizzying as the wobbly screens used to signal flashbacks on bygone telly. Elsewhere, tiles appear to fly off the wall, breaking free from their grid only to reveal another laying beneath it - a vivid depiction of the many layers of ownership ruffled by this quintet of makers...|$|R
