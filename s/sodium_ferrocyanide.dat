30|$|The {{photodegradation}} of UDMH {{aqueous solution}} {{was carried out}} in an open reactor under visible light irradiation. The TiO 2 NRAs/CdS films (area about 6  cm 2) were immersed in UDMH aqueous solution (15  mL) with an initial concentration of 20  mg L− 1. Then, dark (adsorption) experiments were carried out for 30  min to reach the adsorption equilibrium of UDMH with the TiO 2 NRAs/CdS film. The film-coated side of the substrate was exposed to the light source, and the light source was a 300 -W xenon lamp with visible light illumination of 60  mW cm− 2; an ultraviolet cutoff filter was used to exclude UV light with a wavelength below 420  nm. Traces of UDMH can react with amino <b>ferrocyanide</b> <b>sodium</b> to form a red complex in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, and the color depth of the red complex is proportional to the content of UDMH. So, the concentration of UDMH left in the aqueous system can be measured by a spectrophotometer at 500  nm which is the characteristic absorption wavelength of the red complex. The procedure is as follows: (1) UDMH aqueous solution (0.5  mL) was added to a test tube with a volume of 50  mL and then diluted to 25  mL by DI water. (2) Buffer solution (1  mL) was added to adjust the above solution to a weakly acidic aqueous solution. The buffer solution was made of citric acid and disodium hydrogen phosphate with a pH of about 4.8. (3) Amino <b>ferrocyanide</b> <b>sodium</b> (1  mL, 1.5  g L− 1) was added to the test tube, and then, the test tube was placed in 30  °C water bath for 1  h. (4) The final red complex solution was measured by a spectrophotometer at 500  nm. The relative concentration of UDMH in the solution was derived by comparing its absorption intensity with the standard curve line.|$|R
40|$|This {{annual report}} gives {{the results of}} the work {{conducted}} by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in FY 1995 on Task 3 of the Ferrocyanide Safety Project, Ferrocyanide Aging Studies. Aging refers to the dissolution and hydrolysis of simulated Hanford ferrocyanide waste in alkaline aqueous solutions by radiolytic and chemical means. The ferrocyanide simulant primarily used in these studies was dried In-Farm- 1 B, Rev. 7, prepared by Westinghouse Hanford Company to simulate the waste generated when the In-Farm flowsheet was used to remove radiocesium from waste supernates in single-shell tanks at the Hanford Site. In the In-Farm flowsheet, nickel ion and ferrocyanide anion were added to waste supernates to precipitate <b>sodium</b> nickel <b>ferrocyanide,</b> Na{sub 2 }NiFe(CN) {sub 6 }, and co-precipitate radiocesium. Once the radiocesium was removed, supernates were pumped from the tanks, and new wastes from cladding removal processes or from evaporators were added. These new wastes were typically highly caustic, having hydroxide ion concentrations of over 1 M and as high as 4 M. The Aging Studies task is investigating reactions this caustic waste may have had with the precipitated ferrocyanide waste in a radiation field. In previous Aging Studies research, Na{sub 2 }NiFe(CN) {sub 6 } in simulants was shown to dissolve in basic solutions, forming insoluble Ni(OH) {sub 2 } and soluble Na{sub 4 }Fe(CN) {sub 6 }. The influence on solubility of base strength, sodium ion concentration, anions, and temperature was previously investigated. The results may indicate that even ferrocyanide sludge that did not come into direct contact with highly basic wastes may also have aged significantly...|$|R

In its hydrous form, Na4Fe(CN)6·10H2O (<b>sodium</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> decahydrate), it is sometimes known as yellow prussiate of soda.

40|$|Underground {{storage tank}} waste sludge from nuclear fuel {{processes}} {{is difficult to}} analyze because of the extreme heterogeneity, chemical reactivity, and radioactivity of the waste.

In this paper a method utilizing Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy to analyze hazardous underground storage tank waste with a minimal amount of sample and sample handling is discussed. The method was developed with the use of waste tank simulants that were obtained from the Westinghouse Hanford Company. Emphasis was placed on the determination of disodium nickel <b>ferrocyanide,</b> <b>sodium</b> nitrate, and sodium nitrite because of the concern for the potential of exothermic reactions occurring between oxidizers and ferrocyanide-containing compounds.

40|$|The {{impetus for}} this {{research}} was {{the need for a}} conservation treatment of salt-laden terracotta inside kiln # 8 at Western Clay Manufacturing Co. - a historic brickyard in Helena, Montana. Western Clay stands {{as an example of how}} traditional methods of mitigating salt damage, like water-immersion and poulticing, are not possible or effective in certain circumstances. Therefore, the focus of this study was to investigate salt crystallization inhibitors as an alternative method to mitigate salt damage in terracotta. Salt damage is one of the most common mechanisms of deterioration in building materials, which makes the results of this research widely applicable. A performance based evaluation of salt crystallization inhibitors was conducted, using <b>sodium</b> and potassium <b>ferrocyanide,</b> each with and without the addition of sodium hexametaphosphate. These chemical reagents were applied to terracotta samples contaminated with sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and an equal mixture of the two. It was found that there was no measurable change in the sodium sulfate contaminated samples. It was found that all inhibitors had the ability to increase supersaturation, delay nucleation, and effectively changed the morphology of salt crystallization of sodium chloride, which was evident through the dramatic increase in efflorescence and a reduction of material loss that was observed in the sodium chloride and sodium chloride/sodium sulfate contaminated samples. It was found that potassium ferrocyanide and potassium <b>ferrocyanide</b> with <b>sodium</b> hexametaphosphate had the greatest effect.

This study examines changes in tissue Fe status and oxi-dative metabolism in Fe-deficient maize (Zea mays L.) plants enriched with NO using sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a source. Methodology Measurements included changes in concentrations of H 2 O 2, non-protein thiols, levels of lipid peroxidation and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and of the Fe-requiring antioxidant haem enzymes catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidases. Internal NO in Fe-deficient maize plants was manipulated with SNP and the NO scavenger, methylene blue (MB). A key control was treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> (SF), a non-NO-supplying analogue of SNP. Principal results SNP but not SF caused re-greening of leaves in Fe-deficient maize plants over 10 – 20 days, increased in vivo NO content, raised chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, promoted growth in dry weight, increased the activities of H 2 O 2 -scavenging haem enzymes and enhanced lipid peroxidation, while decreasing SOD activity and H 2 O 2 concentrations. The NO scavenger, MB, blocked the effects of the SNP. Although SNP and SF each donated Fe and increased active Fe, only SNP increased leaf chlorophyll. Conclusions NO plays a role in Fe nutrition, independently of its effect on total or active Fe status. The most probable mechanism of NO involvement is to increase the intracellular availability of Fe by means of modulating redox. This is likely to be achieved by enhancing the chemical reduction of foliar Fe(III) to Fe(II) ...|$|E

E 237 Sodium formate preservative should be approved for use as a feed additive in organic silage, subject to the outcome of the review of the authorisation of this product under Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 1831 / 2003 currently in progress. If approved: - it should be considered whether formic and propionic acids should be deleted from Annex VI to Commission Regulation (EC) 889 / 2008; - the same restrictions relating to weather conditions and silage quality as currently apply to formic and propionic acids under the organic regulations should apply; o the concept of „difficult‟ silages and/or „poor‟ weather conditions‟ that would determine eligibility to use the products should be clarified. Initial dry matter content or sugar content of the forage might be a basis for this. Humic acid substances are not currently authorised as a feed additive under EU regulations so they cannot be considered for use as such in organic farming. Their classification as feed material was not considered to be appropriate by the Group, which also noted their current designation as pharmacologically active substances with possible implications for animal health.
