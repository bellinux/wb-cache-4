25|$|AirAsia X {{claims to}} have one of the lowest {{operating}} costs of any long-haul airline around the world, with a Cost per Available <b>Seat-Kilometre</b> (CASK) of US$0.0351 in 2015, or US$0.0240 excluding fuel costs (allowing them to undercut conventional long-haul fares by between 30-50%). To reduce costs, they also co-ordinate many aspects of their operation together with larger affiliate AirAsia (Asia's largest low-cost carrier), such as staff requirements, fuel hedging, marketing and computer systems, which allows them to take advantage of economies of scale that would not be normally available to an airline of their size.|$|E
50|$|Jet {{aircraft}} efficiency is improving: between 1960 and 2000 {{there was a}} 55% overall fuel efficiency gain (as compared to the Boeing 707). Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained {{in the first decade}} when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available <b>seat-kilometre</b> was estimated at 2.4%. Nonetheless, from the 1960s to the present total fleet emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide have outpaced efficiency gains, due to growth in the air travel market.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{during that}} day the airline flew 60,000 passenger-kilometres and 100,000 <b>seat-kilometres,</b> for an overall load factor of 60% (0.6).|$|R
30|$|The dataset is {{obtained}} from the Association of European Airlines (AEA) and is downloaded from [URL] The data is collected for the period 1991 to 2013 and contains information about Available <b>Seat-Kilometres</b> (ASK), Revenue Passenger-Kilometres (RPK) and Load factor (LF).|$|R
5000|$|Specifically, {{the load}} {{factor is the}} {{dimensionless}} ratio of passenger-kilometres travelled to <b>seat-kilometres</b> available. For example, say that on a particular day an airline makes 5 scheduled flights, each of which travels 200 kilometers and has 100 seats, and sells 60 tickets for each flight. To calculate its load factor: ...|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{airplanes}} averaged 4.8 l/100 km per passenger (1.4 MJ/passenger-km) (49 passenger-miles per gallon) in 1998. Note that {{on average}} 20% of seats are left unoccupied. Jet aircraft efficiencies are improving: Between 1960 and 2000 {{there was a}} 55% overall fuel efficiency gain (if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the DH Comet 4 and to consider the Boeing 707 as the base case). Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained {{in the first decade}} when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s, current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile. Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available <b>seat-kilometre</b> was estimated at 2.4%. Concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the Imperial gallon; similar to a business jet, but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft. Airbus puts the fuel rate consumption of their A380 at less than 3 l/100 km per passenger (78 passenger-miles per US gallon).|$|E
30|$|A major {{weak point}} of the HL system {{technology}} appears to be its rather low transport capacity, mainly due to the low seating capacity of individual vehicles/capsules, which affects both the operational and the financial performance. Consequently, the investment costs of HL infrastructure make up {{a large part of}} the total costs per <b>seat-kilometre,</b> raising the latter to a higher level than those of its counterparts – HSR and APT. Hence, the break-even fares would also be higher, even if the load factor is relatively high. This finding suggests that HL-application may be limited to the premium passenger transport market, in which there is ‘willingness to pay’ for the strongest feature of HL system service carried out at the very high average speed.|$|E
30|$|So far, the HL {{technology}} {{is in its}} infancy {{and there are still}} many uncertainties around the system that need further exploration. From operational perspective, an important research issue is if and how the HL system transport capacity could be increased, for instance, by increasing the number seats or coupling several capsules into a single vehicle (‘train’). And also to what extent such change in capacity could influence other operational, financial and socio/environmental performances of the system. An initial study explored the relationship of HL vehicle capacity to total energy consumption and found the former being rather insensitive to the latter (Decker et al., 2017). From financial perspective, {{further research is needed to}} more accurately estimate costs associated with HL development especially with respect to infrastructure (i.e. tracks, stations and vehicles) which form the larger part of the total costs per <b>seat-kilometre.</b> Apparently, further specification of these costs requires more research on technological aspects of the system. Finally, from social/environmental perspective, further research is required in exploring the total life-cycle energy consumption and GHGs emissions of the system including infrastructure development (lines and stations/terminals), rolling stock (capsules), and operation of sub-systems such as the vacuum pumps. Moreover, estimation of social performance of the system would be improved by further research on possible implications of HL for social welfare such as accessibility to life-enhancing opportunities and creation of jobs (direct and indirect).|$|E
30|$|It can be {{observed}} that, on a global level, the goodness of fit between modelled transport performance and ICAO data is within a range of 5 %. Generally, {{it seems that the}} model overestimates available <b>seat-kilometres</b> (ASK) and revenue passenger-kilometres (RPK) slightly compared to ICAO statistics. The total tonne-kilometres (RTK) calculated are very close to the reference, but given the incomplete coverage of all-cargo flights in our model, this seems to be consistent with the slightly overestimated ASKs and RPKs. Looking at the reference data from another angle, it is also questionable whether data published by ICAO can be considered as 100 % accurate. This is because ICAO is dependent on data delivered by its contracting states as well as on data availability. As a result, the quality of ICAO data is likely to be rather heterogeneous.|$|R
