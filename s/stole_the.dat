50|$|The {{most likely}} origin for <b>the</b> <b>stole,</b> however, {{is to be}} {{connected}} with the scarf of office among Imperial officials in the Roman Empire. As members of the clergy became members of the Roman administration (see Constantine I and Christianity) they were granted certain honors, one specifically being a designator of rank within the imperial (and ecclesiastical) hierarchy. The various configurations of <b>the</b> <b>stole</b> (including <b>the</b> pallium or the omophorion) grew out of this usage. The original intent, then was to designate a person as belonging to a particular organization and to denote their rank within their group, a function which <b>the</b> <b>stole</b> continues to perform today. Thus, unlike other liturgical garments which were originally worn by every cleric or layman, <b>the</b> <b>stole</b> was a garment which was specifically restricted to particular classes of people based on occupation.|$|R
