40|$|Nanogels (NGs) are {{physically}} or chemically crosslinked polymer networks and are promising {{candidates in the}} development of therapeutic agent vectors. In fact, thanks to their tunable size and properties, they offer unique advantages, including a large and flexible surface for multivalent bio-conjugation, an internal 3 D aqueous environment for incorporation and protection of (bio) molecular drugs, stimuliresponsiveness to achieve temporal and/or site control of the release function and biocompatibility. In order to develop effective NGs-based biomedical devices an inexpensive, robust and versatile synthetic methodology is required. In this perspective, we have produced NGs with high yields and through-puts by pulsed electron-beam irradiation. In particular, using an industrial electron accelerator, carboxyl functionalized NGs from a dilute aqueous solutions of poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), and acrylic acid as functional monomer have been produced. This process allows simultaneous polymer cross-linking and monomer grafting. Moreover, depending on the value of the total irradiation dose, also the sterilization of the irradiated material can be obtained. Since organic solvents, toxic initiators or catalysts and surfactants are not required, this procedure can be defined as an eco-friendly and clean one. Crosslinked nanoparticles with multi-armed surfaces, and size, crosslinking density, and <b>surface</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> controlled, have been generated. Nanogels produced have been proven to be hemocompatible and not cytotoxic or genotoxic at the cellular level. NGs have been decorated with fluorescent probes, proteins and anti-MiR. Thanks to the use of fluorescent variants, {{it has been argued that}} NGs showed a good affinity for cells, as they rapidly and quantitatively bypass the cellular compartments, accumulating in specific cell portions for the first hours, and being completely released from the cells in the next 24 hours. Moreover, it has been proven that the proteins and anti-MiR, once conjugated, maintain their biological activity giving rise to targeting features toward specific cell types...|$|E
40|$|Nanogels (NGs), {{or small}} {{particles}} formed by physically or chemically crosslinked polymer networks, represent {{a niche in}} the development of “smart” nanoparticles for drug delivery and diagnostics. Yet, they offerunique advantages over other systems, including a large and flexible surface for multivalent bio-conjugation; an internal 3 D aqueous environment for incorporation and protection of (bio) molecular drugs; the possibility to entrap light-activemolecules, metal or mineral nanoparticles for imaging or phototherapeutic purposes; stimuli-responsiveness to achieve temporal and/or site control of the release function and biocompatibility. The availability of inexpensive, robust and versatile synthetic methodologies is at the basis of the development of effective nanogel-based theragnostic devices. In particular, we have established that nanogels can be produced with high yields and through-puts by pulsede-beam irradiation of dilute aqueous solutions of water-soluble biocompatible polymers e. g. poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), and functional acrylic monomers, such as acrylic acid or (3 -aminopropyl) methacrylamide hydrochloride, using industrial electron accelerators and set-ups (see Figure 1). [1 - 4] Nanogels are the result of chemical follow-up reactions initiated by a continuous series of electron pulse-generated hydroxyl radicals in de-aerated water. A number of radical sites are generated on the polymer chains,which may have a different fate depending onthe system composition and irradiation conditions. Intra-molecular and inter-molecular radical recombination as well as disproportionation, chain scission and monomer or short polymer segments grafting may occur up to different extent. As a result, crosslinked-core nanoparticles with multi-armed surfaces can be generated, with controlled size, crosslinking density, <b>surface</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density,</b> number and nature of functional groups. No recourse to organic solvents, toxic initiators or catalysts and surfactants is made, therefore expensive or time-consuming purification procedures are not required. Simultaneous sterilization can be achieved depending on the irradiation doses. Long-term colloidal stability in the formof aqueous dispersions and redispersability from the freeze-dried form are advantageous properties especially in the view of a pharmaceutical use. Nanogels have been decorated with fluorescent probes, peptides, antibodies or oligonucleotides and/or conjugated to both molecular and macromolecular model drugs to demonstrate their amenability to be transformed into bio-hybrid, smart drug nanocarriers. All the base nanogels have been proved to benot cytotoxic or genotoxic at the cellular level. Indeed, they showed a good affinity for cells, as they rapidly and quantitatively bypass the cellularcompartments, to accumulate in specific cell portions for the first hours, to bethen completely released from the cells after 24 h. [5] In particular, active targeting features toward specific cell types and smart delivery functions of model chemotherapeutics of purposely designed bio-hybrid nanogels will be presented...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{traversable}} wormhole can exist in General Relativity only if its throat contains some exotic matter. In this paper, we obtain $(2 + 1) $-dimensional (horizonless) charged magnetic brane without (curvature) singularity. Then, we consider a nontrivial local transformation to grant a global rotation to spacetime. After that, we generalize magnetic brane to higher dimensional solutions and use the cut-and-paste method to construct higher dimensional charged BTZ-like rotating wormholes {{such a way that}} they reduce to charged magnetic BTZ solution in three dimensions, exactly. We also show that charged BTZ-like wormhole supported by the exotic matter at its throat $r=r_{+}$. Finally, we calculate the conserved quantities of the charged BTZ-like wormhole such as mass, angular momentum and <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density,</b> and show that the <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> depends on the rotation parameters, interestingly, and the static wormhole does not have a net <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density.</b> Comment: 13 pages with one eps figur...|$|R

Moreover though CaTiO 3 -aC itself showed low solubility, CaCO 3 {{was found to be}} included in it, and long-term slow Ca 2 + release occurred. Thus the sample was suggested to be used as an ion exchange material. When the implant using Ti/CaTiO 3 -aC/HA double layer coating was developed, first bioactive state of the implant will continue due to HA character. Then even early resorption of HA occurs, bioactive state will continue due to CaTiO 3 -aC layer. Therefore Ti base will not expose.
