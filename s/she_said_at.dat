500|$|At age 17, in 2000, Glover {{travelled}} to Belize with a Raleigh International project. [...] The {{ten weeks}} in Belize {{had a great}} impact on her motivation. [...] "It was the best thing I could have ever done at that point in my life", <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>At</b> age 19, she represented Great Britain in the Miss Earth contest in the Philippines. Soon after, her modelling offers increased tenfold.|$|E
500|$|She began a {{relationship}} with Liverpudlian chauffeur Jim Christie in 1981, who became her partner for 17 years {{as well as her}} business manager, living in Penrith, Cumbria. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time: [...] "Jim has never felt he's living in John Lennon's shadow. He's four years younger than me and wasn't really part of that whole Beatles' scene." [...] They later lived on the Isle of Man and then Normandy for some years, but separated in 1998.|$|E
500|$|On June 20, 1986, Jeanne Calment {{became the}} oldest living person in France {{at the age}} of 111 when Eugenie Roux died. Her {{international}} fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of Vincent van Gogh's visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop, where he bought some canvas, later describing him as [...] "ugly" [...] (laid), [...] "blighted by alcohol" [...] (brûlé par l'alcool), and visiting brothels (il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Show him up {{into our}} sitting-room," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>at</b> once {{went in to}} receive him. [...] "He's just coming up, uncle," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> tapping <b>at</b> Captain Bayley's door. He opened it a few inches.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he asked}} the princess to marry him, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> yes <b>at</b> once.|$|R
6000|$|... “Now don’t {{say that}} this is what you get for {{bringing}} a woman along,” <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>She</b> smiled <b>at</b> me whimsically, gloriously, and I knew {{there was no need for}} forgiveness.|$|R
500|$|The {{opening line}} of the song Min'na saikō arigatō, K-k-k-kawaii, k-k-k-kawaii, is a {{reference}} to the Japanese Kawaii culture. Kawaii is Japanese for [...] "cute", and the word is popularly used to describe endearing physical characterizations in Manga and Japanese video games. She was later asked about the double meaning of the song, on account of the interchangeability of the sexual euphemisms 'kitty' and 'pussy', to which she responded, [...] "Obviously it's flirtatious and somewhat sexual, but it's genuinely about my love for Hello Kitty as well." [...] Additionally, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> MuchMusic Awards, [...] "It's really fun [...] it's about a slumber party and loving the kitty." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2016, {{during a}} game in Chicago against the Red Stars, Rapinoe knelt during the {{national}} anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback who refused to stand during the anthem to protest what he calls racial injustice and minority oppression. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time she planned to continue to kneel. Later that week on September 7, the Washington Spirit uncharacteristically played the national anthem prior to the teams taking the field, indicating {{that they did not}} want to [...] "subject our fans and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent". In an additional statement, the Spirit management said ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Dick Tracy as Breathless Mahoney—a new role {{introduced}} for her—with Warren Beatty, her boyfriend at the time, playing the titular character. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—"Sooner or Later", [...] "More" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose"—which {{would be part of}} the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. [...] "I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel", <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so {{beautiful}}," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> the glowing, beautiful land. It was so beautiful, so perfect, and so unsullied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just ourselves?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> the crotons in {{the great}} hall. [...] "Then let's have marigolds the little {{cemetery}} ones." ...|$|R

500|$|By the 1980s {{record labels}} started to release albums that were closely {{associated}} with a film, thereby gaining double promotion. These were mostly termed as soundtracks although {{many of them were}} not related to the film. After the filming for Dick Tracy was over by May 1989, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—"Sooner or Later", [...] "More" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose"—which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to the previous.

500|$|Lennon {{then started}} taking LSD {{on a regular}} basis, {{as well as his}} daily use of cannabis. After much {{encouragement}} from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, {{on the way to a}} party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point she could see the change taking place in her husband: [...] "It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: [...] "I used to just eat it all the time". [...] In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.|$|E
500|$|She {{had kept}} mementos of Lennon for years, but began {{auctioning}} them off after his death, including a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her, which fetched £8,800 at Christie's in August 1981. [...] With her finances in an unsteady state – {{she would say}} in 1999 that [...] "Apart from John, the men I have {{fallen in love with}} have never been good at earning a living" [...] – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time, [...] "I've enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it's time for a change." [...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, [...] "I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's. When you have to pay the bills, you're not proud and you can't take it with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Laverick," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> him earnestly, [...] "somehow {{or other}} I cannot help believing {{that you are}} an honest man." ...|$|R

500|$|Beatty had {{realized}} several {{positive aspects of}} hiring Madonna as an actress for the film. She would be inclined to develop the soundtrack for Dick Tracy and the film studio would {{see this as a}} promotional opportunity before the release of their product, since Madonna was popular as a recording artist. This would also benefit Warner Bros. Records, who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film, thereby gaining double promotion. These were mostly termed as soundtracks although many of them were not related to the film. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—"Sooner or Later", [...] "More" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose"—which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to the previous. In her favor, she produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. [...] "I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel", <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, with lost prestige, a divided party, {{and with her}} {{campaign}} resources partly drained by the primary fight, Romney was behind incumbent Democrat Hart from the beginning. [...] Romney issued position papers and emphasized the themes of dealing with crime and social permissiveness; she also advocated a national healthcare plan and increased attention to environmental damage caused by industry. She never made any personal attacks against Hart. [...] The only woman running for the U.S. Senate that year, she was a tireless campaigner, traveling around the state in a chartered Cessna and making as many as twelve stops a day. [...] Nevertheless, the perception grew {{that she did not}} have any vision for what she would do as a senator and was only in the race because she was George Romney's wife. [...] In response, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> one point, [...] "I'm not a stand-in or a substitute for anyone". Her campaign material continued to just refer to [...] "Lenore". [...] She also was negatively impacted, in both the primary and general election, by fallout from her husband's effort as HUD Secretary to enforce housing integration in Warren, Michigan. Consistently far ahead in polls, Hart staged a low-key campaign with few public appearances; he mostly ignored her and sometimes acted condescendingly towards her in private.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, {{she entered}} private practice, joining the {{commercial}} litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate. One of 30 attorneys {{in the law}} firm, she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration. [...] She later said, [...] "I wanted to complete myself as an attorney." [...] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job. [...] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than {{be part of a}} larger law firm. Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States; much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods. In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run [...] "much like a drug operation", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by [...] "Fendi Crush", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green. At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes. In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college. [...] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm; she was paid well but not extravagantly. She left in 1992 when she became a judge.|$|E
6000|$|... "What lovely clothes your Majesty wears!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> glancing <b>at</b> {{the rich}} blue satin costume, embroidered, with pearls {{in which the}} King was dressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> him, [...] "I owe you four {{thousand}} pounds and you think, perhaps, that your {{time has come}} to speak?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't come," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> turning <b>at</b> {{the street}} door. But obstinately he lounged {{into the street}} with her. He {{followed}} her to her door.|$|R
500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired {{out of law school}} as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 9, 1940, {{viewing the}} spread of fascism in Europe and fearing similar {{political}} developments in the United States, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> a luncheon of the American Booksellers Association: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of Barbeau's 1978 cheesecake poster confirmed {{her status as}} a sex symbol. Barbeau's popularity stemmed partly from what critic Joe Bob Briggs {{referred to as the}} [...] "two enormous talents on that woman", and her typecasting as a [...] "tough broad". Despite her initial success, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that she thought of Hollywood as a [...] "flesh market", and that she would rather appear in films that [...] "explore the human condition" [...] and [...] "deal with issues".|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did not {{calculate}} upon {{being so}} long,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> sweetly, <b>at</b> {{the same time}} throwing back her face and smiling. 'But I--was longer than I expected.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O no!' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> gazing <b>at</b> the bathing-machines, digging children, {{and other}} common objects of the seashore, {{as if her}} {{interest}} lay there rather than with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{in rather}} a desperate one {{if that is}} anything," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> him with {{something}} of the old light in her tired eyes.|$|R
2500|$|In February 1911, Rankin {{became the}} first woman to speak before the Montana legislature, making her case for women's suffrage. [...] In November 1914, Montana passed a similar {{amendment}} granting women unrestricted voting rights. [...] Rankin later compared her work in the women's suffrage movement to the pacifist foreign policy that defined her congressional career. She believed, with many suffragists of the period, that the corruption and dysfunction of the United States government was a result of a lack of feminine participation. As <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> a disarmament conference in the interwar period, [...] "The peace problem is a woman's problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1993, Zakharov {{publicly}} {{revealed that}} she had been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of her deceased husband for ten years prior to their separation. She launched the government's Campaign to Stop Violence Against Women, and urged other victims and their neighbours to speak up. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time {{that she had}} kept silent because [...] "There were no alternatives. There were no refuges for women, no supporting parent's benefit and almost no child care. I made the break when my youngest was old enough to go to school so I could work." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{element of}} her speech was portrayed {{by some as}} an example of hard left militancy. Speaking before the May 1997 general election, she distanced herself from New Labour. Two years later, she told a {{journalist}} that she was [...] "to the left of old Labour" [...] and confirmed that she had no affiliation to any political party or group. However, in 2000 {{she was a member of}} the London Socialist Alliance, ahead of the Greater London Assembly Elections. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that it [...] "was formed to prevent disillusionment with Labour giving a new birth to the far right as it did in the 1970s".|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one would}} have thought so," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> me with a criticising eye, [...] "who had seen you when you heard she was going." ...|$|R
6000|$|She leaned for {{a moment}} her little fair hand on the table, playing on it. [...] "And now, and now," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> the two gentlemen-- ...|$|R
