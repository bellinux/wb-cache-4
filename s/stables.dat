40|$|AbstractIt is {{well-known}} {{that the structure}} of the set of <b>stable</b> marriages of a <b>stable</b> marriage instance can be represented as a finite distributive lattice and, conversely, every finite distributive lattice is a set of <b>stable</b> marriages for some <b>stable</b> marriage instance. Recently, Irving [12] and Gusfield [9] propose some representations of the set of all <b>stable</b> assignments for a given solvable instance of the <b>stable</b> roommates problem. In this paper, we will give a unifying approach to the structures of the <b>stable</b> marriage problem and the <b>stable</b> roommates problem. To achieve this purpose, we first study the duality in the structure of a <b>stable</b> marriage instance, then transform every <b>stable</b> roommates instance into a corresponding <b>stable</b> marriage instance and obtain {{the structure of the}} <b>stable</b> roommates instance directly from that of the corresponding <b>stable</b> marriage instance. The main results of this paper are: (1) There is a one-one correspondence between the set of <b>stable</b> marriages for a <b>stable</b> marriage instance and the set of feasible words of some Faigle geometry; (2) There is a one-one correspondence between the set of <b>stable</b> assignments for a <b>stable</b> roommates instance and the set of basic words of some Faigle geometry...|$|R

It {{is known that}} the one–dimensional marginals of operator <b>stable</b> laws need not be <b>stable,</b> or even attracted to a <b>stable</b> law. In this paper we show that for any operator <b>stable</b> law, there exists a basis in which the marginals along every coordinate axis are attracted to a <b>stable</b> or semistable law. This connection between operator <b>stable</b> and semistable laws is new and surprising. We also characterize those operator <b>stable</b> laws whose marginals are <b>stable</b> or semistable.
