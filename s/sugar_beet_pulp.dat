40|$|More than {{1 million}} tons of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> are {{generated}} annually by U. S. beet sugar industries. Finding profitable uses for the biodegradable pulp, which is the leftover residue from sugar extraction, is critical for the long-term economic viability of U. S. agribusiness. Agricultural Research Service researchers and colleagues have long been studying the potential of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> utilization. Now, chemist LinShu Liu and plant physiologist Arland Hotchkiss, both with the Dairy and Functional Foods Unit at ARS’s Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, and colleagues have found new uses for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> In collaboration with professor Jinwen Zhang of Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman, Liu and ARS-WSU colleagues developed a biodegradable thermoplastic (meaning plastic that becomes soft when heated) {{that could be used}} in disposable food containers. The bioplastic is manufactured from both <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> and a biodegradable polymer called polylactic acid, or PLA, using a twin screw extruder. PLA is a commercially available polymer derived from the sugars in corn, sugar beet, sugarcane, switchgrass and other plants—renewable feedstocks. Extrusion is a cost-effective manufacturing process that is popularly used in large-scale production of food, plastics, and composite materials. Many biopolymers and their composite materials with petroleum-based polymers also can be extruded. The scientists showed that up to 50 percent <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> can be incorporated with PLA, and the resulting thermoplastic composites retain mechanical properties similar to those of polystyrene and polypropylene—the compounds used to make white, spongy food packages. The new thermoplastic is cost competitive with commonly used petrochemical plastics. The study was published in Industrial 2 ̆ 6 Engineering Chemistry Research in 2008. ARS-WSU researchers also developed other <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> materials. Under extrusion compounding, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> was turned into a thermoplastic-like material with the assistance of water and/or glycerol.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2006, the European Union (EU) {{has decided}} to forbid use of {{antibiotics}} as growth promoters. Although many researches had been conducted about fiber source as alternatives of antibiotics, there are still lack of reports in the literature about the optimum level of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> supplementation, affecting growth performance and nutrient digestibility in weaning pigs. Therefore, different level of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> was added to diets {{to determine the effects}} of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal microflora, blood profile and incidence of diarrhea in weaning pigs. Methods A total of 200 weaning pigs [(Yorkshire × Landrace)  × Duroc], averaging 9. 01  ±  1. 389  kg of initial body weight were, allotted to 5 treatments in a randomized complete block (RCB) design. Each treatment was composed of 4 replicates with 10 pigs per pen. The treatments were control treatment: Corn-SBM basal diet + ZnO (phase 1 : 0. 05 %; phase 2; 0. 03 %) and four different levels of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> were supplemented in Corn-SBM basal diet (3, 6, 9 or 12 %). Two phase feeding programs (phase 1 : 1 – 2  weeks; phase 2 : 3 – 5  weeks) were used for 5  week of growth trial. Results In feeding trial, there were no significant differences in growth performance and incidence of diarrhea among treatments. The E. coli counts were not significantly different among dietary treatments but linear response was observed in Lactobacillus counts as <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> supplementation increased (P <  0. 05). In addition, IGF- 1, IgA and IgG were not affected by dietary treatments. However, the BUN concentration was decreased when pigs were fed the treatments of diets with SBP compared to that of control treatment (P <  0. 05). In nutrient digestibility, crude fiber and NDF digestibilities were improved as the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> increased (P <  0. 05). However, digestibilities of crude ash, crude fat, crude fiber and nitrogen retention were not affected by dietary <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> levels.

40|$|Background Enzymatic {{degradation}} of plant biomass requires a complex mixture {{of many different}} enzymes. Like most fungi, thermophilic Myceliophthora species therefore have a large set of enzymes targeting different linkages in plant polysaccharides. The majority of these enzymes have not been functionally characterized, and their role in plant biomass degradation is unknown. The biotechnological challenge is to select the right set of enzymes to efficiently degrade a particular biomass. This study describes a strategy using sexual crossing and screening with the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora heterothallica to identify specific enzymes associated with improved <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> saccharification. Results Two genetically diverse M. heterothallica strains CBS 203. 75 and CBS 663. 74 were used to generate progenies with improved growth on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> One progeny, named SBP. F 1. 2. 11, had a different genetic pattern from the parental strains and had improved saccharification activity after the growth on 3 % <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> The improved SBP saccharification was not explained by altered activities of the major (hemi-) cellulases. Exo-proteome analysis of progeny and parental strains after 7 -day growth on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> showed that only 17 of the 133 secreted CAZy enzymes were more abundant in progeny SBP. F 1. 2. 11. Particularly one enzyme belonging to the carbohydrate esterase family 5 (CE 5) was more abundant in SBP. F 1. 2. 11. This CE 5 -CBM 1 enzyme, named as Axe 1, was phylogenetically related to acetyl xylan esterases. Biochemical characterization of Axe 1 confirmed de-acetylation activity with optimal activities at 75 – 85 °C and pH 5. 5 – 6. 0. Supplementing Axe 1 to CBS 203. 75 enzyme set improved release of xylose and glucose from <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> Conclusions This study identified beneficial enzymes for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> saccharification by selecting progeny with improved growth on this particular substrate.

30|$|High PG {{activities}} were obtained at trial 4 and 18 using 35 % <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> as inducer substrate. Prediction for high PG activity values was obtained for inducer concentrations of 15 to 34 % and moisture levels of 157 to 165 % applied by 0.2  M HCl (Figure  1). Highest PG activity of 613 U/g was predicted at an inducer concentration of 25 % and a moisture level of 160 %. Therefore, an experimental trial including the predicted optimal conditions for PG production, {{as well as}} a slightly higher inducer concentration of 30 % closer to the highest results of the optimization experiments were tested. The media were wetted at 160 % with 0.2  M HCl and cultivation was performed at 28 °C for 5  days. Under the predicted optimal conditions 634.0 [*]±[*] 44.6 U/g PG activity was obtained which is very close to the predicted result. This represented a very good correlation between the experimental data and the predicted value of the PG activity indicating a good fit of the model. Nevertheless, using 30 % of inducer substrate in the medium resulted in a slightly higher PG activity of 648 [*]±[*] 22.3 U/g.

This is the case with dried <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> as a byproduct of sugar refining process. One of the possibilities to reduce energy consumption is savings in the process of thermal dehydration in the process of the conventional drying of pulp. Pulp drying is one third of total energy consumption in the sugar factory. Acidification of water extraction result in pulp that could be pressed better and in other hand in the juice with less non-sucrose compounds. Keeping the extraction process under certain conditions, directly affects {{on the quality of the}} extracted pulp and on effects of their further processing. This paper examines the impact of the extraction parameters of sugar from sugar beet and agents of acidification for water extraction (sulphurous acid, hydrogen peroxide) on the quality of dried <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> Extraction of sugar from sugar beet cossettes by hydrogen peroxide at pH 5. 5 to 8. 5 does not cause changes in mechanical properties of sugar beet cossettes and in water retention coefficient, but increases the brightness of dried <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> for about 5 - 7 units, which solubility in water does not depend on the applied concentration of extracting agents, but increases in dependence on the duration of the extraction. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> extracted at pH 11. 0 has reduced strength, they are highly hydrated, and under the force they lose their shape, binding a larger amount of water thus reducing the effect of their pressing. The changes in microstructure were probably accompanied by segmenting the linear parts of macromolecules and are reflected in the increase of water retention capacity and increase the solubility of dried <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> for two to three times. Under the same conditions of extraction, sulphurous acid produces similar but relatively mild changes in the characteristics of extracted and dried <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> compared to conditions when hydrogen peroxide is used. From the point of the quality of the product of extraction, the most favorable results are obtained when the extraction is carried on at pH 5. 5 for a period of 1 h at 70 °C, using water for extraction with sulphourus acid with the addition of 5 % hydrogen peroxide. Under these conditions no significant degradation of sugar beet tissue is detected, do not change the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the extracted pulp. But there is an average increase of lightness of dried noodles for about 7 units, which represents a significant improvement of their quality, since there is difficult to sell on the market the dried <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> with increased colour...|$|E
30|$|The {{worldwide}} {{production of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is about 250 million tons per year. From one ton of beet, about 150  kg {{of sugar and}} about 210  kg of pressed <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> are produced. The pressed <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> has a dry matter content of about 20 %. Pressed <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> is often ensiled and used as cattle feed. The d-galUA content of the dry matter is about 21 % (Micard et al. 1996). Citrus fruit production worldwide is about 115 million tons per year; however {{only about a third}} is processed in citrus juice factories, where about 50 – 60 % of the fruit is CPW. CPW has about 20 % dry matter, of which 40 % is pectin. Unlike the pectin from SBP, CPW pectin {{can be used as a}} food ingredient for gelling purposes. However, the market for food pectin is much lower than the amount of pectin available from CPW.|$|R
40|$|The agro-industries {{generate}} {{thousands of}} tons of by-products, such as cereal bran or <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulps,</b> each year. For instance, in the Walloon Region, wheat transformation industry produces about 200, 000 t of bran annually. Most of those by-products are, at best, used for cattle feeding. Through biocracking, this biomass may however constitute a renewable source for various value-added molecules of interest. These include dietary fiber, proteins, antioxidants, etc. The Feruzyme project focuses on ferulic acid, a major example of the hydroxycinnamic acids. These phenolic compounds show excellent antioxidant ability, and are found in relative abundance in cereal bran (about 6. 6 mg. g- 1, dry basis, in wheat bran). Ferulic acid (along with other hydroxycinnamic acids) is in majority (usually about 80 %) ester-linked to other constitutive elements of the cell wall, namely arabinoxylans. Its enzymatic release depends mainly on the breaking of its ester linkage by Ferulic Acid Esterases (FAE, EC 3. 1. 1. 73), which works in synergy with arabinoxylan-degrading enzymes (hemicellulase, including xylanase). Cellulase and even protease may also help by "unweaving" further the complex, cross-linked structure of bran cell-wall. The aim of our project is to design a process, starting from raw wheat bran to obtain purified ferulic acid, either crystallized or in concentrated solution. Furthermore, this process should be feasible at pilot scale, as it is meant to commercial application. Bran pre-treatment may impact the efficiency of the enzymatic action, by facilitating the access of the enzymes to their substrate (grinding, micronisation), or by modifying cell-wall structure (extrusion, steam-explosion, etc. processes involving non-enzymatic hydrolysis). The composition of the bran may also be altered, for instance by destarching, but also by pearling, this process being able to separate richer layers within the bran. Simpler process, like fine sieving of ground bran, is sufficient to eliminate part of the starch (wheat bran starch granules are usually about 20 µm). Purified FAE are still not commercially available. However, several enzyme complexes do present FAE activity: Depol™ 740 l (Biocatalysts), Pentopan™ 500 BG and Novo™ 188 (Novozymes), Pectinase™ PE (Catalysts), Grindamyl™ S 100 (Danisco), etc. These complexes are used as filtration aid or for bread making. FAE activity is usually a side activity, the major being hemicellulase and cellulase, except for Depol™ 740 l in which FAE activity is standardized (36 U. g- 1). Even though it should be preferably integrated in a wider industrial scheme, a high potential of wheat bran valorization lies in the field of natural antioxidants extraction...|$|R
500|$|Forages, {{also known}} as [...] "roughage," [...] are plant {{materials}} classified as legumes or grasses, found in pastures or in hay. Often, pastures and hayfields will contain a blend of both grasses and legumes. Nutrients available in forage vary greatly with maturity of the grasses, fertilization, management, and environmental conditions. Grasses are tolerant {{of a wide range}} of conditions and contain most necessary nutrients. [...] Some commonly used grasses include timothy, brome, fescue, coastal Bermuda, orchard grass, and Kentucky bluegrass. Another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is <b>beet</b> <b>pulp,</b> a byproduct left over from the processing of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets,</b> which is high in energy as well as fiber.|$|R
