5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants <b>splinted</b> together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are <b>splinted</b> to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E

25|$|Dental {{avulsion}} {{is a real}} dental {{emergency in}} which prompt management (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed permanent tooth should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage {{the surface of the}} root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the alveolar bone and later <b>splinted</b> by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt).|$|E

On December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter. Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title {{on the last day}} of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, 3 assists and 4 steals. The record was broken in January 2015 by Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors. On January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand <b>splinted</b> rather than have surgery; his recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow. Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009 in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points. Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach George Karl benched him during a game against the Pacers.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{lamellar}} armour was inherently less flexible {{than other}} types of protection the klivanion was restricted to a cuirass covering the torso only.

2500|$|The best {{treatment}} for condylar fractures is controversial. There {{are two main}} options, namely closed reduction or open reduction and fixation. Closed reduction may involve intermaxillary fixation, where the jaws are <b>splinted</b> together in the correct position {{for a period of}} weeks. Open reduction involves surgical exposure of the fracture site, which can be carried out via incisions within the mouth or incisions outside the mouth over the area of the condyle. Open reduction is sometimes combined with use of an endoscope to aid visualization of fracture site. Although closed reduction carries a risk of the bone healing out of position, with consequent alteration of the bite or the creation of facial asymmetry, it does not risk temporary damage to the facial nerve or result in any facial scar that accompanies open reduction. A systematic review was unable to find sufficient evidence of the superiority of one method over another in the management of condylar fractures. [...] Paediatric condylar fractures are especially problematic, owing to the remaining growth potential and possibility of ankylosis of the joint. [...] Early mobilization is often recommended as in the Walker protocol.|$|E

[Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference in task performance, grip and pinch strength, and dexterity with and without cock-up <b>splints,</b> which are widely used in occupational therapy prac-tice. [Methods] Twenty-three participants performed Jebsen-Taylor hand function test and grooved pegboard for task performance and dexterity. The power grip and pinch strength was measured using Jamar hydraulic hand dy-namometer and pinch gauge. [Results] In the result of the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test, task performance with the cock-up <b>splint</b> was slower compared to without the <b>splint</b> for all items. Men’s grip power with the cock-up <b>splint</b> was found to be significantly decreased compared to without the <b>splint.</b> Women’s grip and palmar pinch strength with the <b>splint</b> decreased significantly compared to without the <b>splint.</b> In the grooved pegboard test, the dexterity of both men and women with the cock-up <b>splint</b> decreased significantly compared to without the <b>splint.</b> [Conclusion] To assist patients to make wise decisions regarding the use of <b>splints,</b> occupational therapists must have empirical knowledge of the topic as well as an understanding of the theoretical, technical, and related research evidence.
