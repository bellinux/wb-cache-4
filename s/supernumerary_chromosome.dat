50|$|Supernumerary {{chromosomes}} do {{not carry}} genes {{that are necessary}} for basic fungal growth, but may have some functional significance. For example, it has been discovered that the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosome</b> of the pea pathogen Haematonectria haematococca carries genes {{that are important to}} the disease-causing capacity of the fungus. This supernumerary DNA was found to code for a group of enzymes that metabolize toxins, known as phytoalexins, that are secreted by the plant's immune system. It is possible that these supernumerary elements originated in horizontal gene transfer events because sequence analysis often indicates that they have a different evolutionary history from essential chromosomal DNA.|$|E

The presence of a neocentromere on this <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosome</b> was confirmed by the absence of detectable alpha satellite DNA using FISH and the presence of centromere proteins CENP-C and CENP-A using immunofluorescence. The absence of telomere sequences suggests that the marker is a ring chromosome (r(13)).

BAC 280 J 7 from within the r(13) was used as a FISH probe for the prenatal analysis of amniocytes at 16 weeks of gestation, which revealed a normal karyotype for the fetus. This r(13) chromosome represents the first description of chromosome 13 of the rarer class of neocentric chromosomes that are derived from interstitial deletions. It represents the first example of prenatal diagnosis in a phenotypically normal female that was ascertained to carry a neocentric marker. The presence of such a neocentric marker/deletion karyotype in a parent presents unique possible karyotypic outcomes for conceptions and unusual challenges for genetic counseling.

40|$|Variations in {{chromosome}} number occur between and within individuals of many {{plant and animal}} species.

They do not pair with chromosomes of the basic set and in many species they are reported to be heterochromatic. Some species have supernumeraries in somatic and reproductive tissues while others exhibit them only in reproductive tissues. The mode of transmission of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosomes</b> varies in different species. Usually there is directed non-disjunction of the supernumeraries towards the gamete in pollen mitosis.

The origin of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{as well as their}} function remain to be elucidated in most species. It is believed that supernumeraries are genetically modified fragments of normal chromosomes. Some indications of a detrimental effect from supernumeraries have been obtained. Generally, however, they appear genetically inert. An examination of meiosis in crested wheatgrass (42) indicated a fairly high frequency of supernumeraries in plants of the tetraploid type. Summit and Nordan, varieties of the tetraploid type, and Fairway, a variety of diploid form, are used extensively as forage and seed crops in the drier parts of Western Canada. Extensive breeding programs, designed to improve both diploid and tetraploid forms of crested wheatgrass, are being conducted at the Forage Crops Section, Canada Department of Agriculture, Research Station, Saskatoon. Since <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosomes</b> occur with a high frequency in the Summit variety, and because this variety is characterized by low fertility, this study was initiated to determine the significance of supernumeraries in breeding of improved strains of crested wheatgrass.

The current research analyzed the most extensively studied member of this complex, N. haematococca mating population VI (MPVI). Several genes controlling the ability of individual isolates of this species to colonize specific habitats are located on <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Optical mapping revealed that the sequenced isolate has 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6. 52 Mb and that the physical size of the genome, 54. 43 Mb, and the number of predicted genes, 15, 707, are among the largest reported for ascomycetes. Two classes of genes have contributed to gene expansion: specific genes that are not found in other fungi including its closest sequenced relative, Fusarium graminearum; and genes that commonly occur as single copies in other fungi but are present as multiple copies in N. haematococca MPVI. Some of these additional genes appear to have resulted from gene duplication events, while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer.

Linkage analysis is a standard method for {{the determination of the}} parental origin of this aneuploidy, although it is inadequate in cases with deficiency of samples from the progenitors. Here, we assessed the reliability of the epigenetic 5 mCpG imprints resulting in the maternally (oocyte) -derived allele methylation at a differentially methylated region (DMR) of the candidate imprinted WRB gene for asserting the parental origin of chromosome 21. We developed a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-specific PCR assay, based on the WRB DMR, across single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine the methylation statuses in the parental alleles. In genomic DNA from blood cells of either disomic or trisomic subjects, the maternal alleles were consistently methylated, while the paternal alleles were unmethylated. However, the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosome</b> 21 did alter the methylation patterns at the RUNX 1 (chromosome 21) and TMEM 131 (chromosome 2) CpG sites in a parent-of-origin-independent manner.

We compared the genomes of 11 isolates comprising six Fusarium species that cause soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) or bean root rot (BRR), and identified significant levels of genetic variation in A+T-rich repeat blocks of the essential chromosomes and in A+T-neutral regions of the supernumerary segments. The A+T-rich repeat blocks in the essential chromosomes were highly variable between F. virguliforme and non-F. virguliforme isolates, but were scarcely variable between F. virguliforme isolates. The A+T-neutral regions in the supernumerary segments, however, were highly variable between F. virguliforme isolates, with a statistically significant number (21 standard deviations above the mean) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). And supernumerary sequence types and rearrangement patterns of some F. virguliforme isolates were present in an isolate of F. cuneirostrum but not in the other F. virguliforme isolates. The most variable and highly expressed region in the supernumerary segments contained an active DNA transposon that was a most conserved match between F. virguliforme and the unrelated fungus Tolypocladium inflatum. This transposon was absent from two of the F. virguliforme isolates.

These chromosomes are of small size, about one halif of the smallest chromosome of the standard karyotype; they are metacentric or slightly heterobrachial, devoid of satellites and secondary constrictions, euchromatic and are present in both somatic and germ cells. Various individuals of the same population as well as various cells of the same organism may contain a variable number of B-chromosomes (from O to 4). The B-chromosomes in metaphase I oocytes appear always as univalents and may sometimes acquire a ring-shaped configuration. lndividuals exhibiting B-chromosomes in their cells belong to populations which reproduce mainly by fission and possess highly polisomic chromosomal sets. However, <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are absent in other races of planarians which present karyological and reproductive characteristics simlar to those of the populations described above. The same is true for eudiploid individuals, even if they belong to a population in which some specimens exhibit B-chromosomes. As far as my observations go, the specimens possessing <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are present in areas of Corsica which correspond to the distribution of the diploid amphimictic biotype; such specimens, however, have not been found in areas in which polyploid biotypes are present. The possible significance of B-chromosomes, in relation to the intraspecific variability of these populations of planarians, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Among {{crustacean}} Decapoda numerical chromosome variability is frequent, and it {{has been}} hypothesized that the presence of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>chromosomes</b> accounts for this variability. Thanks to the improvement of cytogenetic analysis by chromosomal banding techniques, <b>supernumerary</b> B <b>chromosomes</b> (Bs) have been demonstrated in Nephrops norvegicus, Homarus americanus, Palinurus elephas and P. mauritanicus, belonging to different crustacean families. In all four species Bs were variable in number, mainly heterochromatic and undigested by various endonucleases, and in meiosis they showed non-Mendelian segregation. Compared to the other chromosomes of the complement, the Bs are very small in almost all species, but some of them were very large in N. norvegicu...|$|R
