5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E
5|$|Though {{behind in}} the rushing game, Tech's passing offense {{finished}} ahead of Nebraska's. Hokie quarterback Jim Druckenmiller completed 16 of his 33 pass attempts, earning 214 passing yards and three touchdowns. On {{the opposite side of}} the ball, Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost earned just 136 passing yards from 11 completed passes and 22 attempts. Combining the rushing and passing totals results in a similar total offensive performance from both teams. Virginia Tech finished the game with 407 net yards from 72 offensive plays, while Nebraska eked 415 net yards from 71 offensive plays. The Hokies had a slight advantage in the time of possession, 31:02 to 28:58. The real <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> comes in penalties—Tech committed five for 89 yards, while Nebraska had just three for 16 yards—and turnovers. The sole turnover in the game was a Virginia Tech fumble returned for a touchdown. Neither quarterback threw an interception.|$|E

25|$|There is a <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> {{in average}} GPA and MCAT scores {{of those who}} matriculate at DO schools versus those who matriculate at MD schools. In 2016, the average MCAT and GPA for {{students}} entering U.S.-based MD programs were 508.7 and 3.70, respectively, and 502.2 and 3.54 for DO matriculants.

25|$|There {{is great}} {{flexibility}} {{in the choice of}} statistical test (and thus the questions that an experiment can be designed to answer), and common choices include the Student's t test or linear regression. An important consideration with SPM, however, is that the large number of comparisons requires one to control the false positive rate with a more stringent significance threshold. This can be done either by modifying the initial statistical test to decrease the α value so as to make it harder for a particular voxel to exhibit a significant difference, or by modifying the clustering analysis in the second step by only considering a brain region's activation to be significant if it contains a certain number of voxels that exhibit a <b>statistical</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E
25|$|The breast-volume data {{reported}} in Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting: A Clinical Radiological Study (2010) indicated a mean increase of 1.2 times the initial breast volume, at six months post-procedure. In a two-year period, 25 patients underwent breast augmentation by fat graft injection; at three weeks pre-procedure, before the fat grafting to the breast-tissue matrix (recipient site), {{the patients were}} photographed, and examined via intravenous contrast MRI or 3-D volumetric imaging, or both. The breast-filler fat was harvested by liposuction (abdomen, buttocks, thighs), and yielded fat-graft volumes of 220–650cm3 per breast. At six months post-procedure, the follow-up treatment included photographs, intravenous contrast MRI or 3-D volumetric imaging, or both. Each woman had an increased breast volume of 250cm3 per breast, a mean volume increase confirmed by quantitative MRI analysis. The mean increase in breast volume was 1.2 times the initial breast volume measurements; the <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> between the pre-procedure and the six-month post-procedure breast volumes was (P< 00.0000007); the percentage increase basis of the breast volume was 60–80% of the initial, pre-procedure breast volume.|$|E

[...] Typically, the system calculates the difference between compound muscle action potentials generated near the nose (nasolabial fold) in response to supramaximal electrical stimulation near the ear (stylomastoid foramen). [...] Thus, the electrical stimulus travels along the facial nerve, allowing it to be specifically pinpointed. [...] Increasing sensitivity and specificity of the recordings {{has been a constant}} goal, and it is believed that variability arises from the location and pressure of the electrodes, the stimulating current, and skin resistance. [...] Esslen and Fisch placed the electrodes on the nasolabial fold, and this has become the standard, but May and Hughes experimented with electrodes placed on the nasal ala, citing better waveforms. [...] The two positions were compared with respect to supramaximal threshold, waveform shape/amplitude, and repeatability. [...] With regard to the supramaximal threshold, the nasal alae demonstrated a superior biphasic waveform while requiring less input stimulation to yield adequate results. [...] In all other categories, however, there was no <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> between taking measurements at the nasolabial fold compared to the nasal alae.|$|E

60|$|The two contrasted values {{here are}} the English and the Hebrew. The 1332 cases of the latter give a {{percentage}} result of 7·9, which differs as may be seen less than 1 per cent from that of {{any one of the}} four large groups upon which the average is based. The 250 cases of English are comparatively few, but the experience I have had of other English prints is so large as to enable me to say confidently that the percentage result of 13·6 is not too great. It follows, that the percentage of arches in the English and in the Hebrew differs in the ratio of 13·6 to 7·9, or nearly as 5 to 3. This is the largest <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> yet met with. The deficiency in arches among the Hebrews, and to some extent in loops also, is made up by a superiority in whorls, chiefly of the tendril or circlet-in-loop patterns.|$|E
60|$|As regards {{other forms}} of natural selection, we know that races are kept pure by the much more {{frequent}} destruction of those individuals who depart the more widely from the typical centre. But natural selection was shown to be inoperative in respect to individual varieties of patterns, and unable to exercise the slightest check upon their vagaries. Yet, for all that, the loops and other classes of patterns are isolated from one another just as thoroughly and just {{in the same way}} as are the genera or species of plants and animals. There is no <b>statistical</b> <b>difference</b> between the form of the law of distribution of individual Loops about their respective typical centres, and that of the law by which, say, the Shrimps described in Mr. Weldon's recent memoirs (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1891 and 1892) are distributed about theirs. In both cases the distribution is in quasi-accordance with the theoretical law of Frequency of Error, this form of distribution being entirely caused in the patterns, by internal conditions, and in no way by natural selection in the ordinary sense of that term.|$|E
