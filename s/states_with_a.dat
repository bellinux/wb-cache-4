5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of <b>states,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E

Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E

5|$|Covered Bridges Today is a non-fiction {{book on the}} {{architecture}} of covered bridges in the United States. The book was written by Brenda Krekeler and published by Daring Books in 1989.

Krekeler's text includes 412 covered bridges in fourteen <b>states</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> complete record of all 142 covered bridges in Ohio during its writing in 1986 and 1987.

5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the <b>states</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E
5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United <b>States,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E

5|$|In July 1780 Adams {{replaced}} Laurens as {{the ambassador}} to the Dutch Republic, {{then one of the}} few other republics in the world. With the aid of the Dutch Patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states was the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition in 1778. He also negotiated a loan of five million guilders financed by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. By 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United <b>States</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce, the first such treaty between the United States and a foreign power following the 1778 treaty with France. The house that Adams bought during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American-owned embassy on foreign soil.|$|E
5|$|Kentikian {{successfully}} defended her titles against Sarah Goodson of the Philippines by a {{third round}} technical knockout on February 29, 2008. Goodson, who had fought almost exclusively in lower weight classes before, was overpowered by Kentikian and the referee ended the fight {{after a series of}} body punches in round three. In her next title defense on May 10, 2008, Kentikian beat Mary Ortega from the United <b>States</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first round technical knockout. Ortega, who had previously fought against well-known opponents such as Elena Reid and Hollie Dunaway, was knocked down twice by straight right hands during the first 90seconds of the fight. When Kentikian had Ortega pinned against the ropes again, the referee stepped in shortly before the end of round one. The quick stoppage came as a surprise to many, including television commentator Regina Halmich, who had expected a hard-fought bout.|$|E
5|$|Kentikian was {{discovered}} {{as a professional}} boxer at an exhibition fight during qualifications for the World Amateur Boxing Championships. At the beginning of 2005, she signed a three-year contract with the Hamburg boxing promoter Spotlight Boxing, a joint venture of Universum Box-Promotion, focusing on young athletes. Since then, she has been coached by Universum trainer Magomed Schaburow. Kentikian started her professional career on January 15, 2005, with a win by unanimous decision over Iliana Boneva of Bulgaria on the undercard of German female boxing star Regina Halmich. Over the next 14months, Kentikian won nine of her eleven fights by knockout. Her unusually high knockout percentage, rarely seen in lower female weight classes, began to draw attention. On July 25, 2006, she won her first belt, the International German flyweight title, against Daniela Graf by unanimous decision. In her first international title fight on September 9, 2006, Kentikian beat Maribel Zurita from the United <b>States</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fourth round technical knockout for the WIBF InterContinental Flyweight title; the fight was stopped when Zurita was cut over the left eyebrow.|$|E
