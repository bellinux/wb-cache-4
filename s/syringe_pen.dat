40|$|Abstract: Oral {{delivery}} {{is the most}} convenient and the most acceptable route. However, insulin by itself is degraded by intestinal enzymes and is not absorbed intact across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Now, a day gelatin, trypsin coated capsule, pill, pellets may be available. It has some disadvantages; {{a lot of the}} insulin will be wasted before it gets where it's going. Insulin taken as a pill is quickly broken down in the stomach, just like the food you eat. That makes it useless for lowering blood glucose levels. Intensified insulin therapy consists of basal insulin given in the form of either twice-daily injections of delayed action- lente or isoplane (NPH) insulin or once- or twice- daily injections of longer acting ultralente Continuous subcutaneous Insulin infusion (CSII) from a portal pump is used for basal insulin. Prandial insulin is given by injection of short-acting insulin given 30 min before meal. E. g. Insulin <b>syringe,</b> <b>pen,</b> an insulin pump. The pulmonary route of administration offers several advantages. First, the lung has a large surface area for drug absorption, ranging from 100 to 140 m 2. In addition, the alveolar epithelium has permeability that allows for rapid absorption of solutes. Because the mucociliary clearance of the alveolar lung tissue is slower than that of the bronchiolar tissues, the alveoli provide a greater opportunity for the absorption of larger molecules (e. g., insulin) ...|$|E

40|$|Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T 1 DM) is an {{autoimmune}} disease {{in which the}} insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed and insulin must be injected daily to enable the body to metabolize glucose. Standard therapy for T 1 DM involves self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) several times daily with a blood glucose meter and injecting insulin via a <b>syringe,</b> <b>pen</b> or insulin pump. An “Artificial Pancreas” (AP) is a closed-loop control system that uses a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pump and an internal algorithm to automatically manage insulin infusion to keep the subject’s blood glucose within a desired range. Although no fully closed-loop AP systems are currently commercially available there are intense academic and commercial efforts to produce safe and effective AP systems. In this paper we present the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs), an ultraportable AP research platform designed to enable home studies of Closed Loop Control (CLC) of blood glucose in subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. DiAs consists of an Android (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) smartphone equipped with communication, control and user interface software wirelessly connected to a continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump. The software consists {{of a network of}} mobile applications with well-defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) running atop an enhanced version of Android with non-essential elements removed. CLC and safety applications receive real-time data from the CGM and pump, estimate the patient’s metabolic state and risk of hypo- and hyperglycemia, adjust the insulin infusion rate, raise alarms as needed and transmit de-identified data to a secure remote server. Some applications may be replaced by researchers wishing to conduct outpatient ambulatory studies of novel Closed Loop Control, Safety or User Interface modules. Over the past three years the DiAs platform has been used in a series of AP clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Helmsley Charitable Trust and the European Union AP@Home project.

40|$|Background: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{places a}} considerable economic burden on society, and biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (bDMARDs) {{for the treatment}} of RA are associated with high costs. The Norwegian Drug Procurement Cooperation (LIS) aims to reduce the costs by recommending choice of bDMARDs based on tender prices. Here, all bDMARDs are assumed to have equal effectiveness and the biologic with lowest drug cost is recommended. Objective: The overarching objective of our study was to explore the societal costs among nine different biologics included in the 2015 LIS recommendations (TNF/BIO) {{for the treatment of}} RA and compare LIS recommendations with ranking of the drugs according to societal costs. Methods: To calculate the costs of biologics, from a societal perspective, we collected one yearone-year data on drug dose, frequency and price (based on both LIS rules and empirical data from Diakonhjemmet Hospital), drug administration costs, and non-medical costs (patient co-payments, travel cost, loss of production and leisure). We used micro-costing for the drug administration costs and Google Maps for estimating travel time and distance. We performed a cost minimization analysis {{based on the assumption that}} biologics have equal effectiveness. Nine different biologics with in total 14 administration forms were included: five intravenous infusions (Remsima, Inflectra, Remicade, RoActemra, Orencia) and nine subcutaneous injections (Cimzia, Simponi <b>syringe,</b> Simponi <b>pen,</b> Orencia, Orencia with bolus, RoActemra, Enbrel <b>syringe,</b> Enbrel <b>pen,</b> Humira). Using 2015 data, we based the primary analysis on data from the rheumatology outpatient clinic at Diakonhjemmet Hospital. A cost model was developed in Microsoft Office Excel. Uncertainty was expressed as confidence intervals and estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Scenario analyses for rheumatology departments elsewhere in the country was performed to investigate generalizability of the findings. A literature review on the comparative effectiveness of the biologics were undertaken. Results: For Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Remsima had the lowest drug cost (NOK 25 944; 95 % CI 25 466 - 26 421) and societal cost (NOK 59 867; 95 % CI 59 367 - 60 368) based on LIS rules. For 10 drugs, there were some disagreement between the 2015 LIS recommendations and the ranking of societal costs according to our analyses. The cost ranking of the 14 drugs varies somewhat across rheumatology departments depending on variation in travel distances, and loss of production and leisure. Conclusion: Although LIS first line recommendation of biologic for RA was in line with the societal costs for Diakonhjemmet Hospital and five other rheumatology departments in Norway, the LIS recommendations do not necessarily minimize societal costs. The results of our study indicate that health authorities would do well by basing treatment guidelines on thorough cost analyses...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes affects most {{aspects of}} {{everyday}} life and places considerable responsibility on the patient; therefore, without patient acceptance of what we offer, the therapy {{is unlikely to be}} adhered to especially when that therapy happens to be insulin injection. In 2008, almost every physician/health care provider carries new and sleek cell phones (because the newer ones are well designed and function better). Why these same providers continue to prescribe insulin via syringes in 2008 is something that I cannot fathom. Previously, some insurance companies only paid for vials and there was no other choice, but today almost all insurance pay for pens and so the “insurance reason ” is no longer tenable. Since Banting and Best discovered insulin in 1921, scientists have continued to improve the types of insulin (making them mimic physiology more closely in order to minimize hypoglycemia and improve glycemic control as seen with the latest analog insulins). In the same manner, the delivery process of insulin has also continued to evolve to make it easier and more acceptable to patients. Studies have shown that patients prefer device use over traditional vials/syringes. Pen devices used to inject insulin lead to better compliance, are quicker to inject, dosing is much more accurate, and, surprisingly, are more cost effective. I challenge my colleagues to take full responsibility for what their patients use. If a provider believes in pen devices, most of his/her patients will use them. The products your patients use is a direct reflection of what you practice. Educating providers to change their beliefs and practices is key to moving American diabetic patients from <b>syringes</b> to <b>pen</b> devices...|$|R

Scientific evidence from published studies have proven added benefit of insulin pumps in improving quality of life, normalizing sugars in recalcitrant diabetes, improving sexual function, and relieving the intractable pain of neuropathy. In the western world, pumps are commonly used with T 1 DM subjects, whereas in India 80 % of pumpers are T 2 DM subjects. The success of insulin pump therapy depends on selection of the right candidate, extensive education, motivation, and implementing the sophisticated programs with skill. However, all affordable patients are not ideal candidates for pump therapy because for successful continuation of pump therapy other inclusion criteria should also be fulfilled. Among the other indications discussed are a high level of insulin resistance, brittle diabetes, chronic kidney disease on renal replacement therapy, and continuous glucose monitoring pattern strongly suggesting need for a variable basal insulin infusion rate. In International Diabetes Foundation data released in 2009, estimated diabetes prevalence for 2010 is 285 million, representing 6. 4 % of the world's adult population, with a prediction that by 2030 the number of people with diabetes will have increased to 438 million. Considering this massive growth in T 2 DM and its propensity after 10 – 15 years to lead to an insulin-deficient state, available evidence from studies is a compelling indication not to deny the benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in selected T 2 DM subjects.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{assess the}} use, {{handling}} {{and disposal of}} insulin injection equipment by diabetic patients in Pakistan. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study at diabetic clinics in five tertiary centers in Pakistan. All diabetic patients (type 1 /type 2) who were on insulin for more than 1 month, were included. An Urdu (local language) -translated questionnaire was used to collect information on insulin administration equipment, the site and frequency of needle use, insulin syringe/pen/lancet disposal, sharing of needles and knowledge about diseases that are spread by sharing contaminated needles. ResultsOf 375 patients, 58 % were female. The mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 12. 3 (7. 3) years, and the duration of insulin use was 4. 4 (4. 3) years. The majority of the patients used syringes (88. 3 %) for insulin administration. Additionally, {{the majority of the}} patients disposed of used devices (<b>syringes,</b> 92 %; <b>pens,</b> 75 %; and lancets, 91 %) in the household garbage collection bin.

When compared with vial and <b>syringe</b> regimens, insulin <b>pens</b> offer a greater clinical efficacy, improved quality of life, and increased dosing accuracy, particularly at low doses. The portable and discreet nature of pen devices reduces {{the burden on the}} patient, facilitates adherence, and subsequently contributes to the improvement in glycemic control. NovoPen Echo® is one of the latest members of the NovoPen® family that has been specifically designed for the pediatric population and is the first to combine half-unit increment (= 0. 5 U of insulin) dosing with a simple memory function. The half-unit increment dosing amendments and accurate injection of 0. 5 U of insulin are particularly beneficial for children (and insulin-sensitive adults/elders), who often require small insulin doses. The memory function can be used to record the time and amount of the last dose, reducing the fear of double dosing or missing a dose. The memory function also provides parents with extra confidence and security that their child is taking insulin at the correct doses and times. NovoPen Echo is a lightweight, durable insulin delivery pen; it is available in two different colors, which may help to distinguish between different types of insulin, providing more confidence for both users and caregivers. Studies have demonstrated a high level of patient satisfaction, with 80 % of users preferring NovoPen Echo to other pediatric insulin pens.

Flexible and convenient treatment options, compatible with modern lifestyle, are important in helping patients maintain treatment and manage their disease. Etanercept drug product (DP) is available in lyophilized powder (Lyo) for solution injection, prefilled <b>syringe,</b> and prefilled <b>pen</b> presentations and is typically stored under refrigerated conditions. We aimed to generate a comprehensive analytical data package from stability testing of key quality attributes, consistent with regulatory requirements, {{to determine whether the}} product profile of etanercept is maintained at ambient temperature. Methods: Test methods assessing key attributes of purity, quality, potency, and safety were performed over time, following storage of etanercept DP presentations under a range of conditions. Results: Results and statistical analysis from stability testing (based on size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Coomassie) across all etanercept presentations (10 and 25 mg/vial Lyo DP; 25 and 50 mg prefilled syringe DP; 50 mg prefilled pen DP) showed key stability-indicating parameters were within acceptable limits through the alternative storage condition of 25 °C± 2 °C for 1 month.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} self-inject in {{patients}} with multiple sclerosis (MS) {{has been associated with}} a reduced risk of missed injections and drug discontinuation, and a beneficial effect on patients' independence. However, injection anxiety, needle phobia and disease-related disability are major barriers to a patient's ability to self-administer treatment. Use of an autoinjector may improve patients' ability to self-inject. This study evaluated the safe and effective use of Avonex Pen™ (prefilled pen), a single use autoinjector, for intramuscular delivery of interferon beta- 1 a (IM IFNβ- 1 a, Avonex) in MS patients. Methods This was a Phase IIIb, open-label, single-country, multicenter trial in MS patients currently using IM IFNβ- 1 a prefilled syringes. Patients received weekly 30 mcg IM IFNβ- 1 a treatment over 4 weeks. On Day 1, patients self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a using a prefilled syringe at the clinic. On Day 8, patients received training on the prefilled pen and self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a using the device. On Day 15, patients self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a at home using the prefilled pen. A final injection occurred at the clinic on Day 22 when patients self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a using the prefilled pen while clinic staff observed and completed a detailed questionnaire documenting patients' ability to self-inject with the device. Serum neopterin levels were evaluated pre and post-injection on Days 1 and 8. Adverse events were monitored throughout. Results Seventy-one (96 %) patients completed the study. The overall success rate in safely and effectively using the prefilled pen was 89 %. No device malfunctions occurred. One unsuccessful administration occurred at Day 22 due to patient error; no patient injury resulted. Patients gave the prefilled pen high ratings (8. 7 - 9. 3) on a 10 -point scale for ease of use (0 = extremely difficult, 10 = extremely easy). Ninety-four percent of patients preferred the prefilled pen over the prefilled syringe. Induction of serum neopterin levels, serving as a biomarker for type 1 interferon action, was {{similar to that of the}} prefilled <b>syringe.</b> The prefilled <b>pen</b> demonstrated a safety profile comparable to the prefilled syringe. Conclusions The prefilled pen is a safe and effective device for administration of IM IFNβ- 1 a and represents an alternative method for self-injection for MS patients using this therapy.
