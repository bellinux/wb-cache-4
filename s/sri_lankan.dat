5|$|According to the 2012 census {{there were}} 2,270,924 <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils in Sri Lanka, 11.21% of the population. <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils {{constitute}} {{an overwhelming majority}} of the population in the Northern Province and are the largest ethnic group in the Eastern Province. They are minority in other provinces. 70% of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they {{are closely related to}} Sinhalese ethnic group in the island. The <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism and retention of words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils {{live in the}} Northern and Eastern {{provinces and}} in the capital Colombo, and most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands. Historically, both groups have seen {{themselves}} as separate communities, {{although there has been}} a greater sense of unity since the 1980s. In 1948, the United National Party government stripped the Indian Tamils of their citizenship. Under the terms of an agreement reached between the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> citizenship, and most of the remainder were repatriated to India. By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> citizenship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils in India {{are mostly}} {{refugees}} of about over 100,000 in special camps and another 50,000 {{outside of the}} camps. In western European countries, the refugees and immigrants have integrated themselves into society where permitted. Tamil British singer M.I.A (born Mathangi Arulpragasam) and BBC journalist George Alagiah are, among others, notable people of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil descent. <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil Hindus have built a number of prominent Hindu temples across North America and Europe, notably in Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, and the UK.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they {{are closely related to}} other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well. There are various studies that indicate varying degrees of connections between <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|Jayawardene's debut Test {{match was}} against India in August 1997, {{in which the}} <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> team made a world record 952 runs for 6 wickets. He scored his maiden Test century in his fourth match, played in June 1998 against New Zealand. The 150 he scored against Bangladesh in September 2001 is the fastest Test century made by a <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> player. However, this innings came to an unusual end when he retired out just after {{reaching}} 150 runs. Jayawardene's best innings was made against South Africa in July 2006 when he scored 374 runs, surpassing Sanath Jayasuriya's record of 340 for the highest individual score by a <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> batsman. It is also the fourth-highest score in Test cricket, as well {{as part of the}} world's highest Test partnership—624 runs—which he established with teammate Kumar Sangakkara. Jayawardene has scored a total of 34 centuries during his career, the second highest number by a <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> player, after Kumar Sangakkara. He has scored more than 200 runs on seven of these occasions. This is the second-highest number of double centuries by a <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> player, behind Kumar Sangakkara. He is also one of only three players who have scored a triple century for Sri Lanka; the other two being Jayasuriya and Sangakkara.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough {{is one of}} the {{prominent}} destinations for <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils in the Greater Toronto Area, who came from Sri Lanka during the civil war. Efforts to integrate <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil culture include establishing cross-cultural and cross-national alliances and the building of many Tamil schools across the GTA.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil {{nationalism}} is {{the conviction of}} the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil people, a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), {{that they have the}} right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy as a tool to spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E
5|$|The {{two groups}} of Tamils located in Sri Lanka are the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils and the Indian Tamils. There also exists a {{significant}} population in Sri Lanka who are native speakers of Tamil language and are of Islamic faith. Though several evidence point them towards being ethnic Tamils, they are however controversially listed as a separate ethnic group by the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> government. <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils (also called Ceylon Tamils) are descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftaincies called Vannimais. The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of bonded labourers sent from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{scholarly}} consensus over {{the presence of}} the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil people in Sri Lanka, also known as Eelam in Sangam literature. One theory states that there was not an organised <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil people presence in Sri Lanka until the invasions from what is now South India in the 12th century AD; another theory contends that Tamil people were one of the original inhabitants of the island. Theories about Tamil people's presence in Sri Lanka feed into the cycle of ethnic conflict. Another theory states that the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils are descendant of the Nagas, who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.|$|E
5|$|Although the Portuguese {{attempted}} {{to eliminate the}} Jaffna royal family through celibacy, a number of families of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil origin claim descent from the royal family today.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1987, {{the militant}} youth groups had fought not only the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> {{security}} forces and the Indian Peace Keeping Force also among each other, with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the Tamil National Alliance or standalone political parties. Some also function as paramilitary groups within the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> military.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, about {{eighty percent}} of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils were Hindus who {{followed}} the Shaiva sect. The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom and coastal Sri Lanka. There is also {{a small minority of}} Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the American Ceylon Mission. Most Tamils who inhabit the Western Province are Roman Catholics, while those of the Northern and Eastern Provinces are mainly Hindu. Pentecostal and other churches, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, are active among the internally displaced and refugee populations. The 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 amongst <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils. Accounting to roughly 1% of all <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Singhala Buddhist areas he {{is known}} as Gana deviyo, and revered along with Buddha, Vishnu, Skanda and others.|$|E
5|$|Rameswaram is {{frequently}} in headlines over fishermen issues like attack, arrest and alleged harassment by <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> navy for alleged cross border activities, Sethusamudram canal project, Kachchatheevu, <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil refugees {{and also on}} intercountry smuggling between India and Sri Lanka. As an initial step to curb enhanced smuggling, the Tamil Nadu government has set up 30 more marine police stations to bring the state’s entire coastal belt under close vigil.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lanka {{became an}} {{independent}} nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil {{community has been}} strained. Sri Lanka {{has been unable to}} contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war. The <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Civil War has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past. The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka). Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils {{continue}} to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia. The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants. Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system. A Canadian government survey found that over 70% of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil refugees {{have gone back to}} Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the legitimacy of their refugee claims.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> {{record of}} 16 wickets for 220 runs set by Muttiah Muralitharan against England is the fifth-best figures by a bowler {{in a single}} Test match.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Vijithapura is a legendary battle in <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> {{history and a}} {{significant}} milestone in Dutthagamani's campaign to restore Buddhism in the country. It {{is often referred to}} as Vijithapura maha satana (the great battle of Vijithapura). After the ending of the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Civil War in 2009, General Sarath Fonseka, the then commander of the Sri Lanka Army, compared several battles they fought to that of Vijithapura.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{accurate}} {{figures for}} the number of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils living in the diaspora. Estimates range from 450,000 to one million.|$|E
5|$|According to legends, {{the origin}} of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil {{literature}} {{dates back to the}} Sangam period (3rd century BCE–6th century CE). These legends indicate that the Tamil poet Eelattu Poothanthevanar (Poothanthevanar from Sri Lanka) lived during this period.|$|E
5|$|Like much of Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli remains {{prone to}} {{communal}} tensions based {{on religion and}} ethnicity. There have been occasional outbreaks of violence against Sri Lankans. In 2009, the offices of a <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> airline were attacked in the city. In September 2012, two groups of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> pilgrims who had visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni and the Poondi Madha Basilica had their buses attacked in Tiruchirappalli {{by a group of}} Tamil activists. Owing to a series of terrorist attacks in Indian cities since 2000, security has been increased at sites such as Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils are {{categorised}} {{into three}} subgroups based on regional distribution, dialects, and culture: Negombo Tamils {{from the western}} part of the island, Eastern Tamils from the eastern part, and Jaffna or Northern Tamils from the north.|$|E
5|$|Tamil dialects are {{differentiated}} by the phonological {{changes and}} sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCE–7th century CE). The <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil dialects form {{a group that}} is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, Moors and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil dialects.|$|E
5|$|The Horton Plains are the {{headwaters}} of three major <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains. Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback {{is one of the}} major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The Jaffna Public Library which {{contained}} over 97,000 books and manuscripts {{was one of}} the biggest libraries in Asia, and through the Burning of the Jaffna Public Library much of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil literature has been obliterated.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> {{team won}} an ODI series against Australia in Australia in 2010. However, they {{are yet to}} {{register}} a Test match win and an ODI series win against India in India, as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{infrastructure}} of the town was heavily damaged when the SLA took control of it. Most of the houses were badly damaged and a large water tank had been destroyed, which the SLA accused had been done by the LTTE using explosives. According to a senior commander of the SLA, the LTTE had damaged the town's infrastructure to obstruct the advance of the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> military. Power supply lines in Kilinochchi had also been damaged. However, the LTTE claimed that the town's infrastructure had been destroyed by artillery attacks and air raids {{carried out by the}} <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> military.|$|E
5|$|The {{protests against}} the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Civil War in Canada, often {{referred}} to as the Tamil protests by the media, consisted of a series of demonstrations which took place in major Canadian cities with a significant Tamil diaspora population during the year 2009 protesting the alleged genocide of <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil people in the Northern Province of the island nation Sri Lanka. It was part of a global outcry by the Tamil diaspora to end the <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Civil War, investigate acts of war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka, and restore civil rights for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The aim was also to create awareness and appeal to leaders, notably the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, the President of the United States, Barack Obama and the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Canada, Bandula Jayasekara, to take action in ending the conflict. Several Tamil Canadian citizens and business-owners from different parts of Canada and the United States took part in major protests set up in Toronto and Ottawa, while smaller scale demonstrations took place in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Although most ants survive {{attempts}} by humans to eradicate them, {{a few are}} highly endangered. These tend to be island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species. Examples include the critically endangered <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> relict ant (Aneuretus simoni) and Adetomyrma venatrix of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|However, none {{of these}} invaders could extend their rule to Ruhuna, the {{southern}} part of the country, and <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> rulers and their heirs always organized their armies from this area and managed to regain their throne. Throughout the history of Sri Lanka, Ruhuna served as a base for resistance movements.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, she {{condemned}} the Chinese Government's role in supporting and supplying {{arms to the}} <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> government during the conflict {{in an interview with}} music magazine Mondomix, stating that China's influence within the UN was preventing prosecutions of war crimes committed during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In 993, the Chola Emperor Rajaraja I invaded Sri Lanka, {{forcing the}} then <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> ruler Mahinda V {{to flee to}} the {{southern}} part of the country. The Mahavamsa describes the rule of Mahinda V as weak, and the country was suffering from poverty by this time. It further mentions that his army rose against him due to lack of wages. Taking advantage of this situation, Rajendra I son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura. They moved the capital to Polonnaruwa and subsequent <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> rulers who came into power after the Chola reign continued to use Polonnaruwa as the capital, thus ending the Anuradhapura Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{common names}} of D. russelii include Russell's viper, chain viper, Indian Russell's viper, common Russell's viper, seven pacer, chain snake, and {{scissors}} snake. Previously, another common name {{was used to}} describe a subspecies that {{is now part of}} the synonymy of this form: <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Russell's viper for D. r. pulchella.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} ODI ever at Bellerive Oval, West Indian Desmond Haynes scored {{the first century}} at the venue with a score of 101 runs from 112 balls against Pakistan in 1988. In 34 ODIs, a total of 22 centuries have been scored. As of October 2014, the highest ODI score at the ground is 172, scored by Adam Gilchrist, an Australian wicket-keeper. The top scoring non-Australian is <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tillakaratne Dilshan, who scored 160 runs. Dilshan and fellow <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Kumar Sangakkara are the only players to have scored two ODI centuries at Bellerive Oval. In the two T20I games at Bellerive Oval, as of October 2014, no centuries have been scored. The top T20I score at the ground is 75 by Australian Cameron White in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Jayawardene {{made his}} T20I debut against England on 15 June 2006, and scored his first century against Zimbabwe on 3 May 2010. Jayawardene {{was the fourth}} player to score a century in a T20I, and the first <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> to do so.|$|E
