40|$|While {{contemporary}} {{research in}} the field of transportation is paying due attention to the geography and composition of personal social networks, little do we still know about the quality of <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Individuals’ quality of social life can be dictated by the subjective quality of <b>social</b> <b>interactions,</b> particularly crucial for the elderly, the disadvantaged and the migrated population. Review of literature depicts that social belongingness and geographical integration contribute to an individual’s quality of social life and that the number of <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> do not necessarily represent the quality of social life. It is, therefore, important to gain insight in the subjective aspects of social activities in addition to the objective aspects. To that end, this study summarizes empirical evidence of factors that influence the importance of <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Quality of <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> is measured by the individual’s subjective evaluation of <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> The subjective value added to each of the <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> would reflect on the individual’s social well-being, the authors argue. Further to represent geographical integration an index of perceived social cohesion has been incorporated into the estimation. Results suggest that neighborhood and mobility characteristics are important in explaining the quality of <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Frequency of important <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> is positively associated with frequency of walking or cycling. The frequency of important <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> was also found to be higher for people living in neighborhoods with higher levels of perceived social cohesion and walkability, and lower for people living in rural areas, in neighborhoods with higher percentages of older residents and in neighborhoods with higher percentages of ethnic minorities...|$|R

5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through <b>social</b> <b>interaction.</b> Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E
