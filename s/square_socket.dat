2500|$|Winding gear is the {{mechanism}} which allows paddles {{to be lifted}} (opened) or lowered (closed). Typically, a square-section stub emerges from the housing of the winding gear. This is the axle of a sprocket ("pinion") which engages with a toothed bar ("rack") attached by rodding {{to the top of}} the paddle. A lock-keeper or member of the boat's shore crew engages the <b>square</b> <b>socket</b> of their windlass (see below) onto the end of the axle and turns the windlass perhaps a dozen times. This rotates the pinion and lifts the paddle. A pawl engages with the rack to prevent the paddle from dropping inadvertently while being raised, and to keep it raised when the windlass is removed, so that the operator can attend to other paddles. Nowadays it is considered discourteous and wasteful of water to leave a paddle open after a boat has left the lock, but in commercial days it was normal practice. To lower a paddle the pawl must be disengaged and the paddle wound down with the windlass. Dropping paddles by knocking the pawl off can cause damage to {{the mechanism}}; the paddle gear is typically made of cast iron and can shatter or crack when dropped from a height. In areas where water-wastage due to vandalism is a problem, (for example the Birmingham Canal Navigations), paddle mechanisms are commonly fitted with vandal-proof locks (nowadays rebranded [...] "water conservation devices") which require the boater to employ a key before the paddle can be lifted. The keys are officially known as [...] "water conservation keys", but boaters usually refer to them as T-keys, from their shape; handcuff keys because the original locks, fitted on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, resembled handcuffs; Leeds and Liverpool Keys after that canal; or simply Anti-Vandal Keys.|$|E

30|$|The 5  mm borer {{requires}} smaller torque for coring. Due to its smaller reaction force, we used thinner reaction bar {{of smaller}} diameter and a lighter <b>square</b> drive <b>socket,</b> reducing the total weight to 6.0  kg (Table  1). Due {{to the larger}} torque required for sampling 12  mm cores, we had to increase the total weight of the device for sampling 12  mm cores to 9.5  kg. The rotation speed of the bit stayed almost constant irrespective of penetration depth and the wood species sampled. Using the gear ratios of 1 : 24 and 1 : 118, the penetration speeds of the 5 and 12  mm bits were approximately 50  cm and 12  cm per min, respectively (Table  1).|$|R
5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle. Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. Tow vehicles often have <b>square</b> receiver <b>sockets</b> to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R

50|$|A cross, {{variously}} {{known as}} Royse's, Rohesia's, or Roisia's Cross, was erected by the crossroads at an unknown date. It gave the settlement its earliest name of Crux Roesia or Roisia's Cross. By the 14th century this had become Roisia's Town, Roiston or Royston. A large boulder of red millstone grit, bearing a <b>square</b> <b>socket,</b> {{supposed to be}} the base of the cross, has been placed by the cross roads at the northern end of High Street.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} windlass is {{made from}} an iron rod of circular section, about half an inch in diameter and two feet long, bent to make an L-shape with legs of slightly different length. The shorter leg is called the handle, and the longer leg is called the arm. Welded {{to the end of}} the arm is a <b>square,</b> sometimes tapered, <b>socket</b> of the correct size to fit onto the spindle protruding from lock winding gear.|$|R
5000|$|Slip Gates, {{also known}} as Stang Stoops, Yatsteads [...] or Stang Pole Gateways are a form of simple gate that once {{commonly}} controlled access to fields, lanes, etc. {{without the use of}} a wooden or metal frame built gate with cross-bars and without metal or other forms of hinges. The usually wood spars or stangs were slotted into grooves cut into the stone piers and held firmly in place at one end with wedges and on the other end by being placed in a deep <b>square</b> or circular <b>socket.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Square</b> {{heads and}} <b>sockets</b> were {{the easiest to}} make in the era when hand filing was the typical method of manufacture. With the {{proliferation}} of modern manufacturing methods, such as milling, shaping, broaching, and advanced die forging, it became just as easy to make hex heads and <b>sockets</b> as <b>square</b> ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the ratchet pawl to catch the next tooth.|$|R
5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a hex socket screw drive was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the <b>square</b> <b>socket</b> in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching <b>square</b> <b>socket</b> drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911.|$|E
50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson <b>square</b> <b>socket</b> head screws that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot head screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the churchyard}} are five structures, {{each of which}} is listed at Grade II. To the south of the church is a {{sandstone}} chest tomb dated 1815 to the memory of Thomas Phipps. To the east of this is another sandstone chest tomb; this is dated 1831, and is a memorial to John Dodson. Nearby is the chest tomb of Sir John Colt; it is also in sandstone, and is dated 1810. To the northeast of the church is an 18th-century dovecote. This is a two-storey structure with an octagonal plan, in red brick with sandstone dressings and a tiled pyramidal roof. Inside its walls are nesting boxes. To the southeast of the church is a sandstone cross base dating from the 18th century or earlier. It consists of four circular steps with a <b>square</b> <b>socket.</b> The churchyard contains three war graves of British soldiers of World War I. [...] Also buried here is Admiral Sir Cecil Thursby (1861-1936), who saw distinguished service in the same war.|$|E
50|$|A {{set screw}} {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used to secure an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a set screw has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), <b>square</b> <b>socket</b> (Robertson), or slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|E
50|$|A {{bottle jack}} or whiskey jack is a jack which resembles a bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical lifting ram with a support pad of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the lift. The screw version of the bottle jack works by turning a large nut running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a jack handle fitting into a <b>square</b> <b>socket.</b> The ram may have a second screwed ram within it, which doubles the lifting range telescopically.|$|E
