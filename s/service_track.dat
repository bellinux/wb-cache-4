2500|$|The Bukit Panjang LRT {{opened in}} 1999 {{and was given}} the colours purple and orange to {{represent}} its direction of travel.

The directional arrow on the shared <b>service</b> <b>track</b> (between stations A1 to A6) was split, half purple coloured and half orange coloured. From Bukit Panjang station, the orange arrows travelled in an anti-clockwise direction [...] while the purple arrows travelled in a clockwise direction (service A) towards Senja.
