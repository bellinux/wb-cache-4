5|$|The caves are {{the site}} of the first cave dives in Britain which were {{undertaken}} by Jack Sheppard and Graham Balcombe. Since the 1930s divers have explored the extensive network of chambers developing breathing apparatus and novel techniques in the process. The full extent of the cave system is still unknown with approximately , including 25 chambers, having been explored. Part of the cave system opened as a show cave in 1927 following exploratory work by Herbert E. Balch. As a tourist attraction it has been owned by Madame Tussauds and, most recently, the circus owner Gerry Cottle. The cave is noted for the Witch of Wookey Hole– a roughly human shaped stalagmite that legend <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> witch turned to stone by a monk from Glastonbury. It has also been used as a location for film and television productions.|$|E
25|$|The , dark-blue, extra-long twin {{mattress}} used in {{the performance}} art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, {{similar to the one}} on which she alleges she was raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: Written on the walls of her studio in the university's Watson Hall, these state that she must carry the mattress whenever she is on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz is not there; and that she is not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help is offered she may accept it. In September that year she began carrying it on campus, which she <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> physically painful experience.|$|E

Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to Leigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, and Cher; she once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own. She considers Donatella Versace her muse and the English fashion designer Alexander McQueen as an inspiration. In turn, Versace calls Lady Gaga [...] "the fresh Donatella". Gaga has also been influenced by Princess Diana, whom she has admired since her childhood.|$|E

500|$|The Pillar's {{fate was}} sealed when Dublin Corporation issued a [...] "dangerous building" [...] notice. [...] The {{trustees}} {{agreed that the}} stump should be removed. [...] A last-minute request by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland for an injunction to delay the demolition on planning grounds was rejected by Justice Thomas Teevan. On 14 March the Army destroyed the stump by a controlled explosion, watched {{at a safe distance}} by a crowd [...] who, the press reported, [...] "raised a resounding cheer". There was a scramble for souvenirs, and many parts of the stonework were taken from the scene. Some of these relics, including Nelson's head, eventually found their way into museums; [...] parts of the lettered stonework from the pedestal are displayed in the grounds of the Butler House hotel in Kilkenny, while smaller remnants were used to decorate private gardens. Contemporary and subsequent accounts record that the army's explosion caused [...] more damage than the first, but this, Fallon <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> myth; damage claims arising from the second explosion amounted to {{less than a quarter of}} the sum claimed as a result of the original blast.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{scholars}} {{think the}} work is more complicated and important than a cursory read suggests. With the publication of True at First Light critics saw a more humane and empathetic Hemingway, and began to shift their emphasis away from {{the image of the}} [...] "white man with a gun." [...] Robert Fleming considers True at First Light [...] {{to be part of the}} Hemingway canon declaring, [...] "This is a more complicated book than it appears to be, and Hemingway deserves far more credit for it than the reviewers of the popular press have given it. Serious critics dealing with the late works would be advised not to ignore it". Gadjusek praises the prose style, which he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> new direction in Hemingway's writing; he also believes, despite the editing, the book is cohesive and whole with well-ordered themes. [...] Burwell considers the edits to the manuscript generally well-done, though she laments losses that she thinks contribute to some of the subtexts in the book. Biographer Kenneth Lynn criticized Hemingway's sons for editing the manuscript but of Hemingway he says the [...] "memoirist is being totally, indeed helplessly honest," [...] and Gray concedes the publication of the book [...] "underscores Hemingway's courage as a writer". Despite what he considers poor workmanship in the book, Wood considers Hemingway even at his worst a compelling writer and he says the literary estate should be left alone to save the literary influence.|$|E

Shinji Hatano, General Manager for Nintendo's Marketing Division, believes that Dragon Quest IX, which he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quality title, not only could, but should, sell more copies in the United States and Europe. In addition to the overseas market, the entire game is designed around the multi-player aspect. Minor aspects like party talk, which was in previous titles, {{and only a few}} pre-defined non-player characters and more significant things like the quest system which can often be taken multiple times and are presumably designed around getting friends to help with specific missions. Other changes, like the lack of random battles also are structured toward this goal, but on a more tangential level.|$|E

Kumiko suggests starting by looking in the alley, a closed-off strip of land existing behind their house. After Toru has hung {{out there for a}} while with no luck, May Kasahara, who had been watching him camping out the alley for some time, questions him. She then invites him over to her house in order to sit on the patio and look over an abandoned house that she <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> popular hangout for stray cats. The abandoned house is revealed to possibly contain some strange omen, as it had brought bad luck to all of its prior tenants.

2500|$|The One People's Project {{claims that}} MacDonald has {{promoted}} anti-Semitic propaganda {{under the guise}} of what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legitimate and academic search for truth. He has been accused of misrepresenting the sources he uses in that regard. For example, Barry Mehler, an educator at Ferris State University, noted that MacDonald had claimed that [...] "Jewish opposition to the 1921 and 1924 legislation (to limit immigration) was motivated less by a desire for higher levels of Jewish immigration than by opposition to the implicit theory that America should be dominated by individuals with northern and western European ancestry." [...] MacDonald based this on a dissertation entitled “American Jewry and United States immigration policy, 1881–1953” by Sheldon Morris Neuringer. Nueringer’s thesis posited that Jewish opposition in 1921 and 1924 to the anti-immigration legislation at the time was due more to it having the [...] "taint of discrimination and anti-Semitism" [...] as opposed to how it would limit Jewish immigration. Mehler stated [...] "It seems to me Mr. MacDonald is misrepresenting Mr. Neuringer in this case and I posted my query hoping that a historian familiar with the literature might have a judgment on MacDonald's use of the historical data."' ...|$|E

2500|$|Radar's {{first name}} is stated as Walter, and once (in [...] "Fade Out, Fade In"), he {{introduces}} himself by {{his full name}} to Charles Emerson Winchester III as [...] "Walter Eugene O'Reilly". The book says his name is J. Robespierre, and his first name is not revealed in the film. Radar O'Reilly was fraudulently [...] "promoted" [...] {{for a short time}} (through a semi-intentional machination of Hawkeye and B.J.) to second lieutenant, but discovered he disliked officers' duties and asked them to [...] "bust" [...] him back to corporal. Gary Burghoff, one of only two cast members of the original 1970 film to play the same character in the TV series, had been growing restless in his role since at least season 4. With each successive year, he appeared in fewer episodes; and by season 7, Radar is in barely half of the shows. Burghoff planned to leave {{at the end of the}} seventh season (in 1979), but was convinced by producers Alda and Metcalfe to wait until the beginning of season 8, when they filmed a two-part farewell episode, [...] "Good Bye, Radar" [...] (originally intended to be the seventh season's finale), as well as a few short scenes that were inserted into episodes preceding it (Radar is shown having a horrible R & R in Tokyo). The final nod to Radar came in the penultimate episode of the series, [...] "As Time Goes By", when his iconic teddy bear (though it was a different bear than was used throughout the show) was included in a time capsule of the 4077th initiated by Margaret, which Hawkeye <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> symbol of those who [...] "came as boys and went home as men." ...|$|E
