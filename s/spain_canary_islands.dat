50|$|Between September 1939 and June 1940, the French {{submarines}} patrolled in the Northern {{seas and}} the Atlantic, notably {{in front of}} the neutral ports of <b>Spain,</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands,</b> and the Archipelago of the Azores, where a part of the German commercial marine sought refuge, suspected of serving the German U-Boote. Contrary to the Germans, the French officers had for orders and instruction to respect the terms of the London Naval Treaty : the submarines had to manifest their presence to the commercial ships prior to an attack, and only when the crew was driven to safety; all these precautionary measures reduced the efficiency of the submarine arms. Le Redoutable (Le Redoutable) spotted during the night of November 1 a cargo that was navigating with all lights off. The cargo refusing to halt following the request of the submarine, was fired upon warning shots with the 100mm cannon, to which the cargo fired back in direction of the submarine. At that instance, Le Redoutable received a message from British cargo ship Egba which was signaling being attacked by a U-Boot; the French submarine then, understood that the boat was dealing with an ally, accordingly preparations for shots fired were halted and the submarine retreated. In December 1939, the Le Fresnel (Le Fresnel), L'Achéron (L'Achéron), Le Redoutable (Le Redoutable), Le Héros (Le Héros) were sent to search for the German tanker Altmark (10000 tonnage), supplier of German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, {{in the center of the}} Atlantic. The tanker, carrying prisoners of attacked ships by the German cruiser, managed to evade and made way towards Norway. During the winter of 1939-1940, the L'Achille (L'Achille), Le Casabianca, Le Pasteur (Le Pasteur), Le Sfax (Le Sfax) escorted three allied cargo convoys from Helifax until the United Kingdom. They were relieved in February by Le Bévéziers and Le Sidi Ferruch (Le Sidi-Ferruch) then, in April, by L'Archimède (L'Archimède) and L'Ajax (L'Ajax).|$|E

5000|$|In Iberia {{the mean}} {{frequency}} of haplogroup L lineages reaches 3.83%; the frequency {{is higher in}} Portugal (5.83%) than in Spain (2.9% average), and without parallel {{in the rest of}} Europe. In both countries, frequencies vary widely between regions, but with increased frequencies observed for Madeira (insular Portugal), southern Portugal, Córdoba (southern Spain), Huelva (southern <b>Spain),</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> (insular Spain), Extremadura (western Spain) and Leon (western Spain). In the Autonomous regions of Portugal (i.e. Madeira and the Azores), L haplogroups constituted about 13% of the lineages in Madeira, significantly more than in the Azores. In the Canary Islands, frequencies have been reported at 6.6%. Regarding Iberia, current debates are concerned with whether these lineages are associated with prehistoric migrations, the Islamic occupation of Iberia, or the slave trade. [...] suggested that African lineages in Iberia were predominantly the result of the Atlantic slave tarade. [...] revealed that most of the L lineages in Iberia matched Northwest African L lineages rather than contemporary Sub-Saharan L lineages. The authors suggest that this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than during the slave trade. According to , the Sub-Saharan lineages found in Iberia matched lineages from diverse regions in Africa. They suggest this pattern is more compatible with a recent arrival of these lineages after slave trading began in the 15th century. According to the study, alternative scenarios that invoke much older and demographically more significant introductions (...) or that claim a substantial role of the Roman and/or Islamic periods on the introduction of Sub-Saharan lineages seem unlikely. [...] extracted DNA from human remains that were exhumed from old burial sites in Al-Andalus, Spain. The remains date to between the 12th and 13th centuries. The frequency of Sub-Saharan lineages detected in the medieval samples was 14.6% and 8.3% in the present population of Priego de Cordoba. The authors suggest the Muslim occupation and prehistoric migrations before the Muslim occupation would have been the source of these lineages. The highest frequencies of Sub-Saharan lineages found so far in Europe were observed by Álvarez et al. (2010) in the comarca of Sayago (18.2%) which is, according to the authors, [...] "comparable to that described for the South of Portugal" [...] and by Pereira et al. 2010 in Alcácer do Sal (22%).|$|E

40|$|Siphonaria pectinata (Linnaeus, 1758) {{has been}} {{considered}} a widespread species with Amphiatlantic distribution or a case of cryptic taxonomy where sibling species exist. We undertook molecular evaluation of 66 specimens from across its putative distribution range.

While little information could be derived from the shell morphology, molecular data clearly distinguished three lineages with no apparent connectivity. These lineages correspond to what we interpret as three species, two suspected from prior work: S. pectinata, restricted to the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and S. naufragum Stearns, 1872 in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|Background: There is an {{increasing}} prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) in developing countries. It has been shown the relationship between social class and MS in developed countries. The objective of our study was to compare the association of social class with the prevalence of MS in a developing country (Tunisia, region of Cap-Bon) and a developed one (<b>Spain,</b> <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands).</b> Methods: Cross-sectional study of 6729 Canarian and 393 Tunisian individuals. Social class was measured with the income, crowding and education (ICE) model, which includes family income, household crowding and education level. Logistic regression models adjusted by age estimated the risk by odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI 95 %) of MS according to social class. Results: MS prevalence was higher in Tunisian (50 %) than in Canarian women (29 %; p = 0. 002), with {{no significant differences between}} men. For Canarian women, being in the highest social class was a protective factor against MS (OR = 0. 39; CI 95 % 0. 29 – 0. 53) and all its components. The Canarian population and the Tunisian women, showed a significant linear trend (p < 0. 001) of MS to decrease when social class increased. Conclusion: High social class is a protective factor from MS and its components within the Canarian population and the Tunisian women. Our results suggest that the socioeconomic transition in a developing country like Tunisia can improve the population health in a sex-specific manner...|$|E
