40|$|Introduction: Adverse {{reactions}} to antimicrobials in Cuba {{have taken place}} since 2003 to date, {{the first in the}} report of adverse reactions in general, as well as serious and fatal reactions, on the skin and schedules are the systems more affected. This research aimed to characterize the antibacterial dermatologic toxicities reported by the national coordinating pharmacovigilance unit from 2007 to 2009. Method: An observational study of Pharmacovigilance, descriptive and transversal using Spontaneous Reporting of <b>Suspected</b> <b>Adverse</b> <b>Reaction</b> database and the Cuban system of pharmacovigilance. Reports were analyzed for antibacterial dermatologic toxicities reported from 2007 through 2009, the primary endpoint was the dermatologic adverse effect reported. Results: A total of 3006 suspected adverse {{reactions to}} skin. Predominated in females (60. 2 %) and in adults, 53. 7 %. The antibacterial associated with increased number of notifications were 18. 5 % RL penicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, 17. 3 % and 9. 7 %. Dermatological adverse events predominated were rash and urticaria. Moderate adverse effects predominated (64. 4 %), 87. 5 % were probable and 81. 8 % common. Conclusions: Adverse dermatologic antibacterial dominated by females and in adults. RL Penicillin was the drug most associated with adverse reactions. Moderate adverse reactions, probable and common were the more frequent in the study...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} and characterize <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> in adult patients {{admitted to the}} Intensive Care Unit, we conducted a retrospective study from January to June 2007 in a university hospital.

The <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were classified according to their causation and predictability. A total 270 patients were monitored, 20 of whom (7. 4 %) showed {{had at least one}} <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction.</b> The gender, number of diagnoses, mean number of medications prescribed per day, and length of hospital stay were associated with the development of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction.</b> <b>Suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were classified as having predominantly possible causality and predictability of type A.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether anecdotal reports of <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> are valuable early warning signals. DESIGN: Systematic literature survey DATA SOURCES: We evaluated all case reports of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> published in 1997 in five medical journals. Reports were excluded if the <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> {{had previously been}} described in earlier publications and was already listed in the product information of the drug reference source (the British National Formulary (BNF) or the Medicines Compendium). We used the Web of Knowledge Citation Index and Medline for 2003 to identify follow-up studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: the number of <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> subjected to formal validation studies and the findings of these studies. Secondary: the number of instances in which the warning from the case report was incorporated into the product information. RESULTS: We evaluated 63 <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> and found that most (52 / 63, 83 %) {{had not yet been}} subjected to further detailed evaluation. Data from controlled studies that supported the postulated link between the drug and the adverse event were available in only three cases. Of the 48 agents listed in the drug reference sources, details of the suspected reaction were subsequently added to the Medicines Compendium in 15 instances, and to the BNF in seven instances. In each case, only one reaction had been confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Published case reports of <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> are of limited value as suspicions are seldom subjected to confirmatory investigation. Furthermore, these alerts are not incorporated into drug reference sources in a systematic manner...|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{case reports}} {{contribute}} {{about one-third of}} the published literature on adverse drug reactions and interactions, but are regarded as providing poor-quality evidence. However, they can occasionally provide proof of cause and effect, and there are many other reasons for publishing them. Because an anecdote is a narrative, narratological paradigms from literature, art, and music can show how we can make evidential use of anecdotes. Useful paradigms are the dramatic unities (of time, place, and action), comprehensive catalogues, and pattern formations. Here I give examples of each of these types of paradigm and show how they can be used to interpret anecdotes about adverse drug reactions and interactions. The dramatic unities show how a proper classification of adverse drug reactions can be achieved, according to dose-relation, time-course, and susceptibility factors; use of this classification should improve the evidential use of anecdotal reports. A high background incidence of the effect (the medical equivalent of subplots, which violate the unity of action) makes it more difficult to detect adverse drug effects using anecdotal reports. To make best evidential use of the corpus of anecdotal reports of adverse drug reactions, comprehensiveness is important: each <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> should be reported in detail and reactions should be reported in sufficient numbers for proper classification and for patterns to be recognized. One form of pattern recognition, teleoanalysis of data, should, when possible, include not only randomized controlled trials and observational studies, but also case series and anecdotal reports...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Natural health {{products}} are {{promoted to the}} public as equally or more effective and less toxic than conventional drugs. However, some 'natural' medicines, and in particular some herbal medicines, are known to have adverse effects. The Italian Pharmacovigilance System, in charge of the Italian Medicines Agency, collects spontaneous reports only for registered drugs. The awareness of the need of surveillance of the safety of natural health products has stimulated the implementation of a <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> reporting system in Italy. The system has been set up by the Italian National Institute of Health. Methods An ad hoc reporting form can be downloaded from different institutional web sites. Voluntary reports of suspected adverse reactions are sent to the National Institute of Health and are evaluated by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Results From April 2002 to March 2007, 233 spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to natural health products were collected. A large proportion of suspected adverse reactions were serious: hospitalization was reported in 35 % of forms; 6 % reported life threatening clinical events and two fatal events were notified. About 50 % of suspected adverse reactions were related to gastrointestinal, skin, psychiatric and nervous system disorders. Mainly herbal products (66 %) were involved. Twenty-one cases of hepatitis of various seriousness were reported. Twenty-one reports were associated with 27 homeopathic preparations, mostly preparations containing mixtures of substances. Fourteen reports regarded suspected reactions to products containing propolis. Conclusion Safety and efficacy of 'natural' medicines have not been thoroughly investigated. It is important to improve communication with the public on safety issues. Encouraging spontaneous reporting can contribute to improve awareness among health personnel and patients about the benefit-harm profile of these remedies.

40|$|Background: The thiopurines {{azathioprine}} and 6 -mercaptopurine {{are recommended}} for maintenance of remission in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD). Measurement of concentrations of the metabolites 6 -thioguanine nucleotide and 6 -methylmercaptopurine helps delineate interindividual variation in metabolism that may underlie variability in efficacy and toxicity. Aims: We aimed to perform a retrospective observational study to determine the utility of thiopurine metabolite testing following its introduction into South Australia. Methods: All patients having thiopurine metabolite tests done at Flinders Medical Centre between November 2008 and January 2010 were identified. Case notes of patients with testing done {{in the context of}} treatment for IBD were interrogated to determine the reason for testing, clinical context and outcome. Results: One hundred and fifty-one patients were identified with thiopurine metabolite testing for IBD with 157 testing episodes. Eighty (51. 0 %) had testing done for flare or inefficacy, 18 (11. 5 %) for adverse effects, 5 (3. 2 %) for a combination of inefficacy and adverse effects, and 54 (34. 4 %) for routine or other reasons. Testing was followed by improved outcomes of increased efficacy, reduced toxicity or change to alternative therapy in 55. 0 % of the inefficacy/flare group, 27. 8 % of the <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> group, 60. 0 % of the combination group, and 13. 0 % of the routine/other group. Allopurinol was used as cotherapy in 16 patients and led to marked improvements in metabolite concentrations. Conclusions: Thiopurine metabolite testing has quickly become established in South Australia. When used for inefficacy or adverse effects, it often leads to improved outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether routine testing to guide dosing is of benefit. N. A. Kennedy, T. L. Asser, R. E. Mountifield, M. P. Doogue, J. M. Andrews and P. A. Bampto...|$|E

40|$|Both {{oseltamivir}} and zanamivir {{are safe}} drugs with relatively few adverse effects based on clinical trial data. A theoretical risk of bronchospasm {{with the use}} of inhaled zanamivir is of concern in those with respiratory disease and there is an unknown risk of very rare skin reactions to oseltamivir. Despite the concerns about neuropsychiatric events {{with the use of}} NAIs, and the inclusion of these in product literature, pharmacoepidemiogical studies and case report analysis cast doubt on such an association. Influenza infection is arguably the more plausible cause of neuropsychiatric events.

40|$|Since 2013 {{the number}} of <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to the {{quadrivalent}} human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine reported to the Danish Medicines Agency (DMA) has increased. Due to the resulting public concerns about vaccine safety, the coverage of HPV vaccinations in the childhood vaccination programme has declined. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine health care-seeking prior to the first HPV vaccination among females who <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to HPV vaccine. In this registry-based case-control study, we included as cases vaccinated females with reports to the DMA of <b>suspected</b> severe <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> We selected controls without reports of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> from the Danish vaccination registry and matched by year of vaccination, age of vaccination, and municipality, and obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry and The National Health Insurance Service Register the history of health care usage two years prior to the first vaccine. We analysed the data by logistic regression while adjusting for the matching variables. The study included 316 cases who received first HPV vaccine between 2006 and 2014. Age range of cases was 11 to 52 years, with a peak at 12 years, corresponding to the recommended age at vaccination, and another peak at 19 to 28 years, corresponding to a catch-up programme targeting young women. Compared with 163, 910 controls, cases had increased care-seeking in the two years before receiving the first HPV vaccine. A multivariable model showed higher use of telephone/email consultations (OR 1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 2), physiotherapy (OR 2. 1; 95 % CI 1. 6 - 2. 8) and psychologist/psychiatrist (OR 1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 7). Cases were more likely to have a diagnosis in the ICD- 10 chapters of diseases of the digestive system (OR 1. 6; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 4), of the musculoskeletal system (OR 1. 6; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 2), symptoms or signs not classified elsewhere (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 5) as well as injuries (OR 1. 5; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 1. 9).

40|$|Background:  Occasionally, {{patients}} suffer systemic {{adverse effects}} from injections of local anaesthetic solutions. This may range from minor transient vasovagal attacks to life-threatening collapse. Methods:  The <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> {{reported to the}} Office of Product Review of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) were analysed in detail. Results:  There was a high incidence (70 %) of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> associated with prilocaine, which {{is much greater than}} its market share (less than 20 %). There is a tendency to consider all systemic <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> as being ‘allergic’ reactions although this is rarely the case. Syncope, cardiovascular and central nervous system reactions are much more common. There is also a risk of methaemoglobinaemia to prilocaine and articaine. A small series of cases referred to one of the authors were also reported. Conclusions:  Recommendations are made as to the prevention, acute care and subsequent investigation of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> The most important conclusion is not to just label the response as allergic and to use an alternative agent. Detailed investigation and reporting should be made for all cases of <b>suspected</b> severe <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> to local anaesthetic agents. PJ Sambrook, W Smith, J Elijah, AN Gos...|$|R

The Italian database of spontaneous reports of <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to natural products was analyzed to address herb-VKAs interactions. Results. From 2002 to 2009, we identified 12 reports with 7 cases of INR reduction in patients treated with warfarin (n = 3) and acenocoumarol (n = 4), and 5 cases of INR increase (all warfarin associated). It was reported 8 different herbal products as possibly interacting. Discussion. Our study confirms the risk of interactions, highlighting the difficulty to characterize them and their mechanisms and, finally, prevent their onset. The reported data underline the urgent need of healthcare providers being aware of the possible interaction between natural products and VKA, {{also because of the}} critical clinical conditions affecting patients.

Of these 47 reports, 14 related to categories of <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> where false-positive reports were unlikely: immediate reactions, local reactions, and known reactions caused by a different mode of administration or a brand previously thought or claimed to be safe. The problem of false alarms rose in the remaining types of reactions: general reactions that did not occur immediately after administration and arose {{for the first time}} with a new chemical entity. Of 33 reports of such <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> validity was satisfactorily established in 14 cases on the basis of rechallenge, predictability from known pharmacology, or the unique nature of the reaction.

Objective To identify any unmet information and communication needs described by parents whose child had a <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction.</b> Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews with parents of 44 children who had a <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> identified on hospital admission, during in-patient treatment or reported by parents using the Yellow Card Scheme (the UK system for collecting spontaneous reports of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions).</b> Interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone; most interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed. Analysis was informed by {{the principles of the}} constant comparative method. Results Many parents described being dissatisfied with how clinicians communicated about <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> and unclear about the implications for their child's future use of medicines. A few parents felt that clinicians had abandoned their child and reported refusing the use of further medicines because they feared a repeated <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction.</b> The accounts of parents of children with cancer were different. They emphasised their confidence in clinicians' management of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> and described how clinicians prospectively explained the risks associated with medicines. Parents linked symptoms to medicines in ways that resembled the established reasoning that clinicians use to evaluate the possibility that a medicine has caused an <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction.</b> Conclusion Clinicians' communication about <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> was poor from the perspective of parents, indicating that improvements are needed. The accounts of parents of children with cancer indicate that prospective explanation about <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> at the time of prescription can be effective.

Of these cats, 37 were categorised as probable and 24 as possible pulmonary oedema. The first clinical signs had been noted between 1 minute and 2 days (median, 15 minutes) after α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist administration. Many cats probably had no intravenous overhydration when the first clinical signs were detected, as either they presumably had no intravenous cannula or the signs appeared before, during or immediately after cannulation. Of the 61 cats, 43 survived, 14 died and for four the outcome was not clearly stated.

40|$|The {{withdrawal}} of cerivastatin {{from the world}} market because of deaths from rhabdomyolysis (a disorder that results from skeletal muscle injury with release of muscle cell contents into the plasma) focused attention on the risk of adverse events and, in particular, myotoxicity {{that are associated with}} statins. The World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for International Drug Monitoring carried out an evaluation of statins using the WHO database. The study demonstrated that, qualitat-ively, there is a similarity among the safety profiles of all clinically used statins with respect to serious <b>suspected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> and the most frequently reported cases. Furthermore, based on an analysis of spontaneous reports (i. e. those provided by patients and doctors), {{there appears to be a}} strong link between cerivastati...|$|R
