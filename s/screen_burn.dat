50|$|The {{length of}} time {{required}} for noticeable <b>screen</b> <b>burn</b> to develop varies due to many factors, ranging from {{the quality of the}} phosphors employed, to the degree of non-uniformity of sub-pixel usage. It can take as little as only a few weeks for noticeable ghosting to set in, especially if the screen displays a certain image (example: a menu bar at the top or bottom of the screen) constantly, and displays it continually over time. In the rare case when horizontal or vertical deflection circuits fail, all output energy is concentrated to a vertical or horizontal line on the display which causes almost instant <b>screen</b> <b>burn.</b>|$|E
50|$|Screen burn-in, image burn-in or ghost image, colloquially {{known as}} <b>screen</b> <b>burn,</b> is a {{permanent}} discoloration of areas on an electronic display such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) display or computer display monitor or television set caused by cumulative non-uniform usage of the pixels.|$|E
50|$|Screensavers {{derive their}} name from their {{original}} purpose, {{which was an}} active method of attempting to stave off <b>screen</b> <b>burn.</b> By ensuring that no pixel or group of pixels was left displaying a static image for extended periods of time, phosphor luminosity was preserved. Modern screensavers can turn off the screen when not in use.|$|E

50|$|He {{first learned}} of ceramic pot filters from its {{inventor}} Guatemalan chemist Fernando Mazariegos. Rivera produced this inexpensive filter developed in Guatemala by Mr. Mazariegos from {{a mix of}} local terra-cotta clay and sawdust or other combustible materials, such as rice husks. The combustible ingredient, which has been milled and <b>screened,</b> <b>burns</b> out in the firing, leaving a network of fine pores. After firing, the filter is coated with colloidal silver. This combination of fine pore size and the bactericidal properties of colloidal silver produce an effective filter, killing over 98 percent of the contaminants that cause diarrhea, thus dramatically reducing public health problems in the communities that use them to purify potable water. He designed a mold for the filter and a special clay press that was operated with a tire jack.|$|R
50|$|Glitch {{art is the}} {{practice}} of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices. Glitches appear in visual art such as the film A Colour Box (1935) by Len Lye, the video sculpture TV Magnet (1965) by Nam June Paik and more comtemporary work such as Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma <b>Screen</b> <b>Burn</b> (2007) by Cory Arcangel.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of operating the transformer at the flyback frequency {{is that it}} can be much smaller and lighter than a comparable transformer operating at mains (line) frequency. Another advantage is that it provides a failsafe mechanism — should the horizontal deflection circuitry fail, the flyback transformer will cease operating and shut down the rest of the display, preventing the <b>screen</b> <b>burn</b> that would otherwise result from a stationary electron beam.|$|E
5000|$|Monochrome {{monitors}} {{are particularly}} susceptible to <b>screen</b> <b>burn</b> (hence the advent, and name, of the screensaver), because the phosphors used {{are very high}} intensity. Another effect of the high-intensity phosphors is an effect known as [...] "ghosting", wherein a dim afterglow of the screen's contents is briefly visible after the screen has been blanked. This has a certain place in pop culture, as evidenced in movies such as The Matrix.|$|E

30|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective, single-center cohort {{study in the}} Burn Unit of the Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France. The study was approved by our local ethical committee (comité de protection des personnes IV, St-Louis Hospital; Institutional Review Board 00003835, protocol 2013 / 17 NICB). All medical records of the patients admitted to our intensive care burn unit (ICBU) between March 2013 and October 2014 were <b>screened.</b> <b>Burn</b> patients meeting all the following criteria {{were included in the}} study: total body surface area burn (TBSA burn) > 20  %, delay from the time of thermal injury to the time of ICBU < 8  h, patients with invasive blood pressure and continuous cardiac output monitoring within the first hour after admission, patients with a central venous catheter (CVC) in the superior vena cava (SVC) territory. Exclusion criteria were: patients with chemical or electrical burns, coexisting non-burn trauma, patients moribund on admission or dead within 72  h from admission, and patients with do-not-resuscitate orders.|$|R
50|$|Both plasma-type and LCD-type {{displays}} {{exhibit a}} similar phenomenon called transient image persistence, which is sometimes confused with <b>screen</b> <b>burn</b> {{but is not}} permanent. In the case of plasma-type displays, transient image persistence is caused by charge build-up in the pixel cells (not cumulative luminance degradation as with burn-in), which can be seen sometimes when a bright image that was set against a dark background {{is replaced by a}} dark background only; this image retention is usually released once a typical-brightness image is displayed and does not inhibit the display's typical viewing image quality.|$|E
50|$|Singapore utilises plasma {{displays}} in metro stations to display train service information. Critics have opposed {{the use of}} plasma displays as they are considerably more expensive to install and are susceptible {{to the problem of}} <b>screen</b> <b>burn.</b> However, the rail operators see this as a medium to earn advertising revenue from commercials shown on these displays. At the same time, they are able to display all the train service information, safety messages and time and date on these screens clearly. Using the flip dot system previously, only a limited amount of information could be displayed.|$|E
50|$|With phosphor-based {{electronic}} displays (for example CRT-type {{computer monitors}} or plasma displays), non-uniform use of pixels, such as prolonged display of non-moving images (text or graphics), gaming, or certain broadcasts with tickers and flags, {{can create a}} permanent ghost-like image of these objects or otherwise degrade image quality. This is because the phosphor compounds which emit light to produce images lose their luminance with use. Uneven usage results in uneven light output over time, and in severe cases can create a ghost image of previous content. Even if ghost images are not recognizable, the effects of <b>screen</b> <b>burn</b> are an immediate and continual degradation of image quality.|$|E

5000|$|In many cases, {{the use of}} a {{screensaver}} is impractical. Most plasma-type display manufacturers include {{methods for}} reducing the rate of burn-in by moving the image slightly, which does not eliminate <b>screen</b> <b>burn,</b> but can soften the edges of any ghost image that does develop. Similar techniques exist for modern OLED displays. For example, manufacturers of Android Wear watches with OLED displays can request that Android Wear enable [...] "burn protections techniques" [...] that periodically shift the contents of the screen by a few pixels. Google requests that when these techniques are enabled, watch face developers do not use large blocks of pixels so that different pixels are burned in with each shift, reducing the overall wear of the pixels.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Bone {{changes are}} {{increasingly}} described after burn. How bone markers could help to detect early bone changes or to <b>screen</b> <b>burn</b> patients {{at higher risk}} of demineralization is still not made clear. We performed an observational study assessing the changes in serum bone markers after moderate burn. METHODS: Adults admitted in the first 24 h following burn extended on > 10 % body surface area were included. Serum levels of collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 b (TRAP), type 1 procollagen N-terminal (P 1 NP) and bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) were measured at admission and every week during the first month. Data are expressed as median [min-max]. RESULTS: Bone markers were measured in 20 patients: 18 men, 2 women (including one post-menopausal). Age was 46 [19 - 86] years old, burn surface area reached 15 [7 - 85] %. Twelve patients completed the study. All biomarkers mainly remained into normal ranges during evolution. A huge variability was observed regarding biomarkers evolution. Patient's evolution was not linear and could fluctuate from a decrease to an increase of blood concentrations. There was not necessarily a consistency between the two formation or the two resorption markers. Variations observed between two consecutive measurements were lesser than the accepted critical difference in almost {{one third of the}} cases. CONCLUSIONS: Considering available data, role and interest of bone markers in management of burn related bone disease remain unclear. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In a burn center, an {{outbreak}} of group A streptococci (GAS) colonizations involving 13 patients and two staff members occurred. Adverse events due to GAS, loss of skin graft after initial take (secondary loss) and partial take, occurred in patients who underwent surgery before the colonization was detected. GAS isolates from nine patients and one staff member were stored and subsequently pheno- and genotyped by T serotyping, gas chromatography, M genotyping, and random amplified polymorphic DNA typing. The outbreak was caused by two types of GAS, identified as T 4 / 28 -M 48 and T 13 -M 77 by T serotyping and M genotyping. Random amplified polymorphic DNA typing and gas chromatography distinguished both clusters accurately. One subcluster indicated by gas chromatography could {{be linked to the}} acquisition of GAS from a roommate. The T 13 -M 77 cluster was characterized by rapid spread through the center compared with the T 4 / 28 -M 48 cluster. One patient contracted the T 13 -M 77 strain while in protective isolation, indicating a role for staff members in the transmission. Our standard GAS control policy, consisting of twice weekly <b>screening</b> of all <b>burned</b> patients and immediate isolation and treatment, proved efficacious in preventing further spread of GAS.
