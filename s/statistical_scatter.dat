50|$|Both {{of these}} are issues of {{mesoscale}} (L) of the domain of random microstructure over which smoothing (or homogenization) is being done relative to the microscale (d). As L/d goes to infinity, the RVE is obtained, while any finite mesoscale involves <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> and, therefore, describes an SVE. With these considerations one obtains bounds on effective (macroscopic) response of elastic (non)linear and inelastic random microstructures. In general, the stronger the mismatch in material properties, or the stronger the departure from elastic behavior, the larger is the RVE. The finite-size scaling of elastic material properties from SVE to RVE can be grasped in compact forms {{with the help of}} scaling functions universally based on stretched exponentials. Considering that the SVE may be placed anywhere in the material domain, one arrives at a technique for characterization of continuum random fields.|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the purely <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> of {{estimated}} (i. e., 'measured') integral length scales of turbulent wind speed in the boundary layer. However, the purely <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> of means, standard deviations, variances and turbulence intensities is also dealt with to some extent. By purely <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> {{we understand the}} kind of scatter that occurs between numerous repeated measurements for {{one and the same}} stationary wind process. Integral length scales are important for structural analysis; however, in the literature, their values are subject to a very large scatter, and their purely <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> can be very large in the atmospheric boundary layer. Physical scatter of integral length scale measurements and scatter due to differing calculation methods are also discussed as a side issue. It is shown how autoregressive models can be employed for predicting the purely <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> of estimated integral length scales as well as other wind parameters and for analysing integral scale calculation methods. The essential and basically sufficient premise is that the mean wind speed and the spectral density of the autoregressive model be very close to those of the wind process to be simulated. However, the autoregressive order cannot be selected according to customary standard criteria given in the literature such as the FPE criterion. Capabilities and limitations of the autoregressive simulation (of the purely <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> of the wind parameters examined) are analysed theoretically, and the case of a non-gaussian wind process is also considered. Furthermore, some additional theoretical results as well as formulae related to the purely <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> of wind parameters are given. Computer simulation and formulae are compared with wind tunnel experiments. Autoregressive simulation is then applied to some examples in the atmospheric boundary layer. For a total wind record length of 20 minutes, at a height of 10 meters, it can easily happen that integral scale measurements are subject to a standard deviation of 20 % of their mean; however, at a height of 60 meters, the standard deviation may be 40 % and {{the same is true for}} larger integral scales. Finally, some recommendations are given for the estimation of integral scales. (orig.)

Furthermore, the statistical scatters of the creep and fatigue failure times at an arbitrary load level and a constant frequency at these two levels of temperatures were predicted using the statistical scatters for CSR strengths based on the kinetic crack growth law. On the other hand, the creep and the fatigue failure times were experimentally measured at the same conditions.

The {{decay of}} photoexcited quantum systems (examples are {{photodissociation}} of molecules and autoionization of atoms) {{can be viewed}} as a half-collision process (an incoming photon excites the system which subsequently decays by dissociation or autoionization). For this reason, the standard statistical approach to quantum scattering, originally developed to describe nuclear compound reactions, is not directly applicable.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a computer code entitled PSQUIRT for probabilistic evaluations of leak rate in nuclear piping. It is based on (1) the Henry-Fauske model of two-phase flow for thermal-hydraulic analysis and (2) an estimation model for elastic-plastic fracture-mechanics analysis. In both analyses, uncertainties arise due to the incomplete knowledge of the crackmorphology variables and <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> of the pipe material properties. The relevant parameters required to conduct these analyses were modeled as random variables. Henceforth, the above thermal-hydraulic and fracturemechanics models were put in a probabilistic format to allow statistical variability of input and determination of their effects in pipe fracture and leak-before-break (LBB) evaluations. A standard Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to perform the probabilistic analysis. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the PSQUIRT code. Probabilistic analyses were performed by PSQUIRT for a stainless steel and a carbon steel pipe. Histograms were developed for leakage rate and flaw size in these pipes for LBB applications. The results suggest that the variability of leak rate can be significant due to <b>statistical</b> <b>scatter</b> of crack-morphology parameters. Using these histograms, the subsequent fracture stability of a leaking crack, actual or hypothetical, can be evaluated by either a deterministic or a probabilistic method. 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Determining the {{mechanical}} properties of short fibre reinforced CMC using standard sized coupons {{has always been}} a challenge due to a high <b>statistical</b> <b>scattering</b> of the measured values. Although the random orientation of short fibres results in a quasi-isotropic material behavior of 2 D-structures with a sufficiently large volume, the small volume typical for test coupons usually results in a non-isotropic fibre orientation in the tested volume. This paper describes a method for manufacturing unidirectional oriented short fibre reinforced CMC materials and presents material properties of UD-C/C-SiC. After verifying the fibre orientation of the CMC using micro-computed tomography, coupons were extracted to determine the orthotropic material properties. These orthotropic material properties were then used to predict the properties of C/C-SiC with randomly distributed short fibres. To validate the method, micro-computed tomography is used to quantitatively determine the fibre orientation within coupons extracted from randomly distributed short fibre C/C-SiC. After mechanical three-point-bending tests, the measured stiffness and bending strength is compared with the predicted properties. Finally, the data are used to devise a method suited for reducing the inherent large spread of material properties associated with the measurement of CMC materials with randomly distributed short fibres...|$|R

The process of this development has clarified several problems which are of significant interest to the synchrotron community. These problems have been addressed to some extent, for example, for large astronomical telescopes, and at the National Ignition Facility for normal incidence optics, {{but not in the}} synchrotron community for grazing incidence optics. Since {{it is based on the}} Power Spectral Density (PSD) to provide a description of the deviations from ideal shape of the surface, accurate prediction of the scattering requires an accurate estimation of the PSD. Specifically, the spatial frequency range of measurement must be the correct one for the geometry of use of the optic [...] including grazing incidence and coherence effects, and the modifications to the PSD of the Optical Transfer Functions (OTF) of the measuring instruments must be removed. A solution for removal of OTF effects has been presented previously, the Binary Pseudo-Random Grating. Typically, the frequency range of a single instrument does not cover the range of interest, requiring the stitching together of PSD estimations. This combination generates its own set of difficulties in two dimensions. Fitting smooth functions to two dimensional PSDs, particularly in the case of spatial non-isotropy of the surface, which is often the case for optics in synchrotron beam lines, can be difficult. The convenient, and physically accurate fractal for one dimension does not readily transfer to two dimensions.
