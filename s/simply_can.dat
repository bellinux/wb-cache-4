25|$|Anthony Cordesman, while {{speaking}} of the specific situation in Iraq, makes some points that can be generalized to other nations in turmoil. Cordesman recognizes some value in the groupings in Samuel P. Huntington's idea of the clash of civilizations, but, rather assuming the civilizations must clash, these civilizations <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> be recognized as actors in a multinational world. In the case of Iraq, Cordesman observes that the burden is on the Islamic civilization, not unilaterally the West, {{if for no other}} reason that the civilization to which the problematic nation belongs will have cultural and linguistic context that Western civilization cannot hope to equal.|$|E

[...] Adding to the value, study spaces, conferences rooms, library facilities, and a dining hall were set up in Lehman Hall for students in 1964. [...] In addition, there was a television lounge were students could watch the WGBH programs.|$|E

2500|$|Following the breakup, Christensen {{became more}} {{introverted}} than usual, {{and his girlfriend}} could not handle him being in this crisis. He went through a difficult time of coping with both his breakup with the band and with Rosendahl, but {{he went on to}} find his musical style, which resulted in the release of his debut solo album Secrets on Parade in 2000, of which some songs were based on the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy demos from 1998. Several songs on the album were rather ambiguous as to whether they referred to Dizzy Mizz Lizzy or Rosendahl. The album was a success, and it allowed him to further pursue a career in music. Nielsen and Friis initially also intended to continue in music, but turned to a normal working-class life. To walk off the extra weight he had gained from being at home for a long time, Nielsen {{took a job as a}} postman, while Friis became a truck driver delivering gas containers. Despite their different paths, Christensen explained in a 2000 interview that the trio remained friends: [...] "We meet occasionally and have great fun together. Of course we talk about the old days and amuse ourselves with it, because we experienced a lot of great things together and I <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> not remember anything bad from back then. (...) But we just developed ourselves in three different directions, and we kept growing further apart, so it was simply the time to stop." ...|$|E

"Now, Mr. Quatermain," [...] {{said the}} lady next him, [...] "we {{have been kept}} in an agony of {{suspense}} by Sir Henry and Captain Good, who have persistently refused to tell us a word of this story about the hidden treasure till you came, and we <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> bear it no longer; so, please, begin at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{public has}} a short memory, {{signatures}} to petitions {{in the line of}} mercy are had for the asking, and tender-hearted Governors are familiar afflictions. We have life sentences already, and sometimes they are served to the end--if the end comes soon enough! but the average length of [...] "life imprisonment" [...] is, I am told, a little more than seven years. Hope springs eternal in the human beast, and matters <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> not be so arranged that in entering the penitentiary he will [...] "leave hope behind." [...] Hopeless captivity is a dream.|$|E

He went on: 'Then there's my father--you know him. He {{was against the}} other affair, but, if he thinks I have {{committed}} myself and then want to back out, why, with his ideas, he'd rather see me dead. But I can't {{go on with the}} other thing now: I <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> not. I've a good mind to go out after rabbits, and pot myself crawling through a hedge.' ...|$|E

You fellows know there are those voyages that seem ordered for the illustration of life, that might stand for a symbol of existence. You fight, work, sweat, nearly kill yourself, sometimes do kill yourself, trying to accomplish something--and you can't. Not from any fault of yours. You <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> do nothing, neither great nor little--not a thing in the world--not even marry an old maid, or get a wretched 600-ton cargo of coal to its port of destination.|$|E

The Act dissolved the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission {{and created}} the Competition Tribunal and the Competition Bureau.

The Competition Bureau carries out investigations.|$|E

5000|$|... 1. Designed Realism (1926-1944): Vance Kirkland’s first {{painting}} period, Designed Realism, {{consists of}} mostly watercolor and some oil paint. Lewis Sharp, Denver Art Museum Director, and former Curator, Metropolitan Museum, New York, stated, “…he handled this watercolor medium {{as well as}} any American artist ever has. You <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> go back and whether you want to begin with John Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, or move to the 20th century with John Marin or Charles Burchfield, Vance Kirkland was a master.” [...] This period includes still lifes, portraits and landscapes.|$|E

50|$|Although the fruiting {{bodies of}} M. xanthus are {{relatively}} primitive compared with, say, the elaborate structures produced by Stigmatella aurantiaca and other myxobacteria, {{the great majority}} of genes known to be involved in development are conserved across species. In order to make agar cultures of M. xanthus grow into fruiting bodies, one <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> plate the bacteria on starvation media. Furthermore, it is possible to artificially induce the production of myxospores without the intervening formation of fruiting bodies, by adding compounds such as glycerol or various metabolites to the medium. In this way, different stages in the developmental cycle can be experimentally isolated.|$|E

He takes her to a soundstage where she {{successfully}} runs through an elaborate combat simulation, complete with live gunfire. Barbara cites this as proof she is as capable as them, but when Batman asks her why {{she wants to do}} this, she is unable to give a clear answer- except that she <b>simply</b> <b>can,</b> and she believes Gotham needs all the help it can get. Still unimpressed, Batman has Robin knock her out once more with sleeping gas.|$|E
