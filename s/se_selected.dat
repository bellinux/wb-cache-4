40|$|Dental {{diseases}} {{are among the}} most prevalent and costly diseases affecting industrialized societies, and yet are highly preventable. The microflora of dental plaque biofilms from diseased sites is distinct from that found in health, although the putative pathogens can often be detected in low numbers at normal sites. In dental caries, there is a shift towards community dominance by acidogenic and acid-tolerant Gram-positive bacteria (e. g. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli) {{at the expense of the}} acid-sensitive species associated with sound enamel. In contrast, the numbers and proportions of obligately anaerobic bacteria, including Gram-negative proteolytic species, increase in periodontal diseases. Modelling studies using defined consortia of oral bacteria grown in planktonic and biofilm systems have been undertaken to identify environmental factors responsible for driving these deleterious shifts in the plaque microflora. Repeated conditions of low pH (rather than sugar availability per <b>se)</b> <b>selected</b> for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, while the introduction of novel host proteins and glycoproteins (as occurs during the inflammatory response to plaque), and the concomitant rise in local pH, enriched for Gram-negative anaerobic and asaccharolytic species.

The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine how crosses of lines selected for yield per se perform, and to examine the relationship of per se and hybrid performance. The 192 hybrids were evaluated in two replications at each of six Iowa environments. There were significant differences among HH, HL, and LL hybrid group means for grain yield and they were ranked (HH 3 ̆e HL 3 ̆e LL) as expected under a model assuming partial to complete dominance. The data suggests that on the average overdominance was not important for yield in BSSS. Correlations of inbred line traits with the same traits of the hybrids were larger than correlations of inbred line traits with hybrid yield. The correlations of inbred traits with hybrid yield were too small to be of predictive value. The data suggested that selection among lines per se for yield could be used to separate a population into a group of high and low combining lines based on their per se performance. However, per se performance within groups was not related to either specific or general combining ability. After selection for per se performance the smaller group of selected lines could be crossed to a series of testers to identify lines with the greatest hybrid potential...|$|E

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{is one of}} the {{important}} aetiological agents of food intoxications in Europe and can cause gastro-enteritis through the production of various staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in foods. Due to their stability and ease of production and dissemination, some SEs have also been studied as potential agents for bioterrorism. Therefore, specific and accurate analytical tools are required to detect and quantify SEs. Online solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS) based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to detect and quantify two types of SE (A and B) spiked in milk and buffer solution. SE extraction and concentration was performed according to the European Screening Method developed by the European Reference Laboratory for Coagulase Positive Staphylococci. Trypsin digests were screened for the presence of <b>SEs</b> using <b>selected</b> proteotypic heavy-labeled peptides as internal standards.

40|$|AbstractCarcinogens induce carcinogen-specific genetic {{instability}} (defects in DNA repair). According to the ‘direct-selection’ model, defects in DNA repair per se provide an immediate growth advantage. According to the ‘associated-selection’ model, carcinogens merely select for cells with adaptive mutations. Like any mutations, adaptive mutations occur predominantly in genetically unstable cells. The ‘associated-selection’ model predicts that carcinogen-driven selection minimizes cytotoxic but maximizes mutagenic effects of carcinogens. A purely mutagenic (neither cytotoxic, nor cytostatic) environment will favor effective DNA repair, whereas any growth-limiting conditions (telomerase deficiency, anticancer drugs) will select for genetically unstable cells. Genetic instability is a postmark of selective pressure {{rather than a}} hallmark of cancer per <b>se.</b> Once <b>selected,</b> {{genetic instability}} facilitates the development of resistance to any other growth-limiting conditions.

To achieve these objectives, peanut embryogenic tissues were cultured on selective medium containing various concentrations of S. rolfsii culture filtrates and sublethal concentration of the filtrates. Medium containing sublethal level of S. rolfsii culture filtrates was used {{to identify}} culture filtrate-insensitive SE of peanut. Subsequently, the <b>selected</b> <b>SEs</b> were germinated, plantlets were regenerated and preliminary tested against S. rolfsii.

40|$|MicroRNA (miRNA) are an {{important}} class of non-coding RNA which function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in cells, repressing and fine-tuning protein output. Prolonged seizures (status epilepticus, SE) can cause damage to brain regions such as the hippocampus and result in cognitive deficits and the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Emerging work in animal models has found that <b>SE</b> produces <b>select</b> changes to miRNAs within the brain. Similar changes in over 20 miRNAs {{have been found in}} the hippocampus in two or more studies, suggesting conserved miRNA responses after SE. The miRNA changes that accompany SE are predicted to impact levels of multiple proteins involved in neuronal morphology and function, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and cell death. miRNA expression also displays select changes in the blood after SE, supporting blood genomic profiling as potential molecular biomarkers of seizure-damage or epileptogenesis. Intracerebral delivery of chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides (antagomirs) has been shown to have potent, specific and long-lasting effects on brain levels of miRNAs. Targeting miR- 34 a, miR- 132 and miR- 184 has been reported to alter seizure-induced neuronal death, whereas targeting miR- 134 was neuroprotective, reduced seizure severity during status epilepticus and reduced the later emergence of recurrent spontaneous seizures.

40|$|Many {{marine species}} are {{threatened}} by high levels of incidental mortality in fisheries. This paper reviews the design of selected recent, detailed Ecological Risk Assessments (ERAs) {{of the effects of}} fishing on seabirds. Several aspects of ERA methodology for seabirds are still in development, including the most appropriate ways to: predict seabird distribution and fisheries overlap; handle data gaps; compare productivity and susceptibility among species; and incorporate data on bycatch. Nor is there consensus on rules for selecting species or populations for inclusion in assessments, the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution for the analyses, and the definition of risk. Despite these uncertainties, the clear benefits of undertaking quantitative or semi-quantitative ERAs include the identification of particularly vulnerable species or populations and of key areas and seasons in which bycatch may be occurring, and the highlighting of data gaps and priorities for future monitoring. ERAs are likely to be particularly effective where explicit links are established at the outset between the outcomes or conclusions of the ERA and management responses. A precautionary approach to bycatch mitigation can then be embedded in the broader fisheries management framework. However, this requires that the ERA process is not overly complex or is prolonged {{to the extent that it}} draws attention away from existing responsibilities and commitments to reduce bycatch per <b>se.</b> When <b>selecting</b> the best approach, it is vital to balance desired outputs against the availability of data for the assessment, and to deal with data gaps in a precautionary manner...|$|R

METHODS: In a large rheumatoid arthritis population of 930 patients from the same area (Rhône-Alpes, France), patients with (n = 198) or without infliximab treatment (n = 732) were compared according to their genetic status. Clinical, biological, and radiological data were collected. Typing for SE status and cytokine polymorphisms was carried out using enzyme linked oligosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was by chi(2) testing and calculation of odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: A dose relation was observed between the number of SE copies and joint damage in the whole rheumatoid population (OR, 1 v 0 SE copy = 2. 38 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 77 to 3. 19), p< 0. 001; OR 2 v 0 SE copy = 3. 92 (2. 65 to 5. 80), p< 0. 001. The SE effect increased with disease duration but was not significant before two years. Selection for infliximab treatment (n = 198) was associated with increased disease activity, joint damage, and the presence of the SE with a dose effect. In all, 66. 2 % patients achieved an ACR 20 improvement. No clinical or genetic factors were able to predict the clinical response to infliximab.

In the present study, seven members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and 2 lactic acid bacteria isolates, each capable of in vitro and in vivo inhibition of <b>SE,</b> were <b>selected</b> and combined to form the putative CE culture. In the first experiment, day-of-hatch chicks were randomly divided into four pens. All treated chicks were orally gavaged with the CE culture and 3 pens were treated with the CE culture in the drinking water for four consecutive days. Treated and control-non treated chicks were challenged with SE 48 hr later. All 3 groups of birds that were treated with the CE culture had a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in cecal colonization compared with non-CE-treated SE-challenged chicks. Two additional experiments were designed to measure the efficacy of the CE culture in reducing SE horizontal transmission from infected to uninfected chicks when commingled. SE was recovered in the cecal tonsils with a significantly lower incidence at days 7 and 14 in Experiment 2 and day 7 in Experiment 3 from the groups that received the CE in the drinking water as compared to controls respectively. These results suggest that a relatively simple and defined CE culture can reduce SE colonization in neonatal chicks...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} main {{hypotheses}} that {{explain how the}} evolution of parasite virulence could {{be linked to the}} evolution of secondary sexual traits, such as bird song. First, as Hamilton and Zuk proposed a role for parasites in sexual selection, female preference for healthy males in heavily parasitized species may result in extravagant trait expression. Second, a reverse causal mechanism may act, if sexual selection affects the coevolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions per <b>se</b> by <b>selecting</b> for increased virulence. Third, the immuno-suppressive effects of ornamentation by testosterone or limited resources may lead to increased susceptibility to parasites in species with elaborate songs. Assuming a coevolutionary relationship between parasite virulence and host investment in immune defense we used measures of immune function and song complexity to test these hypotheses in a comparative study of passerine birds. Under the first two hypotheses we predicted avian song complexity to be positively related to immune defense among species, whereas this relationship was expected to be negative if immuno-suppression was at work. We found that adult T-cell mediated immune response and the relative size of the bursa of Fabricius were independently positively correlated with a measure of song complexity, even when potentially confounding variables were held constant. Nestling T-cell response was not related to song complexity, probably reflecting age-dependent selective pressures on host immune defense. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that predict a positive relationship between song complexity and immune function, thus indicating a role for parasites in sexual selection. Different components of the immune system may have been independently involved in this process...|$|R

Based on this relationship, the predicted genetic diversity of an imaginary population of size equaling the total area of the islands was lower than that of the global population on the islands. Re-sampling demonstrated that low genetic diversity of populations in small habitats was caused by unevenness in sample size. Fisher's α index was similar among habitat types. These results indicate that the decreased nuclear and chloroplast genetic diversity of populations in smaller habitats was mainly caused by habitat loss. For nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite loci, values of F(ST) were 0. 066 and 0. 893, respectively, and the calculated pollen/seed dispersal ratio was 162. 2. When separated into pre-and post-fragmentation cohorts, pollen/seed ratios were 121. 2 and 189. 5, respectively. Our results suggest that habitat loss explains the early decrease in genetic diversity, while fragmentation per se may {{play a major role in}} inbreeding and differentiation among fragmented populations and later loss of genetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the Gaussian network {{paradigm}} {{can be used to}} solve optimization problems in continuous domains. Some methods of structure learning from data and simulation of Gaussian networks are applied in the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) as well as new methods based on information theory are proposed. Experimental results are also presented. 1 Estimation of Distribution Algorithms approaches in continuous domains Figure 1 shows a schematic of the EDA approach for continuous domains. We will use x = (x 1; : : :; xn) to denote individuals, and D l to denote the population of N individuals in the l-th generation. Similarly, D Se l will represent the population of the <b>selected</b> <b>Se</b> individuals from D l. In the EDA [9] our interest will be to estimate f(x j D Se), that is, the joint probability density function over one individual x being among the selected individuals. We denote as f l (x) = f l (x j D Se l 1) the joint density of the l-th genera [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{corruption}} and bribery involving major corporations in the United States such as Lockheed. However, most of this lite rature ignores the link between Watergate and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The role of accounting and accountants in disguising the use of corporate funds for illicit purposes has als o not been addressed even though many of the enquiries into Watergate and related activities exp ressed concern that none of the cases of financial misstatement had been discovered or, at l east reported, by auditors. In other words, the accountability system envisaged in the financial re porting and audit requirements of the Securities Exchange Act and professional pronouncem ents had failed. Nonetheless, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has done little to ad dress the accounting and audit failures that gave rise to its enactment. The paper uses post-Watergate investigations and hearings leading to the enactment of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 to demonstrate the power of interested parties to influence for their own benefit, the outcome of legislation and other forms of regulation. In general, the findings support the observation expressed in the Letter of Transmittal of the Final Report of the <b>Se</b> nate <b>Select</b> Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (1974 a, p. 1227) that while 2 ̆ 2 ran k has its privileges because rank has its responsibilities 2 ̆ 2, privilege is often used 2 ̆ 2 as a do dge of responsibility 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|Improving {{the fuel}} economy of on-highway {{vehicles}} is of major concern to government agencies, consumers and industry leaders, {{that has caused}} an expanding interest in hybrid vehicles. Hydraulic hybrid vehicles show great potential due to their high power density, high efficiency in regenerative braking and low cost of materials. There are many different hydraulic hybrid architectures that allow for better engine management and regenerative braking. The focus for this work is the blended hydraulic hybrid. This transmission achieves high efficiency and response {{through the use of}} a hydrostatic power path, additionally a set of check valves enable regenerative braking and blending of engine power and stored power from the accumulator. ^ A modified blended hybrid circuit was designed to allow for all time four wheel drive operation. Simulation was used to validate the design in four wheel drive turning events. ^ Optimal control and dynamic simulation were used to understand how the sizing of main components affected the performance and efficiency of this transmission. The main components that were investigated are the hydraulic pump, the two hydraulic motors, the accumulator volume and minimum accumulator pressure, in addition this was compared to a statically sized transmission. This study resulted in the selection of A 100 cc/rev hydraulic pump, two 75 cc/rev hydraulic motors and a 32 liter accumulator was c. ^ A 1999 Range Rover 4. 0 <b>Se</b> was <b>selected</b> as the application vehicle, baseline measurements and empirical data were taken to build an appropriate vehicle dynamics model, and engine model to be used for simulation and control. With this information and results from the parameter study a complete blended hydraulic hybrid transmission was designed, and packaging was completed using 3 D modeling. This design was implemented on the application vehicle and different operating modes of the blended hydraulic hybrid were demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{cause serious}} human illnesses through combinations of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. We initiated studies with {{four of these}} organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exo-toxin production, focusing onmenaquinone analogs. Menadione, 1, 4 -naphthoquinone, and coenzymes Q 1 to Q 3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme Q 10 inhibited the growth and {{to a greater extent}} exotoxin production of Staphylo-coccus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 g/ml. Coenzyme Q 1 reduced the ability of S. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four Gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another antimicrobial agent, glycerol monolaurate, to inhibit S. aureus growth. The staphylococcal two-component system SrrA/B was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme Q 1. We hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasmamembranes and biosynthetic ma-chinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, andmacromolecular synthesis. These compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents. Gram-positive bacteria cause large numbers of infections;some of these organisms and their toxic products, including Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (<b>SEs),</b> are <b>select</b> agents of bioterrorism. S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae cause infections which range from relatively benign to life-threatening, such as toxic shock syndrome (TSS) (1 – 7). For example, S. aureus secretes the superantigen TSS toxin 1 (TSST- 1), which is the predominant cause of menstrual TSS and up to 50 % of nonmenstrual TSS (8, 9). Staphylococcal enterotoxin superantigens, notably serotypes B and C, cause the remaining 50 % of nonmenstrual TSS cases. Staphylococcal supe-rantigens cause TSS through overproduction of cytokines (4...|$|R
40|$|Regardless of type of stress, either mental stress, {{emotional}} stress or physical stress, it definitely affects human lifestyle and work performance. There are two prominent methods in assessing stress which are psychological assessment (qualitative method) and physiological assessment (quantitative method). This research proposes a new stress index based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and non-parametric {{analysis of the}} signals. In non-parametric method, the EEG features that might relate to stress are extracted in term of Asymmetry Ratio (AR), Relative Energy Ratio (RER), Spectral Centroids (SC) and Spectral Entropy (<b>SE).</b> The <b>selected</b> features are fed to the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier to identify the stressed group among the four experimental groups being tested. The classification results are based on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. To support the classification results using k-NN classifier, the clustering techniques using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Fuzzy K-Means (FKM) are implemented. To ensure the robustness of the classifier, the crossvalidation technique using k-fold and leave-one-out is performed to the classifier. The assignment of the stress index is verified by applying Z-score technique to the selected EEG features. The experiments established a 3 -level index (Index 1, Index 2 and Index 3) which represents the stress levels of low stress, moderate stress and high stress at overall classification accuracy of 88. 89 %, classification sensitivity of 86. 67 % and classification specificity of 100 %. The outcome of the {{research suggests that the}} stress level of human can be determined accurately by applying SC on the ratio of the Energy Spectral Density (ESD) of Beta and Alpha bands of the brain signals. The experimental results of this study also confirm that human stress level can be determined and classified precisely using physiological signal through the proposed stress index. The high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the classifier might also indicate the robustness of the proposed method...|$|R
