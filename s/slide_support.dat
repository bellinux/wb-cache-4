In the Wieme apparatus, the gel on its microscope <b>slide</b> <b>support</b> is immersed in an immiscible solvent such as petroleum ether or silicone oil. Although band resolution and speed of migration are equivalent between gels run in the two systems, the relative fluorescence intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained bands is substantially more responsive to an increase in DNA length in the Wieme gels than in the submarine gels. The predicted relative fluorescence is by an average factor of 0. 5 less than that observed after electrophoresis in the Wieme apparatus but is by an average factor of 3. 4 more than that observed on bands derived from the submarine technique...|$|E
40|$|Virtual claying {{has become}} a {{preferred}} method of computer aided shape conceptualization. Nevertheless, the current implementations do not support collaborative design by remote participants. This paper reports on an implementation of virtual claying in a collaborative virtual design environment where ideas and actions of the stylists and the designers are converted to a model by physically-based operators. The basis of the model is a vague discrete modeling kernel. Physical operators are implemented on class and instance levels. The classes contain the generic support constraints and external forces, which can be combined to deform the shape. The instances of a physical operator class are able to model specific effects by various load-support arrangements. The fix, hinge, roller, and <b>slide</b> <b>support</b> operators represent typical mechanical supports. We defined concentrated and distributed forces, both static and dynamic, based {{on the principles of}} the Newtonian physics. We implemented the stretch, squash, bend and torque operators as the instances of the generic deformation operator. This paper presents the definitions and implementation of the operators, together with a comprehensive application example, which shows the capabilities of physically-based operators...|$|E

The base of the system consists of sliding blocks resting on sliding foundation raft. The rigid-friction force-deformation behaviour of the sliding blocks is modelled as elasto-plastic with very high initial stiffness. The {{response of}} the system is analyzed under different parametric variations to investigate the effectiveness of the <b>sliding</b> <b>support.</b> The parameter includes: eccentricity of superstructure, uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency ratio, mass ratio and coefficient of friction of <b>sliding</b> <b>support.</b> The effectiveness is studied by obtaining the response with and without consideration of interaction between the two lateral frictional resistances of the <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> on the criterion of sliding.

40|$|An {{efficiency}} of the cutting method with outstripping plastic deformation (OPD) in lathe works is defined in many respects by design features of the add-on devices for mechanical hardening of a cut-off layer material {{in the course of}} cutting. Applied on lathes, deforming OPD devices can have differing dimensions, placement on the lathe, drive type (manual, electric, hydraulic, pneumatic, pneumohydraulic, electromagnetic), and autonomy degree towards the metalcutting equipment and industrial equipment. At the same time {{there are a number of}} inherent design features of work-hardening devices the modernized lathes with OPD use for machining. Now the OPD standard devices implement two principle construction options: loading device is placed on the machine or on the OPD <b>slide</b> <b>support</b> separate of the tool, or it is structurally aligned with the cutting tool. In the latter case the OPD device for turning is called a tool mandrel, which is mounted in a tool post of the machine or, at large dimensions, such a mandrel is mounted on the machine instead of the tool mandrel. When designing the OPD devices, is important to take into consideration production requirements and recommendations for the technological equipment, developed in the course of creation, working off and introduction of such installations for mechanical hardening of material. In compliance with it, OPD devices, their placement on the machine, and working displacements shouldn't limit technological capabilities of the applied metal-cutting equipment. OPD stresses have to be smoothly regulated, with maximum loads being limited to admissible values for the machine model to be modernized. It is necessary to ensure synchronized longitudinal and cross displacements of the cutting tool and OPD hardener with respect to the axis of billet rotation to enable regulation and readjustment of the hardener and tool placement. It ought to foresee the increased mobile components rigidity and manufacturing accuracy of a device to exclude unexpected displacements of hardener with respect to the surface of cutting. The article also gives main recommendations to choose design parameters of the crush rolls for OPD. Taking into consideration the above production requirements and recommendations to design the turning devices with OPD allows us to create technological equipment to provide high {{efficiency of}} a method. The equipment is convenient for work, simple and cheap in the production, available for repair and replacement of worn-out constructive components, and safe in operation as well. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of structures with <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> to bi-directional (i. e. two horizontal components) harmonic ground motion is investigated. The frictional forces mobilized at the <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> {{are assumed to}} have the ideal coulomb-friction characteristics. The coupled differential equations of motion of the sliding structure in two orthogonal directions are solved in the incremental form using Newmark's method with iterations. The iterations are required due to dependence of the frictional forces on the {{response of}} the system. The responses of the system with bi-directional interaction are compared with those without interaction (2 D idealization in two orthogonal directions) in order to investigate the effects of bi-directional interaction of frictional forces at the <b>sliding</b> <b>supports.</b> It has been shown that effects of bi-directional interaction are significant and should be included for the effective design of sliding structures. Further, if the effects of bi-directional interaction of frictional forces are neglected then the sliding base displacement will be underestimated which is crucial from the design point of view. In addition to harmonic ground motion the significant effects of bi-directional interaction are also observed for selected real earthquake ground excitations. Copyright (C) 1996...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sliding</b> <b>supports</b> {{are widely}} used in bridges, space structures, and power plants to avoid {{potential}} damages to the structure due to expansion and contraction effects caused by temperature changes. To {{ensure the safety of}} an important structure with <b>sliding</b> <b>supports,</b> it is desirable to know both the magnitudes and positions of sliding forces through strain measurements. Effective and practical identification of sliding forces based on strain measurements on site is therefore explored in this paper. The problems involved in the force identification of <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> systems are described. The finite element-based force identification technique and the strain measurement point selection procedure are then presented for the identification of sliding forces with no information required on their initial positions and magnitudes. The minimum strain measurement points with fairly good orthogonal property are targeted in the selection procedure. The quadratic programming problem with linear constraints and in some case the nonlinear least-squares method are involved in the identification of either concentrated sliding forces or uniformly distributed sliding loads. The feasibility and accuracy of the force identification technique and the strain measurement point selection procedure proposed in Part I of this paper will be demonstrated in Part II of this paper through numerical examples.

Coupling effects due to circular interaction between the frictional forces are incorporated in the governing equations of motion. Effects of bidirectional interaction of frictional forces on the response are investigated by comparing the response to two-component excitation with the corresponding response produced by the application of single-component excitations in each direction independently. It is observed that the {{response of}} the sliding structure is influenced significantly by the bidirectional interaction of frictional forces. Further, it is shown that the design sliding displacement may be underestimated if the bidirectional interaction of frictional forces is neglected and the sliding structures are designed merely on the basis of single-component excitation...|$|R

In order to ensure the above-ground routing method for the oil pipeline “Zapolyarye - Pur-pe” and {{in view of the}} lack of construction experience in case of above-ground routing of oil pipelines, the leading research institute of JSC “Transneft” - LLC “NII TNN” over the period of August, 2011 - September, 2012 performed a research and development work on the subject “Development and production of pipeline supports and pile foundation test specimens for the areas of above-ground routing of the pipeline system “Zapolyarye - Pur-pe”. In the course of the works, the test specimens of fixed support, linear-sliding and free-sliding pipeline supports DN 1000 and DN 800 were produced and examined. For ensuring the stable structural reliability of the supports constructions and operational integrity of the pipelines the complex research works and tests were performed: 1. Cyclic tests of structural elements of the fixed support on the test bed of JSC “Diascan” by means of internal pressure and bending moment with the application of specially prepared equipment for defining the pipeline supports strength and durability. 2. Tests of the fixed support under the influence of limit operating loads and by means of internal pressure for confirming the support’s integrity. On the test bed there were simulated all the maximum loads on the support (vertical, longitudinal, side loadings, bending moment including subsidence of the neighboring <b>sliding</b> <b>support)</b> and, simultaneously, internal pressure of the carried medium. 3.
