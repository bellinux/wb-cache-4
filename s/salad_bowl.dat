5|$|The United States {{is home to}} many {{cultures}} and {{a wide variety of}} ethnic groups, traditions, and values. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous <b>salad</b> <b>bowl</b> in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Salad</b> <b>Bowl</b> {{strike was}} a series of strikes, mass pickets, boycotts and {{secondary}} boycotts that began on August 23, 1970 and led to the largest farm worker strike in U.S. history. The strike was led by the United Farm Workers against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The <b>Salad</b> <b>Bowl</b> strike was only in part a jurisdictional strike, for many of the actions taken during the event were not strikes. The strike led directly to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the UFW {{organized}} strikes and boycotts—including the <b>Salad</b> <b>Bowl</b> strike, the largest farm worker strike in U.S. history—to protest for, and later win, higher wages for those farm {{workers who were}} working for grape and lettuce growers. He again fasted to draw public attention. UFW organizers believed that a reduction in produce sales by 15% was sufficient {{to wipe out the}} profit margin of the boycotted product.|$|E
25|$|Allen first hosted The Linit Bath Club Revue on CBS, {{moving the}} show to NBC and {{becoming}} The <b>Salad</b> <b>Bowl</b> Revue (in a nod to new sponsor Hellmann's Mayonnaise, which was marketed by {{the parent company of}} Linit) later in the year. The show became The Sal Hepatica Revue (1933–34), The Hour of Smiles (1934–35), and finally Town Hall Tonight (1935–39). In 1939–40, however, sponsor Bristol-Myers, which advertised Ipana toothpaste as well as Sal Hepatica during the program, altered the title to The Fred Allen Show, over his objections. Allen's perfectionism (odd to some, considering his deft ad-libs) caused him to leap from sponsor to sponsor until Town Hall Tonight allowed him to set his chosen small-town milieu and establish himself as a bona fide radio star.|$|E
25|$|Orian Landreth {{replaced}} Oliver {{and struggled}} in his one season as head coach, compiling a 3–6 record {{before he was}} fired. That season was the first losing season for the Wildcats in several years. Miles Casteel came to Arizona from his post {{as an assistant coach}} at Michigan State. In his eight seasons (Arizona did not field football teams in 1943 or 1944 due to World War II), Casteel compiled a 46–26–3 record and led the Wildcats to the first bowl berth in three decades in his final season, a loss in the 1949 <b>Salad</b> <b>Bowl</b> to Drake. Robert Winslow served as Arizona's head football coach for three seasons, posting a record of 12–18–1, with the team improving every year under his tutelage, going 2–7–1, 4–6 and 6–5 in Winslow's three years. Winslow resigned after three seasons.|$|E

As a result, many fire departments provide traditional helmets using modern plastic and composite helmets without eagles or beavers, jokingly {{referred to as}} <b>salad</b> <b>bowls,</b> turtle shells and slick tops due to their streamlined shape. However, many firefighters and fire departments still retain the leather helmet {{as a matter of}} tradition.|$|R
500|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Homer's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no characters other than Homer, Grampa Simpson, Lenny, and Krusty the Clown have a similar beard line. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting and redesigned the ear to look normal. However, he still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. The basic shape of Homer's head is described by director Mark Kirkland as a tube-shaped coffee can with a <b>salad</b> <b>bowl</b> on top. Bart's head is also coffee-can shaped, while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie. During the shorts, the animators experimented with the way Homer would move his mouth when talking. At one point, his mouth would stretch out back [...] "beyond his beardline"; but this was dropped when it got [...] "out of control." [...] In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than sharply pointed because animation director Wes Archer felt it should look disheveled. Homer's hair evolved to be consistently pointed. During the first three seasons, Homer's design for some close-up shots included small lines which were meant to be eyebrows. Matt Groening strongly disliked them and they were eventually dropped.|$|E

2500|$|The United States {{has often}} been {{thought of as a}} melting pot, but recent {{developments}} tend towards cultural diversity, pluralism and the image of a <b>salad</b> <b>bowl</b> rather than a melting pot. [...] Due to the extent of American culture there are many integrated but unique social subcultures within the United States. The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on social class, political orientation and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background, occupation and ethnic group membership. The strongest influences on American culture came from northern European cultures, most prominently from Britain, Ireland, and Germany.|$|E

2500|$|After Michael had {{sketched out}} his {{ideas for the}} shoot at {{a meeting with the}} {{production}} company and his brothers, Stein and producer John Diaz had a feeling he would skip the actual shoot, so they rented a wax dummy of Michael from Madame Tussaud's museum in Nashville. [...] " [...] was put through the wringer," [...] Stein says. [...] "Its head ended up in the <b>salad</b> <b>bowl</b> at lunch one day." [...] The dummy was ultimately used in three separate sequences, including the ending sequence that shows {{the rest of the group}} standing in a shot similar to the album cover. The television show PM Magazine later discovered the dummy had been used through a close analysis of the video. [...] "I was so young and naïve, I just figured this is what they normally do in music videos," [...] recalls Paula Abdul, who eventually became the choreographer.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Salad</b> <b>Bowl</b> strike {{did not end}} the {{jurisdictional}} {{disagreement between}} the Teamsters and the UFW. [...] The Teamsters resumed their dispute with the UFW in December 1972, which led to further extensive disruptions in the state agricultural industry, mass picketing, mass arrests, and extensive violence. By April 1973, the UFW was [...] "fighting for our lives" [...] and threatening to launch a nationwide boycott of any grower which {{signed a contract with}} the Teamsters. Thousands of UFW members began picketing in the fields on April 15, 1973. Mass arrests quickly occurred, and many county jails were soon overflowing with detainees. The organizing battles between the two unions became violent with audacious and brutal attacks on UFW members day and night. The UFW appeared to be losing the battle physically, legally, and organizationally. The violence worsened; seventy farm workers were attacked on July 31, a UFW picketer was shot on August 3, five firebombs were thrown at UFW picket lines on August 9, two UFW members were shot on August 11, and a UFW picketer was shot to death on August 16, 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1865, President Andrew Johnson asked Haughwout & Co. {{to make an}} {{inventory}} of the White House china and silver, and to make replacements as necessary. Congress subsequently made a $30,000 appropriation {{at the end of}} 1865 to pay for the general refurbishment of the house (which included the china and silver replacements). The administration replaced the entire [...] "solferino" [...] china set with an identical set on January 17, 1866, also manufactured by Haviland and decorated by E. V. Haughwout and Company. This china is different from the 1861 set, as both the outline and the colors were done by hand (no stencil was used). [...] This second order of [...] "Lincoln china" [...] consisted of 391 pieces, and included pickle dishes, custard cups, egg cups, serving dishes of various depths, compote dishes, sugar bowls, baskets, butter dishes, dinner plates, dessert plates, tea plates, soup plates, preserve plates, breakfast coffee cups, regular coffee cups, tea cups, water pitchers, and one <b>salad</b> <b>bowl,</b> cake plate, and ice bowl. There is little documentary evidence, but oral tradition claims that E.V. Haughwout contracted with Edward Lycett, the most famous china painter in the United States at the time, to decorate the china. Glassware was also reordered from Haughwout & Co. in 1866, and manufactured by the New England Glass Co. of Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E

50|$|Food grade {{mineral oil}} has an E number of E905a, {{although}} it is not approved in food products in the European Union, and incidental amounts in foods are carefully regulated. Because of its properties that prevent water absorption, combined with its lack of flavor and odor, food grade mineral oil is a popular preservative for wooden cutting boards, <b>salad</b> <b>bowls</b> and utensils. Rubbing a small amount of mineral oil into a wooden kitchen item periodically will prevent absorption of food odors and ease cleaning, as well as maintain the integrity of the wood, which is otherwise subjected to repeated wetting and drying in the course of use. The oil fills small surface cracks that may otherwise harbor bacteria.|$|R
