25|$|Photoaging has {{two main}} concerns: an {{increased}} risk for skin cancer {{and the appearance of}} damaged skin. In younger skin, <b>sun</b> <b>damage</b> will heal faster since the cells in the epidermis have a faster turnover rate, while in the older population the skin becomes thinner and the epidermis turnover rate for cell repair is lower which may result in the dermis layer being damaged.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet A (UVA) {{radiation}} {{is in the}} wavelength range 320 to 400nm. It is present more uniformly throughout the day, and throughout the year, than UVB. Most UVA is not blocked by the atmosphere's ozone layer. UVA causes the release of existing melanin from the melanocytes to combine with oxygen (oxidize) to create the actual tan color in the skin. It is blocked less than UVB by many sunscreens, but is blocked to some degree by clothing. UVA is known both to cause DNA damage and to be carcinogenic. However, it operates not by inducing direct DNA damage, but by producing reactive oxygen species which damage DNA indirectly. UVA (see above) induces a cosmetic tan but little extra melanin protection against <b>sun</b> <b>damage,</b> sun burn, or cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Uguisu no fun (Japanese: 鶯の糞, {{also called}} the [...] "Geisha Facial"), which {{literally}} means [...] "nightingale feces" [...] in Japanese, refers to the excrement (fun) produced by a particular nightingale called the Japanese bush warbler (Cettia diphone) (uguisu). The droppings {{have been used in}} facials since ancient Japanese times. Recently, the product has appeared in the Western world. The facial is said to whiten the skin and balance skin tone, as well as treat skin affected by hyperpigmentation such {{as in the case of}} acne or <b>sun</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A November 2010 {{report by}} {{scientists}} at the Institute of Zoology in London found that whales {{off the coast of}} California have shown a sharp rise in <b>sun</b> <b>damage,</b> and these scientists [...] "fear that the thinning ozone layer is to blame". The study photographed and took skin biopsies from over 150 whales in the Gulf of California and found [...] "widespread evidence of epidermal damage commonly associated with acute and severe sunburn", having cells that form when the DNA is damaged by UV radiation. The findings suggest [...] "rising UV levels as a result of ozone depletion are to blame for the observed skin damage, {{in the same way that}} human skin cancer rates have been on the increase in recent decades." ...|$|E
5000|$|Inflammation of {{the lips}} is termed {{cheilitis}}. This {{can be in}} several forms such as chapped lips (dry, peeling lips), angular cheilitis (inflammation of {{the corners of the}} mouth), herpes labialis (cold sore, a form of herpes simplex) and actinic cheilitis (chronically <b>sun</b> <b>damaged</b> lips).|$|R
50|$|Tazarotene (marketed as Tazorac, Avage, Zorac, and Fabior) is {{a third-generation}} {{prescription}} topical retinoid {{sold as a}} cream, gel, or foam. Tazarotene {{is a member of}} the acetylenic class of retinoids. This medication is approved for treatment of psoriasis, acne, and <b>sun</b> <b>damaged</b> skin (photodamage). It is commonly sold in two concentrations: 0.05% and 0.1%.|$|R

50|$|In August 2017 a {{complete}} drying {{out of the}} lake gained media attention. It was reported of the ecological catastrophe which endangered the local population, agriculture (vineyards, orchards) and 200 bird species living in the lake area, due to the toxic saline dusts blown by the winds. Also, the mud dries and can't be used, while the <b>Sun</b> <b>damages</b> both the peloid's quality and quantity.|$|R
50|$|First {{dilemma in}} {{diagnosis}} is recognition. As lentigo malignas often present on severely <b>sun</b> <b>damaged</b> skin, it is frequently found amongst numerous pigmented lesions - thin seborrheic keratoses, lentigo senilis, lentigines. It {{is difficult to}} distinguish these lesions {{with the naked eye}} alone, and even with some difficulty using dermatoscopy. As the lentigo maligna is often very large, it often merges with, or encompasses other skin tumors - such as lentigines, melanocytic nevi, and seborrheic keratosis.|$|R
40|$|Space is a {{dangerous}} place for humans, once we step beyond the rotection of Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field. Galactic cosmic rays and bursts of charged particles from the <b>Sun</b> <b>damaging</b> to health happen with alarming frequency – the Apollo astronauts were very lucky. Understanding the physics of radiation from distinct sources in space will be useful to help future space voyagers plan journeys in greater safety, and produce effective shields for these unavoidable events on journeys to Mars or beyond...|$|R
50|$|Hyperpigmentation can {{be caused}} by <b>sun</b> <b>damage,</b> inflammation, or other skin injuries, {{including}} those related to acne vulgaris. People with darker skin tones are more prone to hyperpigmentation, especially with excess sun exposure.|$|E

40|$|O’Brien’s actinic {{granuloma}} is clinically {{characterized by}} grouped red papules that may coalesce into annular plaques on <b>sun</b> <b>damaged</b> skin {{such as the}} head and neck, chest, and arms. There is no gender predilection, and patients tend to be middle-aged or older giving the association with significant actinic damage. We presented a 50 -year-old male with multiple annular lesions on the neck of four years duration, associated with prolonged sun exposure. A biopsy confirmed the clinical suspicion of O’Brien’s granuloma and excluded other possibilities...|$|R
50|$|Tetonkaha was {{relieved}} of duty on 6 November {{and returned to}} San Francisco, California, in December 1945. She was decommissioned at Mare Island, California, on 22 January 1946; stripped; struck from the Navy list on 12 March; and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946. In 1949, the ship was sold to the Sun Oil Co., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and renamed Maumee <b>Sun.</b> <b>Damaged</b> in a collision with the MV American Pilot in November 1965.The USCGC Escanaba (WHEC-64) came to her aid after the collision. The Maumee Sun was subsequently scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Many {{ultralight}} aircraft {{are covered with}} pre-sewn envelopes of 3.9 oz Dacron that are simply screwed, bolted or laced into place.

His publications have covered treatments for port wine stains, hemangiomas, <b>sun</b> <b>damaged</b> skin, wrinkles, telangiectases, birthmarks, skin laxity, hair removal, tattoo removal and Nevus of Ota removal. Geronemus has advocated the early intervention of vascular birthmarks, encouraging treatment during early infancy ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that the {{tourniquet}} test may not have high specificity. Interfering factors with this test are women who are premenstrual, postmenstrual and not taking hormones, or those with <b>sun</b> <b>damaged</b> skin, since all will have increased capillary fragility. However many other {{studies have shown}} that the tourniquet test has good specificity but a low sensitivity. Therefore, its use as a diagnostic test for dengue is questioned as people who have a negative test may still have dengue. It is no longer used as a classification test for dengue haemorraghic fever in the latest WHO guidance.|$|R
40|$|Seeded fault {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} the planetary stage of an OH- 58 C helicopter transmission. Two vibration based methods are discussed that isolate {{the dynamics of the}} sun gear from that of the planet gears, bearings, input spiral bevel stage, and other components in and around the gearbox. Three <b>damaged</b> <b>sun</b> gears: two spalled and one cracked, serve as the focus of this current work. A non-sequential vibration separation algorithm was developed and the resulting signals analyzed. The second method uses only the time synchronously averaged data but takes advantage of the signal/source mapping required for vibration separation. Both algorithms were successful in identifying the spall <b>damage.</b> <b>Sun</b> gear <b>damage</b> was confirmed by the presence of sun mesh groups. The sun tooth crack condition was inconclusive...|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} {{chemotherapeutic}} agent such as 5-Fluorouracil or imiquimod, can prevent development of skin cancer. It is usually recommended to individuals with extensive <b>sun</b> <b>damage,</b> history of multiple skin cancers, or rudimentary forms of cancer (i.e., solar keratosis). It is often repeated every 2 to 3 years to further decrease the risk of skin cancer.|$|E
50|$|Early civilizations used {{a variety}} of plant {{products}} to help protect the skin from <b>sun</b> <b>damage.</b> For example, ancient Greeks used olive oil for this purpose, and ancient Egyptians used extracts of rice, jasmine, and lupine plants whose products are still used in skin care today. Zinc oxide paste has also been popular for skin protection for thousands of years.|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} {{has been}} continuously occupied and has changed hands several times since 1948, {{with very little}} structural upkeep until renovations began in 2007. Along with necessary safety installations (pipes replaced, fire extinguishers installed) the Linden Centre added glass ceilings to protect original artwork from the wind, rain, and <b>sun</b> <b>damage,</b> re-levelled floors and walkways, and restored the original living spaces.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2004-05 season, <b>Sun</b> <b>damaged</b> his cruciate ligaments in a tackle with Chelsea striker Eiður Guðjohnsen and missed the rest of the season. After recuperating and following a strict physical regimen devised by his father, Sun re-installed his place as a regular in the club's starting lineup. In the 2006-07 season, Sun was set back yet again by another injury and he made his return on 10 February 2007, against Portsmouth which his side lost 2-1. With the arrival of Sven-Göran Eriksson as the new manager, Sun rarely played in the 2007-08 season. He was replaced by Vedran Ćorluka at right back and Michael Ball played as the defensive substitute instead of Sun.|$|R
40|$|Dermal granulomatous {{inflammation}} was identified immediately adjacent to seven (77 %) of nine atypical fibroxanthomas arising in <b>sun</b> <b>damaged</b> skin. Concomitant elastophagocytosis {{was observed in}} five (56 %) of these seven patients. Similar inflammation with elastophagocytosis was found in association with only two (6 %) of 36 epithelial tumours arising on the same background (10 basal and 10 squamous cell carcinomas, 10 nodular malignant melanomas, and six keratocanthomas). Granulomatous inflammation is an unusual dermal reaction to tumour and elastophagocytosis is rare. The fact that both of these features occur with inordinate frequency in association with atypical fibroxanthomas, when compared with other, more common skin tumours, suggests that atypical fibroxanthomas might modulate the inflammatory response, either passively, by its dermal location, or actively, by secreting locally effective cytokines...|$|R
