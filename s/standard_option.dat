5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a <b>standard</b> <b>option</b> by 1966.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{employers}} who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even {{for those who are}} employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes—73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.

In case the number of trading dates is fixed, we show that this capital corresponds to the buy-and-hold strategy (for a Call option, or the corresponding strategy for any option with a continuous payoff). In case the number may depend {{on the path of}} the underlying, we show that if the Black-Scholes delta of the contingent claim is itself a finite-variation process (which excludes <b>standard</b> <b>options</b> in general), this initial capital is the Black-Scholes price of the option.

40|$|What {{follows is}} a {{treatise}} on executive stock options (ESOs), employing both theoretical and empirical methods. The title speaks of evaluation, instead of 'plain' valuation, because subjective ESO values depend on the employee's private data including risk aversion, initial wealth, and labor income. Economic theory assumes that utility is drawn from consumption, and consumers are impatient. It follows {{that the decision to}} exercise or sell ESOs deals with consumption smoothing. Assuming that the ESOs have vested, the option grantee asks: Is it better to sell now and consume the proceeds, or to wait and possibly enjoy higher consumption later on? Obviously, the answer depends (among other things) on individual risk preferences. ESOs are options {{in the sense that they}} provide the call option payo¤. However, since the option grantee cannot usually hedge his position, usual arguments leading to risk-neutral valuation are not applicable, suggesting that ESO pricing is different from standard contracts. This claim can be tested, since ESOs are traded in the Helsinki stock exchange. Now let us consider a generalized Black-Scholes model with (implied) volatility as free parameter. If ESO pricing differs from <b>standard</b> <b>options,</b> it should be seen in their volatilities. It is shown in Market pricing of ESOs that volatilities (i. e. relative prices) of ESOs are lower compared to <b>standard</b> <b>options.</b> Given the prominence of illiquidity and hedging under uncertainty in mathematical finance, we ask if these factors could explain the discount in ESO prices. In the case of Nokia ESOs, illiquidity is not the story, since the underlying stock is fiercely traded. However, hedging is complicated by ESOs having longer maturities than standard contracts. The average maturity of ESOs is 3. 1 years, compared to few months for liquid <b>standard</b> <b>options.</b> Hence, hedging ESOs by taking opposite position in <b>standard</b> <b>options</b> is subject to volatility risk. Obviously, hedging is also possibly by shorting the stock and using cash account, but this involves frequent trading and hedging error. Nonetheless, volatility risk and hedging error can explain the discount only to an extent. Finally, we conclude that the employees benefit from public trading of ESOs. It allows the employees to receive some time value 1, which they would lose if ESOs were not traded and had to be exercised...|$|R
