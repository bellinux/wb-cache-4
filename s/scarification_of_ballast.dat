40|$|The {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> railway {{is usually}} {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> placed above naturally deposited subgrade. The ballast layer is responsible for limiting the vertical stress magnitudes applied to the weaker subgrade and also prevents the vertical and lateral train-induced sleeper movements. In recent years, the progressive use of faster and heavier trains has compromised the ability <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> to resist such movements due to the increased magnitude <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage (degradation). Therefore, accurate determination <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage is important. The amount <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage can be estimated by comparing the gradation (particle size distribution) curves of fresh and degraded ballast, using a ballast breakage index. However, the Australian railway authorities currently rely on the visual inspection for estimating ballast breakage. Despite {{the fact that the}} visual inspection is convenient, as it does not require transport <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> samples or testing, it is subjective and can lead to uneconomical maintenance cycles. In this paper, an attempt is made to utilise the digital imaging technique for gradation analysis and breakage estimation <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> The technique is fast and convenient, and can be applied to both the laboratory and field conditions, hence, can be used successfully to replace the visual inspection <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage...|$|R
40|$|The {{foundations}} <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> railway {{tracks are}} usually {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> placed above a naturally deposited subgrade. Available methods for design of track foundations are based on determination of an adequate granular layer thickness <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> so that subgrade shear failures and plastic deformations produced by the transmission of imposed train loads are prevented. However, the deformation <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> itself is ignored in almost all available design methods. In addition, most available methods do not represent true cyclic loading situations and rather provide oversimplified solutions based on static loading conditions. In this paper, a method {{that can be used}} to calculate the deformation <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> under train cyclic loading is presented. The method is deemed to complement the existing methods <b>of</b> design <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> railway track foundations...|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} {{study was}} performed to develop correlations between electromagnetic and mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> These correlations {{can be used to}} predict the deformation properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> and also its dynamic behavior under heavy axle load in different fouling and moisture conditions by GPR survey. By developing this technique and performing similar tests on different types <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> and fouling materials, a criterion can be developed to detect the railroad high risk areas and predict the engineering properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> by GPR surveys. This study was performed on granite ballast and breakdown fouling and has three phases: performing GPR survey on full-scale laboratory models with different amount of fouling and water content; performing box test with equivalent dynamic Heavy Axle Load (HAL) up to 2, 500, 000 cycles on the reconstituted samples of first phase; performing CIDC triaxial tests on the reconstituted samples of first phase. In these phases the effect of water content and fouling percentage on the electromagnetic, dynamic and static properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> was investigated and discussed quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, existing correlations between electromagnetic and deformation properties <b>of</b> fouled <b>ballast</b> were studied in both time domain and frequency domain analyses from first and third phases.

40|$|AbstractIn Japan {{where large}} {{earthquakes}} frequently occur, {{it is important}} to increase the resistibility of railway structures to earthquakes. The authors performed a shaking table test using a full-scale model to evaluate the lateral resistance force <b>of</b> the <b>ballasted</b> track during earthquakes. In this study, the shaking table test was attempted under test conditions under which the sleeper is given the lateral force to induce track buckling. Two kinds of cross sections <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> track for the full-scale model were applied: a straight track and a curved track to evaluate the influence of the difference of the cross section <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> track on the lateral resistance force. The results of the shaking table test clarified that the lateral resistance force <b>of</b> the <b>ballasted</b> track decreased during shaking, and the lateral sleeper displacement increased significantly by lateral force smaller than the lateral resistance force <b>of</b> the <b>ballasted</b> track after shaking. In addition, it is considered that the influence of the cross section <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> track on the lateral ballast resistance force during shaking and after shaking is small...|$|R

40|$|Rail tracks undergo {{degradation}} {{owing to}} particle breakage and fouling <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> by various fines including coal and subgrade soil. As the ballast becomes fouled, its strength and drainage capacity are compromised, sometimes resulting in differential settlement and reduced track stability. This paper demonstrates a continuum mechanics based framework {{to evaluate the}} detrimental effect of fines on the strength, deformation and degradation <b>of</b> coal-fouled <b>ballast</b> under monotonic loading. An elastoplastic constitutive model that considers the effect of fines content and energy consumption associated with particle breakage during shearing is presented. This multiphase constitutive model is developed within a critical state framework based on a kinematic-type yield locus and a modified stress-dilatancy approach. A general formulation for the rate <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage and coal particle breakage during triaxial shearing is presented and incorporated into the plastic flow rule to accurately predict the stress-strain response <b>of</b> coal-fouled <b>ballast</b> at various confining pressures. The behaviour <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> at various levels of fouling is analysed and validated by experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The {{lateral flow}} <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> during {{the passage of}} trains can reduce the {{stability}} of rail tracks. Therefore, {{it is important to}} monitor and restrain the movement <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> accordingly in order to prevent track misalignment. This current study explored the use of optical-Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors to measure the lateral displacement of unreinforced and geogrid-reinforced ballast. The tests were conducted on fresh latite basalt at a loading frequency of 20 Hz and up to 250 000 load cycles. The test results showed that the FBG sensing system is fully capable of measuring the lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> under high-frequency cyclic loading. A comparison of strains obtained from FBGs installed at different depths along the ballast depth is made and the lateral strain profiles are measured. Moreover, an empirical model to convert the FBG strains to an equivalent lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> is proposed to effectively use this technology in real-time monitoring of track deformations...|$|R
