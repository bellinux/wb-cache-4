5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation {{was on a}} side stream, at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{allowed for}} {{branches}} to extend {{from the main}} line, and for private wharves and basins. In May 1821 the loop of the main line around Oldbury was bypassed by a <b>straight</b> <b>cut,</b> shortening the route between Birmingham and Wolverhampton.|$|E
25|$|In days past, {{the mining}} {{industry}} {{was a particular}} boon to residents {{of the town and}} area. Immigrants who had experience with coal mining in Europe, located lignite coal in the area and developed coal mines, including open pit, shaft, and <b>straight</b> <b>cut.</b> Twenty three different mines were in operation during the early to mid-1900s, all with different owners. Frédérick Desjardins’ mine stands out as the longest operating, continuing until the late 1950s. Currently, the nearest coal mine is in Coronach; the Popular River Mine employs 800 people.|$|E

25|$|The {{baseplate}} (sole plate) {{is generally}} circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) {{and may be}} used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a <b>straight</b> <b>cut.</b> Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its use as an herbicide, glyphosate is also used for crop desiccation (siccation) to increase harvest yield, {{and as a result}} of desiccation, to increase sucrose concentration in sugarcane before harvest. The application of glyphosate just before harvest on grains (like wheat, barley, and oats) kills the food crop so that it dries more quickly and evenly, similar to the use of dessicants. This dry crop does not have to be windrowed (swathed and dried) prior to harvest but can easily be <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> and harvested. This saves the farmer time and money,which is important in northern regions where the growing season is short. Excess residue levels in beans resulting from incorrect application can render the crop unfit for sale.|$|E
25|$|Gear sets may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the power band, or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E

25|$|Below Earith, {{thirteen}} Adventurers {{working with}} the Earl of Bedford formed a Corporation to drain the Bedford Levels. Cornelius Vermuyden was the engineer, and {{a major part of}} the scheme was the Old Bedford River, a <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> to carry water from Earith to a new sluice near Salters Lode, which was completed in 1637. The sluice was not popular with those who used the river for navigation, and there were some attempts to destroy the new works during the turmoil of the civil war. A second drainage Act was obtained in 1649, and Vermuyden oversaw the construction of the New Bedford River, parallel to the Old Bedford River, which was completed in 1652. There was strong opposition from the ports and towns on the river, which increased as the old channel via Ely gradually silted up. Above Earith, Samuel Jemmatt took control of the river, and navigation was extended to Bedford in 1689 by the construction of new staunches and sluices.|$|E
25|$|Below Peterborough, {{the river}} meandered to Tydd Gote, where it shared an outfall to the Wash with the River Great Ouse. Once {{the latter was}} {{diverted}} to King's Lynn in 1236, the Nene outfall deteriorated. Navigation was improved in the 1470s when Morton's Leam, a straight channel between Peterborough and Wisbech, was constructed by Bishop Morton. It was improved in 1570 and 1631, and was largely superseded by Smith's Leam, a <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> from Peterborough to Guyhirn made by the Bedford Level Corporation in 1728. In order to improve {{the mouth of the}} river, which followed a tortuous route through salt marshes, {{the construction of a new}} channel was proposed by Nathaniel Kinderley, and work started on it in 1721. It was nearly completed when Wisbech Corporation's support turned to opposition, and they destroyed the work. The cut was eventually completed in 1773, but was not long enough to be a complete success.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E

50|$|Pipe cutting, or pipe profiling, is a {{mechanized}} {{industrial process}} that removes material from pipe or tube {{to create a}} desired profile. Typical profiles include <b>straight</b> <b>cuts,</b> mitres, saddles and midsection holes. These complex cuts are usually required to allow a tight fit between two parts {{that are to be}} joined via arc welding.|$|R
25|$|In a {{time when}} defense was defined as “an individual's effort to stop or stymie the {{opposing}} team's counterpart”, Toyota's playing style {{was considered one of}} the most glamorous and worthy to watch. With team defense hardly known back then, Toyota was a typical run-and-gun team that depended heavily on their rebounding prowess. Hence, when you have an Andrew Fields, Bruce King, John Irving, Abe King, Ramon Fernandez and even a Bobby Jaworski collaring the rebounds, the most common (and very entertaining) spectacle was to see a baseball pass by the rebounder to a streaking player on the break for an easy twinner. Notables among the recipients of the baseball pass over the years in the Toyota lineup included Segura, Cortez, Tuadles, Arnaiz, and Legaspi. In the halfcourt, it was not uncommon to see a similar play that Fernandez and Jaworski employed in the recent Crispa-Toyota reunion game where Fernandez would post up, Jaworski would stay at the top of the arc and wait for Fernandez to be double-teamed. Once the double team is consummated, Jaworski either waits at the 3 point line or makes a <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> in the middle of the lanes waiting for the blind pass of Fernandez for an easy two. Another common sight was to see Jaworski mapping out the play, cuts in the middle and makes the interior defense commit to him. He then throws a behind-the-back blind pass to cutting slotmen like Fernandez or King for an easy layup or throws it back to good buddy Arnaiz for a long range bomb shot from the arc. Hence, it wasn't a surprise to see Jaworski, Arnaiz and Fernandez (in that order) being the first 3 PBA players to dish off 2,000 assists in their careers.|$|E
500|$|A {{little further}} to the south is another <b>straight</b> <b>cut,</b> with the old course still visible {{on the other side}} of the canal. Soon it reaches Newbridge on the A272 road near Wisborough Green. The {{location}} of the wharf which was the northern terminus of the Arun Navigation was just to the south of the bridge. Wharf Farm was nearby, and the modern 1:2500 Ordnance Survey map shows buildings named [...] "The Old Wharf". Brockhurst Brook joins from the east before the river turns briefly westwards. Soon it is crossed by Orfold Aqueduct, which carried the Arun Navigation over the river channel. The River Kird joins it, flowing from the north, and it turns southwards again. At Pallingham the remains of Pallingham Manor are on the north bank, next to Pallingham Manor Farm, a 17th-century timber-framed farmhouse, which is Grade II listed. Pallingham Quay Farmhouse, another Grade II listed building dating from the 18th century, is on the west bank of the river just before its junction with the Arun Navigation cut. Below the junction, the river is tidal.|$|E
500|$|The Middle Levels of the Fens are a low-lying area of {{approximately}} , {{much of which}} is at or below sea level. [...] Attempts {{to protect them from}} inundation and to make them suitable for agriculture began in 1480, when the Bishop of Ely, John Morton, constructed a [...] <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> from Stanground to Guyhirne. This provided the waters of the River Nene with a more direct route to the sea than the previous route through Benwick, Floods Ferry, March, Outwell and Wisbech. Morton's Leam, the name given to the medieval drainage ditch, was [...] wide and [...] deep, and much of the manual labour was provided by prisoners of war from the Hundred Years War. In 1605, Sir John Popham, who was the Lord Chief Justice at the time, began work on a drainage scheme near Upwell, and although the scheme was ultimately abandoned in 1608, Popham's Eau, his [...] cut from the old course of the River Nene near March to the Well Creek at Nordelph remains.|$|E
50|$|Graphical and model-making scalpels {{tend to have}} round handles, with {{textured}} grips (either knurled {{metal or}} soft plastic). These are often called {{by the name of}} the most well-known manufacturer of graphic arts blades, X-Acto knives.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the configurations outlined below, there are also upright and long cut configurations. The upright snip has the blades rotated 90° from the handles. This configuration is more ergonomic and commonly used in tight spaces. The long cut snip has long blades that {{make it easier to}} make long <b>straight</b> <b>cuts.</b> These snips are commonly used on vinyl or aluminium siding.|$|R

500|$|A form of {{cinematic}} punctuation {{very strongly}} identified with Kurosawa is the wipe. This is an effect created through an optical printer, in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to {{move across the}} screen, [...] "wiping" [...] away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it {{is used as a}} substitute for the <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> or the dissolve (though Kurosawa often used both of those devices as well). In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in Drunken Angel. Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films, especially with an emphasis on sound-image counterpoint, in which the music or sound effects would ironically comment upon the image rather than merely reinforcing it. (Teruyo Nogami's memoir gives several such examples from Drunken Angel and Stray Dog.) He was also involved with several of Japan's outstanding contemporary composers, including Fumio Hayasaka (who died in 1955) and the internationally famous Toru Takemitsu.|$|E
500|$|At [...] {{from its}} source to the sea, the Arun {{is the longest}} of the rivers flowing entirely within Sussex. It rises {{as a series of}} streams, known locally as ghylls or gills, to the east of Horsham, in St Leonard's Forest. It flows westwards, along the {{southern}} boundary of Horsham and turns briefly to the north to skirt Broadbridge Heath. Continuing westwards, it is joined by the North River, which is also known as the River Oke, whose headstreams are the heights of Leith Hill and Holmbury Hill in Surrey. After the junction, it passes under the A29 road, which follows the route of the Roman Stane Street at this point, and timber piles of a Roman bridge have been found in the riverbed. The earthworks from a Roman station are close by. To the south of Rudgwick it is crossed by a disused railway line, and at this point it crosses the [...] contour. Its course is marked by winding meanders as it turns towards the south, and the county boundary briefly follows its course, before it is joined by the partially restored Wey and Arun Canal. Its former course {{to the west of the}} canal can be clearly seen, and is followed by the boundary, but the main flow of the river follows a new <b>straight</b> <b>cut</b> just to the east of the canal. Once the boundary crosses back over the canal, the river resumes its meandering course on the eastern side of the canal.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century the ideal of Victorian manliness became {{increasingly}} defined by imperialism because the subordination of non-western cultures was in its heyday in Britain. Thus, part of the concept of masculinity became military and patriotic virtue, which defined the ideal man as courageous and enduring like hunters, adventurers, and pioneers, all of whom were profoundly self-sufficient and independent and had broad scientific knowledge. This orientation towards hardiness and endurance was reflected by a change in clothing as well: rich colors and materials were discouraged in favor of dark colors, <b>straight</b> <b>cuts,</b> and stiff materials.|$|R
