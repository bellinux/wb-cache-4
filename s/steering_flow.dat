Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones.

30|$|Despite the {{observed}} advances, existing solutions {{do not address}} localized fluctuation and bottleneck scenarios that occur due to variations in the volume of flows in transit in the network. An ad hoc strategy {{to deal with these}} fluctuations is to re-execute VNF allocation algorithms, and to rearrange them according to the results obtained. Although effective, this strategy is computationally more expensive (by re-executing globally the optimization algorithms), and does not allow to react efficiently to dynamic flow behavior. The work of Rankothge et al. [34, 35] is the closest approach to an effective solution to this problem. In that work, the authors use genetic algorithms to introduce network functions with scalable processing capabilities. However, those network functions are considered in isolation, therefore without taking into account possible global optimizations, such as <b>steering</b> <b>flows</b> with similar requirements for higher capacity VNFs.|$|R

Sea surface cooling also affected the track simulation of T 1109 under weak basic flow because the weakened typhoon intensity altered the beta effect and changed the depth-weighted <b>steering</b> <b>flows.</b> Sea surface cooling beneath a typhoon led to axisymmetrical decreases in the latent heat fluxes of 24 % (in the intensification phase, with sea surface cooling of less than 1 °C) to 47 % (in the mature phase, with sea surface cooling of more than 1 °C). The decreases in the latent heat fluxes led to changes in the inner core structure of T 1109, particularly in the inflow boundary layer and around the eye and eyewall, through changes in secondary circulation.|$|R

It is estimated that the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September20, about 490miles southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical {{because of the large}} distance between the convection and the center, uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems.

40|$|Observational records {{reveal that}} the number of {{tropical}} cyclones (TCs) approaching East Asia in July-October is positively correlated with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the equatorial and northern off-equatorial central Pacific (CP) oceans, indicating the significant impact of CP El Nino (CP-EN). Through experiments using a Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model-based regional climate model, this study demonstrates that it is northern off-equatorial CP warming, rather than equatorial CP warming, that effectively induces local anomalous <b>steering</b> <b>flows</b> pertinent to the observed increase in TC activity over East Asia during CP-EN. Sensitivity experiments, in which the prescribed CP-EN-related SST anomaly is confined near the equator, do not capture the observed TC increase over East Asia, whereas those including the off-equatorial region successfully reproduce observed atmospheric and TC variabilities. The off-equatorial CP SST anomaly acts to expand the anomalous cyclonic response in the Philippine Sea farther northward.

A clear positive correlation existed between the two variables, and this high positive correlation remained unchanged even when excluding El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years. To investigate {{the causes of the}} positive correlation between the two variables in non-ENSO years, after the 8  years with the highest EASMI (high EASMI years) and the 8  years with the lowest EASMI (low EASMI years) were selected, and the average difference between the two phases was analyzed. In high EASMI years, in {{the difference between the two}} phases regarding 850 and 500  hPa streamline, anomalous cyclones were reinforced in the tropical and subtropical western North Pacific, while anomalous anticyclones were reinforced in mid-latitude East Asian areas. Due to these two anomalous pressure systems, anomalous southeasterlies developed near Korea, with these anomalous southeasterlies playing the role of anomalous <b>steering</b> <b>flows</b> making the TCs head toward areas near Korea.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{goal of this}} project {{is to develop a}} robust and hardened high-resolution air-ocean coupled tropical cyclone (TC) data assimilation and prediction system that is able to assimilate the wide variety of available in-situ and remotely-sensed observations in order to analyze and predict TC structure and intensity changes in an operational environment. Significant gains have been made in TC track prediction over the past three decades. This considerable achievement is due, in large part, to the steady improvement of numerical models, especially the global scale prediction systems, and the judicial utilization of multi-model ensemble results. In contrast, the TC intensity forecast by numerical models has shown very little improvement during the same time period, and remains a formidable forecast problem. Advanced statistical prediction models nowadays are able to predict the trend for intensification, but as statistical tools, they inherently cannot predict the rapid intensity changes, as evident in Katrina and Rita of 2005, and other tropical cyclones. It is generally accepted now that while advancements in data assimilation and modeling have resulted in better analyses and predictions of <b>steering</b> <b>flows,</b> the processes that affect the structure and intensity of tropical cyclones are much more difficult for current numerical models to capture and reproduce.
