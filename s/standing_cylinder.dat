This visualization has been performed for two velocities of a freestream for Reynolds numbers Re = 920 a 990 and for four frequencies of the rotation (0 s- 1, 5 s- 1, 12. 5 s- 1 and 20 s- 1).

40|$|We {{consider}} upward planar {{drawings of}} directed graphs {{in the plane}} (UP), and on standing (SUP) and rolling cylinders (RUP). In the plane and on the <b>standing</b> <b>cylinder</b> the edge curves are monotonically increasing in y-direction. On the rolling cylinder they wind unidirectionally around the cylinder. There is a strict hierarchy of classes of upward planar graphs: UP ⊂ SUP ⊂ RUP. In this paper, we show that rolling and standing cylinders switch roles when considering an upward planar graph and its dual. In particular, we prove that a strongly connected graph is RUP {{if and only if}} its dual is a SUP dipole. A dipole is an acyclic graph with a single source and a single sink. All RUP graphs are characterized in terms of their duals using generalized dipoles. Moreover, we obtain a characterization of the primals and duals of wSUP graphs which are upward planar graphs on the <b>standing</b> <b>cylinder</b> and allow for horizontal edge curves...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} planar upward {{drawings of}} directed graphs on arbitrary surfaces where the upward direction {{is defined by}} a vector field. This generalizes earlier approaches using surfaces with a fixed embedding in R 3 and introduces new classes of planar upward drawable graphs, where some of them even allow cycles. Our approach leads to a classifi- cation of planar upward embeddability. In particular, we show the coincidence of the classes of planar upward drawable graphs on the sphere and on the <b>standing</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These classes coincide with the classes of planar upward drawable graphs with a homogeneous field on a cylinder and with a radial field in the plane. A cyclic field in the plane introduces the new class RUP of upward drawable graphs, which can be embedded on a rolling cylinder. We establish strict inclusions for planar upward drawability on the plane, the sphere, the rolling cylinder, and the torus, even for acyclic graphs. Finally, upward drawability remains NP-hard for the <b>standing</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the torus; for the cylinder this was left as an open problem by Limaye et al. ...|$|E

Morphologies in thin films are strongly in fluenced by film parameters, {{the ratio of}} film thickness and bulk domain spacing. Laterally structured polymer surfaces may serve as templates for controlled assembly of nanoparticles (NPs). We investigated the BCP of poly(n-pentyl methacrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) which show bulk morphologies of stacked lamellae or hexagonally packed cylinders. Thin films were investigated by atomic force microscopy and grazing-incidence small-angleX-ray scattering. For film thicknesses fwell below d$_{bulk}$, <b>standing</b> <b>cylinder</b> morphologies were observed in appropriate molar ratios, while film thicknesses around and larger than d$_{bulk}$ resulted in cylinders arranged parallel to surface. To alter and/or improve the morphology also in presence of different NPs (e. g., silica, gold), solvent vapour annealing (SVA) was applied. The BCP morphology usually remains unchanged but periodicities change depending on type and amount of incorporated NPs. It was found that silica clusters enlarge lateral distances of cylinders, whereas Au NPs reduce it. The effect of SVA is weak. The quality of morphology is slightly improved by SVA and lateral distances remain constant or are slightly reduced...|$|E
40|$|A carbon {{microfiber}} (7 μm diameter) {{is employed}} herein as an electroanalytical sensor. The fabricated sensor is cheap, disposable and requires only 150 μL of samples. The carbon fiber is surface-mounted onto an inert surface {{to overcome the}} problems of the fragility of the microwire and the possible interference of convective force due to the non-rigid nature of the wires, as well as to improve the reproducibility in length and the amperometric responses. As the cylindrical electrode is supported on a surface, the diffusion of redox-active species to the electrode is partially blocked by the substrate. A theoretical model is developed to account for this hindered diffusion. The mass-transport regime is altered from ‘linear’ at very short time, where the amperometric responses of the supported microwire closely resemble that of an isolated free <b>standing</b> <b>cylinder</b> (current ∝ electrode area), to ‘convergent’ at long time where its response now tends towards that of a hemi-cylinder of equal radius. The model is validated using chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry of an ideal outer-sphere redox probe, reversible ferrocene methanol oxidation. The fabricated microwire electrode is further applied to the system of irreversible 2 -nitro- 5 -thiobenzoate oxidation used in the detection of reduced glutathione (GSH). The microwire electrode shows significantly higher ratio of Faradaic to non-Faradaic currents as compared to microdisk, macrodisk or carbon nanotube modified electrodes. Using the fabricated microwire, GSH can be detected with the sensitivity of 0. 7 nA μM- 1 and the limit of detection of 0. 5 μM (3 sB/m) ...|$|E
40|$|Of late {{there has}} been a surge of {{interest}} in localised phonon polariton resonators which allow for sub-diffraction confinement of light in the mid-infrared spectral region by coupling to optical phonons at the surface of polar dielectrics. Resonators are generally etched on deep substrates which support propagative surface phonon polariton resonances. Recent experimental work has shown that understanding the coupling between localised and propagative surface phonon polaritons in these systems is vital to correctly describe the system resonances. In this paper we comprehensively investigate resonators composed of arrays of cylindrical SiC resonators on SiC substrates. Our bottom-up approach, starting from the resonances of single, free <b>standing</b> <b>cylinders</b> and isolated substrates, and exploiting both numerical and analytical techniques, allows us to develop a consistent understanding of the parameter space of those resonators, putting on firmer ground this blossoming technology.

To distinguish them from each other we use the opposite symmetry of their time Fourier modes obtained by integrating the periodic flow field over one vortex shedding period. As argued in a recent paper, a relatively significant spanwise period of the simulation has to be considered to obtain a realistic simulation of the infinite spanwise geometry. This spanwise period of the simulation is taken equal to 10 π d, d <b>standing</b> for the <b>cylinder</b> diameter, which amounts to 8 times the linearly preferred wavelength. In this numerical configuration the 3 D state is found fully chaotic and stable down to the Reynolds number (Re) of 170. The obtained asymptotic state is analyzed to evidence the fingerprint of either of the modes A and B by time Fourier analysis. The results show the presence of both modes, which allows us to conclude that the mode B is excited simultaneously with the onset of mode A by non-linear couplings and that the progressive emergence of the mode B, described by Williamson as an ''energy transfer'' from frequencies associated to mode to those of mode B, observed experimentally to start from Re = 220, occurs actually along the whole discontinuous branch of the Williamson Strouhal vs. Reynolds number curve. This explains why a bifurcation giving rise to the mode B has never been observed...|$|R
