40|$|Abstract. Gradient-dependent {{plasticity}} {{considering the}} microstructural effect is introduced into Johnson-Cook model {{to calculate the}} nonuniform temperature distribution in adiabatic shear band (ASB) and the evolutions of average and peak temperatures in ASB. Effects of initial static yield stress, <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient,</b> strain-hardening exponent, strain-rate parameter and thermal-softening parameter are numerically investigated. The calculated peak temperature in ASB considering both the plastic work and the microstructural effect is always greater than the average temperature calculated only using the plastic work. For much lower flow shear stress, the peak temperature approaches two times the average temperature. The occurrence of phase transformation in ASB is easier in metal material with higher initial static yield stress, <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient,</b> strain-rate parameter and thermal-softening parameter. At much lower flow shear stress or much higher average plastic shear strain, the phase transformation occurs more easily in material with a lower strain-hardening exponent. Traditional elastoplastic theory without the microstructural effect underestimates the peak temperature in ASB so that the experimentally observed phase transformations cannot be explained...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{literature}} highlights that surface {{integrity of}} machined parts is notably {{affected by the}} flow stress characteristic of the workpiece. Typically, machining simulation models are tuned by identifying the friction model (tool-chip interaction), heat transfer model and tool geometry that match experimental outcomes. However, in this work {{the influence of the}} parameters defining material mechanical properties on simulation results is considered. A two-dimensional Finite Element Model has been developed based on the material Johnson-Cook constitutive law. Design of Experiment (DoE) procedure has then been used to analyze the response of the model in terms of predicted cutting forces and surface residual stresses to variations in mechanical properties such as the initial Yield strength, the <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the instantaneous strain-rate sensitivity and the temperature dependence of the flow stres...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour {{of the commercial}} aluminium alloys EN AW- 5182, EN AW- 6016 and EN AW- 7021 is investigated at temperatures ranging from 298 to 77 [*]K and strain rates from 1. 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 to 6. 6 [*]×[*] 10 − 2 s− 1. A device that allows testing at cryogenic temperatures is developed and demonstrated, where the specimens are subject to uniaxial tensile loads. The influence of a solution heat treatment for precipitation hardenable alloys is shown. The <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient</b> is determined and mapped {{in terms of the}} experimentally investigated uniform elongation. The experimental data of tested aluminium alloys are compared with EN AW- 1050 A-H 14, which is used as a reference. The effect of the Portevin–LeChatelier effect on ductility and strength is discussed. The Ludwik relationship is adapted to describe materials showing a Portevin–LeChatelier effect...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} role of {{nitrogen}} content on the stress-strain response of Hadfield steel (HS) single crystals under compressive loading. Two different nitrogen concentrations were examined for each orientation (0. 05 wt pct and 1. 06 wt pct) with drastic increase in critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) and <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficients</b> compared to HS without nitrogen. The stress-strain response was strongly dependent on both the crystallographic orientation and the nitrogen concentration. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that, for the HS with 1. 06 wt pct nitrogen, the hardening {{is influenced by the}} coexisting deformation twins and precipitates, which both act as strong obstacles against dislocation motion. A visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) model was modified to account for precipitation and twinning length scales in HS with 1. 06 wt pct nitrogen for selected crystallographic orientations. Incoherent precipitates in the hardening formulation were treated as factors affecting the mean free path of dislocations. The model also accounts for plastic relaxation of precipitates with increasing strain and accurately predicts the stress-strain response. I...|$|R
40|$|The tensile {{deformation}} {{behavior of a}} range of supersaturated Mg-Al solid solutions and an as-cast magnesium alloy AM 60 has been studied. The Mg-Al alloys were tested at room temperature while the alloy AM 60 was tested in the temperature range 293 - 573 K. The differences in the deformation behavior of the alloys is discussed in terms of hardening and softening processes. In order to identify which processes were active, the stress dependence of the <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient</b> was assessed using Lukac and Balik 2 ̆ 7 s model of hardening and softening. The analysis indicates that hardening involves solid solution hardening and interaction with forest dislocations and non-dislocation obstacles such as second phase particles. Cross slip is not a significant recovery process in the temperature range 293 - 423 K. At temperatures between 473 and 523 K the analysis suggests that softening is controlled by cross slip and climb of dislocations. At temperatures above 523 K softening seems to be controlled by dynamic recrystallisation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|High-energy {{ball milling}} (HEBM) is a bulk powder {{manufacturing}} process {{used in the}} creation of dispersion strengthened and nanolaminate materials. Fundamentally, these materials have not been dynamically characterized in a green state prior to hot consolidation. This study incorporates porosity with these HEBM compacts to investigate the effect of high strain-rate on void collapse and particle interaction which has broad applications in development of predictive models for impact events of porous metallic structures that may be employed as energy absorbers, reactive structures, and intermetallic materials. Here, pure and HEBM aluminum powders have been characterized under dynamic compression using the split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) in a passive confinement configuration. The plastic deformation of the powder and crush up were shown to be strain-rate insensitive; and as a result, were modelled adequately with a second order P-? model. The pure aluminum and HEBM aluminum powders appear to have the same <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient</b> and strength index as solid aluminum after yielding. The powders’ respective stress-strain responses follow the same trend but differ only in strength as result of porosity and pre-strain experienced prior to dynamic compression. The HEMB powder was found to be twice as strong as the untreated pure aluminum powder. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{method for}} deducing the stress–strain {{uniaxial}} properties of metallic materials from instrumented spherical indentation is presented {{along with an}} experimental verification. An extensive finite element parametric analysis of the spherical indentation was performed in order to generate a database of load vs. depth of penetration curves for classes of materials selected in order to represent the metals commonly employed in structural applications. The stress–strain curves of the materials were represented with three parameters: the Young modulus for the elastic regime, the stress of proportionality limit and the <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the elastic–plastic regime. The indentation curves simulated by the finite element analyses were fitted {{in order to obtain}} a continuous function which can produce accurate load vs. depth curves for any combination of the constitutive elastic–plastic parameters. On the basis of this continuous function, an optimization algorithm was then employed to deduce the material elastic–plastic parameters and the related stress–strain curve when the measured load vs. depth curve is available by an instrumented spherical indentation test. The proposed method was verified by comparing the predicted stress–strain curves with those directly measured for several metallic alloys having different mechanical properties. This result confirms the possibility to deduce the complete stress–strain curve of a metal alloy with good accuracy by a properly conducted instrumented spherical indentation test and a suitable interpretation technique of the measured quantities...|$|E

40|$|Experimental creep {{measurements}} on an AISI type 310 stainless steel and high purity polycrystalline magnesium {{have been conducted}} within the test temperature and applied stress ranges of 650 ∘C to 800 ∘C and 110 MPa to 320 MPa for the 310 stainless steel, and 150 ∘C to 250 ∘C and 20 MPa to 50 MPa for pure magnesium. The results show that: (i) the creep strain rate ratio, F, between the initial creep rate upon loading and steady-state creep rate decreases from a high value to about unity when the test temperature and/or applied stress are increased; (ii) the apparent activation energy for creep, Q c, upon loading is lower and {{is closer to the}} activation energy for pipe diffusion, Q p, than the value at steady-state which is of the order of the activation energy for volume diffusion, Q v; and (iii) the initial creep rate is less strongly dependent upon the applied stress than the steady-state creep rate. The experimental results are discussed in terms of dislocation network models for creep and the internal and effective stresses. The analysis indicates that the high value for F at low temperatures and/or low stresses is in agreement with the predictions of exhaustion theories where multiplication is not taking place and easily-moved dislocations are eventually exhausted. The low value measured for the apparent activation energy for creep upon loading (creep strain 3 ̆c 10 - 4) {{can be attributed to the}} contribution of pipe diffusion due to the large effective stress present at the onset of creep. The stress dependence of the initial and steady-state creep rates is a consequence of a change in both internal and effective stress during creep deformation, and the stress dependence of the initial strain rate offers an indirect measurement for investigating the stress dependence of the dislocation velocity in creep tests. Examination of the experimental results lends support to the theoretical models based on dislocation link length distribution (dislocation network) models for recovery creep. This analysis gives the stress dependence of the steady-state creep rate, ε̇ s, the dislocation annihilation rate, ρ̇ a, the average effective dislocation velocity, v, the recovery rate, R, and the <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient,</b> H, respectively, during high temperature recovery creep of crystalline materials. Micromechanical modelling was carried out for three aspects of creep, namely (i) the grain size effect in the creep and superplastic deformation of polycrystalline materials; (ii) simulation of the experimental creep results for a 310 stainless steel using the Ostrom-Lagneborg creep model; and (iii) a dislocation link length statistics model for the plastic deformation of crystalline materials. It is shown that: (i) during superplastic deformation, a solid polycrystalline material can be visualized as a two 2 ̆ 2 phase 2 ̆ 2 mixture, one flowing according to Newtonian viscous flow and the other deforming by power law creep; (ii) the simulation results for the 310 stainless steel obtained using the Ostrom-Lagneborg creep model are in good agreement with the experimental results and other independent studies on dislocation network models for creep; and (iii) the dislocation link length statistics model produces reasonable values for the <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the recovery rate during a constant stress creep test, and for a strain rate change during a constant strain rate tensile test.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an inverse}} analysis approach {{aimed at the}} identification of the mechanical properties of metallic materials based on the experimental results obtained from indentation tests. Previous work has shown the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem based on the load-penetration curve when dealing with mystical materials, which exhibit identical indentation curves even if possessing different yield and strain-hardening properties. For this reason, an additional measurement is {{used in the present study}} as input for the inverse analysis which consists of the maximum pile-up height measured after the indentation test. This approach lends itself for practical applications as the load-penetration curve can be easily obtained from commonly available micro-indenters while the pile-up present at the end of the test can be measured by different instruments depending on the size of the indented area, for example by means of an atomic force microscope or a laser profilometer. The inverse analysis procedure consists of a batch deterministic approach, and conventional optimization algorithms are employed for the minimization of the discrepancy norm. The first part of the paper outlines how the inclusion of both the maximum height of the pile-up and the indentation curve in the input data of the inverse analysis leads to a well-defined inverse problem using parameters of mystical materials. The approach is then applied to real experimental data obtained from three sets of 2024 Al alloy samples prepared using different age-hardening treatments. The accuracy of the identification process is validated against the mechanical properties obtained independently from standard tensile coupon tests. The reported results highlight the advantages of the proposed methodology in identifying the elastic modulus, yield stress and <b>strain-hardening</b> <b>coefficient</b> while minimizing the amount of information required to be collected from the experimental indentation tests...|$|E
