40|$|A {{comparison}} of the coadsorption of benzyl alcohol and phenyl ethanol with the cationic surfactant, hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB,</b> at the air-water interface is made using the specular reflection of neutrons. The phenyl ethanol is more surface active than the benzyl alcohol, and competes more effectively with the <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB</b> for the interface. The structure of the <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB</b> component in the mixed monolayer is compared with {{the structure of the}} pure <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB</b> monolayer at an equivalent area per molecule. The addition of the aromatic alcohol subtly alters the conformation of the <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB</b> and draws it closer to the aqueous subphase. The center of the alcohol distribution is located in the interface adjacent to the C 6 group of the <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB</b> alkyl chain closest to the headgroup.

The surfactants were dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (<b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB)</b> and the corresponding <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB.</b> Partially isotopically labeled <b>C</b> 16 <b>TABs</b> were used to localize the position of the oil in the layer with greater precision. The surfactant concentrations were chosen to be at their critical micelle concentrations (cmc) of 14 × 10 - 3 M (<b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB)</b> and 9. 1 × 10 - 4 M (<b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB).</b> The area per molecule for both surfactants increased on the addition of oil from 48 to 54 ± 3 Å 2 for <b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB</b> and 43 to 52 ± 3 Å 2 for <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB.</b> In each case the surfactant layer was found to be slightly thicker in the presence of dodecane than in its absence, although the increase in area would normally cause the thickness to decrease. The area per molecule of the dodecane was found to be 76 and 67 ± 7 Å 2 on <b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB</b> and <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB,</b> respectively, to be compared with earlier surface tension estimates of 78 and 56 Å 2. On <b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB</b> the thickness of the dodecane layer is slightly greater (18. 5 ± 2 Å) than its fully extended chain length of dodecane (18 Å), but on <b>C</b> 16 <b>TAB</b> it is significantly greater (20. 5 ± 2 Å). The separations of the centers of the surfactant and dodecane distributions at the corresponding cmc's were found to be 6. 5 and 8. 5 ± 1 Å.

This particular property is rapidly lost when the solution is heated due breakup of the giant micelles.

The experiments performed at constant up to 1. 0 mM total surfactant concentration reveal that these homologue surfactants mix together to form either mixed vesicles and/or micelles, or both of these structures in equilibrium, depending on the relative amount of the surfactants. The main transition melting temperature Tm of the mixed DODAB-C 18 TAB vesicles is larger than that for the neat DODAB in water owing to the incorporation of <b>C</b> 18 <b>TAB</b> in the vesicle bilayer, however, little amount of <b>C</b> 18 <b>TAB</b> having a minor effect on the Tm of DODAB. The surface tension decreases sigmoidally with <b>C</b> 18 <b>TAB</b> concentration and the inflection point lies around xDODAB ≈ 0. 4, indicating the onset of micelle formation owing to saturation of DODAB vesicles by <b>C</b> 18 <b>TAB</b> molecules and formation of vesicle structures.

40|$|AbstractAs a rule, {{most of the}} {{classical}} Michael-type selection theorems are analogues and, in some respects, generalizations of ordinary extension theorems. In this paper we show {{that the existence of}} set-valued u. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> selections for l. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> mappings is not related to the “usual” mapping-extension problem for u. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> mappings. In view of that, the paper is especially devoted to a proper notion of extending u. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> mappings that agrees well with the existing selection results. On this base new selection theorems dealing with controlled u. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> “extensions” of partial u. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> selections are obtained.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} two commonly studied surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (<b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB),</b> on skin barrier properties. Using skin conductivity, FT-IR of stratum corneum samples, and penetration of radiolabelled SDS, we determined that addition of <b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB</b> lowers the ability of SDS to perturb skin’s barrier properties. Ultrafiltration experiments revealed that addition of <b>C</b> 12 <b>TAB</b> serves to decrease the concentration of monomers and sub-micellar aggregates. None of the measured skin properties including enhancement of skin conductivity, perturbation of lipid structure and skin concentration of SDS correlated with the total SDS concentration in the donor compartment (i. e., the total SDS concentration). However, all these parameters correlated well against the concentration of monomers and sub-micellar aggregates. These findings provide {{the evidence of the}} importance of monomer and sub-micellar components in altering skin barrier properties...|$|R
40|$|Electrogenesis of {{the slow}} {{excitatory}} post-synaptic current (slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.)</b> was analysed with voltage-clamp methods in curarized sympathetic ganglion cells of bull-frogs. Three types of slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> were observed from B neurones of sympathetic ganglia. The type I slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> {{was associated with}} a decrease in membrane conductance, was depressed by membrane hyperpolarization and nullified at - 60 to - 70 mV. It was observed in 65 % of the sympathetic neurones studied. The type II slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> {{was associated with a}}n increase in membrane conductance, was depressed by membrane depolarization and nullified at around + 5 mV. It was observed in 14 % of the neurones studied. A third type of slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> was recorded from 21 % of the sympathetic neurones in this study. This slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> was a mixed type having characteristics of both type I and type II slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> Activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors by application of acetylcholine (ACh) also produced two types of inward currents. The nature of each type of muscarinic slow ACh current was similar to that of each type of slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> The time course of the falling phase of type I and type II slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> was dependent on the membrane potential. The type I slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> was primarily dependent on extracellular K+ and appeared to be produced by a suppression of the M-current (Brown & Adams, 1980). The type II slow e. p. <b>s.</b> <b>c.</b> was due to an increased conductance, probably to Na+, and other cations...|$|R

We found that Jeju <b>S.</b> <b>c.</b> hallamontanus {{is one of three}} clades within S. caecutiens, with an average Jukes-Cantor distance of 1. 57 % in the COI sequences and the distance of 2. 07 % and 11 fixed site differences in the cytochrome b sequences, indicating that Jeju <b>S.</b> <b>c.</b> hallamontanus is one endemic subspecies with concordant genetic distinctness, although further analyses with nuclear DNA sequences are necessary to confirm these findings.

Naltrindole (5. 0 mg/kg <b>s.</b> <b>c.)</b> pretreatment, while failing to modify preference when given alone, completely prevented place-preference induced by BW 373 U 86 (1. 0 mg/kg <b>s.</b> <b>c.)</b> and SNC 80 (1. 25 mg/kg <b>s.</b> <b>c.).</b> The dopamine D- 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390, given at doses that do not affect place-preference (0. 012 mg/kg <b>s.</b> <b>c.),</b> completely prevented the place-preference induced by BW 373 U 86 and SNC 80. At the doses effective in eliciting place-preference, BW 373 U 86 and SNC 80 failed to modify extracellular dopamine in the medial nucleus accumbens, while in the dorso-lateral caudate-putamen BW 373 U 86 (1. 0 and 2. 5 mg/kg <b>s.</b> <b>c.)</b> reduced extracellular dopamine, and this effect was prevented by naltrindole (5. 0 mg/kg <b>s.</b> <b>c.).</b> SNC 80, only at the dose of 5 mg/kg <b>s.</b> <b>c.,</b> significantly reduced extracellular DA in the dorso-lateral caudate-putamen.
