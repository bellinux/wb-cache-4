50|$|Jazz guitarist, producer, and {{composer}} Henry Johnson, was the <b>second</b> <b>endorser</b> of Heritage Guitars, beginning in 1985. In 1986, Johnson's first solo recording {{came out on}} Impulse/MCA records and was met with popular acclaim, including a Grammy nomination. Johnson's recordings were popular throughout the 1990s, which raised the visibility of Heritage Guitars into the mainstream forefront of TV, music magazines, and news publications. Because of a court order, Heritage was unable to talk about themselves or tell anyone of their true identities. Because Johnson did {{a large amount of}} interviews and TV shows, he was able to promote Heritage Guitars more than other artists who were endorsing them. Business flourished after Johnson revealed the identities of the luthiers behind Heritage Guitars. Johnson has been an endorser for almost 30 years, and his Heritage Signature model has been in production since 2008.|$|E

50|$|Any {{candidate}} {{obtaining the}} votes of at least 12.5% of registered voters could advance to the second round. The candidate of the Union for a Popular Movement, Jean-Pierre Marine, finished second behind Bayrou in the first round, and withdrew from the <b>second,</b> <b>endorsing</b> Bayrou {{so as not to}} split the centre-right electorate between two candidates. Third-placed Socialist candidate Marie-Pierre Cabanne was thus Bayrou's only opponent in the final round.|$|R

[...] Rival candidate Pat DeWine, a Hamilton County Commissioner {{and the son of}} Senator Mike DeWine, the same day questioned McEwen's post-Congressional career as a lobbyist, issuing a press release saying [...] "no one who has ever served in Congress ought to be allowed to become a lobbyist. Ever." [...] Congressman John Boehner, whose Eighth District was {{to the west of the}} <b>Second,</b> <b>endorsed</b> McEwen on June 7. Boehner was a freshman in McEwen's final term. He said, [...] "Bob is the most qualified to step in and represent that district." [...] The Congressmen from other neighboring districts, Steve Chabot and Mike Turner, were silent in the primary race.

50|$|Another {{common type}} of decimal time is decimal hours. In 1896, Henri de Sarrauton of the Oran Geographical Society {{proposed}} dividing the 24 {{hours of the day}} each into 100 decimal minutes, and each minute into 100 decimal <b>seconds.</b> Although <b>endorsed</b> by the Bureau des Longitudes, this proposal failed, but using decimal fractions of an hour to represent the time of day instead of minutes has become common.|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} reasons for the slow {{progress}} being made in the Northern Ireland peace process. It examines complications that exist in dealing with the past, present, and future of the conflict between the two main communities whilst also arguing {{that it is hard to}} separate these time frames in practice. In terms of the present, some well known difficulties with the consociational approach are identified. Recent studies have also demonstrated a failure to address sectarianism at the grass-roots level and there has been a resurgence in activity by spoilers and rejectionists. When thinking about the future the two communities still have competing views about the final constitutional destiny of Northern Ireland and this inhibits the development of a sense of a shared future. Although there have been a plethora of initiatives for dealing with the past and for truth recovery, there does not appear to have been a satisfactory approach to this important dimension of peacebuilding. The article concludes by advocating two key strategies. The first is the development of initiatives based on the pursuit of superordinate goals. The <b>second</b> <b>endorses</b> Rorty’s idea of sentimental education as a way of building greater solidarity...|$|R

40|$|Retrieving Realism {{renders the}} joint {{philosophical}} goals of Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Taylor {{into what is}} probably their final and most concise form. It has two main objectives: first, it aims to deconstruct the mediationalism that undergirds Western philosophy, and <b>second,</b> it <b>endorses</b> contact theory, or embodied/embedded coping, as an alternative. In this essay, I present the book’s most salient themes and reveal areas that are ripe for further philosophical consideration. I also direct the reader to the work’s genuine ontological challenge: how {{to come to grips}} with contact theory beyond the borders of epistemology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon {{is likely}} to {{continue}} for a long time, despite the efforts of the Brazilian government and of Brazilian and foreign non-governmental organizations to halt it. This paper argues that among the reasons for this unhappy state of affairs is the framing of deforestation as an environmental issue. It discusses three kinds of environmental framing that, while promoting respect for nature, distort policy options. One frame simplifies an extraordinarily complex situation, thus disregarding critical policy questions. A <b>second</b> frame <b>endorses</b> weak but politically acceptable solutions to the deforestation problem. A third plays into the hands of a politically conservative Brazilian agenda that identifies forest protect with threats to national sovereignty. discourse...|$|R

5000|$|The first, {{known as}} the [...] "states' rights" [...] or [...] "collective right" [...] model, held that the Second Amendment {{does not apply to}} individuals; rather, it recognizes the right of each state to arm its militia. Under this approach, {{citizens}} [...] "have no right to keep or bear arms, but the states have a collective right to have the National Guard". Advocates of collective rights models argued that the Second Amendment was written to prevent the federal government from disarming state militias, rather than to secure an individual right to possess firearms. Prior to 2001, every circuit court decision that interpreted the <b>Second</b> Amendment <b>endorsed</b> the [...] "collective right" [...] model. However, beginning with the Fifth Circuit's opinion United States v. Emerson in 2001, some circuit courts recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{a closely}} watched case by {{companies}} such as Google, Amazon, and Apple who are launching cloud music services, and in Google and Amazon's cases, without license agreements with the music industry. The decision {{in this case was}} viewed as [...] "a victory for cloud music" [...] and a first step in [...] "putting music locker services on a solid legal foundation" [...] for two main reasons. First, it established DMCA safe harbor protection for online locker services, potentially granting them [...] "broad immunity from copyright liability". <b>Second,</b> it <b>endorsed</b> data deduplication, which allows cloud music services to more efficiently allocate storage and reduce the amount of space needed per user. This interpretation was welcomed by cloud music advocates after a previous ruling in Cartoon Network v. CSC Holdings had indicated that deduplication would make online lockers services liable for copyright infringement.|$|R

When the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the commission in Reagan v. Farmers Loan and Trust in 1894, this law helped them to be fully equipped to fight the power of the railroads.|$|R
