Oriented to the modulation control of UPFC (unified power flow controller), this paper constructs afuzzy modulation controller (FMC) with fuzzy logic incorporated, {{so as to}} damp the power oscillations of tie-lines andimprove the dynamic stability of the whole system.

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{suggests}} {{a new concept}} of investigation irregular time series with {{the high level of}} unidentified processes of different nature. The method is based on the concept of physical resonance phenomenon. It is free of many disadvantages and restrictions peculiar to classical methods of numerical analysis of time series.

The method allows to do optimum interpolation and extrapolation under the condition of a limited amount and quality of initial information on the process under study.

To contribute to this need a new diagnostic approach is presented in this work. This paper focuses on some parts of an autonomous full-band spectrum analyzer, referred to as AStrion. AStrion consists different function blocks, referred to as “modules”. In the first module, among other processing tasks, the signal is pre-processed with a new order tracking algorithm described in this paper. The subsequent modules, referred to as AStrion-I and AStrion-H, automatically identify all the harmonic <b>series</b> and <b>modulation</b> side-bands in all the frequency band of the signal [1].

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a complete data-driven method to automatically generate system health indicators without any a priori on the monitored system or the acquired signals. This method is composed of two steps. First, every acquired signal is analysed: the spectral peaks are detected and then grouped in more complex structure as harmonic <b>series</b> or <b>modulation</b> sidebands. Then, a time-frequency tracking operation is applied on all available signals: the spectral peaks and the spectral structures are tracked over time and grouped in trajectories, which will be used to generate the system health indicators. The proposed method is tested on real-world signals coming from a wind turbine test rig.

In order to stabilize the system during an oscillation, the stationary voltage angle difference between the areas is changed {{to coincide with the}} present angle at a point where the speed of the lumped machine representations of the areas is nominal. This is the case at the peaks of the oscillation. To determine the required size of the reactance step, a reduced model of the power system is used.

The second part of this paper describes the demodulation task, done by AStrion-M module. The demodulation is conducted over each carrier frequency along with its side-bands detected by AStrion-H. A multi-rate filtering process is applied over each band to isolate the component. Such filtering method downsamples the signal {{in such a way that}} the digital filter can achieve a satisfactory precision and stability over the targeted demodulation band, even if it is extremely narrow. In order to extract the corresponding deterministic component and to increase the signal to noise ratio, a time synchronous averaging is carried out over the filtered signal sampled according to the corresponding triggering frequency. Therefore, after computing the analytical signal of the averaged signal, a demodulation process estimates the amplitude and frequency functions, which are employed to derive fault indicators both in time and in frequency domains. Finally, results are presented on real data gathered on a test bench designed in KAStrion project for simulating a wind turbine operation. This test bench was prepared to simulate all components of a wind turbine drive train and is composed of mechanisms for accelerated deterioration of bearings and gearbox, which allows the investigation of the wear of selected elements separately.

The dramatic opening {{is based on the}} music from Figaro: a free paraphrase of [...] "Non più andrai" [...] followed by an arrangement of [...] "Voi che sapete" [...] in A-flat major instead of Mozart's B-flat major. This is the only appearance of Cherubino's music. Figaro's aria returns, initially in its original C major, but is quickly varied both harmonically and pianistically. However, instead of proceeding to Mozart's coda, the aria transitions to the dances from Don Giovanni. In the opera, the dances are a minuet in 3/4, a country dance in 2/4, and a quick waltz in 3/8. Liszt keeps the minuet in F major, and combines it with the country dance in the same key. He does not add the waltz as Mozart does, but treats it separately, eventually combining it with the country dance and, interestingly, a portion of Figaro's aria. A <b>series</b> of <b>modulations</b> follow which combine bits of all four themes. At the final transition, the earlier material from Figaro is reused alongside the theme from the minuet.
