6000|$|... "I am more {{amenable}} to treatment," [...] said the Prince, {{a good deal}} revived. [...] "I am my own man again at once, as you perceive. And <b>so,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you, what are my directions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} inconsistent, Mr. Crocker; I grant you that. No doubt it is <b>so.</b> But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you something: {{did you ever}} yet know {{a woman who was}} not inconsistent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{that was}} only for the moment. I could see nothing but her face--so sad, <b>so</b> wistful. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you something. Did you, the night after our walk on the drive in the moonlight--did you dream of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Albany scowled, but was silent; {{and it was}} {{not till}} after the space of a minute or two that he said: [...] "This matter being <b>so</b> happily accommodated, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> if your Majesty is pleased to attend the evensong service in the chapel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hearing {{that the}} man who took Ticonderoga was here in Pendennis Castle, I've ridden twenty-five miles to see him; and to-morrow my brother will ride forty for the same purpose. <b>So</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have first look. Sir," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} the captive, [...] "will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you a few plain questions, and be free with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Will you {{pardon me}} if I {{pause for a}} moment to put what I fear you may think an impertinent question? I never can go on with an address unless I feel, or know, that my {{audience}} are either with me or against me: I do not much care which, in beginning; but I must know where they are; and I would fain find out, at this instant, whether you think I am putting the motives of popular action too low. I am resolved, to-night, to state them low enough to be admitted as probable; for whenever, in my writings on Political Economy, I assume that a little honesty, or generosity,--or {{what used to be called}} [...] "virtue,"--may be calculated upon as a human motive of action, people always answer me, saying, [...] "You must not calculate on that: that is not in human nature: you must not assume anything to be common to men but acquisitiveness and jealousy; no other feeling ever has influence on them, except accidentally, and in matters out of the way of business." [...] I begin, accordingly, tonight low in the scale of motives; but I must know if you think me right in doing <b>so.</b> Therefore, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> those who admit the love of praise to be usually the strongest motive in men's minds in seeking advancement, and the honest desire of doing any kind of duty to be an entirely secondary one, to hold up their hands. (About a dozen hands held up--the audience, partly, not being sure the lecturer is serious, and, partly, shy of expressing opinion.) I am quite serious--I really do want to know what you think; however, I can judge by putting the reverse question. Will those who think that duty is generally the first, and love of praise the second, motive, hold up their hands? (One hand reported to have been held up behind the lecturer.) Very good: I see you are with me, and that you think I have not begun too near the ground. Now, without teasing you by putting farther question, I venture to assume that you will admit duty as at least a secondary or tertiary motive. You think that the desire of doing something useful, or obtaining some real good, is indeed an existent collateral idea, though a secondary one, in most men's desire of advancement. You will grant that moderately honest men desire place and office, at least in some measure for the sake of beneficent power; and would wish to associate rather with sensible and well-informed persons than with fools and ignorant persons, whether they are seen in the company of the sensible ones or not. And finally, without being troubled by repetition of any common truisms about the preciousness of friends, and the influence of companions, you will admit, doubtless, that according to the sincerity of our desire that our friends may be true, and our companions wise,--and in proportion to the earnestness and discretion with which we choose both,--will be the general chances of our happiness and usefulness.|$|R
