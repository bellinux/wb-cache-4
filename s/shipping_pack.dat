5000|$|In 1698, Zanzibar {{became part}} of the {{overseas}} holdings of Oman, falling {{under the control of the}} Sultan of Oman. The Portuguese were expelled and a lucrative trade in slaves and ivory thrived, along with an expanding plantation economy centring on cloves. With an excellent harbor and no shortage of fresh water, Stone Town (capital of Zanzibar) became one of the largest and wealthiest cities in East Africa. With the coming of Omani rule, there occurred a forced land redistribution as all of the most fertile land was handed over to Omani aristocrats who enslaved the African farmers who worked the land. Every year, hundreds of dhows would sail across the Indian Ocean from Arabia, Persia and India with the monsoon winds blowing in from the northeast, bringing iron, cloth, sugar and dates.

40|$|The food {{processing}} industry tends {{to rely on}} well proven technology in processing and wastewater management. Processing costs [...] raw material, labor, <b>shipping,</b> <b>packing</b> materials, energy, water, and wastewater treatment [...] are increasing rapidly, and these increases {{are reflected in the}} food prices passed on to the consumer. Methods of reducing these costs are becoming increasingly important in the industry due to stiff Competition. Process water recycle is a method being considered and implemented for this purpose. According to the Office of Water Research and Technology (OWRT), total national recycling in the food and kindred products industry in 1975 was 1. 6 bgd which results in a recycle rate of 1. 6 (ratio of gross water use to intake). (4) The type of recycle depends on type of products, contaminants in the water and their effect on product quality, the possibility of product or byproduct recovery, water availability, wastewater treatment required, and policies and regulations of the company and regulatory agencies. Significant decreases in water use (50 percent to 70 percent) have been realized by this practice...|$|R
