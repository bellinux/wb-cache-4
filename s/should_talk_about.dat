I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

But we shouldn't shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways." [...] The Independent has cited opinion polls to suggest that many of Corbyn's policies, such as the renationalisation of railways and energy companies, have polled popularly with the general public.|$|E

2500|$|The , Jeremy Corbyn, {{has been}} a {{consistent}} supporter of renationalising public utilities, such as British Rail and energy companies back into public ownership. He also ignited controversy within his party when, {{in an interview with}} The Independent on Sunday, he said that: [...] "I think we <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> what the objectives of the party are, whether that’s restoring the Clause Four as it was originally written or it’s a different one, but I think we shouldn’t shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways. I'm interested in the idea that we have a more inclusive, clearer set of objectives. I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail". Although this has been seen by some as an endorsement for the reinstatement of Clause IV, Corbyn denies this and says that more discussion within his party is needed.|$|E
2500|$|Rihanna began {{recording}} {{songs for}} the album in April 2009. The recording sessions for the album {{took place at}} Milk Studios in Manhattan, New York, Metropolis Studios in London, England, Studios Davout in Paris, France and at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Rihanna worked with several different songwriters and producers on the album, including Chuck Harmony, The-Dream, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart, Chase & Status, StarGate, Demo, and Justin Timberlake. Rihanna wanted the album to be less influenced by synthpop, attempting to avoid the lighthearted commercial pop of her previous albums. By doing so, she incorporated a production style with more bass, and utilized Gothic imagery. In {{the early stages of}} the production, she worked with Adonis Shropshire, who stated that Rihanna had brainstormed a large number of ideas over the course of a few weeks. Rihanna also worked with Norwegian producer duo StarGate, who mused that the collaboration was [...] "very rewarding" [...] and [...] "inspiring for us", commenting: [...] "I don't think we <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> titles just yet. We don't really know which songs are gonna make it, but it feels exciting." [...] It was later revealed that StarGate originally produced a collaboration between Rihanna and Canadian rapper Drake. However, the song did not make the final cut for the album.|$|E

Boldwood's had begun to be a {{troublesome}} image--a species of Daniel in her kingdom who persisted in kneeling eastward when reason and common sense said that he {{might just as well}} follow suit with the rest, and afford her the official glance of admiration which cost nothing at all. She was far from being seriously concerned about his nonconformity. Still, it was faintly depressing that the most dignified and valuable man in the parish should withhold his eyes, and that a girl like Liddy <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. So Liddy's idea was at first rather harassing than piquant.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Western was to {{come down}} to Exeter only on the day before the marriage. The Holts had seen him as they came through London where they slept one night, but as yet the story had not been told. Cecilia expected, almost wished, that the story might reach him from other quarters. It was so natural now that he <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the girl whom he {{intended}} to marry, and so natural,--as Cecilia thought,--that in doing so he should hear the name of Sir Francis Geraldine. Sir Francis was a man well known to the world of fashion, and many men must have heard of his intended marriage. Cecilia, though she almost hoped, almost feared that it should be so. The figure of Mr. Western asking with an angry voice why he had not been told did alarm her. But he asked no such question, nor, as far as Cecilia knew, had he heard anything of Sir Francis when the Holts passed through London.|$|E
60|$|The Dean's family, and {{especially}} Mrs. Hippesley, attempted {{to be kind}} to her. The Dean himself came down and called with much decanal grandeur, conspicuous as {{he walked up to}} the Hall door with shovel hat and knee breeches. But even the Dean could not do much. He had intended to take Mrs. Western's part as against his brother-in-law, having been no doubt prompted by some old feeling of favour towards Cecilia Holt; but now he was given to understand that this Mr. Western had also gone astray, and {{in such a way as}} to make it hardly possible that he <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. He called therefore and took her by the hand, and expressed a hope that all things should be made to go straight, and then he left her, taking her by the hand again, and endeavouring to prove his esteem by his manner of doing so. That was the beginning and the end of the Dean's comforting. Mrs. Hippesley could do but little more. She did make an attempt at confidential conversation, but was soon stopped by Cecilia's cold manner. Mrs. Western, indeed, could speak to none. She could not utter a word either for or against her husband. Mrs. Green came, of course, more than once; but it was the same thing. Mrs. Western could endure to talk and to be talked to about nothing. And though there was friendship in it, it was but a subdued feeling of friendship,--of friendship which under the circumstances had to be made silent. Mrs. Green when she had taken her leave determined not to come again immediately, and Mrs. Western when Mrs. Green had gone felt that she did not wish her to come. She could live with her mother more easily than with her old friends, because her mother understood the tone of her mind. Each kept their thoughts to themselves on that subject of which each was thinking; but each sympathised with the other.|$|E
