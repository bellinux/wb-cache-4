It {{is hard to}} understand what sense the military saw in the trawling operation. First drag everything haphazardly around the bottom by the trawls, and then send in the submersibles?...It is clear that things <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in the reverse order.” ...|$|E

500|$|AOC 11 Group Keith Park was livid {{with the}} claim returns. As {{far as he}} was concerned, {{claiming}} 200 on one day was nonsense. He placed particular blame on Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing which had claimed one third, around 60, of the 185 'victories' (total claims were 81 in the morning and 104 in the afternoon). More damage <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to German bombers inbound to the target rather than destroying stragglers that were no military threat {{as they made their way}} to the coast. He complained that there were too many inexperienced leaders and interceptions were being missed. Things needed [...] "tightening up", that was Park's lesson for 15 September. Park was aware the ratio of losses was 2:1 in the British favour. It had been a decent performance, but not Fighter Command's best.|$|E
500|$|The initial autopsy {{performed}} on Patricia Jones was criticized by police and prosecutors, {{who felt that}} the recovery of bullets and the testing of stomach contents <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> Dr. Hugh Owens, who had performed the autopsy, argued that he had recovered one of the presumed three bullets present in the body, and that because the body had been [...] "prepared" [...] by an undertaker prior to autopsy, any chemical tests on stomach contents would have been useless. Owens did add when asked {{that he had not}} seen any food apparent in the stomach at autopsy. The body of Patricia Jones was exhumed on June 17 in order to collect the bullets that had been left behind at the original autopsy, as well as to gather what samples of tissue and stomach contents were possible.|$|E
500|$|Balukas {{was greatly}} incensed over the {{sanction}} {{and refused to}} pay on principle, turning away offers by others to pay the fine in her stead. Balukas explains that [...] "It wasn’t the $200... pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, {{were the ones who}} decided I should be fined. I felt it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by an outside panel, not by my competitors." [...] The sides were at an impasse. Balukas refused to relent and the WPBA refused to lift the sanction and would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid the fine. [...] "Just because she was our premier player doesn't mean she was above the rules," [...] said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Professional Loree Jon Jones in the same interview expressed mixed sentiments: [...] "Her not playing is, I guess, sad," [...] but she reflected that in Balukas's absence, [...] "we've all learned how to win." ...|$|E

Hammarskjöld {{was criticized for}} overstepping his bounds and doing more than the UN <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing.</b> There <b>was</b> also {{criticism for}} taking sides in the conflict. The Soviet Union, France and Belgium were not satisfied by the UN's work and refused to pay {{their share of the}} costs of the operation. This nearly bankrupted the UN.|$|R

500|$|As soon as {{he joined}} the Middle Temple, Hastings began saving money for his call to the Bar, {{starting}} with half a crown {{from the sale of}} his Queen's South Africa Medal to a pawnbroker. The rules and regulations of the Inns of Court meant that a student was not allowed to work as a [...] "tradesperson" [...] but there was no rule against working as a journalist, and his cousin Philip Carr, a drama critic for the Daily News, got him a job writing a gossip column for the News for one pound a week. This job lasted about three months; both he and Carr were fired after Hastings wrote a piece for the paper that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by Carr. Despite this, his new contacts within journalism allowed him to get temporary jobs writing play reviews for the Pall Mall Gazette and the Ladies' Field. After two years of working eighteen-hour days he had saved £60 of the £100 needed to be called to the Bar, but had still not studied for the examinations as he could not afford to buy any law books. Over the next year his income decreased, as he was forced to study for the examinations rather than work for newspapers. By the end of May 1904 he had the £100 needed, and he was called to the bar on 15 June.|$|E
500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E
500|$|... or [...] "with-knowledge". The English word implies {{internal}} {{awareness of}} a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, {{as well as a}} consciousness of our own actions. Thus conscience considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined [...] "gut feeling" [...] or [...] "vague sense of guilt" [...] about what ought to be or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination, {{which may or may not}} be presently consciously acceptable to the person ("traditional conscience"). Conscience may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ("critical conscience"). In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others, critical conscience can be aided by a [...] "spark" [...] of intuitive insight or revelation (called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy). Conscience is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and approbation or 'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined.|$|E

500|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, rated it 58% fresh {{based on a}} total of 12 critic reviews. Meena Iyer of The Times of India praised the actors and noted that despite being based on true {{incidents}} the film [...] " [...] to connect emotionally". In her review for Hindustan Times, Sweta Kaushal wrote that director Ravi Kumar [...] "should be congratulated for picking a rather grave subject" [...] and praised the actors for doing justice to their respective characters. However, she felt that in portraying Dilip, Kumar took away the [...] "severity of the issue" [...] {{and that he did}} not put [...] "the blame on anyone". Further, she opined that the film had depicted Anderson [...] "as a rather humanist [...] ". She concluded that better research <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> and that the film [...] "could have been a more involving story". While Kaushal felt that Barton's role was unnecessary, Anuj Kumar of The Hindu suggested that this role was planted in the story to provide Warren Anderson a chance to express his views. Kumar praised Yadav's acting by calling him the [...] "face of the tragedy." [...] He also praised Sheen but felt that Penn looked [...] "out of place in the mofussil surroundings." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express noted that Chatterjee was effective in her role. India Today Rohit Khilnani praised the director for [...] " [...] everything that [...] drama needed". However, he felt that the overall quality of the film could have been better.|$|E

[...] Moore later stated, [...] "When Terry Stewart [...] called and told me we were to be inducted, he was apologetic," [...] Moore said.

The sudden change of angle caused the nose to pitch downwards and the aircraft to descend more rapidly than was appropriate for the conditions. The Captain and other crew members did not react to this for about 45 seconds, though, until about [...] from the ground they applied full power and full up elevator {{to try to bring}} the aircraft up. The accident report states that during this 45-second period, they may have been preoccupied by looking for visual confirmation of their position, such as the runway lights.|$|E
