40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on merger policy in open economies. We first adopt a reduced-form approach to derive general insights on the scope for conflict between national antitrust authorities and on the gains from international merger policy coordination. Taking trade costs as given, we use standard oligopoly models to derive conditions on market structure, under which underenforcement or overenforcement of national merger policies can arise. We then study the interactions between merger policy and trade policy, and find that trade liberalization often leads to <b>stricter</b> <b>national</b> merger policies. We conclude by discussing empirical evidence on conflict between antitrust authorities...|$|R

The program also included a large-scale public information campaign and an increase in water tariffs. The impact of the program is difficult to assess, since available figures on water consumption are difficult to compare over the years, because {{it is not clear whether}} they include water losses or not and whether they refer only to residential consumption or total consumption.|$|R

50|$|Low {{politics}} {{is a concept that}} covers all matters that are not absolutely vital to the survival of the state as the economics and the social affairs. The low politics are the domain of the state's welfare. It concerns all things about social or human security. This concept is the opposite of the high politics which concerns the state's survival and <b>strict</b> <b>national</b> security. Keohane and Nye describe that previously, the international relations were based on a simple interdependence scheme based on national security: high politics, and that nowadays the international relations are ruled by a complex interdependence based on domestic issues : low politics.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The {{objective of this}} project is to produce a large user-friendly and research-oriented database of the <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> that transpose EU directives into domestic law {{in order to provide}} the basis for large-N theoretically-based academic research on the causes of variance in the timing and quality of national implementation. The pre-existing databases on national transposition were not designed to facilitate academic research. The Commission publishes an annual report on the application of Community law, but it lists only the proportion of directives that have been transposed up to a given year, without providing data on delay of transposition. It also uses cumulative data since 1960, creating a severe upward bias in the national compliance record. The report tends to consider a directive transposed when the first measure has been notified by the Member States. But transposition normally needs more than one <b>national</b> <b>measure,</b> so the Commission’s data are likely overestimated compliance. Finally, no information is provided on the dates and instruments of national transposition. Recently, Celex, the EU legal database, has been opened to the public for free online consultation. The database contains approximately 3, 000 directives, but it is not designed in a way that could be immediately used for research purposes. Fields than contains dates need to be converted from string to date format. Deadlines for the adoption of <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> need to be separated from deadlines for the application. There are no fields containing the dates of adoption of <b>national</b> transposition <b>measures.</b> These need to be deducted from the title of <b>national</b> implementing <b>measures</b> or by other available means. Moreover, there are no fields that record the types on <b>national</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, there are mistakes and missing information that need correcting and completing. The project consists of migrating the raw data available from Celex into an appropriately-designed database...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Breastfeeding {{is crucial}} for child {{survival}} and development, and exclusive breastfeeding is recommended {{for the first six}} months of the infant’s life, with continued breastfeeding until two years of age and beyond. Marketing of breastmilk substitutes has a negative impact on the recommended breastfeeding behaviour, and interferes with maternal and child rights. The International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code) was launched to guide breastfeeding promotion and regulate breastmilk substitutes marketing. The aim of this study is to examine the protection of breastfeeding through international recommendations and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> adopting provisions from the Code, as well as the breastfeeding promotion and breastmilk substitutes marketing through mass media in five Southeast Asian countries. Methods: Media clips collected from January 2015 to January 2016 through media monitoring services were analysed, in addition to international frameworks in support of the protecting of breastfeeding and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of the Code. Relevant provisions from the Code were chosen to assess compliance. Results: Several international recommendations and human rights conventions are in support of breastfeeding. All the five countries studied had <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of provisions from the Code, either legally enforceable or voluntary. “Growing-up milk” for children above 12 months was the most common product advertised for, counting for more than two thirds of the collected advertisement clips. Social medias were used by companies to promote all categories of breastmilk substitutes. Conclusions: Despite international frameworks and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> to promote and protect breastfeeding, breastmilk substitutes are marketed through various media outlets. Companies are in violation of the Code, hindering states to fulfil their obligation to protect breastfeeding. There is a need for strengthening of <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of the Code, especially in expanding the covered age range and better monitor compliance on social media outlets.

50|$|As of August 2016, the EWG {{alongside}} activist Erin Brockovich {{is pushing}} for the EPA to change the nationwide MCL to be more reflective of the California standards. This response comes as result of the resignation of a top state health official in North Carolina.

The confusion on the regulating guidelines and health safety of hexavalent chromium within drinking water has led to multiple standards.
