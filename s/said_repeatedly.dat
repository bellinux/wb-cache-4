25|$|Novak has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> {{that he was}} not told, {{and that}} he did not know, that Plame was – or had ever been – a NOC, an agent with Non-Official Cover. He has emphatically said that had he {{understood}} that she was any sort of secret agent, he would never have named her.|$|E
25|$|A further {{concern is}} whether, {{as a result}} of this {{security}} argument, Israel will in fact allow the Palestinian community to emerge as a viable and sovereign political unit, a viable and contiguous state. There are also various economic and political restrictions placed on Palestinian people, activities, and institutions which have had a detrimental effect on the Palestinian economy and quality of life. Israel has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> that these restrictions are necessary due to security concerns, and in order to counteract ongoing efforts which promote terrorism which incite opposition to Israel's existence and rights as a country. The key obstacle therefore remains the Israeli demand for security versus Palestinian claims for rights and statehood.|$|E

25|$|His ankle {{problems}} {{became so}} severe {{years later that}} he had both his ankles surgically fused. His saga of injury and failed rehabs {{was connected to the}} use of painkillers by the doctor who was assigned to his case. Walton has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> in his broadcasts that he is just as much to blame for taking the medication as the doctor was for giving it to him. In a June 8, 2010 interview on The Dan Patrick Show, Walton admitted to contemplating suicide for a time due to the constant pain resulting from injuries sustained during his NBA career. Walton's injuries, along with his 1978–1979 year-long protest, gave him an unpleasant, if not odd, record of missing the most games during an NBA playing career, when taking into account the number of years he was officially listed as a player on a team roster.|$|E
500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: [...] "Signor Mortara, I am sorry {{to inform you that}} you are the victim of a betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to take Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately after observing Dr. Adams' 12-hour autopsy, Dr. Baden said, [...] "Preliminary {{findings}} indicate {{the boy did}} not die from sickle cell trait, nor did he die from natural causes." [...] Dr. Baden has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> that sickle trait by itself does not cause death. [...] He explained a [...] "sickle cell crisis" [...] is a sickle cell disease—not the same as sickle cell trait. [...] By itself, the sickle cell trait is not harmful. People with sickle cell trait can lead perfectly healthy lives. But beyond that, he said, hospital records indicate Anderson's blood was not sickled until the moment at which he started to die.|$|E
2500|$|Abernethy <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> that AMC's [...] "main {{problem was}} its image lag — {{the fact that}} too many people still thought of American Motors as the builder of plain jane compacts." [...] He also started to move the Ambassador upscale to compete with other manufacturers' {{full-size}} cars. Moreover, larger models typically return bigger profits. Offering larger, and often more prestigious or [...] "halo cars", can also help make the firm's smaller models look more attractive to consumers. Thus, {{as part of this}} vision, Abernethy put into a motion a total remake of AMC's corporate identity and its marketing mix that would divorce its larger car lines from its Rambler brand and his perceived [...] "negative" [...] compact car image.|$|E

She is known for her continuing interest in deaf culture and the Deaf in Japan. [...] She learned Japanese sign language and she is a skilled sign language interpreter. [...] She attends the [...] "Sign Language Speech Contest for High School Students" [...] held every August, and [...] "Praising Mothers Raising Children with Hearing Impairments" [...] every December. In October 2008, she participated in the [...] "38th National Deaf Women's Conference." [...] She also signs in informal Deaf gatherings.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the trial}} in December 2000, it emerged that Katz's claim that Abu Fahmi, one of the witnesses, had told him the [...] "army rounded up the villagers, lined them {{up against a wall}} and shot them", was incorrect. When the court {{examined}} Katz's tapes of his interviews, it did not find such a statement. On the contrary, Abu Fahmi <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly,</b> [...] "We did not see them killing after we raised our hands." [...] According to Morris, it is telling that [...] "no residents went on record in 1948 or any time before the 1990s to claim there had been a massacre." [...] In August 1998, a former resident of the village, Mahmoud al Yihiya Yihiya, published a book about Tantura in which he describes the battle and names 52 villagers who died, but does not call it a massacre.|$|E
2500|$|Simmons, the {{ostensible}} Party favorite, staked {{his campaign}} on the convention and <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> he would not [...] "force a primary" [...] if he lost the convention. However, when Simmons lost many of his pledged delegates to McMahon, his viability was doubted {{by the media and}} state GOP. Pundits revealed that Simmons was under pressure to drop out and run for his former Congressional seat. When Simmons was asked about the possibility, he did not explicitly [...] "rule out" [...] a change in races. Simmons was visibly frustrated by the negative media publicity he received as a result. Simmons then claimed that he had more delegates than McMahon by a wide margin. McMahon heavily outspent Simmons, maintaining a steady lead over both her rivals. Simmons could not fund TV ads after a drop in fundraising. In the weeks prior to the convention, Simmons failed to regain in the polls.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1982, Iraq {{was removed}} from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism to ease the {{transfer}} of dual-use technology to that country. According to investigative journalist Alan Friedman, Secretary of State Alexander Haig was [...] "upset at the fact that the decision had been made at the White House, even though the State Department was responsible for the list." [...] "I was not consulted," [...] Haig is said to have complained. In March, President Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82—seeking [...] "a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East"—and in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: [...] "The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran." [...] Pursuant to this Directive, Thomas Twetten arrived in Baghdad on July 27 to share CIA satellite imagery on Iranian troop movements with the Iraqi Mukhabarat. This was [...] "the first U.S. provision of intelligence to Iraq," [...] and sparked a short-lived debate over whether Iraq would tolerate a CIA presence in the country: Mukhabarat head Barzan Tikriti told Twetton to [...] "get the hell out of Iraq," [...] but Iraqi military intelligence—"having already drooled over it and having <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> how valuable it was"—subsequently informed Twetton [...] "we'll continue to look at your information, and we'll assess whether it is of use to us in any way." [...] Reports of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran reached the CIA as early as 1983, but the U.S. took no action to restrain Iraq's violations of international law, failing even to alert the UN. In late 1983, Reagan selected Donald Rumsfeld as his envoy to the Middle East; Rumsfeld met Saddam in Baghdad in December 1983 and March 1984. [...] "On November 26, 1984, Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations." ...|$|E

Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a man--of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words uttered. They were loud and quick--unequal--spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh--not so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice.

60|$|The second attempt {{met with}} even worse success; for he {{remained}} so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, {{and found that}} he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he <b>said,</b> <b>repeatedly</b> jerked at the rope without our feeling it. This was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade {{at the foot of the}} ladder. This balustrade was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if possible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no means of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it down.|$|E

6000|$|The maiden did {{not show}} any great haste to open the letter, being aware that the true gist of {{it could only be}} {{discovered}} in private, and her father was studying his own likewise in silence. It was from Sir Ralf Sadler to request that Mistress Cicely might be permitted to become a regular member of the household. There was now a vacancy since, though Mrs. Curll was nearly as much about the Queen as ever, it was as the secretary's wife, not as one of the maiden attendants; and Sir Ralf wrote that he wished the more to profit by the opportunity, as he might soon be displaced by some one not of a temper greatly to consider the prisoner's wishes. Moreover, he said the poor lady was ill at ease, and much dejected at the tenor of her late letters from Scotland, and that she had <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> that nothing would do her good but the presence of her pretty playfellow. Sir Ralf added assurances that he would watch over the maiden like his own daughter, and would take the utmost care of the faith and good order of all within his household. Curll also wrote by order of his mistress a formal application for the young lady, to which Mary had added in her own hand, [...] "I thank the good Master Richard and Mrs. Susan beforehand, for I know they will not deny me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{friends of}} Melmotte had {{moreover}} {{a basis of}} hope, and were enabled to sound premonitory notes of triumph, arising from causes quite external to their party. The 'Breakfast Table' supported Melmotte, but the 'Breakfast Table' was not a Conservative organ. This support was given, not to the great man's political opinions, as to which a well-known writer in that paper suggested that the great man had probably not as yet given very {{much attention to the}} party questions which divided the country,--but to his commercial position. It was generally acknowledged that few men living,--perhaps no man alive,-- had so acute an insight into the great commercial questions of the age as Mr Augustus Melmotte. In whatever part of the world he might have acquired his commercial experience,--for it had been <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> that Melmotte was not an Englishman,--he now made London his home and Great Britain his country, and it would be for the welfare of the country that such a man should sit in the British Parliament. Such were the arguments used by the 'Breakfast Table' in supporting Mr Melmotte. This was, of course, an assistance;--and not the less so because it was asserted in other papers that the country would be absolutely disgraced by his presence in Parliament. The hotter the opposition the keener will be the support. Honest good men, men who really loved their country, fine gentlemen, who had received unsullied names from great ancestors, shed their money right and left, and grew hot in personally energetic struggles to have this man returned to Parliament {{as the head of the}} great Conservative mercantile interests of Great Britain! ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} plans, of course. There was a faction against the chapel faction, which favoured the plan sketched out above. The theatre faction, {{including}} Mr. May {{and some of}} the more florid tradesmen, favoured the risking of everything in the Endeavour. Alvina was to be the proprietress of the Endeavour, she was to run it on some sort of successful lines, and abandon all other enterprise. Minor plans included the election of Alvina to the post of parish nurse, at six pounds a month: a small private school; a small haberdashery shop; and a position in the office of her cousin's Knarborough business. To one and all Alvina answered with a tantalizing: [...] "I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know. I can't say yet. I shall see. I shall see." [...] Till one and all became angry with her. They were all so benevolent, and all so sure that they were proposing the very best thing she could do. And they were all nettled, even indignant that she did not jump at their proposals. She listened to them all. She even invited their advice. Continually she said: [...] "Well, {{what do you think of}} it?" [...] And she repeated the chapel plan to the theatre group, the theatre plan to the chapel party, the nursing to the pianoforte proposers, the haberdashery shop to the private school advocates. [...] "Tell me what you think," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly.</b> And they all told her they thought their plan was best. And bit by bit she told every advocate the proposal of every other advocate [...] "Well, Lawyer Beeby thinks--" [...] and [...] "Well now, Mr. Clay, the minister, advises--" [...] and so on and so on, till it was all buzzing through thirty benevolent and officious heads. And thirty benevolently-officious wills were striving to plant each one its own particular scheme of benevolence. And Alvina, naïve and pathetic, egged them all on in their strife, without even knowing what she was doing. One thing only was certain. Some obstinate will in her own self absolutely refused to have her mind made up. She would not have her mind made up for her, and she would not make it up for herself. And so everybody began to say [...] "I'm getting tired of her. You talk to her, and you get no forrarder. She slips off to something else. I'm not going to bother with her any more." [...] In truth, Woodhouse was in a fever, for three weeks or more, arranging Alvina's unarrangeable future for her. Offers of charity were innumerable--for three weeks.|$|E
