Theoretical designs which operate as invisibility cloak for one polarization while behaving as a Luneburg lens for another orthogonal polarization have been suggested.

Forces at <b>submicrometer</b> <b>scales</b> are weak and slow, control is hard to achieve, and power cannot be reliably supplied. Despite the increasing complexity of nanodevices such as DNA origami and molecular machines, rapid mechanical operations are not yet possible. Here, we bind temperature-responsive polymers to charged Au nanoparticles, storing elastic energy that can be rapidly released under light control for repeatable isotropic nanoactuation. Optically heating above a critical temperature [Formula: see text] = 32 °C using plasmonic absorption of an incident laser causes the coatings to expel water and collapse within a microsecond to the nanoscale, millions of {{times faster than the}} base polymer. This triggers a controllable number of nanoparticles to tightly bind in clusters. Surprisingly, by cooling below [Formula: see text] their strong van der Waals attraction is overcome as the polymer expands, exerting nanoscale forces of several nN. This large force depends on van der Waals attractions between Au cores being very large in the collapsed polymer state, setting up a tightly compressed polymer spring which can be triggered into the inflated state.

Opaque gold films have been structured by focused ion-beam technologies at <b>submicrometer</b> <b>scales</b> in a checkerboard fashion and their optical properties measured. Subwavelength square holes in thick gold films placed in checkerboard fashion show a broadband extraordinary transmission of light at visible wavelengths. We find that the smaller the square holes, the larger is the transmission over a band of wavelengths from 650 to 950 nm suggesting that such structured surfaces have very unusual effective medium properties, which is confirmed by the band-structure diagrams computed with finite elements. Theoretical results also confirm the experimental transmission measured to be well over 80 % from 750 to 950 nm for a checkerboard with 150 nm× 150 nm square holes. This unusual broadband nature of checkerboard structured films is confirmed by the dark-field reflection spectra.

50|$|Hydride Vapour Phase Epitaxy (HVPE) is {{the only}} III-V and III-N {{semiconductor}} crystal growth process working close to equilibrium. That means that the condensation reactions exhibit fast kinetics: one observe immediate reactivity to an increase of the vapour phase supersaturation towards condensation. This property {{is due to the}} use of chloride vapour precursors GaCl and InCl, of which dechlorination frequency is high enough so that there is no kinetic delay. A wide range of growth rates, from 1 to 100 microns per hour, can then be set {{as a function of the}} vapour phase supersaturation. Another HVPE feature is that growth is governed by surface kinetics: adsorption of gaseous precursors, decomposition of ad-species, desorption of decomposition products, surface diffusion towards kink sites. This property is of benefit when it comes to selective growth on patterned substrates for the synthesis of objects and structures exhibiting a 3D morphology. The morphology is only dependent on the intrinsic growth anisotropy of crystals. By setting experimental growth parameters of temperature and composition of the vapour phase, one can control this anisotropy, which can be very high as growth rates can be varied by an order of magnitude. Therefore, we can shape structures with various novel aspect ratios. The accurate control of growth morphology was used for the making of GaN quasi-substrates, arrays of GaAs and GaN structures on the micrometer and <b>submicrometer</b> <b>scales,</b> GaAs tips for local spin injection.
