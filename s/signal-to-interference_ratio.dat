50|$|In {{communication}} systems, {{noise is}} an error or undesired random disturbance of a useful information signal. The noise is a summation of unwanted or disturbing energy from natural and sometimes man-made sources. Noise is, however, typically distinguished from interference, {{for example in}} the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), <b>signal-to-interference</b> <b>ratio</b> (SIR) and signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SNIR) measures. Noise is also typically distinguished from distortion, which is an unwanted systematic alteration of the signal waveform by the communication equipment, for example in the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) and total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N).|$|E

50|$|In {{information}} theory and telecommunication engineering, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) (also {{known as the}} signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR)) is a quantity used to give theoretical upper bounds on channel capacity (or the rate of information transfer) in wireless communication systems such as networks. Analogous to the SNR used often in wired communications systems, the SINR {{is defined as the}} power of a certain signal of interest divided by the sum of the interference power (from all the other interfering signals) and the power of some background noise. If the power of noise term is zero, then the SINR reduces to the <b>signal-to-interference</b> <b>ratio</b> (SIR). Conversely, zero interference reduces the SINR to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is used less often when developing mathematical models of wireless networks such as cellular networks.|$|E

50|$|Asynchronous CDMA {{offers a}} key {{advantage}} in the flexible allocation of resources i.e. allocation of a PN codes to active users. In the case of CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA the number of simultaneous orthogonal codes, time slots and frequency slots respectively are fixed, hence the capacity in terms of number of simultaneous users is limited. There are a fixed number of orthogonal codes, time slots or frequency bands that can be allocated for CDM, TDMA, and FDMA systems, which remain underutilized due to the bursty nature of telephony and packetized data transmissions. There is no strict limit {{to the number of}} users that can be supported in an asynchronous CDMA system, only a practical limit governed by the desired bit error probability, since the SIR (<b>signal-to-interference</b> <b>ratio)</b> varies inversely with the number of users. In a bursty traffic environment like mobile telephony, the advantage afforded by asynchronous CDMA is that the performance (bit error rate) is allowed to fluctuate randomly, with an average value determined by the number of users times the percentage of utilization. Suppose there are 2N users that only talk half of the time, then 2N users can be accommodated with the same average bit error probability as N users that talk all of the time. The key difference here is that the bit error probability for N users talking all of the time is constant, whereas it is a random quantity (with the same mean) for 2N users talking half of the time.|$|E

In this paper, under the assumption of a noiseless channel, we strengthen these results by proving a necessary and sufficient condition for the feasible log-SIR region to be a strictly convex set.

30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that RRH cells are {{overlaid}} in the macrocell, in general, all the RRH cell users suffer interference from the MBS. However, the users in different areas usually have significantly distinct orders of <b>signal-to-interference</b> <b>ratios</b> (SIRs). Therefore, it is not efficient to employ a uniform interference coordination over all areas. In particular, performing interference coordination on the users with high SIRs usually brings marginal gain but requires additional cost such as the feedback of interference channels. The same issue exists in the macrocell. To improve the coordination efficiency, we propose to classify both the macrocell coverage and RRH cell coverage into two types of areas, i.e., the cooperative area and non-cooperative area. The interference coordination is only used for the users located in the cooperative area.|$|R
