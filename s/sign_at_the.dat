5|$|WSDOT is {{studying}} several different proposed {{changes to the}} SR224 / SR225 intersection to improve traffic flow. Several proposals have been introduced to alleviate the situation, including replacing the stop <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersection with a traffic light, reconfiguring the intersection and the off ramp from I-82, and implementing several options featuring roundabouts. WSDOT favors the roundabout options and estimates costs will range between $2 and $7.4million to construct.|$|E
5|$|Lisa finds Homer's {{note and}} alerts the family. They hurry {{to the bridge}} to save him, but they are almost {{run over by a}} {{speeding}} truck. Homer pulls them to safety just in time, and he is suddenly filled with a new reason to live: to place a stop <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dangerous intersection. After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed bumps and warning signs throughout the town.|$|E
5|$|While NY32 officially remains {{concurrent}} with NY299 {{all the way}} to {{the traffic}} light at the northern terminus of NY208, a <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Elting Memorial Library, just before the center of downtown, directs northbound traffic on the highway down North Front Street. This shortcut allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection and head out of the village on North Chestnut Street. Once past the village, the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east. NY32 then becomes mostly rural again.|$|E

5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, Army Air Forces Intelligence began {{a secret}} {{study of the}} best saucer reports, {{including}} Arnold's. A follow-up study by the Air Materiel Command intelligence and engineering departments at Wright Field Ohio {{led to the formation}} the U.S. Air Force's Project <b>Sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1947, the first official U.S. military UFO study.|$|E
25|$|Public USAF UFO {{studies were}} first {{initiated}} under Project <b>Sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1947, following many widely publicized UFO reports (see Kenneth Arnold). Project Sign was initiated specifically {{at the request}} of General Nathan Twining, chief of the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

25|$|The scene {{changes to}} Israel in 1956, and shows Rachel meeting {{her husband and}} their two children, and walking back into Kibbutz Stein, which a <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gate announces was funded with the {{recovered}} money stolen from Jews killed during the war. In the final scene the tranquility of Rachel and her family is interrupted by explosions heard in the distance; the sirene announces an air attack and the Israeli soldiers poistion themselves {{at the front of}} the kibbutz. It is October 1956 and the Suez crisis has begun.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to the}} {{creation}} of the Air Force's Project <b>Sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1947, one of the earliest government studies to come to a secret extraterrestrial conclusion. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate to that effect, but the Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg ordered it destroyed. The existence of this suppressed report was revealed by several insiders who had read it, such as astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek and Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of the USAF's Project Blue Book.|$|E
25|$|He {{was first}} {{published}} as a poet in 1947 with Mumei-shishū ("Poems of an unknown poet"), which he paid for himself, and as a novelist the following year with, Owarishi michi no shirube ni ("The Road <b>Sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> End of the Street"), which established his reputation. When Abe received the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, his ability to continue publishing was confirmed. Though he did much work as an avant-garde novelist and playwright, {{it was not until}} the publication of The Woman in the Dunes in 1962 that he won widespread international acclaim.|$|E

25|$|Baptism {{also became}} a public event in Geneva, with the font moved {{to the front of}} the church or even being {{attached}} to the pulpit. Confirmation was abolished, but as in Strasbourg children were expected to make a public profession of faith when able, and this became the standard rite of passage for children to be admitted to communion in Reformed churches. Puritans also saw baptism as a prophetic <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of Christian life. Confession of sin and professions of faith (such as reciting the Apostles' Creed) were considered the fulfillment of the sign, the living out of one's baptism, or improving on one's baptism.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Walden has noted, in its 2005 Comprehensive Plan, the {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} oblique intersection at {{the eastern end of}} the Route208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to a stop <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy ]. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut.|$|E
25|$|Notable signage {{includes}} the Toshiba billboard {{directly under the}} NYE ball drop, the curved seven-story NASDAQ <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NASDAQ MarketSite at 4 Times Square on 43rd Street, and the curved Coca-Cola sign located underneath another large LED display {{owned and operated by}} Samsung. Both the Coca-Cola sign and Samsung LED displays were built by LED display manufacturer Daktronics. Times Square's first environmentally friendly billboard powered by wind and solar energy was first lit on December 4, 2008. On completion, the 20 Times Square development will host the largest LED signage in Times Square at 18,000 square feet. The display will be 1,000 square feet larger than the Times Square Walgreens display and one of the largest video-capable screens in the world.|$|E

25|$|Mount Barker Hill, just 5km {{from the}} town centre, reaches 404 metres above sea level. A sealed road leads {{to the base of}} a 184 metre high TV tower - the tallest {{free-standing}} tower in the southern hemisphere - on the summit of the hill. An information <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> summit states that the steel TV tower weighs 340 tonnes. There is also a lookout and a granite cairn with a bronze directional plate. Views extend north to the Stirling Range and east to the Porongurup Range. An elevated concrete lookout offers views South to Albany and south-west toward Denmark. On a clear day, the Albany Wind Farm is easily visible some 50km away. In the summer months, many locals use the hill lookout to assess any risk posed by nearby fires.|$|E
25|$|In addition, on July 9 AAF intelligence, {{with help}} from the FBI, {{secretly}} began an investigation of the best sightings, mostly from pilots and military personnel. Arnold's sighting, {{as well as that of}} the United Airline's crew, were included in the list of best sightings. Three weeks later they came to the conclusion that the saucer reports were not imaginary or adequately explained by natural phenomena; something real was flying around. This laid the groundwork for another intelligence estimate in September 1947 by Gen. Nathan Twining, commanding officer of the Air Materiel Command, which likewise concluded the saucers were real and urged a formal investigation by multiple government agencies. This in turn resulted in the formation of Project <b>Sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1947, the first publicly acknowledged USAF UFO investigation. Project Sign eventually evolved into Project Grudge, and then the better known Project Blue Book.|$|E
25|$|These {{consist of}} a number of {{uncovered}} stands, curved around the northern perimeter of the Main Arena, between the northeast end of the John MacDonald Stand and the Marshalling Yards at the northeast end of the arena. They are of concrete construction (concrete seating tiers supported on concrete piers), with brick or concrete in-fill to the sides. The seating consists of curved, slatted timber benches and is accessed via subways beneath the stands. The sub-floor beneath the northern-most stand provides kiosk space, with metal roller doors between the concrete piers opening to Ring Road. The sub-floor beneath the middle stand is utilised as the Cattleman's Bar. Sections of the seating on the northernmost of these open-air stands have been in-filled recently to provide access for horsemen entering the show ring for special display riding. There is a large <b>sign</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the northern stand, with the lettering: MACHINERY HILL, which can be viewed from all over the show ring.|$|E
