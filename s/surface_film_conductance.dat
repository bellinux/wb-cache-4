Therefore, in such situation the Nu-Re correlations, which are generally used to predict h-values, may not yield realistic results.

The main concern of the present work is about considering the heat transfer behaviour for liquid foods for which a cylindrical shape container of brass metal have taken, in this work the transient Time-Temperature relation is utilized to calculate the value of convection heat transfer coefficient (h) for each measured temperature at the centre of the cylinder (r¬¬o= 0).

Experiments were designed and transient temperature-time variations were recorded at the center and other three equidistant locations during air blast cooling of slab shaped pieces of fresh water fish. A number of pieces from the same lot were cold preserved at 3 ˚C {{for a period of}} 28 days and experiments were repeated daily. Time-temperature records were used to determine thermal diffusivity of each sample using the empirical approach of the first author, reported elsewhere. It was observed that the measured thermal diffusivity increased up to 14 days and then stayed approximately constant up {{to the end of the}} preservation period (28 days). According to the reported literature, it was found that the shelf life of fish preserved at 3 ˚C is 14 days.

In particular, this thesis is concerned with the kinetics of lithium transport through the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> that form on carbon in non-aqueous electrolyte. These <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> have often been described as a solid electrolyte interphase or “SEI”. To investigate the morphology and physical properties of the <b>surface</b> <b>films,</b> in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (ECAFM) was used. The ECAFM experiments showed that the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> are thicker than previously believed. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT), constant current cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were used to investigate the kinetics of charging and discharging of fresh and cycled cells. These experiments showed that the kinetics of a fresh cell are limited by lithium diffusion in the bulk carbon. The kinetics of a cycled cell, however, are slower than that of a fresh cell due to an increased impedance of the <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> A model is proposed to explain how the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> are slowing the kinetics of lithium transport.

We have found striking features in the experimental conductivity which are unexpected from widely used semiclassical free-electron models. Addition of ∼ 1 ML Co to a NiO/Co/Cu surface causes the net <b>film</b> <b>conductance</b> to decrease; the reverse case of Cu on NiO/Co shows a strong positive curvature of the thicknessdependent conductance, indicating a reduction of the conductivity in Cu near the interface with Co. Quantitative agreement is found between the experimental thickness-dependent <b>film</b> <b>conductance</b> and multiband tightbinding model calculations using a single constant parameter for on-site atomic disorder. The experimental data are consistent with strong scattering of conduction electrons in Cu at the interfaces with Co.

Although most of the FFA were immediately released to the medium, some were retained within chylomicrons when FFA-binding sites on albumin were not available. These observations suggest that albumin may have a specific role in the transfer of FFA across the chylomicron <b>surface</b> <b>film.</b> Chylomicrons-LPL assumed many different shapes as they were depleted of triglyceride by the lipolytic action of the enzyme, and total removal of core triglyceride resulted in empty sacks of <b>surface</b> <b>film.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> was visualized in sections of Os 04 -fixed chylomicrons-LPL as a thin electron-opaque line, 25 - 30 A wide, in areas where the underlying electron-opaque core had been replaced by zones of decreased electron opacity, and in folds of <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> extending outward from chylomicrons partially depleted of core lipid.

Using different combinations of subphase vesicles and spread <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> a clear correlation between dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) content and minimum surface tension was observed. Spread phospholipid films containing 50 % DPPC over a subphase containing 50 % DPPC vesicles did not form stable <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> with a low minimum surface tension.

A film-forming additive-derived <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> is formed when PC is used as a solvent because PC does not participate in {{the formation of a}} <b>surface</b> <b>film.</b> A <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> forms at around 1. 2 V through the reductive decomposition of additives, such as vinylene carbonate. The precipitate layer can be removed by repeated scanning over 100 times in contact-mode AFM. The number of AFM scans required to remove the precipitate layer formed in PC-based electrolytes was much higher than that needed for ethylene carbonate-based electrolytes containing additives, even though the former was thinner by about 10 nm. These results indicate that a thin, dense and solid precipitate layer should form in PC-based electrolytes with additives. A very thin surface layer remains on the edge plane after repeated scans by AFM, and is in close contact with it. This remaining surface layer still functions as a protective film in subsequent potential cycles. The thermal stability of the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> at an elevated temperature was also investigated...|$|R
