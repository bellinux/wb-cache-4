60|$|I do {{not mean}} that all mad {{delusions}} are as concrete as this, though some are more concrete. Believing your own body is glass is a more daring denial of reality than believing a tree is a glass lamp {{at the top of}} a pole. But all true delusions have in them this unalterable assertion--that what is not is. The difference between us and the maniac is not about how things look or how things ought to look, but about what they self-evidently are. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> ought to <b>be</b> King; Perkin Warbeck might <b>say</b> that. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> King. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> as wise as Shakespeare; Bernard Shaw might say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Shakespeare. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> divine in the same sense as Christ; Mr. R.J. Campbell would say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Christ. In all cases the difference is a difference about what is there; not a difference touching what should be done about it.|$|R

25|$|Coppola's {{next project}} was Jack, which was {{released}} on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so {{at the age of}} ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, Jack also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film Big, in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for Jack, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.|$|E
25|$|Saṅkrānti (Hindi: सङ्क्रान्ति, meaning Revolution): In {{the first}} 27 verses (first quarter) of the canto, the poet expounds on Saṅkrānti, {{the concept of}} true revolution. It {{is not to be}} {{attained}} by spilling blood, but by spreading a thought. Rarely do people want such a revolution, their egos do not allow it. The narrative then proceeds – after the Puṃsavana and Sīmantonnayana Saṃskāras of Sujātā, one day, late in the night, Kahola is practising Vedic chanting, perfecting his knowledge of what he is to teach his disciples on the following day. Out of fatigue and the four defects of Bhrama, Pramāda, Vipralipsā and Karaṇāpāṭava, Kahola starts erring in all eight types of recitations – Jaṭā, Rekhā, Mālā, Śikhā, Ratha, Dhvaja, Daṇḍa, and Ghana. The child of Sujātā, while still in the womb, thinks about this for some time and then asks his father to stop practising and teaching verses incorrectly, pointing out that the sage is making eight errors in reciting each verse. Kahola is taken aback and asks the child in the womb to stay quiet, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> reciting as per tradition, and forgetfulness is only human. The child replies by saying that the father should throw away the old corpse of so-called tradition and again requests Kahola to learn the Vedas once more from Uddālaka. The enraged Kahola curses the child to be born with all eight limbs crooked. Kahola repents immediately after, but the child (Aṣṭāvakra) takes the curse in his stride, and asks his father not to repent.|$|E
