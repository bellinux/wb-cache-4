Soon afterwards he learns that this second girl, Thomasina Tuckerton, has died. At dinner with a friend, a woman named Poppy Stirling mentions <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Pale Horse that arranges deaths, but is suddenly scared at having mentioned it and will say no more.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, Guth heard colleagues {{discussing}} <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> horizon problem. The {{microwave background}} radiation discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson appeared extremely uniform, {{with almost no}} variance. This seemed very paradoxical because, when the radiation was released about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the observable universe had a diameter of 90 million light-years. There {{was no time for}} one end of the cosmos to communicate with the other end, because energy can not move faster than the speed of light. The paradox was resolved, as Guth soon realized, by the inflation theory. Since inflation started with a far smaller amount of matter than the Big Bang had presupposed, an amount so small that all parts would have been in touch with each other. The universe then inflated at billion times the speed of light so the homogeneity remained unbroken. The universe after inflation would have been very uniform even though the parts were not still in touch with each other.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{out against}} the protesters, President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit Mukherjee argued that the women protesters {{did not appear to}} him to be students, saying, [...] "What's {{basically}} happening in Delhi is a lot like Egypt or elsewhere, where there's <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Pink Revolution, which has very little connection with ground realities. In India, staging candle-lit marches, going to discothèques... I can see many beautiful women among them– highly dented-painted... I have grave doubts whether they're students..." [...] The remark was widely condemned as sexist. His sister Sharmistha said that she and their father the president both disapproved. Then Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan also expressed disapproval. Abhijit quickly withdrew his comment and apologised. [...] Spiritual guru Asaram Bapu also provoked extensive criticism from the public by saying that the victim was also to blame for her own assault because she could have stopped the attack if she had [...] "chanted God's name and fallen {{at the feet of the}} attackers".|$|E

2500|$|Because {{she gained}} {{significant}} diplomatic {{power in the}} early 1770s Catherine considered <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Greek Project". This consisted of pushing the Turks out of Europe but it also carried another more utopian aspect: reclaiming Constantinople from Muslim to Orthodox Christian rule. The Second Turkish War, 1787–1792, ended with Russia gaining the fortress of Ochakov and the Black Sea shore to the Dniester river, and the Ottoman Empire recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea.|$|E
2500|$|In Mulata de tal, Asturias fuses surrealism with {{indigenous}} tradition in <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "great language" [...] ("el gran lengua"). In this Maya tradition, the people bestow magical power to certain words and phrases; {{similar to a}} witch's chant or curse. In his stories, Asturias restores this power to words and lets them speak for themselves: [...] "Los toros toronegros, los toros torobravos, los toros torotumbos, los torostorostoros" [...] ("the bulls bullsblack, the bulls bullsbrave, the bulls bullsshake, the bullsbullsbulls").|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton {{created a}} list of {{possible}} singularities that could form but he was concerned that some singularities might lead to difficulties. He wanted to cut the manifold at the singularities and paste in caps, and then run the Ricci flow again, so he needed to understand the singularities and show that certain kinds of singularities do not occur. [...] Perelman [...] discovered the singularities were all very simple: essentially three-dimensional cylinders made out of spheres stretched out along a line. An ordinary cylinder is made by taking circles stretched along a line. [...] Perelman proved this using <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Reduced Volume" [...] which {{is closely related to}} an eigenvalue of a certain elliptic equation.|$|E
2500|$|By {{at least}} the 8th century BCE the Greeks {{borrowed}} the Phoenician alphabet and adapted it to their own language, creating in the process the first [...] "true" [...] alphabet, in which vowels were accorded equal status with consonants. According to Greek legends transmitted by Herodotus, the alphabet was brought from Phoenicia to Greece by Cadmos. The letters of the Greek alphabet {{are the same as}} those of the Phoenician alphabet, and both alphabets are arranged in the same order. However, whereas separate letters for vowels would have actually hindered the legibility of Egyptian, Phoenician, or Hebrew, their absence was problematic for Greek, where vowels played a much more important role. The Greeks used for vowels some of the Phoenician letters representing consonants which weren't used in Greek speech. All of the names of the letters of the Phoenician alphabet started with consonants, and these consonants were what the letters represented, <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> acrophonic principle.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Cohen responded via {{his regular}} Washington Post column {{published}} on February 6, 2007. Cohen {{noted that he}} has dedicated more than 90 columns to condemning antisemitism since he started as a columnist in 1976, [...] "most of them full-throated condemnations of the hatred that killed fully one-third of all Jews during my lifetime. So it comes as a surprise that has {{the force of a}} mugging to be accused of aiding the very people I so hate – of being an abettor of <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>The</b> New Anti-Semitism." [...] Cohen wrote that the report [...] "has given license to the most intolerant and narrow-minded of Israel's defenders so that, as the AJC concedes in my case, any veering from orthodoxy is met with censure or, from someone like Reinharz, the most powerful of all post-Holocaust condemnations – anti-Semite – is diluted beyond recognition. The offense here is not just to a handful of relatively unimportant writers, but to memory itself." ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{were times}} when Kipps would lie awake, all others in the {{dormitory}} asleep and snoring, and think dismally of the outlook Minton pictured. Dimly he perceived the thing {{that had happened to}} him--how the great, stupid machine of retail trade had caught his life into its wheels, a vast, irresistible force which he had neither strength of will nor knowledge to escape. This was to be his life until his days should end. No adventures, no glory, no change, no freedom. Neither--though the force of that came home to him later--might he dream of effectual love and marriage. And there was a terrible <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "swap," [...] or [...] "the key of the street," [...] and [...] "crib hunting," [...] of which the talk was scanty but sufficient. Night after night he would resolve to enlist, to run away to sea, to set fire to the warehouse, or drown himself; and morning after morning he rose up and hurried downstairs in fear of a sixpenny fine. He would compare his dismal round of servile drudgery with those windy, sunlit days at Littlestone, those windows of happiness shining ever brighter as they receded. The little figure of Ann seemed in all these windows now.|$|E
60|$|In {{these small}} {{isolated}} communities {{it is common}} to find men who have succeeded in rising above the others and in establishing a sort of mastery over them. They are not as a rule much more intelligent than the others who are never able to better themselves; the main difference is that they are harder and more grasping and have more self-control. These qualities tell eventually, and set a man a little apart, a little higher than the others, and he gets the taste of power, which reacts on him like the first taste of blood on the big cat. Henceforward he has his ideal, his definite goal, which is to get the upper hand--to be on top. He may be, and generally is, an exceedingly unpleasant fellow to have for a neighbour--mean, sordid, greedy, tyrannous, even cruel, and he may be generally hated and despised as well, but along with these feelings there will be a kind of shamefaced respect and admiration for his courage in following his own line in defiance of what others think and feel. It is after all with man as with the social animals: he must have a master--not a policeman, or magistrate, or a vague, far-away, impersonal <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> authorities or the government; but a head of the pack or herd, a being like himself whom he knows and sees and hears and feels every day. A real man, dressed in old familiar clothes, a fellow-villager, who, wolf or dog-like, has fought his way to the mastership.|$|E
6000|$|The {{movements}} of the grown-ups, whom Georgie tolerated, but did not pretend to understand, removed his world, when he was seven years old, to a place called [...] "Oxford-on-a-visit. [...] "Here were huge buildings surrounded by vast prairies, with streets of infinite length, and, above all, <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "buttery," [...] which Georgie was dying to see, because he knew it must be greasy, and therefore delightful. He perceived how correct were his judgments when his nurse led him through a stone arch into {{the presence of an}} enormously fat man, who asked him if he would like some, bread and cheese. Georgie was used to eat all round the clock, so he took what [...] "buttery" [...] gave him, and would have taken some brown liquid called [...] "auditale" [...] but that his nurse led him away to an afternoon performance of a thing called [...] "Pepper's Ghost." [...] This was intensely thrilling. People's heads came off and flew all over the stage, and skeletons danced bone by bone, while Mr. Pepper himself, beyond question a man of the worst, waved his arms and flapped a long gown, and in a deep bass voice (Georgie had never heard a man sing before) told of his sorrows unspeakable. Some grown-up or other tried to explain that the illusion was made with mirrors, {{and that there was no}} need to be frightened. Georgie did not know what illusions were, but he did know that a mirror was the looking-glass with the ivory handle on his mother's dressing-table. Therefore the [...] "grown-up" [...] was [...] "just saying things" [...] after the distressing custom of [...] "grown-ups," [...] and Georgie cast about for amusement between scenes. Next to him sat a little girl dressed all in black, her hair combed off her forehead exactly like the girl in the book called [...] "Alice in Wonderland," [...] which had been given him on his last birthday. The little girl looked at Georgie, and Georgie looked at her. There seemed to be no need of any further introduction.|$|E
