50|$|Salted {{versions}} of both fission and fusion weapons {{can be made}} by surrounding the core of the explosive device with a material containing an element that can be converted to a highly radioactive isotope by neutron bombardment. When the bomb explodes, the element absorbs neutrons released by the nuclear reaction, converting it to its radioactive form. The explosion scatters the resulting radioactive material over a wide area, leaving it uninhabitable far longer than an area affected by typical nuclear weapons. In a salted hydrogen bomb, the radiation case around the fusion fuel, which normally is made of some fissionable element, is replaced with a metallic salting element. Salted fission bombs {{can be made by}} replacing the neutron reflector between the fissionable core and the explosive layer with a metallic element. The energy yield from a <b>salted</b> <b>weapon</b> is usually lower than from an ordinary weapon of similar size as a consequence of these changes.|$|E
50|$|The customs {{regulations}} are priceless for documenting trade in Eastern Europe of the 9th and 10th centuries. The document {{makes it clear}} that Raffelstetten was a place where German slave traders and their Slavic counterparts exchanged goods. The Czech and Rus merchants sold wax, slaves, and horses to German merchants. <b>Salt,</b> <b>weapons,</b> and ornaments were sought by slave trading adventurers.|$|R

50|$|Salt Ash is a rural {{suburb of}} the Port Stephens local {{government}} {{areas in the}} Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. It {{is located on the}} main road between Newcastle and Nelson Bay but is largely undeveloped, partly because it is the location of the <b>Salt</b> Ash Air <b>Weapons</b> Range which is used by pilots from RAAF Base Williamtown for training purposes.|$|R

It is studied with using of historical method that emphasizes on oral history. For collecting data and observation purposes, it is equipped with qualitative analysis. The {{results showed that the}} Indonesian salt farmers, especially in Java has a quirk resistance, which tends to be soft, closed, and not frontal, but it continuously takes place in their productive activity daily rhythm. It is taken because they do not have bargaining power with other parties both in economic, social, cultural and political...|$|R
5000|$|Gold {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a material for creating a <b>salted</b> nuclear <b>weapon</b> (cobalt is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of natural 197Au, irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, would transmute into the radioactive isotope 198Au with a half-life of 2.697 days and produce approximately [...]411 MeV of gamma radiation, significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's fallout for several days. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used. Gold {{has been used in}} thermonuclear weapons as radiation mirrors within the secondary assembly. Ivy Mike used a thin layer of gold on the secondary casing walls to enhance the blackbody effect, trapping more energy in the foam to enhance the implosion.|$|R

5000|$|Although the Tupi {{population}} largely disappeared {{because of}} European diseases {{to which they}} had no resistance or because of slavery, a large population of maternal Tupi ancestry occupied much of Brazilian territory, taking the ancient traditions to several points of the country. Darcy Ribeiro wrote that {{the features of the}} first Brazilians were much more Tupi than Portuguese, and even the language that they spoke was a Tupi-based language, named Nheengatu or Língua Geral, a lingua franca in Brazil until the 18th century. The region of São Paulo was the biggest in the proliferation of Mamelucos, who in the 17th century under the name of Bandeirantes, spread throughout the Brazilian territory, from the Amazon rainforest to the extreme South. They were responsible for the major expansion of the Iberian culture in the interior of Brazil. They acculturated the Indian tribes who lived in isolation, and took the language of the colonizer, which was not Portuguese yet, but Nheengatu itself, to the most inhospitable corners of the colony. Interestingly, Nheengatu is still spoken in certain regions of the Amazon, although the Tupi-speaking Indians did not live there. The Nheengatu language, as in other regions of the country, was introduced there by Bandeirantes from São Paulo in the 17th century. The way of life of the Old Paulistas could almost be confused with the Indians. Within the family, only Nheengatu was spoken. Agriculture, hunting, fishing and gathering of fruits were also based on Indian traditions. What differentiated the Tupi from the Old Paulistas was the use of clothes, <b>salt,</b> metal tools, <b>weapons</b> and other European items.When these areas of large Tupi influence started to be integrated into the market economy, Brazilian society gradually started to lose its Tupi characteristics. The Portuguese language became dominant and Língua Geral virtually disappeared. The rustic Indian techniques of production were replaced by European ones, in order to elevate the capacity of exportation. Brazilian Portuguese absorbed many words from Tupi. Some examples of Portuguese words that came from Tupi are: mingau, mirim, soco, cutucar, tiquinho, perereca, tatu. The names of several local fauna [...] - [...] such as arara ("macaw"), jacaré ("South American alligator"), tucano ("toucan") [...] - [...] and flora [...] - [...] e.g. mandioca ("manioc") and abacaxi ("pineapple") [...] - [...] are also derived from the Tupi language. A number of places and cities in modern Brazil are named in Tupi (Itaquaquecetuba, Pindamonhangaba, Caruaru, Ipanema). Anthroponyms include Ubirajara, Ubiratã, Moema, Jussara, Jurema, Janaína. Tupi surnames do exist, but they do not imply any real Tupi ancestry; rather they were adopted as a manner to display Brazilian nationalism.|$|R
