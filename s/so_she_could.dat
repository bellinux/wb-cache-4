5|$|After Liliʻuokalani {{was imprisoned}} in the ʻIolani Palace, she was denied {{literature}} and newspapers, essentially cutting her {{off from her}} people. However, she was not forbidden from having a paper and pencil, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> continue to compose music {{while she was in}} confinement.|$|E
5|$|Darren Osborne {{was born}} {{as the result}} of an affair between Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna) and Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth). Sandy, married to Alan Roscoe at the time, was forced into giving Darren up by her husband, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> save her marriage.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, the Air Force {{appointed}} McKenzie as {{an honorary}} flight {{officer of the}} Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> legitimately instruct Air Force personnel. This was the only official recognition McKenzie received during the war for her efforts.|$|E
50|$|After the Xavier Institute becomes public, Gail {{sends her}} there, {{and moves to}} Salem Center to stay near her, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have one person whose {{reactions}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> trust. Although <b>she</b> insists that Laurie live at the school, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make friends, Laurie remains a loner and goes through several roommates in quick succession.|$|R
60|$|The doctor {{stepped around}} <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see him, and nodded.|$|R
50|$|His {{ship would}} be fast, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> choose her point of attack.|$|R
5|$|She {{lived in}} the United States from 2006 to 2008, {{with the goal of}} {{improving}} the quality of her water polo play <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> qualify for the Olympics. In late 2010, she injured her arm and it took time to recover.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{criminal}} charges were threatened against Robinson in Cleveland, {{up to and}} including murder, though none actually materialized. After learning of Doyle's intentions of using the bout's money to buy his mother a house, Robinson gave Doyle's mother the money from his next four bouts <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> purchase herself a home, fulfilling her son's intention.|$|E
5|$|At age 15, {{with her}} parents' approval, she filed for {{emancipation}} from them, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> better pursue her acting career with less interference from child labor work laws. After completing ninth grade at Santa Fe Christian Schools, in Solana Beach, California, she left school because of severe bullying. Subsequently, Williams was home-tutored {{by her father}} and later graduated with a GED from a correspondence school.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed and}} drew him down <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> whisper in his ear.|$|R
5000|$|The Controller gave White Fang a {{new suit}} <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> kill the Hood.|$|R
60|$|She laughed, {{and moved}} her parasol a little <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see him better.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in childhood, Crawford's {{ambition}} {{was to be}} a dancer. One day, however, in {{an attempt}} to escape piano lessons <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play with friends, she leapt from the front porch of her home and cut her foot severely on a broken milk bottle. As a result, she experienced three surgeries to repair the damage. She was unable to attend elementary school or continue with dancing lessons for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for her age group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business.|$|E
5|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Alex Field taught Alicia Silverstone to ride {{a motorcycle}} <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play Batgirl.|$|R
60|$|When they rose, {{her feet}} were <b>so</b> numbed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly stand. <b>She</b> clung to Siegmund, laughing.|$|R
50|$|So much <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not speak, recall her past, and get {{to terms}} with the present.|$|R
5|$|Nevada was refloated on 12 February 1942 and {{underwent}} temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get to Puget Sound Navy Yard for a {{major overhaul}} and modernization. This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance so she slightly resembled a South Dakota from a distance. Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. Nevada then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11–18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu.|$|E
5|$|The only test {{in battle}} for Dunkerque {{came in the}} attack on Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July. The British Force H, {{commanded}} by Admiral Somerville and centered on HMS Hood and the battleships , and , arrived off Mers-el-Kébir to coerce the French battleship squadron to join the British cause or scuttle their ships. The French Navy refused, as complying with the demand would have violated the Armistice signed with Germany. To ensure the ships would not fall into Axis hands, the British warships opened fire. Dunkerque was tied alongside the mole with her stern facing the sea, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not return fire.|$|E
5|$|Todd {{discovers that}} the beggar woman {{was his wife}} Lucy, whom he {{believed}} to be dead, and that Mrs. Lovett deliberately misled him <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have him to herself. Todd pretends to forgive her and dances with her before hurling her into the bakehouse oven, then cradles Lucy's dead body in his arms. Toby appears, enraged at Mrs. Lovett's death, and Todd allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor. Toby leaves as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.|$|E
25|$|In late 1794, Admiral Jervis {{signed a}} {{safe-conduct}} pass for Prevoyante <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> repatriate British prisoners of war.|$|R
60|$|With the {{relaxing}} of {{her fingers}} she eased him from her <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> look {{from one to the}} other.|$|R
50|$|Her {{maternal}} grandfather {{convinced her}} to take initiation under the Jain Sadhvi Sumati Kuwar <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> study and help others.|$|R
5|$|Tolman and Conant, {{in their}} role as the project's {{scientific}} advisers, drew {{up a list of}} candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists already working on the project. Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Haiko, {{the family moved to}} a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and the heir to the dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do was {{to accept}} the hopeless task set her, and make her guesses and abide by the result.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} held a strip <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{only just}} see 'Dolores M. Mohun,' and she unhesitatingly answered 'Yes'--very much surprised.|$|R
60|$|The {{daughter}} {{then made}} the oven {{as hot as}} could be, and took Esben out of his prison in order to roast him. She brought the oven spade, and told Esben to seat himself on it, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> shoot him into the oven. Esben accordingly took his seat on it, but when she had got him {{to the mouth of}} the oven he spread his legs out wide, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not get him pushed in.|$|R
5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour {{and they wanted to}} know the location of a large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
60|$|He sounded <b>so</b> indifferent, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} {{refrain from}} crying. She went {{and stood in}} front of him, looking down on him heavily.|$|R
50|$|Actor Emmanuelle Béart practised violin for {{at least}} a year before the film began shooting, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> convincingly mime the {{performance}} sequences.|$|R
50|$|Nicoletta's mother. A sought-after divorce {{lawyer in}} Rome. She left Nicoletta with her {{grandmother}} {{at a young age}} <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get re-married.|$|R
