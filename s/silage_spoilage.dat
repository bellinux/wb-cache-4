40|$|Lactobacillus buchneri strain NRRL B- 30929 was a {{contaminant}} {{obtained from}} a commercial ethanol fer-mentation. This facultative anaerobe is unique because of its rapid growth on xylose and simultaneous fermentation of xylose and glucose. The strain utilizes {{a broad range of}} carbohydrate substrates and possesses a high tolerance to ethanol and other stresses, making it an attractive candidate for bioconversion of biomass substrates to various bioproducts. The genome sequence of NRRL B- 30929 will provide insight into the unique properties of this lactic acid bacterium. Lactobacillus buchneri is a heterofermentative, facultative anaerobe that belongs to the lactic acid bacteria. Strains of L. buchneri have been described as having diverse activities, rang-ing from prevention of <b>silage</b> <b>spoilage</b> by yeasts and molds (1, 2, 10) to histamine production in Swiss cheese (9). Several strains have been reported to metabolize lactate to produce 1, 2 -propanediol (5, 7) and to produce 1, 3 -propanediol from glycerol (8, 11, 12). A sauerkraut isolate of L. buchneri was found to produce an antibacterial peptide that inhibited th...|$|E
40|$|The yeast Williopsis mrakii {{produces}} a mycocin or yeast killer toxin designated HMK; this toxin exhibits high thermal stability, high pH stability, {{and a broad}} spectrum of activity against other yeasts. We describe construction of a synthetic gene for mycocin HMK and heterologous expression of this toxin in Aspergillus niger. Mycocin HMK was fused to a glucoamylase protein carrier, which resulted in secretion of biologically active mycocin into the culture media. A partial purification protocol was developed, and a comparison with native W. mrakii mycocin showed that the heterologously expressed mycocin had similar physiological properties and an almost identical spectrum of biological activity against a number of yeasts isolated from silage and yoghurt. Two food and feed production systems prone to yeast spoilage were used as models to assess the ability of mycocin HMK to act as a biocontrol agent. The onset of aerobic spoilage in mature maize silage was delayed by application of A. niger mycocin HMK on opening because the toxin inhibited growth of the indigenous spoilage yeasts. This helped maintain both higher lactic acid levels and a lower pH. In yoghurt spiked with dairy spoilage yeasts, A. niger mycocin HMK was active at all of the storage temperatures tested at which yeast growth occurred, and there was no resurgence of resistant yeasts. The higher the yeast growth rate, the more effective the killing action of the mycocin. Thus, mycocin HMK has potential applications in controlling both <b>silage</b> <b>spoilage</b> and yoghurt spoilage caused by yeasts...|$|E

Metagenomics is defined as the direct analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) purified from environmental samples and enables taxonomic identification of the microbial communities present within them. Two main metagenomic approaches exist; sequencing the 16 S rRNA gene coding region, which exhibits sufficient variation between taxa for identification, and shotgun sequencing, in which genomes of the organisms that are present in the sample are analyzed and ascribed to "operational taxonomic units"; species, genera or families depending on the extent of sequencing coverage. In this study, shotgun sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community present in cattle silage and, coupled with a range of bioinformatics tools to quality check and filter the DNA sequence reads, perform taxonomic classification of the microbial populations present within the sampled silage, and achieve functional annotation of the sequences. These methods were employed to identify potentially harmful bacteria that existed within the silage, an indication of <b>silage</b> <b>spoilage.</b> If spoiled silage is not remediated, then upon ingestion it could be potentially fatal to the livestock.

40|$|The top 3 {{feet from}} 30 {{horizontal}} silos was sampled at three depths to determine top spoilage losses, using ash content as an internal marker. When compared to face samples, corn and forage sorghum silages exhibited similar additional organic matter (OM) {{losses in the}} top 18 inches. In the top 18 inches, covering <b>silage</b> reduced <b>spoilage</b> losses of OM from 41 to 27 percentage units compared to uncovered counterparts. Covering corn <b>silage</b> reduced <b>spoilage</b> losses of OM from 49 to 31 and 9 to 1 percentage units in the top and second 18 inches, respectively. Similar reductions in OM losses from covering were observed in the forage sorghum <b>silages.</b> Although <b>spoilage</b> losses observed in covered silages appear high, covering silage stored in horizontal silos greatly reduced the estimated storage losses in the top 3 feet...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Bag silos made {{at three}} {{research}} farms in 2000 and 2001 were monitored at filling and emptying to determine densities and losses. A total of 47 bags (23 alfalfa, 1 red clover, 23 whole−plant corn) were made, and losses were calculated on 39 of the silos. Dry matter (DM) density ranged from 160 to 270 kg/m 3. Dry matter density increased with DM content in hay crop silages on average 2. 9 kg/m 3 − % DM, whereas the effect in corn silage varied by bagging machine. Density decreased with increasing particle size at 4. 1 kg DM/m 3 per mm. The operator and the bagging machine setup both affected density. A wide range (0 % to 40 %) of DM losses was observed. Average DM losses were 9. 2 % invisible plus uncollected losses and 5. 4 % spoilage losses, {{for a total}} loss of 14. 6 %. Six silos had excessive spoilage losses of more than 15 % and total losses above 25 % due to plastic integrity issues or overly dry silage (> 40 % DM) being fed out in warm weather. Invisible losses were reduced in high−porosity <b>silages</b> (where <b>spoilage</b> losses were exacerbated), greater in warm weather, and affected by emptying procedures. Spoilage losses in bags without plastic integrity issues were greater in dry silages, from emptying silos in warm weather, at lower feed−out rates, in bags stored for a long time, and if bags were emptied periodically rather than daily...|$|R

The focus was on the influence of crop maturity, silage additives and laceration on the quality of whole-crop cereals silages. The ensilability of whole-crop cereals was highly dependent upon the stage of maturity. An important factor related to the stage of maturity and influencing the ensilability of wholecrop cereals seems to be the concentration of WSC in the fresh forage. Ensiling at the milk stage was found to be a more suitable time to harvest whole-crop cereals since there is a sufficient concentration of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) that provides the conditions for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to rapidly dominate the silage microflora and produce enough acids to reduce pH thereby giving a better protection of the <b>silage</b> against the <b>spoilage</b> microflora. The low WSC concentration of whole-crop cereals at dough stage seems to restrain good fermentation. However, silages harvested at the milk stage still appear to have a low aerobic stability.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, 20 {{different}} isolates of {{lactic acid}} bacteria (LAB) were physicochemically screened for the ability to grow at low pH and produce lactic acid. The best isolates were selected for fermentation of Panicum maximum {{in order to produce}} silage. The grass was harvested at 6 weeks re-growth and ensiled at 15, 30, 45 and 60 days. Samples were taken on each of these days for microbial changes, physical and chemical composition and acceptability by ruminants. Afterwards, silage was exposed to air at 45 and 60 days of ensiling and its effects on microbial succession were determined. Lactobacillus plantarum produced the highest concentration of lactic acid (18. 72) in MRS broth and has the highest optical density of 0. 949 when grown at pH 2 was selected. The LAB count in the inoculated silage increased to 10. 26 log cfu/g on day 45 and 10. 87 cfu/g on day 60 compared to an increase of 8. 46 log cfu/g and 7. 48 log cfu/g respectively on the same day for the uninoculated <b>silage.</b> <b>Spoilage</b> organisms like yeast decreased to 2. 94 log cfu/g and 2. 97 log cfu/g on days 45 and 60 respectively in the inoculated silage. The pH of the inoculated silage decreased to 3. 97 within the first 30 days of ensiling and the crude protein content increased to 9. 84 by the end of day 60. The NDF content of the inoculated silage also decreased to 55. 00 on day 15 while that of the control had a value of 63. 00 on this same day. When exposed to air on day 45, the inoculated silage was less stable having an increase of spoilage bacteria like mould from 2. 04 log cfu/g on day 1 to 3. 97 log cfu/g by day 2. The uninoculated silage was mor...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate factors to improve the silage quality {{of different types of}} forage crops. The focus was on the influence of crop maturity, silage additives and laceration on the quality of whole-crop cereals silages. The ensilability of whole-crop cereals was highly dependent upon the stage of maturity. An important factor related to the stage of maturity and influencing the ensilability of whole-crop cereals seems to be the concentration of WSC in the fresh forage. Ensiling at the milk stage was found to be a more suitable time to harvest whole-crop cereals since there is a sufficient concentration of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) that provides the conditions for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to rapidly dominate the silage microflora and produce enough acids to reduce pH thereby giving a better protection of the <b>silage</b> against the <b>spoilage</b> microflora. The low WSC concentration of whole-crop cereals at dough stage seems to restrain good fermentation. However, silages harvested at the milk stage still appear to have a low aerobic stability. Precision chopping had variable affects on silage fermentation and showed that laceration is not a guarantee of a good silage quality of whole-crop cereals. At the milk stage, precision chopping improved the silage fermentation, whereas the dough-stage silages tended to give clostridial fermentation resulting in poor quality and high DM losses. Precision chopping promoted a higher silage density at the milk stage and resulted in reduced DM losses at the dough stage. Application of silage additives was {{the most important factor in}} improving silage quality. A mixture of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, hexamine and sodium nitrite seems to be the most suitable additive to secure the silage quality and improve the aerobic stability in whole-crop cereals as well as in moderate and highly -wilted clover-grass forages. No remaining toxic residues of the nitrite concentration were found in the silages. A similar influence on the ensiling process is found when using the combination of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate and propionic acid. The results of mixtures of formic acid and propionic acid were closely related to the chop length of the forage. These additive combinations seem to improve the silage quality and storage stability in precision-chopped silages at both maturities, while the quality of long-cut treated silages often appeared to be low. The variable efficiency of inoculation of whole crop cereals with LAB seems to be associated with types and numbers of epiphytic bacteria in the herbage. The inoculation of homofermentative LAB successfully reduced pH of both precision-chopped and long cut-silages but abundant production of lactic acid did not secure the aerobic stability of thes...|$|R
