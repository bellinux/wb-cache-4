50|$|The DFS 228 was {{designed}} by Felix Kracht and a first prototype was completed in March 1944 and was undergoing gliding tests by August, carried aloft piggyback, strut-mounted atop a Dornier Do 217. The aircraft was of conventional sailplane design, with long, slender wings, and intended to land on a retractable <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> on its belly. The nose of the aircraft could be separated in an emergency, and formed a self-contained, pressurised escape capsule for the pilot. Because of problems with the cabin pressurisation system, the second prototype accommodated the pilot in a prone position.|$|R
50|$|The V.1's {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, {{with the}} engine partially enclosed by a helmet shaped cowling open at the bottom.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the special}} {{physical}} properties of shale gas reservoirs, {{it is necessary to}} adopt unconventional and standardized technologies for its surface engineering construction. In addition, the surface engineering design of shale gas reservoirs in China faces many difficulties, such as high uncertainty of the gathering and transportation scale, poor adaptability of pipe network and station layout, difficult matching of the process equipments, and boosting production at the late stage. In view of these problems, the surface engineering construction of shale gas reservoirs should follow the principles of “standardized design, modularized construction and <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> equipment”. In this paper, standardized surface engineering design technologies for shale gas reservoirs were developed with the “standardized well station layout, universal process, modular function zoning, <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> equipment selection, intensive site design, digitized production management” as the core, after literature analysis and technology exploration were carried out. Then its application background and surface technology route were discussed with a typical shale gas field in Sichuan–Chongqing area as an example. Its surface gathering system was designed in a standardized way, including standardized process, the modularized gathering and transportation station, serialized dehydration unit and intensive layout, and remarkable effects were achieved. A flexible, practical and reliable ground production system was built, and a series of standardized technology and modularized design were completed, including cluster well platform, set station, supporting projects. In this way, a system applicable to domestic shale gas surface engineering construction is developed...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 69 Under extreme conditions, pumps may be {{required}} to withstand severe nozzle loads, which often exceed the API 610 specified values. To meet these requirements, pump mechanical behavior versus nozzle loads must be examined in detail. Others have discussed shaft end displacement of centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> under nozzle loads. However, the subject of stresses on the pedestal bolts and casing is a critical area that must also be analyzed. An in-depth study was made on the deformation and stress analysis of centerline <b>mounted</b> end suction <b>pumps,</b> whose stiffness were relatively low and were frequently required to withstand rather high nozzle loads. The nozzle load analysis consisted of deformation and stress measurements, combined with finite element calculation. The analysis resulted in a versatile empirical formula for end suction, centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> {{that can be used to}} estimate the shaft end displacement, pedestal bolt stress and casing stress for arbitrary nozzle loads. This allows the determination of whether or not specified nozzle loading conditions can be tolerated by a given pump and pump support design...|$|R

30|$|In {{drilling}} field, {{especially the}} offshore drilling platform, thermal desorption disposal of oily cuttings should be efficient and relatively smaller footprint of equipment.

The <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> pilot experimental installations have been built up by electromagnetic induction heating, and materials continuous conveying based on double screws conveying apparatus. The processing capacity of the TDU is about 250 L/h, and experiments were carried out and key process parameters were studied.|$|R

50|$|The EF 009 was {{designed}} as a point defense interceptor, to be positioned around vital locations then launched when they were in trouble. The plane was to be powered by ten jet engines clustered around its nose and was expected to sustain flight for six minutes. It would then land unpowered on a central <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the front of the}} plane. To cope with g-forces during takeoff, the pilot would lie in a prone position. Takeoff would most likely be from a specially-designed cart, or vertically like a rocket. Armament was to consist of two MG 151/20 20 mm cannons or two MK 108 30 mm cannon. Aircraft design advances made this project obsolete almost before the plans were even complete.|$|R

Neither rear control surface was balanced. Like the tailplane, fin was also narrow but the fabric covered rudder was broad, with a curved edge that reached down to the keel, protected by an integral tail bumper. The main landing gear was a wooden <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> on rubber shock absorbers. The pilot sat at the wing leading edge under a protuberant, multipiece glazed canopy of teardop form.|$|R
