50|$|Most {{military}} {{combat aircraft}} have an {{angle of attack}} indicator among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the <b>stall</b> <b>point</b> the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a stall warning indicator or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).|$|E
50|$|More common {{solutions}} to the problem of spanwise flow is the use of a wing fence or the related dogtooth notch on {{the leading edge of the}} wing. This disrupts the flow and re-directs it rearward, while also causing the buildup of stagnant air inboard to lower the <b>stall</b> <b>point.</b> This does have an effect on overall airflow on the wing, and is generally not used where the sweep is mild.|$|E
50|$|With other {{parameters}} remaining the same, as the lift {{generated by a}} body increases, so does the lift-induced drag. This means that as the wing's angle of attack increases the lift coefficient increases (up to a limit called the <b>stall</b> <b>point)</b> so too does the lift-induced drag. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of parasite drag, increases due {{to the formation of}} turbulent unattached flow {{on the surface of the}} body.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} an aileron {{displacement}} {{on the distribution}} of the lift along the span is computed for an elliptic wing of aspect ratio 6 for three conditions. The lift distribution caused by the aileron displacement is uniform and extends normally beyond the inner end of the ailerons. Hence, the displacement of an aileron with constant chord length may bring about passing the <b>stalling</b> <b>point</b> of the adjacent wing sections, if these were near this point before. Hence, such ailerons can become ineffective at low speeds. Tapering the aileron towards the inside suggests itself as a remedy...|$|R

50|$|In takeoff {{and landing}} {{operations}} from short runways, such as Naval Aircraft Carrier operations and STOL back country flying, aircraft may {{be equipped with}} angle of attack or Lift Reserve Indicators. These indicators measure the angle of attack (AOA) or the Potential of Wing Lift (POWL, or Lift Reserve) directly and help the pilot fly close to the <b>stalling</b> <b>point</b> with greater precision. STOL operations require the aircraft {{to be able to}} operate close to the critical angle of attack during landings and at the best angle of climb during takeoffs. Angle of attack indicators are used by pilots for maximum performance during these maneuvers since airspeed information is only indirectly related to stall behaviour.|$|R
50|$|On {{a modern}} fighter {{aircraft}} LERX induce controlled airflow over the wing at high angles of attack, so delaying the stall and consequent loss of lift. In cruising flight {{the effect of}} the LERX is minimal. However at high angles of attack, as often encountered in a dog fight or during takeoff and landing, the LERX generates a high-speed vortex that attaches {{to the top of the}} wing. The vortex action maintains a smooth airflow over the wing surface well past the normal <b>stall</b> <b>point</b> at which the airflow would otherwise break up, thus sustaining lift at very high angles.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} motion helps {{smooth out}} the relative airspeed seen by the blade. Since {{the effects of the}} forward motion of the helicopter are reduced, or even eliminated at lower speeds, the rotor can be spun at a high speed without fear of reaching the wave drag regime. At the same time, the speed of the retreating blade never approaches the <b>stall</b> <b>point.</b> Likewise, changes in drag are even more reduced, {{to the point of being}} negligible. This allows the Derschmidt rotor to be a rigid design, eliminating the complex series of bearings, flexible fittings and linkages used in conventional rotors.|$|E
50|$|Wing fences delay, or eliminate, {{this effect}} by {{preventing}} the spanwise flow from moving too far along the wing and gaining speed. When meeting the fence, {{the air is}} directed back over the wing surface. Similar solutions included a notch in the leading edge, as seen on the Avro Arrow, {{or the use of}} slats, as on the earlier versions of the F-86. Slats can act as fences directly, in the form of their actuators, but also reduce the problem by improving the angle of attack response of the wing and moving the <b>stall</b> <b>point</b> to a lower speed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{introduction}} of swept wings {{took place during}} a move to more highly tapered designs as well. Although it had long been known that an elliptical planform is [...] "perfect" [...] from an induced drag standpoint, it was also noticed that a linear taper of the wing had much the same effect, while being lighter. Research during the war led to widespread use of taper, especially in the post-war era. However, it had been noticed early on that such designs had unfavourable stall characteristics; as the tips were more highly loaded in high angles of attack, they operated closer to their <b>stall</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{lift and}} drag curve {{obtained}} in wind tunnel testing is {{shown on the}} right. The curve represents an airfoil with a positive camber so some lift is produced at zero angle of attack. With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called {{the slope of the}} lift curve. At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The drop in lift {{can be explained by the}} action of the upper-surface boundary layer, which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle. The thickened boundary layer's displacement thickness changes the airfoil's effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective camber, which modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the circulation and the lift. The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in pressure drag, so that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the <b>stall</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{stall warning}} system {{utilizes}} a stall warning vane {{on each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a stall warning bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above stall, the stall warning energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the <b>stall</b> <b>point,</b> the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the stall warning system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|E
40|$|Loss-of-Control (LOC) is a {{major factor}} in fatal {{aircraft}} accidents. Although defi-nitions of LOC remain vague in analytical terms, it is generally associated with flight outside of the normal flight envelope, with nonlinear influences, and with a significantly diminished capability of the pilot to control the aircraft. Primary sources of nonlin-earity are the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft and the state and control constraints within which the aircraft must operate. This paper examines how these nonlinearities affect the ability to control the aircraft and how they may contribute to loss-of-control. Specifically, the ability to regulate an aircraft around <b>stall</b> <b>points</b> is considered, as is the question of how damage to control effectors impacts the capability to remain within an acceptable envelope and to maneuver within it.

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} applications of haptic technology was in large aircraft that use servomechanism systems to operate control surfaces. [...] Such systems tend to be [...] "one-way", meaning external forces applied aerodynamically to the control surfaces are not perceived at the controls. Here, the missing normal forces are simulated with springs and weights. In lighter aircraft without servo systems, as the aircraft approached a stall the aerodynamic buffeting (vibrations) was felt in the pilot's controls. This was a useful warning of a dangerous flight condition. This control shake is not felt when servo control systems are used. To replace this missing sensory cue, the angle of attack is measured and when it approaches the critical <b>stall</b> <b>point,</b> a stick shaker is engaged which simulates the response of a simpler control system. Alternatively, the servo force may be measured and the signal directed to a servo system on the control, known as force feedback. Force feedback has been implemented experimentally in some excavators and is useful when excavating mixed material such as large rocks embedded in silt or clay. It allows the operator to [...] "feel" [...] and work around unseen obstacles, enabling significant increases in productivity and less risk of damage to the machine.|$|E

The methodology is based on two-dimensional blade element calculations and a streamline curvature procedure to calculate the axisymmetric flow, although it can be extended to use three-dimensional calculations where available. The methodology is demonstrated by assembling the body force database and using it for a stability calculation. The connection between the stall onset behavior and the body forces near and below the <b>stall</b> <b>point</b> is established through a sensitivity assessment of the radial and axial distribution of the body forces. Comparisons are made with stall onset data obtained in a single stage axial compressor.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} unsteady CFD code called CSTALL {{has been}} developed and used to investigate compressor stability. The code solved the Euler equations through the entire annulus and all blade rows. Blade row turning, losses, and deviation were modeled using body force terms which required input data at stations between blade rows. The input data was calculated using a separate Navier-Stokes turbomachinery analysis code run at one operating <b>point</b> near <b>stall,</b> and was scaled to other operating points using overall characteristic maps. No information about the stalled characteristic was used.

Differential access to managerial jobs is one of inequality’s linchpins, as these positions secure higher average wages and other rewards for their incumbents than do other jobs. Besides spawning an expansive academic literature, the question of access to managerial jobs for pro-tected groups has also been the focus of count-less gender and race discrimination lawsuits, has formed the basis of numerous government reports (e. g., U.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} an {{axial compressor}} body force representation constructed from 3 D CFD calculations. The radial distribution of body forces {{is compared to}} that of a body force representation based on axisymmetric streamline curvature (SLC) calculations, and shown to be in qualitative agreement except {{in the vicinity of the}} blade tip. In terms of stall inception type and <b>stall</b> <b>point,</b> computations based on both representations exhibit agreement with rig test data. A parametric study is undertaken in which the magnitude of the forces in the blade tip region of both representations is reduced so as to obtain reductions in compressor pressure rise similar to those observed experimentally due to increased tip clearance. It is shown that on a back-to-back basis, a given change to the end wall forces produces similar effects on the computed <b>stall</b> <b>point,</b> whether the underlying body force representation derives from 3 D CFD or SLC. Based on this result one route to capturing effects of tip clearance on stall prediction can be the development of a tip clearance body force model for use in conjunction with SLC calculations. by Jonathan Kerner.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Navy's concern with steam-induced jet engine stall {{has become more}} pertinent {{with the introduction of}} the F- 35 C. During take offs on aircraft carriers, steam from aging catapult systems can potentially seep onto the flight deck. When ingested into jet engines, this steam may increase the engines' susceptibility to stall. The serpentine air inlet ducts and single engine of the F- 35 C could make it especially vulnerable to this steam-induced stall during takeoff. To better understand and predict steam-induced stall, this study created a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of steam-induced stall on a single blade passage of a compressor rotor. A single blade passage of the transonic Sanger rotor was generated using computer modeling software. This model was then used in the ANSYS CFX computational fluid dynamics program to simulate steady-state and steam ingestion operations at 95 % and 100 % rotor design speeds. These CFD simulations generated compressor maps and throttle and steam-induced <b>stall</b> <b>points.</b> The CFD results were then compared to results from throttle-induced stall and steam-induced stall experiments conducted on the Sanger rotor in the transonic compressor rig.
