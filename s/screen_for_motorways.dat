With this goal, a pilot project of network <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> Italian <b>motorways</b> using HSM is presented. The more appropriate HSM procedures are selected and calibrated taking into account Italian national factors. Results are evaluated using as comparison Safety Performance Functions (SPF), developed directly with data for the specific Italian road infrastructure, which is assumed to provide more reliable estimates than HSM calibration...|$|R

The appearance of L road-numbers on signposts only began in 2006, along with European route numbers on some major roads. Roads in Northern Ireland are signed with M (<b>for</b> <b>motorways),</b> A (<b>for</b> A-class roads) and B (for B-class roads). There are also C-class roads in Northern Ireland but these road-numbers are not currently shown on signposts.|$|R

40|$|There are no {{detailed}} specifications for work zone (WZ) traffic control plan in Pakistan whereas MUTCD in the US provides for very detailed traffic control plans for WZs. Pakistan needs {{to develop its}} specifications by adopting in-practice standards to its conditions. This study aims at analysis of comfort level with reduction in taper length in Pakistani WZ conditions. A web based survey was conducted with 108 participants to assess drivers’ comfort level if taper length is reduced on motorways and highways by 0 %, 10 %, 29 %, 30 % and 40 %. It focused on people having driving experience in Pakistan and US. It was concluded that age was a significant factor for 20 % and 30 % reduction in the taper length <b>for</b> <b>motorways</b> and <b>for</b> 10 % reduction for highways. Driving experience in Pakistan was a significant factor for 30 % and 40 % reduction <b>for</b> <b>motorways</b> but not <b>for</b> highways. People from higher age groups and people having Pakistani driving experience of more than 10 years were over represented in uncomfortable category. Province of residence in Pakistan was a significant factor for 10 % and 20 % reduction on taper length on <b>motorways</b> and <b>for</b> 20 % and 40 % reductions on the highways. State of residence and driving experience in the US were not significant factors. For reductions up to 20 %, majority of drivers was either in “comfortable category” or in “neither comfortable nor uncomfortable category”. However, for 30 % reduction majority was in “uncomfortable category”. Average comfort level <b>for</b> respondents on <b>motorways</b> is greater than that on highways for reduction up to 30 %. A 20 % reduction in taper length brings the average comfort level to 3. 108 <b>for</b> <b>motorways</b> and 2. 891 for highways, whereas a value of 3 indicates “neither comfortable nor uncomfortable”. A 30 % reduction in taper length brings the average comfort level to 2. 439 <b>for</b> <b>motorways</b> and 2. 241 for highways. Finally, a reduction of 25 % in taper length is recommended <b>for</b> <b>motorways</b> and highways and it is suggested to study this recommendation in Pakistani work zones at those sites where the safety of motorist is not compromised...|$|R
