5|$|One of SSI's first grants {{funded the}} {{development}} of the mass driver, a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974. Mass drivers are based on the coilgun design, adapted to accelerate a non-magnetic object. One application O'Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined from the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, Henry H. Kolm, and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype. The eight-foot (2.5m) long prototype could apply 33g (320m/s2) of acceleration to an object inserted into it. With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800g (18,000m/s2), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160m) long could launch material off the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gameplay itself {{requires}} Jetman {{to locate}} and destroy a series of alien bases on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> Each new base appears with {{the destruction of the}} previous one. To accomplish this task, Jetman must take the bomb to the alien base—either in his space suit or using the rover—and then fly over the base and drop the bomb. After several bases have been destroyed in succession, new and increasingly hazardous varieties of flying aliens assault the player. Each base must be destroyed within a strict time limit. If this limit expires before the base is destroyed, two missiles are launched from the base—one for Earth, the other for Jetman's rover. The player will be given a limited time to intercept and destroy the missiles whilst still in flight, thus preventing a game over.|$|E

5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, {{but it may be}} related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a vector graphics system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar lander specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed the lander. The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most relevant}} astronaut assistant activities on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and Mars and, furthermore, the robotic technology development requirements to implement these activities with a centaur-like outdoor service robot, called the WorkPartner.

5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere.

25|$|In a {{different}} gravitational field, for example, on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> an object {{can have a}} significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is only about one-sixth as strong as {{on the surface of}} the Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an extrinsic property of the object) but the downward force due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 pounds weighs only about 30 pounds-force when visiting the Moon.|$|E

Prior to that the only available means of exploration had been observation from Earth. The invention of the optical telescope brought about the first leap in the quality of lunar observations.

25|$|M3 {{detected}} absorption features near 2.8–3.0µm on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> For silicate bodies, such {{features are}} typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing materials. On the Moon, the feature {{is seen as}} a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with neutron spectrometer H abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of OH and H2O is an ongoing surficial process. OH/H2O production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.|$|E
25|$|These craters {{appear in}} a {{continuum}} of diameters across the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> {{ranging in size from}} tiny pits to the immense South Pole–Aitken basin with a diameter of nearly 2,500km and a depth of 13km. In a very general sense, the lunar history of impact cratering follows a trend of decreasing crater size with time. In particular, the largest impact basins were formed during the early periods, and these were successively overlaid by smaller craters. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of crater diameters on a given surface (that is, the number of craters as a function of diameter) approximately follows a power law with increasing number of craters with decreasing crater size. The vertical position of this curve can be used to estimate the age of the surface.|$|E
