50|$|The car also {{featured}} a new carbon bodyshell, {{as well as}} a new shaped front wing, hollowed sidepods and multiple <b>side</b> <b>deflectors</b> designed to improve aerodynamic performance. However, several areas of the car, including the gearbox, rear suspension and carbon brakes, remained the same in order to keep costs under control.|$|E
5000|$|... "A body {{design that}} makes this {{magnificent}} seven-seater even more than ever like a £1,000 car. Its streamline front, waistline moulding and petrol tank housing, all new, enhance its superb lines". Syncromesh {{was added to the}} gearbox in mid 1933. Other minor improvements included: illuminated semaphore direction indicators, <b>side</b> <b>deflectors</b> for the front door windows and an interior visor, a lockable metal spare wheel cover.|$|E
50|$|The Adiva has an {{innovative}} folding metal roof, which {{together with the}} windscreen and <b>side</b> wind <b>deflectors</b> offers excellent weather protection for rider and pillion passenger.|$|R
50|$|On 8 November 2008 {{preserved}} sister loco No. 70013 (BR standard class 7 70013 Oliver Cromwell) {{was temporarily}} re-numbered as 70048, {{and carried the}} original 'Territorial Army 1908-1958' nameplate on the right hand <b>side</b> smoke <b>deflector.</b> This was carried out {{as part of a}} ceremony to temporarily rename the loco 'Territorial Army 1908-2008' as part of the 100th anniversary of the Territorial Army. The new name was carried on the left hand <b>side</b> smoke <b>deflector,</b> and naming was performed by HRH The Duke of Gloucester at Quorn station on the preserved Great Central Railway.|$|R
50|$|With Pacific National {{ownership}} further {{changes were}} made, the Pacific National decals {{placed over the}} <b>side</b> air <b>deflectors</b> replacing the National Rail signage. From 2006 the National Rail diamonds {{on the side and}} ends of the locomotives were removed or painted over. Most have now been repainted into Pacific National livery.|$|R
50|$|From late 1931, {{after several}} bizarre forms of smoke {{deflectors}} were tried on various locomotives to stop drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision, the straight <b>sided</b> smoke <b>deflectors</b> were added. These were later replaced by deflectors with angled top. From 1933 the class were {{taken off the}} top-link expresses, being superseded by the LMS Princess Royal Class and later the LMS Princess Coronation Class pacifics.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCONVENIENT is {{a project}} where {{prediction}} and integrated control are applied on several subsystems with electrified actuators. The technologies developed in this project are applied to a long-haul tractor and semi-trailer combination. A Volvo truck meeting the Eu 6 emission standard is rebuilt {{with a number of}} controllable electrified actuators. An e-Horizon system collects information about future road topography and speed limits. Controllable aerodynamic wind deflectors reduce the wind drag. The tractor is also equipped with a full digital cluster for human machine interface development. A primary project goal is to develop a model-based optimal controller that uses predictive information from the e-Horizon system in order to minimize fuel consumption. Several energy buffers are controlled in an integrated and optimal way using model predictive control. Several buffers are considered, such as the cooling system, the battery, and the vehicle kinetic energy. This paper presents details on the model predictive controller of the battery system and of the cooling system. Another project goal is to reduce fuel consumption by using adaptive aerodynamics. Controllers are developed that automatically sets an optimal roof deflector angle and the optimal <b>side</b> <b>deflector</b> angle. The results presented in this paper are encouraging. A third focus is the human machine interface and especially the communication between the driver and the control system during driving. This project develops a driver interface that encourages the driver to use the adaptive cruise controller when appropriate. The CONVENIENT project will be finalized this year. This paper presents the main project findings...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} {{collected}} {{by using a}} vertical deflector assembly, a stationary reflector and a horizontally mounted solar collector. The deflector assembly contains a plurality of vanes which change {{the direction of the}} solar energy to the vertical, while constantly keeping the same <b>side</b> of the <b>deflector</b> facing the sun. The vertical rays are then reflected off the stationary reflector and are then absorbed by the collector...|$|R

2500|$|The 1999 Formula One season started {{well for}} Ferrari, the team winning {{three of the}} first four races of the season. Eddie Irvine scored his maiden career win at the season-opening [...] Michael Schumacher scored {{back-to-back}} victories at the [...] and the [...] The team's fortunes began to change in Canada, however, with Michael Schumacher retiring from {{the lead of the}} race after sliding into the wall at the exit of the final chicane of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, since known as the [...] "Wall of Champions". On Lap 1 of the [...] at Silverstone, Schumacher crashed heavily at Stowe Corner after his rear brake failed, sending him off the circuit after he locked up at approximately 130mph. He broke his lower right leg as a result, forcing him to miss the next six races and ending his bid for the 1999 Drivers' Championship. Ferrari replaced him with Mika Salo. Irvine became Ferrari's main contender for the Drivers' title. He won the next two rounds in Austria and in Germany. Schumacher returned for the final two races of the season, handing Irvine the race lead and eventual win at the inaugural [...] Both Ferrari drivers had been disqualified after the race as the <b>side</b> <b>deflector</b> panel on both cars was deemed to have been one centimetre too long, making Mika Häkkinen the provisional Drivers' Champion. However, both Ferrari cars were reinstated on appeal, and Irvine led the Drivers' standings by four points over Häkkinen going into the final round. Irvine ultimately fell short of the 1999 Drivers' Championship at the season-ending , where he finished third, losing to Häkkinen by two points in the final standings. Schumacher's second place in the race helped Ferrari secure the 1999 Constructors' Championship, their first since 1983.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{effort is}} a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) investigation {{that looks at}} the flow-field and performance of a bypass ratio 8 nozzle with an external wedgeshaped noise suppressor, simulating the exhaust of a turbofan engine at takeoff conditions. Peak turbulence was reduced by the wedge on the <b>side</b> opposite the <b>deflector,</b> and it was increased in the initial region of the jet behind the deflector. Flow-field trends agreed with the expectations based on static jet experiments. The calculated thrust loss was 1. 1 % at takeoff conditions...|$|R
5000|$|A new , [...] {{engine was}} {{introduced}} on the 1.7 Quadrifoglio Verde, which replaced the 1.5 QV. The 1.7 engine was {{developed from the}} 1.5 by enlarging bore and stroke; it also used new cylinder heads, incorporating hydraulic tappets. To cope with the increased power the new QV was equipped with vented front brake discs.The 1.7 QV looked close to its predecessor, but had lost the grey mid-body stripe and gained new alloy wheels, front <b>side</b> window wind <b>deflectors,</b> more pronounced <b>side</b> skirts and a rear body-colour spoiler on the boot lid. Inside it featured a leather-covered steering wheel, red carpets, and leatherette-backed sport seats upholstered in a grey/black/red chequered cloth.|$|R
50|$|In a {{cross-flow}} engine, {{the transfer}} and exhaust ports are {{on opposite sides}} of the cylinder, and a deflector on the top of the piston directs the fresh intake charge into the upper part of the cylinder, pushing the residual exhaust gas down the other <b>side</b> of the <b>deflector</b> and out the exhaust port. The deflector increases the piston's weight and exposed surface area, affecting piston cooling and also making it difficult to achieve an efficient combustion chamber shape. This design has been superseded since the 1960s by the loop scavenging method (below), especially for motorbikes, although for smaller or slower engines, such as lawn mowers, the cross-flow-scavenged design can be an acceptable approach.|$|R
500|$|As mentioned, {{the main}} {{production}} batch of Southern-built locomotives {{differed from the}} two prototypes, Channel Packet and Union Castle. [...] The steam-operated firehole door treadle was removed, and {{a new type of}} boiler cladding was utilised in response to the worsening supply situation during the Second World War. [...] Modification was also made to the air-smoothed casing surrounding the smokebox after reports were made of drifting smoke obscuring the locomotive crew's vision ahead. Initially, the only form of smoke deflection was a narrow slot in front of the chimney, intended to enable air to lift the smoke when the locomotive was travelling. This proved inadequate because of the relatively soft exhaust blast that came from the multiple-jet blastpipe, which failed to be caught by the air flow. [...] After several trials, the air flow was increased by extending the casing roof over the front of the smokebox to form a cowling whilst <b>side</b> smoke <b>deflector</b> plates were also incorporated into the front of the air-smoothed casing. The latter added to the poor visibility from the footplate and the expedients combined never fully solved the smoke drift problem.|$|R
40|$|Flow {{over an open}} {{side window}} in a car {{exhibits}} similar characteristics as the flow over an open cavity. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation over a cavity was done as a benchmark. The unsteady flow simulation was carried out using Scale Adaptive Simulation (SAS) turbulence model. The benchmark results, frequency and sound pressure levels of feedback and resonance modes, all well matched with the experimental data. Then, with the right rear window, for example, the mechanism of the side window buffeting was investigated. The simulation results show that side window buffeting noise is generated by large scale vortices and in low frequency. Furthermore, buffeting noise characteristics under several patterns of side windows opening were also numerically investigated. As a result, rear window buffeting noise is more severe than that of front window when one window open, and combination pattern of side windows open can reduce buffeting noise. To decrease the interior noise and improve car ride comfort, four suppression measures through adding a <b>side</b> window weather <b>deflector</b> at the A-pillars, constructing a cavity at the B-pillars, combination of {{the front and rear}} windows and installing a row of square cylinder deflector at the B-pillars were also studied, respectively. In conclusion, certain noise reduction can be achieved through four passive control methods...|$|R
