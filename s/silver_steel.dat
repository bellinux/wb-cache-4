5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural <b>silver.</b> <b>Steel</b> diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E

50|$|Grey {{simply means}} a grey {{colouration}} of any shade. It {{can be used}} as an alternative synonym of blue, but tends to mean some other type of grey than the d/d dilution of black. Synonyms include silver, pepper, grizzle, slate, blue-black grey, black and <b>silver,</b> <b>steel.</b> Greys of a dusty or brownish cast are often lilac, a d/d dilution of liver, and this colouration does not have much of a commonly recognised name. Across various breeds, it is called lavender, silver-fawn, isabella, fawn, café au lait or silver beige.|$|E
50|$|Both factory-forged and hand-forged blades {{are often}} laminated. A {{thin layer of}} very hard steel (traditionally {{crucible}} steel made from limonite iron) is sandwiched between two layers of softer metal, which make the blade less brittle and facilitates repeated sharpening. Before the 19th century, almost all iron in Finland was made from limonite on charcoal blast furnaces, which yield very pure and high-quality iron suitable for crucible steel. German <b>silver</b> <b>steel</b> was and is a popular core-steel material. Today both carbon steel and tool steel are used. The blade can be lightened and strengthened with a fuller.|$|E

5000|$|A {{straight}} {{razor blade}} (cut-throat razor) starts, at the Thiers Issard factory, as a shape called the blank {{supplied by the}} steel manufacturer. Thiers Issard traditionally has used Sheffield <b>silver</b> <b>steel,</b> long considered a superior quality carbon steel. [...] The {{first step is to}} clean the blank using a heavy forge process called the detourage. Following the forging stage a hole is drilled in the tang of the blade. This is a crucial step since after the steel hardening process it would be next to impossible to drill hardened steel without employing specialised methods such as electrical discharge machining, and even then the process would be too arduous to be practical. At this pre-hardening stage the decoration or guiochage of the blade is done, since the blade is malleable enough to be carved.|$|E
