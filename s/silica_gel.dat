5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto <b>silica</b> <b>gel</b> or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E

While a direct application of such anisotropic <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> is for an optical anisotropic medium possessing chemical resistance, we show here their possibility of medium in materials processing. In this direction, for example, silica hydrogels have so far been used as media of crystal growth. In this paper, {{as opposed to the}} soft-wet state, dried <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> have been investigated. We have found that lead (II) nanocrystallites were formed induced by electron irradiation to lead (II) -doped dried <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> prepared in a high magnetic field such as B = 10 T. Hydrogels made from a sodium metasilicate solution doped with lead (II) acetate were prepared. The dried specimens were irradiated by electrons in a transmission electron microscope environment. Electron diffraction patterns indicated the crystallinity of lead (II) nanocrystallites depending on B. An advantage of this processing technique is that the crystallinity can be controlled through the strength of magnetic field B applied during gel preparation. Specific skills are not required to control the strength of magnetic field. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures; Journal of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, accepte...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption onto solid {{supports}} {{has proven}} to be an easy and effective way to improve the mechanical and catalytic properties of lipases. Covalent binding of lipases onto the support surface enhances the active lifetime of the immobilized biocatalysts. Our study indicates that mesoporous <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> grafted with various functions are ideal supports for both adsorptive and covalent binding for lipase B from Candida antarctica (CaLB). Adsorption of CaLB on phenyl-functionalized <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> improved in particular its specific activity, whereas adsorption on aminoalkyl-modified <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> enabling covalent binding with the proper reagents resulted in only moderate specific activity. In addition, adsorption on <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> modified by mixtures of phenyl- and aminoalkyl silanes significantly increased the productivity of CaLB. Furthermore, CaLB adsorbed onto a phenyl/aminoalkyl-modified surface and then treated with glutardialdehyde (GDA) as cross-linking agent provided a biocatalyst of enhanced durability. Adsorbed and cross-linked CaLB was resistant to detergent washing that would otherwise physically deactivate adsorbed CaLB preparations.

The only deviation from this is at strong alkaline conditions where the gel strength decreased perhaps due to the antagonistic effect described previously.

The importance of choosing the right accelerator depends on the surrounding environment.

To evaluate the effect of immobilization methods on the structural and dynamic properties of proteins, a highly fluorescent mutant of the green fluorescent protein, GFPmut 2, was spectroscopically characterized in bulk solutions, dispersed on etched glasses, and encapsulated in wet, nanoporous <b>silica</b> <b>gels.</b> The emission spectrum, the fluorescence lifetimes, the anisotropy, and the rotational correlation time of GFPmut 2, encapsulated in <b>silica</b> <b>gels,</b> are very similar to those obtained in solution. This finding indicates that the gel matrix does not alter the protein conformation and dynamics. In contrast, the fluorescence lifetimes of GFPmut 2 on glasses are two-to fourfold higher and the fluorescence anisotropy decays yield almost no phase shifts. This indicates that the interaction of the protein with the bare glass surface induces a significant structural perturbation and severely restricts the rotational motion. Single molecules of GFPmut 2 on glasses or in <b>silica</b> <b>gels,</b> identified by confocal image analysis, show a significant stability to illumination with bleaching times of the order of 90 and 60 sec, respectively.

40|$|Native {{and some}} monofunctionally derivatized <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> have been {{investigated}} by 29 Si CP MAS NMR spectroscopy with pulse and with cross-polarization (CP) excitation.

Quantitative analyses of such silicas with CP excitation require CP curves as standards. For these samples Tlsi values measured with pulse excitation differ from those obtained by CP excitation.
