Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many <b>sanitary</b> <b>products</b> are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E

25|$|Polypropylene {{is a major}} polymer used in nonwovens, {{with over}} 50% used for diapers or <b>sanitary</b> <b>products</b> where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) rather than {{naturally}} repelling water (hydrophobic). Other interesting non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 micrometre range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters. The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic polypropylene nonwovens are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar floating barriers near oil spills on rivers.|$|E

Mexico's Secretary for Social Development provided $3.6million (MXN, US$190,800) to three communities in Veracruz toward temporary work programs. The country's Ministry of Public Education provided $200million (MXN, US$11million) toward rebuilding schools damaged by Earl. Soup kitchens opened in the disaster zones to help storm victims. In the landslide-struck regions of eastern Mexico, a crew of 600soldiers and rescue workers searched the mountains for storm victims, with the assistance of sniffer dogs. Supplies were distributed throughout Puebla, including water, <b>sanitary</b> <b>products,</b> and clothing. Officials sent trucks containing food, water, and oil to the hard-hit town of Huauchinango, enough supplies for 1,800people for ten days. The Mexican Red Cross brought ambulances to the isolated community Chicauaxtla, where they helped assess the scope of the storm damage. The Inter-American Development Bank provided US$200,000 to purchase blankets, food, and cleaning supplies for storm victims. Other assistance included CHF143,000 from the International Red Cross and US$50,000 from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.|$|E

30|$|Because direct {{methods were}} {{sophisticated}} {{and were not}} suitable for implementation among general population, another approach was to indirectly calculate hemoglobin contents by weighing <b>sanitary</b> <b>product</b> before and after use [21].

This method was refined by Fraser and colleagues in 2001; however, complexity of proper collection of the sanitary pads precluded its use in clinical and research settings [24].|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores how the menstruating {{subject is}} {{articulated}} in contemporary consumer culture and through practices of consumption. This {{results in an}} alternate reading of the menstruating subject that brings together broader questions related to modernity and history. Consumption in modernity occupies a troubled place for feminist theorists and activists; considering consumption requires the rejection of assumptions about the consumer as a blank slate on which advertisers and marketers write their products. The assumed passivity of the young female consumer is also readily questioned, particularly in relation to <b>sanitary</b> hygiene <b>products.</b> Using the work of Walter Benjamin, particularly his ideas of „now-time‟, the dialectical image and technological reproducibility, allows for {{a different type of}} analysis of the menstruating subject in modernity. Understanding how the past, present and future are constructed in current <b>sanitary</b> hygiene <b>product</b> advertising and branding leads to new ways of accessing the everyday for young women in contemporary Australia. Benjamin‟s literary trope of the fragment is also discussed and used in conjunction with the cultural artefacts of everyday objects and commodities. Looking at the visual and digital media of two brands of <b>sanitary</b> hygiene <b>products</b> Moxie and U by Kotex, framed by an autoethnographic approach, I offer a way of considering menstruation and consumption together whilst also suggesting new possibilities for how we frame the everyday for young women in modernity...|$|R

50|$|The songs {{popularity}} {{in the summer of}} 1985 was responsible for a significant rise in popularity of the name Kayleigh. Its popularity and legacy was addressed by Harry Wallop, writing in The Daily Telegraph in 2011:Some names just didn’t exist a generation ago, but have taken off in popularity. The most famous of these is Kayleigh, which came into existence thanks to the neo-prog rock band Marillion, who had a number two hit with a single of this name in 1985. It was almost unheard of before the song. But since then it has taken hold, especially with parents who grew up with a love of long-haired bouffant power ballads. A few years ago, the name made it to the 30th most popular girl’s name in Britain, and it remains popular: 267 children were named it last year. Curiously, though, it has spawned a bewildering sub-sect of names, nearly all of which are unrelentingly bizarre. There were 101 Demi-Leighs last year, seven Chelsea-Leighs and four called Lilleigh, which sounds like a <b>sanitary</b> <b>product.</b>|$|R
