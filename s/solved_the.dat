5|$|Viète {{used this}} {{approach}} to shrink one of the given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> CLL case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a LLP case. He then <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> CLP case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to a point, Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP case. He then <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> CPP case (a circle and two points) and the CCP case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to a point, rendering it a CCP case.|$|E

These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical comparator) and Flanders’s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1946, the two brothers received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment. They had improved the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in soft metal and <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E

5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional {{in the other two}} modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles <b>solved,</b> <b>the</b> obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove.

With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
5|$|For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production rolling in their installations.

In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters.
