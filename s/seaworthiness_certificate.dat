25|$|In 2003, Gallagher {{sold the}} boat to new owners who pledged to {{continue}} with the restoration work. In 2006 the boat was moved to Hoboken, New Jersey while the local council carried out an upgrade to Pier 25. Although operational, the boat is apparently not used for actual voyages since it lacks a <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>certificate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dix was {{purpose-built}} for one route only, the {{run across}} Elliott Bay from Seattle to Alki Point, then the main recreation area for Seattle. Her owners were A.B.C. Dennison and W.L. Dudley, doing business as the Seattle and Alki Point Transportation Company. She was lightly built, and apparently top-heavy, as the steamboat inspectors twice refused to issue her a <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>certificate,</b> only relenting when her builders installed 7tons of gravel ballast in her hull and 5tons of iron weights bolted to her keel. Even so, she {{was said to}} be difficult to handle.|$|E

By the early 1980s, Chinese shipyards had begun to manufacture {{a large number of}} ships for their own maritime fleet. The China Shipping Inspection Bureau {{became a member of the}} Suez Canal Authority in 1984, empowering China to sign and issue <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>certificates</b> for ships on the Suez Canal and confirming the good reputation and maturity of its shipbuilding industry. In 1986 China had 523 shipyards of various sizes, 160 specialized factories, 540,000 employees, and more than 80 scientific research institutes. The main shipbuilding and repairing bases of Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan had 14 berths for 10,000-ton-class ships and 13 docks.|$|R
