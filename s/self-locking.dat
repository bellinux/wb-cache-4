25|$|<b>Self-locking</b> and {{sealable}} sharps containers {{are made}} of plastic so that the sharps can not easily penetrate through the sides. Such units are designed so that the whole container can be disposed of with other biohazardous waste. Single use sharps containers of various sizes are sold throughout the world. Large medical facilities may have their own 'mini' autoclave in which these sharps containers are disposed of with other medical wastes. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel {{and the number of}} people to come in contact with the sharps waste. Smaller clinics or offices without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Self-locking</b> or spring-closing show-lead nose rings, {{also called}} [...] "bulldogs" [...] or nose grips, are {{removable}} rings {{that do not}} require the nose to be pierced. They are often used on steers and cows, along with a halter, at agricultural shows, or when handling cattle for examination, marking or treatment. [...] They stay shut until released, and usually have a loop for the attachment of a cord or lead rope. [...] They give similar control to a bull ring without the need for permanent attachment.|$|E
2500|$|Where [...] is the helix angle, [...] is the {{friction}} angle, and [...] is the maximum efficiency. The friction value {{is dependent on}} the materials of the screw and interacting nut, but ultimately the efficiency is controlled by the helix angle. The efficiency can be plotted versus the helix angle for a constant friction, as shown in the adjacent diagram. The maximum efficiency is a helix angle between 40 and 45 degrees, however a reasonable efficiency is achieved above 15°. Due to difficulties in forming the thread, helix angle greater than 30° are rarely used. Moreover, above 30° {{the friction}} angle becomes smaller than the helix angle and the nut is no longer <b>self-locking</b> and the mechanical advantage disappears.|$|E
2500|$|A {{descender}} or rappel {{device is}} a friction device or friction hitch that allows rope to be payed {{out in a}} controlled fashion, under load, with a minimal effort by the person controlling it. The speed at which the abseiler descends is controlled by applying greater or lesser force on the rope below the device or altering the angle at which the rope exits the device. Descenders can be task-designed or improvised from other equipment. Mechanical descenders include braking bars, the figure eight, the abseil rack, the [...] "bobbin" [...] (and its <b>self-locking</b> variant the [...] "stop"), the gold tail, and the [...] "sky genie" [...] used by some window-washers and wildfire firefighters. Some improvised descenders include the Munter hitch, a carabiner wrap, the basic crossed-carabiner brake and the piton bar brake (sometimes called the carabiner and piton). There is an older, more uncomfortable, method of wrapping the rope around one's body for friction instead of using a descender, as in the Dulfersitz or Geneva methods used by climbers in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War II, {{plastics}} {{became available}} in Denmark, and Lego purchased a plastic {{injection molding machine}} in 1947. One of the first modular toys to be produced was a truck that could be taken apart and re-assembled. In 1947, Ole Kirk and Godtfred obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company Kiddicraft. These [...] "Kiddicraft <b>Self-Locking</b> Building Bricks" [...] were designed by Hilary Page. In 1939, Page had applied for a patent on hollow plastic cubes with four studs on top (British Patent Nº.529,580) that allowed their positioning atop one another without lateral movement. In 1944, Page applied an [...] "Improvement to Toy Building Blocks" [...] as an addition to the previous patent, in which he describes a building system based on rectangular hollow blocks with 2X4 studs on top enabling the construction of walls with staggered rows and window openings. The addition was granted in 1947 as British Patent Nº 587,206. In 1949, the Lego Group began producing similar bricks, calling them [...] "Automatic Binding Bricks." [...] Lego bricks, then manufactured from cellulose acetate, were developed {{in the spirit of}} traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another but could be [...] "locked" [...] together. They had several round [...] "studs" [...] on top, and a hollow rectangular bottom. They would stick together, but not so tightly that they could not be pulled apart. In 1953, the bricks were given a new name: Lego Mursten, or [...] "Lego Bricks." ...|$|E
50|$|Worm gear {{configurations}} {{in which}} the gear cannot drive the worm are called <b>self-locking.</b> Whether a worm and gear is <b>self-locking</b> depends on the lead angle, the pressure angle, and the coefficient of friction.|$|E
50|$|A versatackle is a <b>self-locking</b> {{tensioning}} structure {{implemented in}} cordage. It {{consists of two}} loops with the rope passed {{back and forth between}} them. It is functionally similar to the trucker's hitch, however, unlike the trucker's hitch, the versatackle is <b>self-locking</b> under tension.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Self-locking</b> {{devices are}} devices {{intended}} {{to arrest the}} fall of solo climbers who climb without partners. This device is used for back rope solo climbing for 'ground-up climbing' or 'top rope self belaying'. To date, several types of such <b>self-locking</b> devices have evolved.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-locking</b> {{retaining}} rings {{can be installed}} in a housing/bore or on a shaft that {{has not had a}} groove machined into it. <b>Self-locking</b> rings with no lug holes are impossible to remove without either destroying the ring or warping it out of specified tolerances.|$|E

50|$|Kiddicraft was a toy company {{founded in}} 1932 by Hilary 'Harry' Fisher Page (1904-1957) at Purley in {{southern}} England. The company is notable for the predecessor of Lego bricks, the <b>Self-locking</b> Bricks.|$|E
5000|$|Whether a screw is <b>self-locking</b> {{ultimately}} {{depends on}} the pitch angle and the coefficient of friction of the threads; very well-lubricated, low friction threads with a large enough pitch may [...] "overhaul".|$|E
5000|$|Authorities {{disagree}} on whether nyloc nuts should be reused. For example, Carroll Smith (Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners, and Plumbing Handbook) {{notes that the}} nylon insert is not damaged by installation and therefore they can be reused many times, and a Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular allows nuts to be reused if the prevailing torque is within specification. [...] However, an Air Force Technical Order requires replacement of <b>self-locking</b> nuts in critical areas. [...] Various specifications for aerospace-grade <b>self-locking</b> nuts require that the running torque be maintained {{after a number of}} cycles of assembly, but without preloading the fastener.|$|E
50|$|The <b>self-locking</b> {{property}} is also {{key to the}} screw's use {{in a wide range}} of other applications, such as the corkscrew, screw top container lid, threaded pipe joint, vise, C-clamp, and screw jack.|$|E
5000|$|The stitch is not <b>self-locking,</b> and if {{the thread}} breaks at any point or is not tied at both ends, the whole length of {{stitching}} comes out. It is also easily ripped out.|$|E
