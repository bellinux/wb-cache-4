5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished <b>social</b> <b>action</b> from social behavior, noting that <b>social</b> <b>action</b> must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of <b>social</b> <b>action</b> through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: <b>social</b> <b>action</b> theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

The Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through children's classes, youth groups, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion known as study circles. Further focuses are involvement in <b>social</b> <b>action</b> and participation in the prevalent discourses of society. The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá.|$|E
5|$|Rodham then entered Yale Law School, {{where she}} {{served on the}} {{editorial}} board of the Yale Review of Law and <b>Social</b> <b>Action.</b> During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973). She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor. In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{estimate}} {{different types of}} <b>social</b> <b>actions</b> from a single body-worn accelerometer in a crowded social setting. Accelerometers have many advantages in such set-tings: they are impervious to environmental noise, unobtru-sive, cheap, low-powered, and their readings are specific to a single person. Our experiments {{show that they are}} surpris-ingly informative of different types of <b>social</b> <b>actions.</b> The so-cial actions we address in this paper are whether a person is speaking, laughing, gesturing, drinking, or stepping. To our knowledge, this is the first work to carry out experiments on estimating <b>social</b> <b>actions</b> from conversational behavior using only a wearable accelerometer. The ability to estimate such actions using just the acceleration opens up the potential for analyzing more about social aspects of people’s interactions without explicitly recording what they are saying.

How do Swedish fresh food producers acquire information about the consumer expectations? Which environmental and <b>social</b> <b>actions</b> within the CSR concept do Swedish fresh food producers take and why? How should Swedish fresh food producers further develop and extend their environmental and <b>social</b> <b>actions?</b> Purposes: The {{purposes of this study}} are to describe how Swedish fresh food producers acquire information about consumer expectations, to analyse which environmental and <b>social</b> <b>actions</b> within the CSR concept these producers could handle to bridge the consumer expectations gap and to suggest what environmental and <b>social</b> <b>actions</b> Swedish fresh food producers should undertake to do more and to do better.   Method: This study carries out a qualitative research with a deductive scientific approach. The empirical findings were gathered through semi-structured interviews with six respondents from the Swedish fresh food industry.   Conclusion: The results indicated that all the studied companies are involved in some environmental and <b>social</b> <b>actions</b> to meet the consumer requirements. The CSR concept should support the Swedish fresh food producers by providing a framework and a scope of possible actions. Depending on the company, different methods to acquire consumer information are used, from outsourced surveys to direct contact. Concerning the CSR actions, a reference to Carroll’s pyramid enables to demonstrate the current degree of companies’ commitment, while the empirical findings indicated that the level of involvement will keep on increasing and be further developed. ...|$|R
