5|$|In November 2006, first-generation {{symmetric}} multiprocessing (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, {{referred to as}} SMP1. These clients used Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as {{at that time the}} GROMACS cores were not designed to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although the clients performed well in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under Windows. On January24, 2010, SMP2, the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable thread-based implementation.|$|E

The facility remained in use from 1967 to 1974, but was closed as it was not suitable for ESRO's <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> satellites. During the planning of the station, Longyearbyen had been proposed as a location, and it was largely political concerns by Norwegian authorities to create permanent activity in Ny-Ålesund which lead ESRO to accept the location.|$|E
5|$|The War Brides Act of 1945, and {{subsequent}} Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946, continued to apply {{until the end}} of 1953, allowing veterans of the Regiment, and other Filipino American veterans, to return to the Philippines to bring back fiancées, wives, and children. In the years following the war, some sixteen thousand Filipinas entered the United States as war brides. These new Filipino American families formed a <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Filipino Americans, significantly expanding the Filipino American community.|$|E
5|$|The first {{design in}} the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Italian dreadnoughts, the Conti di Cavour class was also {{designed}} by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered {{in response to the}} French s. They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant improvement was a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships. All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.|$|E
5|$|With Soishiro Satake, Maeda {{formed the}} head of the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Kodokan judoka, which had {{replaced}} the first {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century. Satake, at 175cm and 80kg, was unmatched in amateur sumo but admitted that he himself was not able to match Maeda in judo. Satake would later travel to South America with Maeda and settle in Manaus, Amazonas State, while Maeda continued traveling. Satake would become the founder, in 1914, of the first historically registered judo academy in Brazil. He and Maeda are considered the pioneers of judo in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a {{single-engine}} ground-attack {{aircraft that}} constitutes the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the Harrier Jump Jet family. Capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL), the aircraft was {{designed in the}} late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. Named after a bird of prey, it is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B {{is used by the}} United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} film of Climati's and Morra's Savage Trilogy, which also {{includes}} Savana violenta (This Violent World) and Dolce e selvaggio (Sweet and Savage). The best known film of the trilogy, Ultime grida dalla savana became influential in exploitation cinema by use of cinematographic techniques that were repeated in numerous subsequent Mondo films. Two scenes in particular, a lion attack on a tourist in Namibia and the murder of an indigenous man {{by a group of}} mercenaries in South America, have gained notoriety as genuine footage of human death. The film also sparked a rivalry between the team of Climati and Morra and the brothers Alfredo and Angelo Castiglioni. These two teams became the forerunners of the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Mondo cinema.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E
5|$|The 6th National Congress {{elected the}} 6th Central Committee. At the 4th, 5th and 6th National Congresses {{approximately}} 45 percent of full Central Committee members were retained, 18 percent of alternate members were promoted to full membership and 37 percent were newly {{elected to the}} Central Committee as either full or alternate members. The 6th Congress continued the trend of increasing {{the size of the}} Central Committee; membership was 124 full and 49 alternate members. Most of the new officials in the Central Committee were from the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Vietnamese revolutionaries who gained prominence during Vietnam's struggle against French colonial rule in the 1940s and 1950s. The composition of the Central Committee changed at the 6th National Congress, with a notable increase of economic specialists, technocrats and provincial secretaries as members, but military representation in the Central Committee decreased. Only 8 percent of members of the 6th Central Committee were from the Vietnam People's Army. The number of central-level officials also decreased; 74 percent {{of the members of the}} 2nd Central Committee were central-level officials, while only 46 percent in the 6th Central Committee were from the centre. These changes reflected the party's overriding concern about basic problems.|$|E

5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.|$|E
