5|$|Adult {{crocodilians}} {{are typically}} territorial and solitary. Individuals may defend basking spots, nesting sites, feeding areas, nurseries, and overwintering sites. Male saltwater crocodiles establish year-round territories that encompass several female nesting sites. <b>Some</b> <b>species</b> are occasionally gregarious, particularly during droughts, when several individuals gather at remaining water sites. Individuals of <b>some</b> <b>species</b> may share basking sites {{at certain times}} of the day.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} {{important}} in <b>some</b> <b>species,</b> usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. <b>Some</b> <b>species</b> sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E

5|$|Distraction {{displays}} {{attract the}} attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected. Distraction displays are performed by <b>some</b> <b>species</b> of birds, which may feign a broken wing while hopping about on the ground, and by <b>some</b> <b>species</b> of fish.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Members of the sub-order CharadrU are {{the only}} birds to winter {{regularly}} in New Zealand. They prefer to live on inter-tidal mudflats where. particularly during late summer, they mix with New Zealand's endemic <b>species.</b> <b>Some</b> migratory <b>species</b> show a preference for feeding and roosting with endemic species. Distribution throughout the country is irregular. Some 160000 northern hemisphere breeding Charadrfi are present and this number appears to be increasing. Approximately 95 % of this total {{is made up of}} two <b>species.</b> <b>Some</b> 40 <b>species</b> have been recorded...|$|R

5|$|Sclerocytes secrete the mineralized spicules ("little spines") {{that form}} the skeletons of many sponges and in <b>some</b> <b>species</b> provide some defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts provide {{habitats}} and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. <b>Some</b> <b>species,</b> including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on the ocean floor. Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as <b>some</b> <b>species</b> of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E

25|$|Wheat {{genetics}} is {{more complicated}} than that of most other domesticated <b>species.</b> <b>Some</b> wheat <b>species</b> are diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, but many are stable polyploids, with four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid).|$|R

In <b>some</b> <b>species,</b> the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, {{they may be}} pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E

5|$|The young hatch {{after a few}} weeks, and {{typically}} have only three pairs of legs, followed by up to four legless segments. As they grow, they continually moult, adding further segments and legs as they do so. <b>Some</b> <b>species</b> moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk, and may also shelter in these during wet weather, and most species eat the discarded exoskeleton after moulting. The adult stage, when individuals become reproductively mature, is generally reached in the final moult stage, which varies between species and orders, although <b>some</b> <b>species</b> continue to moult after adulthood. Furthermore, <b>some</b> <b>species</b> alternate between reproductive and non-reproductive stages after maturity, a phenomenon known as periodomorphosis, in which the reproductive structures regress during non-reproductive stages. Millipedes may live from one to ten years, depending on species.|$|E
5|$|While <b>some</b> <b>species</b> of procellariid have {{populations that}} {{number in the}} millions, many species are much less common and several are {{threatened}} with extinction. Human activities have caused dramatic declines {{in the numbers of}} <b>some</b> <b>species,</b> particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the IUCN 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered. Procellariids are threatened by introduced species on their breeding grounds, marine fisheries, pollution, exploitation and possibly by climate change.|$|E
5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. <b>Some</b> <b>species</b> are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with <b>some</b> <b>species</b> using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E
