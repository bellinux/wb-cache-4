N-limited alpine ecosystems are expected to be particularly susceptible to increasing N deposition.

To evaluate the N critical loads and N <b>saturation</b> <b>thresholds</b> in an alpine ecosystem, in 2010, we treated an alpine meadow with five levels of N addition (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 kg N ha(- 1) year(- 1)) and characterized plant and soil responses. The results showed that plant species richness and diversity index did not statistically vary with N addition treatments, but they both changed with years. N addition affected plant cover and aboveground productivity, especially for grasses, and soil chemical features.

40|$|AbstractSaturation {{discrimination}} {{has been}} reported to be affected early {{in the course of a}} disease. Our empirical data show a compressive curvi-linear relationship between opponent/nonopponent channel activity and <b>saturation</b> <b>thresholds</b> in normal trichromatic observers. This relationship can be explained by a model based on the Hurvich and Jameson saturation coefficient (1957), Psychology Reviews, 64, 384 – 404. The model considers effects of both selective and nonselective channel losses on saturation processing based on the assumption that disease produces elevated thresholds while maintaining normal psychometric response functions. Both the model and data support clinical observations of saturation losses occurring early in disease. However, the results also indicate that saturation may not be the best modality for monitoring long-term progression of such conditions. We suggest that the different processing characteristics for blue-yellow thresholds may yield added information for saturation testing under some circumstances and that saturation processing occurs at a higher cortical level.

However, the nonlinear response of ANPP to N addition gradient and the N <b>saturation</b> <b>threshold</b> have not been comprehensively quantified yet for terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we compiled a global dataset of 44 experimental studies with at least three levels of N treatment. Nitrogen response efficiency (NRE, ANPP response per unit N addition) and the difference in NRE between N levels (Delta NRE) were quantified to test the nonlinearity in ANPP response. We found a universal response pattern of N saturation for ANPP with N addition gradient across all the studies and in different ecosystems. An averaged N <b>saturation</b> <b>threshold</b> for ANPP nonlinearity was found at the N addition rates of 5 - 6 g m(- 2) yr(- 1). The extent to which ANPP approaches. N saturation varied with ecosystem type, N addition rate and environmental factors. ANPP in grasslands had lower NRE than those in forests and wetlands. Plant NRE decreased with reduced soil C:N ratio, and was the highest at intermediate levels of rainfall and temperature. These findings suggest that ANPP in grassland or the ecosystems with low soil C:N ratio (or low and high rainfall or temperature) is easier to be saturated with N enrichment. Overall, these results indicate that the beneficial effect of N deposition on plant productivity likely diminishes with continuous N enrichment when N loading surpasses the N <b>saturation</b> <b>threshold</b> for ANPP nonlinearity...|$|E

Independent of these small changes, the P content of eggs was constant at 14 mg P (g dry wt) (- 1). Storage of EPA, but not P, fully compensated D. magna growth during periods of bad food quality.
