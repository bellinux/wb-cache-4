5|$|When {{she became}} a mother in 1999, Thompson made a {{conscious}} decision to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles. She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the British comedy Maybe Baby, which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend Ben Elton.|$|E
5|$|Bosworth's {{first film}} role came after an open casting call in New York for the {{supporting}} part of Judith in the 1998 film, The Horse Whisperer. The film's producers needed {{someone who was}} already an experienced horse rider, leading to Bosworth's successful audition for the role. The film received positive reception from film critics. In 2000, she starred in the television series drama Young Americans, in which she played Bella Banks. The series, however, was canceled. That same year, she had a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the film Remember the Titans. In 2001, Bosworth moved to Los Angeles in hopes of obtaining easier access to auditions and better film parts.|$|E

5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{receives}} 174petawatts (PW) {{of incoming}} solar radiation (insolation) {{at the upper}} atmosphere.

The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.|$|E
5|$|The Woods, {{which had}} been shelved for some 18 months, was {{released}} directly-to-video in October 2006.

Also that year, Nichols had a bit part in the fact-based political drama Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and was cast in a new science fiction drama television series Them, which was ultimately not picked up by Fox.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and {{television}} including Frost in May (where he played an impotent man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC. Eleven {{years after his}} film debut, Day-Lewis had a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the film Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character. In late 1982 he had his big theatre break {{when he took over}} the lead in Another Country. The following year, he had a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal first mate in The Bounty, after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|In 1217, Henry III's {{government}} {{decided to break}} {{the power of the}} Beauchamps and reduce the ongoing military threat posed by the castle by returning much of the castle's bailey to the cathedral. Without an intact bailey the castle was no longer valuable militarily, although it played a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the Second Barons' War in the 1260s. A gaol had been built in the castle by the early 13th century and the castle continued to be used as Worcestershire's county gaol until the 19th century, when a new prison was built {{on the north side of}} Worcester and the old site completely redeveloped. Today nothing remains of Worcester Castle with the exception of Edgar's Tower, a cathedral gatehouse built on the former entrance to the castle.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{within two}} weeks of {{finishing}} her GCSE examinations, Winslet made her screen debut {{as one of the}} main cast members of the BBC science fiction television series Dark Season. Her part was that of Reet, a schoolgirl who helps her classmates fight against a sinister man distributing free computers to her school. She did not earn much from the job, and at age 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, she worked at a delicatessen. In 1992, she had a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the television film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, an adaptation of Angus Wilson's satirical novel of the same name. Winslet, who weighed 185 pounds at the time, played the daughter of an obese woman in it. While filming, an off-hand comment from the director Diarmuid Lawrence about the likeness between her and the actress who played her mother prompted Winslet to lose weight. She next took {{on the role of the}} young daughter of a bankrupt middle-aged man (played by Ray Winstone) in the television sitcom Get Back (1992–93). She also had a guest role in a 1993 episode of the medical drama series Casualty.|$|E
