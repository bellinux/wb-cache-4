5|$|In January 1950, Douglas opened {{campaign}} headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which {{was seen as}} a signal that she was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined. The two candidates traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{official}} government statement that allowed {{for freedom of}} the press, {{this was the first}} trial of whether or not Dubček was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> reforms. Goldstucker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy. By August 1968, Literární listy had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Endecott's warrant was {{followed}} by an order issued by King Charles in March and received by Endecott in May 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend the two fugitives and ship them back to England. Endecott dutifully obeyed, but he appointed two recently arrived Royalists to track them down. Somewhat predictably, their search came up empty, and Whalley and Goffe thus escaped. Biographer Lawrence Mayo suggests Endecott would have appointed different men for the search had he been <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> catching them.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Army, Carradine became <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> his acting pursuits. It {{was at that}} time that he was advised to change his name to avoid {{confusion}} with his famous father. In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of Armstrong Circle Theatre. Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. He made his feature film debut in 1964 in Taggart, a western based on a novel by Louis L'Amour.|$|E
5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this {{way to ensure that}} their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{summer and}} autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> his studies and his life. He became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, an educated {{baroness}} of the Prussian ruling class {{who had known}} Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father Ludwig von Westphalen (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him. Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.|$|E

5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{was born}} in Paterson, New Jersey, and moved to Aguada, Puerto Rico with his family when he was one year old. He played very little {{baseball}} {{as a child in}} Puerto Rico, and did not become <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> becoming a professional baseball player until he was 18. He attended Dr. Carlos Gonzalez High School and Miami-Dade Community College. At Miami-Dade, he was a track and field star, running the 100 meters in 10.37 seconds. In 1997, the Florida Marlins drafted him in the 23rd round of the Major League Baseball Draft, but he chose not to sign. He was then drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft, and that time he signed.|$|E

In addition, the new government guaranteed workers the right to strike and established an eight-hour work day.|$|E
25|$|The album's {{title was}} {{intended}} to have a double meaning: that the music business is a hard one, and that the band was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> its music ("The Firm mean business"). However, perhaps due to the lukewarm-at-best critical and financial success which the band met, Page and Rodgers decided to disband The Firm within months of this album's release.|$|E

He once held a mock funeral service at the courthouse for Roman numerals, retiring them from use in state pleadings.|$|E

25|$|Whistler had a {{distinctive}} appearance, short and slight, {{with piercing eyes}} and a curling mustache, often sporting a monocle and the flashy attire of a dandy. He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. Though he could be droll and flippant about social and political matters, he always was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.|$|E
