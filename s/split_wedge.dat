50|$|The second {{bridge was}} far more massive and the new eastern {{abutment}} was a far more massive affair than before, with splayed wing walls both {{north and south of}} the bridge's actual line. This abutment, its massive rectangular stones lifted into place using the lewis holes which are a feature of their upper surface, were held together with long iron ties channelled into the masonry to reinforce the front face. The lewis-holes widen as they penetrate. The lewis consisted of a <b>split</b> <b>wedge</b> which, after being inserted in the hole, was widened out to lock into it by the insertion of a strip of metal between the two halves of the wedge. The hook of the crane was then passed through the head of the lewis and the stone was ready for lifting. From this solid abutment there sprang an elegant bridge with four arches supported on three substantial river piers, 34 ft apart. Its overall length was 189 ft and was intended to take a road carriageway. Few voussoirs (wedge-shaped stones from arches) have been found, but there is sufficient other evidence in the form of cornice blocks, grooved to take vertical parapet slabs, and angled mouldings, to show that the bridge was of stone, although others state that the second bridge had a timber superstructure. This second bridge seems to date from the early 3rd century give AD 162-5 or AD 206. There is no evidence for any further repair or alteration to the bridge after that date. There is a male fertility symbol carved into the northern face of the eastern abutment.|$|E
30|$|The {{anterior}} fissure of the anterolateral wedge fragment {{is developed}} by inserting a blunt instrument to prise open the plane, and thereby gain access into {{the centre of}} the lateral joint space. If the subperiosteal elevation does not extend beyond the mid-sagittal plane, the posterior parts of this anterolateral <b>split</b> <b>wedge</b> will keep its soft tissue attachments posteriorly. This plane of access can be maintained using a simple Weitlander retractor.|$|E
30|$|Evacuation of {{the joint}} haemarthrosis and of soft clot will enable the surgeon to {{identify}} the fracture fragments. The depressed segment should be elevated en masse from beneath and not by picking out individual articular fragments. The latter can render the assembly of tiny pieces {{of the joint}} surface utterly futile. The elevation of the depressed segment leaves a void in the subchondral metaphysis. There is some individual preference and debate about the choice of appropriate substitute to fill this defect. Autogenous corticancellous graft is still the benchmark although tricalcium phosphate and similar type bone substitutes have their appeal. Direct visualisation of accuracy of reduction is possible through the submeniscal exposure of the joint surface. The anterolateral <b>split</b> <b>wedge</b> fragment is then folded over like closing a book.|$|E

40|$|Key words: concrete; <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> specimen; {{fracture}} toughness; {{stress intensity}} factor; crack extension Abstract. The <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> (WS) test {{is now a}} promising method to perform stable fracture mechanics tests on concrete-like quasi brittle materials. Fracture parameters, such as fracture toughness and critical crack opening displacement and et. al, are however not easy to determined since formulae available from stress intensity factor manual are restricted to standard specimen geometry. The paper attempts to compute expressions for commonly used fracture parameters for a general <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> specimen. By means of finite element analysis program, test simulation was performed on non-standard <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> specimen with different depth and initiation crack length, and thereafter expressions were proposed for stress intensity factor at the pre-cast tip and crack mouth opening displacement on the load line. Based on the work above, size effect on the unstable fracture toughness and crack extension were investigated, and the consistency of fracture toughness data for various specimen depth as well as initiation crack length is demonstrated. The crack extension is little sensitive to the initiation crack length, it increases with the depth of specimen, which {{can be explained by}} the boundary influence of the specimen...|$|R

50|$|The hammer {{side of the}} maul {{is often}} used in wood {{splitting}} when combined with a <b>splitting</b> <b>wedge,</b> driving the wedge into the wood {{in the same fashion}} as the maul itself. This is generally used when attempting to split logs with a large diameter. Modern mauls are made of a strong enough steel to withstand the metal-to-metal contact without chipping. However, it is still common for the wedge itself to chip off. This can be dangerous as flying chips of steel could damage the eye. This is also the easiest way to break a maul's handle because the wedge is a very small target as opposed to the whole log, and can be overshot, resulting in the handle hitting full-force onto the wedge. This greatly weakens the handle, and can cause it to break after only a few over-shots.|$|R

For a comparison of isotropic and orthotropic material behavior, finite element modeling was performed. In addition to the calculation of fracture energy the stress intensity factor was analyzed by means of finite elements simulation and calculation. In order to analyze strain deformations and the process zone, electronic speckle pattern interferometry measurements were performed. The results revealed an elongated process zone and lower results for KIC if compared to the <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> experiment. The Gf numbers are higher compared to the <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> results and {{can be explained by the}} thicker process zone formed during the crack propagation.

5000|$|A {{cleaving}} axe {{resembles a}} felling axe but is heavier, more wedge shaped, not sharp-edged and the pole is flat for driving wedges. [...] The edge is of medium length, almost straight {{with just a}} slight camber, and symmetrical top and bottom. A section through the edge {{is that of a}} simple <b>splitting</b> <b>wedge.</b> The edge itself {{does not need to be}} sharp: cleaving relies more on wedge action than chopping (cutting) with an edge. The section of the axe should be triangular though, with flat sides, rather than the deeply hollow-sided forged and welded axes, or the modern convex-sided [...] "apple pip" [...] axe grind. Nor should the edge be ground at a bevel. The work of using the axe, and its ability to split cleanly, depends on having flat sides with the minimum of friction, rather than all the force of the timber being concentrated on one protruding line. The handle is straight and fairly short, around 18 inches, as the cleaving axe is only held, not swung. As the axe head must penetrate fully into the wood, the poll is minimal, narrower than the axe cheeks, and is never used for pounding other tools, lest it damage or mushroom the head.|$|R
