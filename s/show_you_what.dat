500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|Crystal Bell of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{generally}} positive review stating [...] "much {{as he did}} on his debut single, [...] "One Time," [...] Bieber {{makes a strong case}} for why he's the next pop heartthrob. 'I'm gonna put you first, I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> you're worth/If you let me inside your world,' he sings. The stump speech is hard to resist, especially when set to an arrangement that follows the lineage of hit midtempo ballads [...] "With You", and [...] "Irreplaceable". Although the lyrics are generic, Bieber's smooth delivery is right on point, and his tender vocals blend well with the song's easy-flowing beat." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song along with [...] "Down to Earth", [...] "uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic listed the song as one of his recommended tracks from the album.|$|E
500|$|Describing [...] "Lay You Down" [...] {{as one of}} {{the more}} sensual songs on Versus, Mark Nero of About.com wrote [...] "the best of which might be the piano-laced 'Lay You Down,' on which Usher sings: 'This ain't bump 'n grind, I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> love is if you let me lay you down. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe commended Usher's use of falsetto, whilst writing that the song [...] "is an urgent boudoir jam that draws a neat line"– she also commented on how it takes {{inspiration}} from both Prince and Marvin Gaye. Los Angeles Timess Jeff Weiss also pointed out the influence from pop musician Prince, and how Usher is [...] "unctuously cooing about wanting to be the: one who keeps your body warm." [...] "Lay You Down" [...] entered the R/Hip-Hop Songs chart on the week ending November 13, 2010, and peaked at number fifty-six, due to strong radio play.|$|E
50|$|After {{suffering}} defeat from summoned dragons at Nefer Moor, the Legion retreats back to Qoble. Shandie and {{his inner}} circle decide to head to Hub {{to speak with the}} Imperor. Instead of traveling conventionally, they race to Hub to beat the message of their coming. On the way, a cloaked Pixie visits them and tells them of a preflecting pool at Wold Hall (putting your left foot in the pool <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should seek, your right foot <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should avoid). They detour to visit it, and each person's vision guides their actions afterwards.|$|R

500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, Presley {{recorded}} [...] "Hound Dog", {{along with}} [...] "Any Way You Want Me" [...] and [...] "Don't Be Cruel". The Jordanaires sang harmony, {{as they had}} on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced, [...] "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the real Elvis is like tonight." [...] In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. The single pairing [...] "Don't Be Cruel" [...] with [...] "Hound Dog" [...] ruled {{the top of the}} charts for 11 weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years. Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of [...] "Hound Dog," [...] contributed [...] "Love Me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So she is mine," [...] he {{said without}} the {{slightest}} irony or bitterness, but added with conviction: [...] "That <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> life ashore is. Much better be out of it." ...|$|R
60|$|SECOND. And {{thus have}} I <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> this throne of grace is, {{and where it}} stands. And now I shall come to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how you shall find it, and know when you are come to it, by several other things.|$|R
2500|$|NPR critic Bob Mondello {{adds that}} [...] "despite {{working with a}} plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could even say they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a {{character}} check {{the soles of his}} boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough in No Country for Old Men that they don't have to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> he's checking for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1985, {{the company}} {{produced}} the first computer {{of its own}} design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM. After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month. Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to [...] "give {{us a chance to}} <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> [...] can do". Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986. In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{proceed to}} an {{observation}} upon the words, I must, but briefly, touch upon two things: namely, FIRST, <b>Show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> Jerusalem now was. SECOND, <b>Show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{it was to}} preach the gospel to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hssh! I am again Kaa. I {{knew it was}} but {{a little}} time. Now {{we will go to}} the river, and I will <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>what</b> is to be done against the dhole." ...|$|R
60|$|Having thus <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> sort of {{subjection}} it {{is which}} all men owe one another, {{and in what}} manner {{it ought to be}} paid, I shall now draw some observations from what hath been said.|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth {{spread his}} hands out with a little deprecatory gesture. [...] "I {{expected}} this. The story I have told <b>you</b> should have <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I am--and while I wanted to tell it earlier I was afraid." ...|$|R
60|$|I shall now {{speak to}} this fear, which I call a lasting godly fear; first, {{by way of}} explication; by which I shall show, FIRST. How by the Scripture it is described. SECOND. I shall <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> this fear flows from. And then, THIRD. I shall also <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> doth flow from it.|$|E
60|$|The {{method that}} I shall {{go on in}} at this time shall be, FIRST. To <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> true prayer is. SECOND. To <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it is to pray with the Spirit. THIRD. What it is to pray with the Spirit and {{understanding}} also. And so, FOURTHLY. To make some short use and application of what shall be spoken.|$|E
60|$|If {{you will}} listen to me, I will try and <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I mean.|$|E

5000|$|This morning {{one of my}} men {{was shot}} through the lungs, not far from our room, and he died at once. This just <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> a time we go through here, always having to keep our eyes open! ...|$|R
50|$|Fighting {{against the}} favourite, Brian Wright, proved {{a test of}} nerves for Wilson in the first round. However, after his trainer, Arthur Anderson gave him the advice, 'he's <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> he can do, so now <b>you</b> <b>show</b> him <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can do', Wilson struck first and tellingly in the second, and the fight {{finished}} early due to knockout. Over the course of Wilson's amateur career he may have won up to 32 of his 35 fights with one disqualification, controversially, in the Irish Flyweight title fight in Dublin.|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} a right {{handling}} of this matter, I shall divide this head into these two parts--A. <b>Show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{it is to}} suffer for well-doing, or for righteousness. B. <b>Show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it is to suffer for righteousness' sake. I put this distinction, because I find that {{it is one thing}} to suffer for righteousness, and another to suffer for righteousness' sake.|$|E
60|$|SECOND. I {{come now}} to the second thing, to wit, to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> this fear of God flows from.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold {{out your}} hat, and I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I can do," [...] {{continued}} the voice, while its owner persistently remained hidden.|$|E
6000|$|... "Therefore, have no fear, Kallikrates, when thou--living, and {{but lately}} born--shalt look upon thine own {{departed}} self, who breathed and died so long ago. I do but turn one page in thy Book of Being, and <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>what</b> is writ thereon.|$|R
6000|$|... 55. I {{have already}} given you {{several reasons for}} my wish that you should retain, in {{classifying}} birds, the now rejected order of Picae. I am going to read you a passage from Humboldt, which <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> difficulties one may get into for want of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just let me {{get hold}} of the fellow who knocked my papers in the mud, and I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what's</b> what!" [...] Teddy cried, not {{understanding}} {{that he had been}} arrested. [...] "They aren't goin' to drive me away from this town, if I know myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Fifthly, I {{come now}} to the fifth thing, which is, to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{necessity}} there is that Christ should be our Advocate.|$|E
60|$|Third, I {{come now}} to the third thing, namely, to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> is to be {{inferred}} from Christ's making intercession for us.|$|E

5000|$|Showing: this {{is making}} {{something}} understandable, or using your own example {{to demonstrate a}} skill or activity. <b>You</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are talking about, <b>you</b> <b>show</b> by your own behavior.|$|R
60|$|I {{never saw}} {{such a thing}} as potato-scraping for making a fellow in a mess. It seemed {{difficult}} to believe that the potato-scrapings in which Harris and I stood, half smothered, could have come off four potatoes. It <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> can be done with economy and care.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2006 the American {{newspaper}} USA Today {{suggested that}} Ahlstedt should be {{nominated for a}} Best Supporting Actor Oscar {{for his role in}} Saraband, with the comment [...] "He <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it's like to be an aging version {{of a man who was}} already broken in his 20s".|$|R
