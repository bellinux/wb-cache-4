Honeoye, {{were examined in}} laboratory experiments. In Petri dish assays, both Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) and A. ervi Hal-iday readily stung shallot aphids, with {{no significant difference in}} stinging frequency between the two species. A. ervi induced a significantly higher mortality (79. 0 ± 7. 2 %) in terms of stung aphids compared with A. colemani (55. 3 ± 4. 1 %); however, only a minor fraction (2. 7 ± 1. 8 % and 7. 1 ± 3. 1 %, respectively) of the killed aphids resulted in formation of mummies, presumably due to a physiological response to parasitism. The low percentage of mummification precludes the use of either Aphidius species in anything but inundative biocontrol. In similar set-ups, Ap-helinus abdominalis (Dalman) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) killed almost half (49. 6 ± 5. 3 %) of the exposed aphids through host feeding. In addition, 23. 2 ± 7. 3 % of non-host-fed aphids devel-oped into mummified aphids, and 38. 1 ± 13. 2 % of non-host-fed aphids died from other parasitoid-induced causes. However, the host feeding rate was reduced to only 1. 2 ± 0. 8 %, an...|$|E
