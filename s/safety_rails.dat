500|$|The {{antiquarian}} Austin Cooper {{visited the}} house in 1779 and found it {{in a state of}} disrepair. Joseph Holt, a general of the Society of the United Irishmen recorded in his memoirs that he spent a night in the ruin of Mount Pelier while on the run following the 1798 Rebellion. Holt wrote of his experience, [...] "I lay down in the arched room of that remarkable building. I felt confident of the protection of the Almighty that the name of enchantment and the idle stories that were told of the place had but a slight hold of my mind."

Designer Derek McLane commented that {{it is not uncommon for}} repeat choreographer/set designer collaborations to result in intriguing innovation like the conveyor belt dance scene in Kinky Boots. McLane was impressed with the [...] "series of conveyor belts that came apart, moved around, and fit the context of the story" [...] in order to accentuate the choreography of [...] "a troupe of men in four-inch heels". With respect to the conveyor belts, he said, [...] "They've never been used as dynamically as this, creating a series of surprises, with the kind of wild athleticism that actually looks dangerous. It's one of the more thrilling combinations of stage design and choreography that I can recall." ...|$|E
