The {{results showed that the}} P-induced deletions occurred nonrandomly in the genomic sites. One breakpoint of the deletions was located precisely {{at the end of the}} <b>starting</b> <b>element,</b> i. e., at the end of the inverted terminal repeats. The other breakpoint was nearby the retained <b>starting</b> <b>element</b> and coincided with preferential P-element insertion sites that harbor transcription initiation activities. It is known that P elements induce male recombination near the <b>starting</b> <b>elements,</b> giving rise to deletions with one breakpoint precisely located at an inverted terminal repeat of the retained <b>starting</b> <b>element.</b> Database analyses further revealed that deletions generated in P-induced male recombination also contained the other breakpoint in genomic regions that coincided with preferential P-insertion sites.

40|$|Data {{parallel}} languages like High Performance Fortran, demand efficient compile and run-time {{techniques for}} {{tasks such as}} address generation. Array references with arbitrary affine subscripts can make the task of compilers for such languages highly involved. This paper deals with the efficient address generation in programs with array references having two types of commonly encountered affine references, namely coupled subscripts and subscripts containing multiple induction variables (MIVs). Methods discussed in the paper utilize the repetitive pattern of the memory accesses. In the case of MIV, we address this issue by presenting runtime techniques which enumerate the set of addresses in lexicographic order. Our approach to the problem incorporates a general approach of computing in O(k) time, the <b>start</b> <b>element</b> on a processor for a given global <b>start</b> <b>element.</b> Several methods are proposed and evaluated here for generating the access sequences for MIV based on problem param [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The P {{element in}} Drosophila melanogaster {{preferentially}} transposes into nearby sites. The local insertions display a preferential orientation toward the <b>starting</b> <b>element.</b> We investigated {{the mechanism of}} the P-element local transposition by isolating and characterizing local insertions in the male germline. We designed a genetic screen employing a marker gene that is carried in the P element and is dose sensitive. This dose effect allows isolation of flies containing newly transposed P elements {{in the presence of}} the <b>starting</b> <b>element.</b> A rapid molecular screen with PCR was used to identify 45 local insertions located within an approximately 40 -kb genomic region on both sides of the <b>starting</b> <b>element.</b> Our system permits the isolation of the cluster progeny derived from a single insertion event, but none was isolated. The data suggest that local transposition occurs in the meiotic cell cycle. Nearly all of the local insertions were located within the promoter regions of the genes that were active in the male germline cells, suggesting that local insertions target predominantly active promoters. Our analysis shows that local transposition of the P element is highly regulated, displaying a cell-type specificity and a target specificity...|$|R

40|$|Storage {{capacity}} on {{limited and}} mobile devices has risen rapidly in recent years. The amount of available processing capacity is, however, still low, {{as it is}} limited by battery capacity. In this talk we look at techniques for efficiently processing the increasing amounts of data in XML format that can be fit on a mobile phone. The techniques were developed by the author and Jaakko Kangasharju {{as part of the}} Fuego XML stack in context of the Fuego Core project on mobility middleware. The XML processing techniques included in the Fuego XML stack that we present are: processing sequences of XML particles, parser/serializer byte stream access, parsing in a random access manner, using delayed tree structures and building mutability on these, as well as document packaging for synchronization. In many cases, it is unnecessary to construct the tree structure corresponding to the XML document in order to perform a processing task. Instead, the document may be processed as a sequence of XML particles, such as document <b>start,</b> <b>element</b> <b>start,</b> <b>element</b> end, content, and so on. In the Fuego XML stack, the XAS XML parsing and serialization API supports such sequential processing. We have developed an XML efficient differencing application based on sequential XML processing [1]. One way of embedding binary data in XML documents is to use Base 64 encoding, and embed the resulting text as a text node in the XML document. However, this large text object frequently becomes a bottleneck in XML parsing and serialization. This situation can be remedied by providing access to the raw input and output streams of the XML parser and serializer. Care has to be taken to preserve a valid XML context when switching between byte- and XML-level processing. In some cases, XML documents are too large to be accessed in a sequential manner, in which case a parser that can be quickly positioned at...|$|E

Most navigational elements are placed at the left side. However, there is neither a theoretical reasoning nor empirical evidence, why these elements should be placed left. In the present study we examined three independent variables (presentation side of elements (left, right), number of elements (one, three, five) and a visual cue prior to selection (with cue, without). Dependent variables were selection times and accuracy of task completion. 50 participants were exposed to elements consisting of single words in bubbles. After clicking on the <b>start</b> <b>element</b> {{in the middle of}} the screen a number of elements were presented randomly on the left or right. In 50 % of trials the presentation side was announced in advance, by using a visual cue. It was tested, whether and to what extent there is a preference and performance (correct selection time) increase for elements placed on the left side. When the cue was presented, performance increased; without cue information, elements on the left were selected faster. The use of cues resulted in no significant differences between the left and right side. A significantly better performance was found when only one element was presented on the left. With an increasing number of elements, the performance decreased. The results of this study suggest that the presentation of elements on the left side is advantageous for the speed of information processing only in the case of single elements. When selecting between numbers of options (three, five), placing elements on the left does not affect the selection performance...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Distance {{protection}}s {{are widely}} used in protection of energy transmission lines, but their time coordination is still an important and difficult problem. Inappropriate configuration leads to a hazard event: remote circuit breaker tripping provided the local circuit breaker can be opened, which severely impairs power system operation. OBJECTIVE: To describe a method and provide software tools to alleviate the hazard in power systems. METHODS: A domain specific language (DSL) for representation of a transmission line with its distance protection schema, and a translation algorithm from the DSL to probabilistic fault trees with time dependencies (PFTTDs) are employed. RESULTS: The paper presents software tools that can support power protection experts in time coordination of distance protections. The tools are based upon abstract and concrete syntax of the DSL designed specifically {{for the purpose of}} the distance protection time coordination problem. In order to render creation of power line and its protection schema models easier, a DSL-dedicated editor supporting syntax and semantic aspects of the DSL has been developed. Additionally, a translator from the DSL into PFTTD language has been implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Power system experts are enabled to perform hazard probability assessment and sensitivity analysis. LIMITATIONS: Translation supports two types of distance protections, which are: single-system relays with <b>starting</b> <b>elements</b> as well as multi-system relays without <b>starting</b> <b>elements.</b> For the single-system relay, there is one timer per relay.

A single P element residing in the euchromatin of minichromosome Dp 1187 was mobilized following a cross to the Δ 2 - 3 (99 B) strain, and progeny bearing transpositions were identified {{with a minimum of}} bias by performing Southern blots on progeny. Approximately 1 - 2 % of all progeny minichromosomes contained new insertions. Many of these ``local transpositions'' landed very close to or within the starting P element; however, nearly 1 % of all progeny chromosomes contained new insertions 1 - 180 kb from the donor element. More local insertions were observed in the progeny of females than from male parents, and most occurred in a preferred orientation relative to the <b>starting</b> <b>element.</b> These observations suggested that donor elements are frequently excised and reinserted locally without ever dissociating from a transposition complex.
