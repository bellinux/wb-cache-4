5|$|On 29 November 2011, two workmen {{suffered}} {{minor injuries}} after a section <b>of</b> <b>gangway,</b> {{connected to the}} ship, collapsed during renovation works. The ship was closed to visitors following the accident. An investigation later established that the collapse <b>of</b> the <b>gangway</b> had been caused by a subcontractor cutting through the gangway's structure during refurbishment work. Belfast re-opened on 18 May 2012.|$|R

50|$|With {{four levels}} <b>of</b> <b>gangways</b> and {{thousands}} <b>of</b> cables cluttering it, the fly loft {{in particular was}} a real stumbling block. What was state-of-the-art in 1962 had become obsolete—almost a threat to security in the theatre—and the grid (the machinery above the stage) was thus completely transformed.|$|R
25|$|From 1983-1984 {{the fleet}} was refurbished. Work {{involved}} replacing all compartments with open saloons, and the fitting <b>of</b> <b>gangways</b> between vehicles within a unit.

50|$|To assist {{pedestrian}} circulation during floods, the city installs a network <b>of</b> <b>gangways</b> (wide wooden planks on iron supports) {{on the main}} urban paths. This gangway system is generally set at 120 cm above the conventional sea level, which can result in partial or complete flooding when higher tides occur.|$|R

The cab front is also smooth and ‘step free’ to reduce the problem of ‘train surfing’ in South London.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Gangway bellows in {{this study}} is the double {{wrinkled}} neoprene rubber component to accept various deviations between the carriage end parts of the articulated type high speed railway vehicle(HSRV). The fatigue failure of the bellows has a harmful effect on the riding comfort for the passengers with the increase of noise and ringing in the ears due to air-tightness failure during pass through a long tunnel. In this study, to assure the safety <b>of</b> <b>gangway</b> bellows <b>of</b> the HSRV, non-linear analysis <b>of</b> the <b>gangway</b> bellows considering triaxial angular displacement(rolling /yawing/pitching) between the carriage end parts are performed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the idea to develop the {{integrated}} model <b>of</b> offshore <b>gangway</b> model including multi-body dynamics model and hydraulic system model with bond-graph method in 20 -sim. And based on that model, active motion compensation control approach will developed in order to compensate the ship motion during gangway operation and further more a parallel position and force control method will be proposed to make the gangway tip maintain constant contact force with windmill platform as well as compensate ship motion during transferring process. In order to get reasonable data for modeling, simulation and control <b>of</b> <b>gangway</b> operation, an offshore gangway was designed first based on the relative rules and existing products from Uptime Company. Then multi-body dynamic model is developed with IC-field based on the Lagrangian Hamiltonian equation <b>of</b> <b>gangway.</b> After that, the hydraulic system for gangway was designed and verified with simulation. Based on this developed model, the control algorithm for active motion control and parallel position and force control were proposed. The active heave compensation control {{is based on}} the kinematics solving method to mapping the gangway tip trajectory to actuator trajectory and then control the actuator by position and velocity feedback with velocity feedforward controller. And the parallel position and force control was based on the inner positon loop outer force control and the idea is to adjust the desired gangway tip trajectory by the force modulator to achieve the desired contact force...|$|R
