5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The Iran-Contra Affair and the ensuing deception to protect <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of Donald Trump as the 45th. President of the United States of America caught European polity completely off-guard {{with the majority}} of the political, financial & bureaucratic elite having openly come out in support of Hillary Clinton and making disparaging statements about Donald Trump during the US Presidential Campaign period. Brussels has listed the US as posing an existential threat to the EU. Immigration, trade and geopolitical policies unveiled by the Trump administration have provoked reactions ranging from anger to dismay amongst longstanding US allies. Donald Trump has stated that the United Nations and NATO are obsolete in their current form and has threatened to withhold US Government funding and review obligations unless both institutions are revamped to alleviate the financial burden on US-taxpayers and modernize themselves to represent the geopolitical realities of the 21st.century. Statements from Presidential advisors and <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> indicate that President Trump is indifferent {{to the future of the}} European Union and the Euro currency.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was further}} {{debate over the}} exact meaning of the Chinese {{translation}} issued by the U.S. Embassy.

25|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralization of power relative to previous administrations. Modi personally selected the civil servants who served under his ministers, frequently giving them instructions without involving the ministers themselves. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policied frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances, or executive orders, to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. In 2014, the Prime Minister's Office prevented Gopal Subramaniam from being appointed to the Supreme Court. The stated reason was that his conduct in the 2G spectrum allocation scandal had been suspect: commentators stated it was because he had been the amicus curiae in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, which had implicated BJP leaders including Modi's aide Amit Shah. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

500|$|In 1950, the Senate, led by Estes Kefauver, {{investigated}} numerous {{charges of}} corruption among <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials,</b> {{some of whom}} received fur coats and deep freezers in exchange for favors. [...] A large number of employees of the Internal Revenue Bureau (today the IRS) were accepting bribes; 166 employees either resigned or were fired in 1950, with many soon facing indictment. When Attorney General J. Howard McGrath fired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous, Truman fired McGrath. Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB; Congress passed it, but the corruption was {{a major issue in}} the 1952 presidential election.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton <b>Administration</b> <b>officials</b> {{told the}} New York Times that US support for Suharto was [...] "driven by a potent mix of power {{politics}} and emerging markets."

2500|$|Sections 9 and 10 of {{the memo}} are said by Gore Vidal {{to be the}} [...] "smoking gun" [...] {{revealed}} in Stinnett's book, suggesting it was central to the high level plan to lure the Japanese into an attack. Evidence the memo or derivative works actually reached President Roosevelt, <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials,</b> or {{the highest levels of}} U.S. Navy command, is circumstantial, at best. [...] Regardless, the US Government followed all the recommendations of the McCollum memo, and the Japanese attacked the US as the McCollum memo indicated they might, and no evidence has been presented that indicates Roosevelt did not see it.|$|E
