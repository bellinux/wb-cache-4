40|$|Abstract. Given {{the general}} neglect of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> {{place in the}} study of {{conflict}} and conflict processes- especially in contrast to the temporal context- this article makes a plea for a more explicit and extensive attention to the spatial contexts of social phenomena. In so doing, the paper discusses the importance of space, the relationship between <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time, how <b>space</b> <b>and</b> spatiality can be studied, and the continuing challenges that come with the study of <b>space,</b> <b>and</b> of combining the study of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time in our analyses of social phenomena...|$|R
40|$|We review some modern {{theories}} about the structure of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time, in particular those related to discrete <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time. Following an epistemological method we start from theories which discuss discrete <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time as a mathematical tool to solve physical models. Antother theories look for physical content of the discrete structure of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time, based in relational theories of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time which are derived from the relations of some fundamental entities.
