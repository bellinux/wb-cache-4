Antenna array and aperture theory are applied to the model and used to derive equations for the total received field that enable a clear understanding of fading over various distances along the path. It is shown that lower frequency fades, which have often heretofore been attributed to shadowing by obstructions, can result from multipath interference. This is confirmed via Fourier analysis of data measured on line-of -sight microcellular-type radio channels at 1. 8 Hz.
