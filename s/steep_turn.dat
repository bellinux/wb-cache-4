[...] Used in 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora! Crashed near Elko, Nevada during {{fire bomber}} run, updrafts and downdrafts, 40 knot winds. Following <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> downwind over downslope of mountain, pilot failed to maintain airspeed, stalled, two crew killed.|$|E
50|$|This {{minor planet}} named {{in memory of}} Russian aviator Mikhail Nikiforovich Efimov (М. Н. Ефимов; 1881-1919), {{who was the first}} to realize <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> and dives.|$|R
50|$|The term {{can also}} refer to an {{aircraft}} certified under American, Canadian, European or Australian regulations as a Utility Category Aircraft, {{which indicates that}} it is permitted to conduct limited aerobatics. The approved maneuvers include chandelles, lazy eights, spins and <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> over 60° of bank.|$|R
50|$|The {{service is}} mostly {{operated}} by older rolling stock {{or the new}} Artic units. This is because the difficult portion of track from Töölön tulli to Munkkiniemi is not suited for Variobahn trams due to its <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> and climbs that were built before {{the current generation of}} trams were ordered.|$|R
2500|$|With T-37s, {{the type}} of {{formation}} and sequence virtually remained the same since the team’s inception – line astern to the diamond formation during a loop, then clover-leaf, <b>steep</b> <b>turn,</b> barrel roll and finally, the breath-taking bomb-burst. Attempts were made {{to increase the number}} of aircraft in the team, but engine thrust demands were excessive for the outer formation members to cope with. A four aircraft diamond has thus remained the basic formation of the ‘Sherdils’.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the pilot}} in command had said he was {{entering}} the hold according to the Spanish air traffic controller's instructions, he actually turned the aircraft to the left towards the southeast into an area of high ground, where the minimum safe altitude was [...] When during the aircraft's descent towards [...] the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) activated, the crew reacted quickly and initiated a climb. With the engines on full power, the aircraft entered a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> {{to the right and}} struck mount La Esperanza at 13:21:15 local time. The aircraft was flying in clouds when it struck the mountain. The impact resulted in the aircraft's complete disintegration, killing everyone on board, and leaving a debris trail 350m long.|$|E
60|$|The {{trail to}} the upper range was wide and easy of ascent, the first of it winding under crags, the latter part {{climbing}} long slopes. It forked before the summit, where dark pine trees showed against the sky, one fork ascending, the other, which Piute took, beginning to go down. It admitted of no extended view, being shut in {{for the most part}} on the left, but there were times when Hare could see a curving stream of sheep on half a mile of descending trail. Once started down the flock could not be stopped, that was as plain as Piute's hard task. There were times when Hare could have tossed a pebble on the Indian just below him, yet there were more than three thousand sheep, strung out in line between them. Clouds of dust rolled up, sheets of gravel and shale rattled down the inclines, the clatter, clatter, clatter of little hoofs, the steady baa-baa-baa filled the air. Save for the crowding of lambs off the trail, and a jamming of sheep in the corners, the drive went on without mishap. Hare was glad to see the lambs scramble back bleating for their mothers, and to note that, though peril threatened at every <b>steep</b> <b>turn,</b> the steady down-flow always made space for the sheep behind. He was glad, too, when through a wide break ahead his eye followed the face of a vast cliff down to the red ground below, and he knew the flock would soon be safe on the level.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, Clapper was {{accepted}} into the Air Force pilot training program at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas. The training began with flying Cessna 172s, and then progressed to the T-37, a small twin-engine jet, nicknamed the “Tweety-bird”, because of the high-pitched sound of the engine. Clapper learned to do basic maneuvers, <b>steep</b> <b>turns,</b> and fly in formation.|$|R
50|$|The Adelaide-Crafers Highway {{extension}} came as {{a much-needed}} upgrade and replacement to the previous link road, the Mount Barker Road, which had been contoured to the Adelaide Hills, giving rise to many <b>steep</b> <b>turns,</b> ascending a tortuous route. The tightest hairpin turn on the Mount Barker Road became infamous as 'the Devils Elbow', often the site of car and semi-trailer accidents.|$|R
50|$|Three prototypes and 24 {{production}} aircraft were ordered, {{with the first}} of three prototypes flying in April 1917. It was found to have a poor climb performance and handling, with the ailerons being overbalanced, which tended to force the aircraft onto its back in <b>steep</b> <b>turns.</b> To try to solve its handling problems it was fitted with various designs of aileron and rudders.|$|R

50|$|A <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> in aviation, {{performed}} by an aircraft (usually fixed wing), is a turn that involves {{a bank of}} more than 30 degrees. This means the angle created by the axis running along both wings and the horizon is more than 30 degrees. Generally, for training purposes, steep turns are demonstrated and practiced at 45 degrees, sometimes more. The purpose of learning and practicing a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> is to train a pilot to maintain control of an aircraft in cases of emergency such as structural damage, loss of power in one engine etc.|$|E
50|$|Staircases {{lead from}} the cellar and second story to the rear kitchen wing. It has its {{original}} cooking hearth, complete with crane, and a brick oven that protrudes slightly from the rear wall. A small pantry made from old panel doors and other reused woodwork is in the passageway to the main block. A <b>steep,</b> <b>turning</b> staircase leads up to the garret.|$|R
5|$|Wind shear is also {{a hazard}} for {{aircraft}} making <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.|$|R

5000|$|It {{reportedly}} {{came toward}} the island from the east, flew towards the [...] "Pico Desejado" [...] (Wished Peak), made a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> and went away {{very quickly to}} the north-west.|$|E
50|$|A 45 degree bank turn is made {{by placing}} the {{indicator}} equidistant between the 30 and 60 degree marks. A 45 degree bank turn is usually {{referred to as a}} <b>steep</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 23 November 1943: A {{squadron}} aircraft {{crashed on}} the breakwater at Port Lyautey, during a practice depth charge run. The starboard wing tip touched {{the water in}} a <b>steep</b> <b>turn,</b> tearing off the wing. All hands were lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was very fast but lacking in stability and control. At 150 mph (241 km/h), <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> {{could not be}} made without applying full rudder. Engine overheating occurred during flight tests. The single centrally mounted radiator was replaced by two radiators mounted in the lower inner wings, but the problem was not fully cured. The small size of the cockpit restricted {{the movement of the}} pilot.|$|R
50|$|Since 2011, {{downtown}} {{has played}} host for the Red Bull Crashed Ice event. Crashed Ice is a winter extreme sporting event featuring ice cross downhill (or downhill ice cross) which involves downhill skating {{in an urban}} environment, on a track which includes <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> and high vertical drops. The event coincides with the Saint Paul Winter Carnival and draws crowds of more than 100,000.|$|R

50|$|This {{applies to}} cockpits with two seats (usually Pilot & Co-Pilot) {{arranged}} horizontally or abreast. Assuming the pilot performing the manoeuvre is positioned {{in the left}} seat (command seat) when a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> to the right is performed, the nose will appear to fall. Conversely, a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> to the left will {{make it seem like}} the nose is rising against the horizon. This is parallax error based purely on the pilot's vantage point and instinctively causes a pull back or a push down reaction on the control stick / column which is an incorrect reaction. A good way of eliminating the effect of this error is {{to keep an eye on}} the horizon and maintain the aircraft's position relative to the horizon line thereby allowing you to approximate the 45 degree angle the panel top creates against the horizon.|$|E
50|$|Maranakatte {{is located}} at a {{distance}} of 16 km from Kundapura on the way to Kollur and the village is also called Kanchinakodlu.There is a Brahmalingeshwara Temple which is located on the banks of river Brahmakunda in the northside which then takes a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> towards east which increases the beauty of the spot.|$|E
5000|$|The {{handling}} {{characteristics of the}} Interceptor {{have been described as}} [...] "alarming." [...] In <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> the elevator became ineffective, and the aircraft was prone to enter a spiral dive or a spin from such flight attitudes. The Mercury II engine suffered from persistent high oil temperatures. Test pilots gave a negative assessment of the Interceptor, causing it to be withdrawn from the F.20/27 competition.|$|R
5000|$|The LRI {{has been}} well {{received}} by STOL pilots and pilots of experimental or home-built aircraft. The LRI is very useful for short field landings, short field takeoffs, and slow speed maneuvers such as <b>steep</b> <b>turns,</b> <b>steep</b> climbs, and steep descents, and also allows pilots of fast or [...] "slippery" [...] aircraft to land {{with little or no}} float very reliably. Since the LRI is so useful at the critical lower end of the flight envelope, most pilots will use the LRI as a complement to the ASI, using the LRI for slow speed work and the ASI for cruising and navigational work.|$|R
40|$|An analyticl {{procedure}} {{developed to}} permit a systematic examination of rotorcraft flight dynamics in <b>steep</b> high-g <b>turns</b> is presented. The procedure {{is used in}} a numerical investigation of a tilt-rotor aircraft and three single-rotor helicopters that have different types of main rotor systems. The results indicate (1) that strong coupling in longitudinal and lateral-directional motions exists for these rotorcraft in high-g turns; (2) that for single-rotor helicopters, the direction of turn has a significant influence on flight dynamics; and (3) that a stability and control augmentation system that is designed {{on the basis of}} standard small-disturbance equations of motion from steady straight and level flight and that otherwise performs satisfactorily in operations near 1 g, becomes significantly degraded in <b>steep</b> <b>turning</b> flight...|$|R
50|$|Common {{first steps}} after an EFTO {{would be to}} fly at the best glide speed (VBG), retract flaps if {{airspeed}} permits, unlatch the door, and land straight ahead. Returning to the airport with a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> has a high probability of resulting in a stall or spin. Although it seems counter intuitive, the NTSB has recorded numerous fatal crashes due to this mistake.|$|E
5000|$|Approach {{conditions}} towards Freeland {{were poor}} {{due to the}} weather; there was restricted visibility, and conditions were ripe for icing. The plane's crew apparently attempted a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> to align the craft with the runway. This caused the plane to stall, which {{was followed by a}} spin. [...] The crew could not regain control, leading to the crash of the plane.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} statue {{once found}} on Mt. Radhošť, sculpted in 1929 by Albin Polasek, is now located in Frenstat's (Czech Republic) Town Hall. When the statue {{was moved to}} the mountain in 1931, the truck became stuck in a <b>steep</b> <b>turn,</b> and heavy rain accompanied by storm and lightning killed one of the soldiers. A second cast by Albin Polasek stands in the center of Prague's Zoo.|$|E
40|$|Thirteen human {{volunteers were}} exposed to weekly flights in which standardized, <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> were used to produce motion sickness. A {{combination}} of promethazine hydrochloride (25 mg) plus ephedrine sulphate (25 mg) {{was found to be}} equally as effective as the combination of 1 -scopolamine hydrobromide (0. 35 mg) plus d-amphetamine sulphate (5 mg). Droperidol (2. 5 mg) was indistinguishable from the placebo. It was concluded that the treatment of choice for motion sickness is promethazine plus ephedrine...|$|R
2500|$|The Hampden's flying qualities were {{typically}} {{described as being}} favourable; Moyes described it as being [...] "extraordinarily mobile on the controls". Pilots were provided {{with a high level}} of external visibility, assisting the execution of <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> and other manoeuvers. The control layout required some familiarisation, as some elements such as the hydraulic controls were unassuming and unintuitive. Upon introduction, the Hampden exhibited greater speeds and initial climb rates than any of its contemporaries while still retaining favourable handling qualities.|$|R

Certified for +6/-3 Gs and had {{standard}} four-point harnesses, skylights and jettisonable doors, {{along with}} a checkerboard paint scheme and removable seat cushions to allow parachutes to be worn by the crew. Type approved in 1977 and produced as 1978 to 1985 model years. The following aerobatic maneuvers are approved: chandelles, <b>steep</b> <b>turns,</b> barrel rolls, snap rolls, loops, vertical reversements, lazy eights, spins, aileron rolls, Immelmann turns, Cuban Eights and stalls (except whip stalls).|$|R
