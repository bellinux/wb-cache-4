Internal wears and tears of such systems {{can lead to}} catastrophic failures which affect system operation and endanger human lives in many cases. To avoid sudden failures, continuous monitoring, fault diagnosis, and failure prognosis are required. Prognostics as a discipline plays the major rule in impending failure prevention. Offline prognostics system focuses on maintenance and logistics operations whereas online prognostics focuses on maintaining safe operation. In a previous work we successfully developed an offline prognostics system for aircraft turbofan engines’ remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. In this paper we will show how we used the offline prognostics system as the baseline definition towards creating an online data-driven prognostics system <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>informed</b> real-time decisions.|$|R
40|$|Background: Neonatal {{respiratory}} distress syndrome, as {{a consequence}} of preterm birth, is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity during infancy and childhood. Survivors of preterm birth continue to remain at considerable risk of both chronic lung disease and long-term neurological handicap. Progesterone is involved in the maintenance of uterine quiescence through modulation of the calcium-calmodulin-myosin-light-chain-kinase system in smooth muscle cells. The withdrawal of progesterone, either actual or functional is thought to be an antecedent to the onset of labour. While there have been recent reports of progesterone supplementation for women at risk of preterm birth which show promise in this intervention, there is currently insufficient data on clinically important outcomes for both women and infants <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>informed</b> clinical decision-making...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of prenatal diagnosis programmes is to ensure women make informed decisions about testing. As few studies have operationalised informed decision making, {{it is unclear whether}} or not this objective has been attained. However, evidence suggests that (a) insufficient information is provided <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>informed</b> and autonomous decision making, and (b) women's knowledge of testing is often incomplete. It is unlikely, therefore, that all women make fully informed decisions. Aims: To describe the conditions <b>enabling</b> <b>informed</b> decision making; <b>to</b> operationalise and assess the informed decision making process; to evaluate the efficacy of decision analysis to facilitate informed decision making; to describe the factors associated with prenatal diagnosis decisions. Sample: Data from 128 prenatal diagnosis information giving consultations between a health professional and women receiving a screen positive triple test result were included for analysis. Methods: Theoretical and integrative reviews summarising prior empirical research; observational designs assessing the decision making process; a randomised control trial design evaluating the decision analysis intervention. The following materials were piloted: a checklist of information provided; a coding frame of information utilised; a consent form; a questionnaire completed at two time points. Results: Insufficient information about Down's syndrome and termination was provided by the health professional <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>informed</b> decision making. As many women employed a ‘screening out’ strategy to limit the information for assimilation, not all women made fully informed decisions. In the RCT (n = 106), 17 women chose no further testing. Compared with women receiving routine information, those allocated to the decision analysis consultation made more informed decisions, experienced less decisional conflict, were less falsely reassured and had longer consultations. Perceived social norm, expected-utility values and anxiety predicted women’s test decisions. Discussion: Decision analysis consultations were associated with more informed decisions than routine care. However, additional empirical research is required to ascertain what aspects of the decision analytic technique were associated with the facilitation of informed decision making. Recommended changes to routine clinical practice and women’s role in the consultation will be dependent on these subsequent findings...|$|R

40|$|Background Informed {{decision}} making is recognized as important in screening. Invitees should be provided with relevant information, <b>enabling</b> them <b>to</b> make an informed decision. This may be more difficult in ethnic minority and low socio-economic status groups. We aimed to assess the proportion of informed decisions {{to participate in a}} faecal immunochemical test (FIT) -based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening pilot and to explore differences in knowledge and attitude across various subgroups. Methods Asymptomatic persons aged 50 - 74 were invited to a second round of a Dutch FIT-based pilot screening programme for CRC. An information leaflet containing all information relevant <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>informed</b> {{decision making}} accompanied the invitation. Informed choice was assessed by a mailed questionnaire. Knowledge was elicited through 18 items and attitude towards screening through four items. Main outcome measure was the proportion of informed decision makers among participants. Differences between subgroups were evaluated using logistic regression. Results Of 5367 screening participants, 2774 (52 %) completed the questionnaire. Knowledge was adequate in 2554 (92 %); 2736 (99 %) showed a positive attitude towards screening. A total of 2525 persons had made an informed choice (91 %); male gender, low education level, non-Dutch ethnicity and not speaking Dutch at home were negatively associated with having adequate knowledge in multivariable analysis. Conclusion In FIT-based screening for CRC, the majority of responders made an informed decision to participate. However, we did not succeed in equally providing all population subgroups with sufficient information.
