We conduct a meta-analysis including 23 studies on coffee and cocoa plantations over a 26  year period. Our results show that, contrary to common perceptions, profitability and cost-efficiency are higher for small-scale <b>shaded</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite the lower yields for <b>shaded</b> <b>systems,</b> the lower costs per area and higher {{price per kilogram}} of coffee or cocoa causes <b>shaded</b> <b>systems</b> to perform better financially. This finding shows that the traditional indicator ‘yield’ is an inaccurate measure of financial performance when studying diversified systems, and that the more detailed indicators as net revenue or benefit-cost ratio should be used instead. Few studies specifically reported {{on the relationship between}} biodiversity and financial performance, providing divergent results, yet various papers showed a promising optimum relationship for intermediate levels of <b>shade.</b> Because <b>shaded</b> <b>systems</b> are known to correlate positively with biodiversity, we postulate that they can offer competitive business opportunities for small-scale farmers, while also contributing to biodiversity conservation.

40|$|Active <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> in {{buildings}} {{have emerged as}} a high performing shading solution that selectively and optimally controls daylight and heat gains. Active <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> are increasingly used {{in buildings}}, due {{to their ability to}} mainly improve the building environment, reduce energy consumption and in some cases generate energy. They may be categorized into three classes: smart glazing, kinetic shading and integrated renewable energy shading. This paper reviews the current status of the different types in terms of design principle and working mechanism of the systems, performance, control strategies and building applications. Challenges, limitations and future opportunities of the systems are then discussed. The review highlights that despite its high initial cost, the electrochromic (EC) glazing is the most applied smart glazing due to the extensive use of glass in buildings under all climatic conditions. In terms of external shadings, the rotating shading type is the predominantly used one in buildings due to its low initial cost. Algae façades and folding <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> are still emerging types, with high initial and maintenance costs and requiring specialist installers. The algae façade systems and PV integrated <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> are a promising solution due to their dual benefits of providing shading and generating electricity.

Brazil is the world largest coffee producer, {{with an average of}} 2, 300, 000 tons of green coffee in the last 5 years. Cultivation of organic coffee and shaded coffee are common in Central America, while in Brazil both conventional and organic coffee are cultivated in the full sun system.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, as {{fenestration}} and <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become more}} complex and sophisticated, a great improvement of thermal and solar-optical performance has been required {{and as a consequence}} old methods of characterization have become inadequate.

The suitability and usefulness of new parameters and models for a wide use depend on the level of knowledge of the interaction between fenestration systems and the external environment. In {{the first part of this}} work an analysis of incident solar radiation on fenestration has been performed, by using the climatic data contained in the average monthly days of some sites representative of the main Italian climatic zones. The ratio of direct solar radiation to diffuse solar radiation has been analyzed for different orientations of glazed surfaces and for different periods in the year.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the architectural integration of mobile external shielding devices with the building’s façade. In most cases these elements act as solar shading. For this reason, within the research, they are called by that name. The research mainly develops around the theme of environmental quality, strictly limited to the architectural integration of these mobile devices with the building’s façade. It concerns mainly the quality of open spaces but also of those internal. When we talk about environmental quality often it means an interest in microclimatic comfort. Recently the research tends to focus only on the energy aspects. These issues are left aside here, since the researches about energy-saving and microclimatic comfort sadly neglect some strategical aspects: {{in most cases the}} solar <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> do not fall within an architectural design and also they may affect the appearance of places, from single side to the urban front, to the entire city. This research deals with all the main aspects of this area: history of architecture, manufacturing of solar <b>shading</b> <b>systems,</b> legislation, bibliography, software, technological and environmental design. The main goal of this research was to identify technological and architectural parameters for the choice of external dynamic shielding devices. These parameters must allow the integration of shielding devices with the building’s façade in connection with the culture and the traditions of the places. The ultimate goal of this research was to produce guidelines for architectural design and a user-friendly software. These instruments are addressed to the world of architectural design, manufacturing and sales of solar <b>shading</b> <b>systems,</b> but also to local authorities for the improvement of building regulations. Among the identified parameters the main are: color, type and dimension of the shading elements related to the buildings and their relationship with the context. On these basis, over one hundred case studies of contemporary international architecture have been analyzed. The data emerged from the analysis were developed in graphs and were compared across, producing scientific results under the form of stochastic analysis of the sample studied.

Three shade matching methods were used to match twelve shade tabs under simulated clinical conditions using a Vita Classical shade guide: conventional visual shade matching using 3 human raters (VM – Visual method), photographic <b>shade</b> analysis <b>system</b> (CM - ClearMatch) using two different ways of normalizing the image (CM-A 2 and CM-ref respectively). Shade matching for all methods was completed at two separate sessions. The Kappa statistic was used to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater agreement. CIELAB values of the shade results were used to produce scatter plots as well as to calculate the color difference (delta E) between VM and CM groups. There was no inter-rater agreement between VM and CM-A 2 (k= 0. 000 and k= 0. 015 for the first and second sessions respectively) while VM and CM-ref showed weak agreement (k= 0. 244 and k= 0. 091 respectively). Intra-rater agreement was strong in all groups VM, CM-A 2 and CM-ref (0. 705, 0. 803 and 0. 681 respectively). CM-A 2 had 2 (8. 3 %) shade matches with a delta E of less than 2. 6 (clinically imperceptible), while CM-ref had 12 (50. 0 %) imperceptible matches.
