This master thesis {{has been}} revised and {{approved}} by: Advisor 1. Prof. Dr. I Ketut Seken, M. A., Advisor 2. Prof. Dr. Nyoman Padmadewi, M. A. Key words: GIST, learning style, reading comprehension, conventional reading technique This study concerned with experimental research which investigated {{whether or not}} there is any effect of Generating Interaction between Schemata and Text (GIST) and learning style on reading comprehension, and to investigate the relationship between the use of GIST, conventional reading technique and learning style. This study was carried out in SMA Dwijendra Bualu on grade XI students through a 2 X 4 true-experimental research design where the participants were homogenously The students in experimental group were taught using GIST while the students in control group were taught using conventional reading technique. Each group consisted of students with visual, aural, read-write, kinesthetic learning style. Therefore, there were eight groups altogether; <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with visual learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique with visual learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with aural learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique aural learning style. <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with read-write learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique with read-write learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with kinesthetic learning style, and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique kinesthetic learning style.

In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals.
