40|$|International audienceThe {{dark current}} {{produced}} by neutron irradiation in CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) is investigated. Several CIS with different photodiode types and pixel pitches are irradiated with various neutron energies and fluences {{to study the}} influence {{of each of these}} <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> and irradiation parameters on the dark current distribution. An empirical model is tested on the experimental data and validated on all the irradiated optical imagers. This model is able to describe all the presented dark current distributions with no parameter variation for neutron energies of 14 MeV or higher, regardless of the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> and irradiation characteristics. For energies below 1 MeV, it is shown that a single parameter has to be adjusted because of the lower mean damage energy per nuclear interaction. This model and these conclusions can be transposed to any silicon based <b>solid-state</b> <b>optical</b> imagers such as CIS or Charged Coupled Devices (CCD). This work can also be used when designing an optical imager instrument, to anticipate the dark current increase or to choose a mitigation technique...|$|R

In this paper, the design and testing of a surrogate retroreflector payload to assess key components of a modulated retroreflector payload is presented. In addition to passive retroreflectors, the surrogate payload has an optical beacon to aid in acquisition and tracking {{as well as an}} <b>optical</b> <b>detector.</b> The payload design is comprised of six subsystems: mechanical structure, optical electrical circuits, flight computer, retroreflectors, optical beacon, and <b>optical</b> <b>detector.</b> The mechanical structure has been tailored to accommodate the retroreflectors, while preserving roughly a 1. 5 U size.

40|$|In many applications, an <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> has to {{be located}} {{relative}} to mechanical reference points. One solution is to specify stringent requirements on (1) mounting the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> relative to the chip carrier, (2) soldering the chip carrier onto the printed circuit board (PCB), and (3) installing the PCB to the mechanical structure of the subsystem. Figure 1 shows a sketch of an <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> mounted relative to mechanical reference with high positional accuracy. The <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> is typically a fragile wafer that cannot be physically touched by any measurement tool. An optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) {{can be used to}} position <b>optical</b> <b>detectors</b> relative to mechanical reference points. This approach will eliminate all requirements on positional tolerances. The only requirement is that the PCB is manufactured with oversized holes. An exaggerated sketch of this situation is shown in Figure 2. The sketch shows very loose tolerances on mounting the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> in the chip carrier, loose tolerance on soldering the chip carrier to the PCB, and finally large tolerance on where the mounting screws are located. The PCB is held with large screws and oversized holes. The PCB is mounted loosely so it can move freely around. The optical CMM measures the mechanical reference points. Based on these measurements, the required positions of the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> corners can be calculated. The optical CMM is commanded to go to the position where one detector corner is supposed to be. This is indicated with the cross-hairs in Figure 2 (a). This figure is representative of the image of the optical CMM monitor. Using a suitable tapping tool, the PCB is manually tapped around until the corner of the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> is at the crosshairs of the optical CMM. The CMM is commanded to another corner, and the process is repeated a number of times until all corners of the <b>optical</b> <b>detector</b> are within a distance of 10 to 30 microns of the required position. The situation is sketched in Figure 2 (b) (the figure also shows the tapping tool and where to tap). At this point the fasteners for the PCB are torqued slightly so the PCB can still move. The PCB location is adjusted again with the tapping tool. This process is repeated 3 to 4 times until the final torque is achieved. The oversized mounting holes are then filled with a liquid bonding agent to secure the board in position (not shown in the sketch). A 10 - to 30 -micron mounting accuracy has been achieved utilizing this method. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Many {{optical fiber}} {{communication}} applications {{require the use}} of <b>optical</b> radiation <b>detectors.</b> Examples are <b>optical</b> radar, monitoring of laser power levels for materials processing, and laser metrology. There are different types of <b>optical</b> fiber <b>detectors</b> are available, these <b>optical</b> fiber <b>detectors</b> are covering the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. <b>Optical</b> <b>detectors</b> convert incoming <b>optical</b> energy into electrical signals.
