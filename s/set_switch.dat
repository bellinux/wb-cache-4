However, the contribution of these <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits to the primary motor symptoms of the disease is unclear. We investigated whether <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits contribute to gait and stepping problems in PD. By contrasting motor and cognitive <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> within the same paradigm, we investigated the nature of <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits associated with freezing of gait (FOG). METHODS: We integrated step initiation with <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> within one task and compared patients with and without FOG with healthy subjects. Motor <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> was defined as a change in stepping direction from one trial to the next. Cognitive <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> was defined as a change in task rule (ie, respond according to the shape or color of the presented stimulus). RESULTS: We found delayed motor switching in PD patients with FOG. We did not observe impaired cognitive switching. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that motor <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits, commonly reported in tasks using verbal or tapping responses, extend to stepping and can contribute to the occurrence of freezing episodes during gait initiation...|$|R

5000|$|If {{a switch}} becomes worn or the {{operating}} rods become damaged, {{it is possible}} for the flange to split the switch, and go through the switch in the direction other than what was expected. This happens when the flange strikes a small gap between the fixed rail and the <b>set</b> <b>switch</b> point (whichever is touching the main line); this forces the switch open, and the train is diverted down the incorrect track. This can either happen to the locomotive, in which case the whole train can be directed onto the wrong track, with potentially dangerous results, or it can occur at any point through the train, when a random truck is directed down a different track {{from the rest of the}} train; if this happens on the front truck of a car, the usual result is derailment, as the trailing truck of the preceding car attempts to go one way, while the leading truck of the following car tries to go another. If it happens to the trailing truck of a car, the front truck will follow one track, while the trailing truck follows a parallel line; this causes the whole car to [...] "crab", or move sideways down the track (derailment often results eventually, due to the lateral forces applied when the train tries to brake or accelerate). This can have disastrous results if there is any obstacle between the lines, as the car will be propelled into it sideways, such as happened in the 1928 Times Square derailment. In some cases, the whole train behind the car will follow the errant car onto the other track; in others, only one or a few trucks are diverted, while the rest follow the correct track. In cases where it is a simple siding, rather than a continuous parallel track, the diverted truck(s) can travel the whole length of the siding until it turns back to the main track, where it performs a trailing point movement, forces the switch open, and ends up back on the same track again, with only damage to the switches. This is far less likely in cases of diversion to a parallel track, since switches on both lines will often be interconnected, so to set the switch on the main line to straight-through will set the other switch to straight-through as well (otherwise there is a risk of turning off the track only to find the joining switch is set the wrong way, and running the train through it). Because derailments are expensive and very dangerous to life and limb, maintenance of switch points and other trackwork is essential, especially with faster trains. Another derailment that occurred due to a split switch is the ProRail Hilversum derailment on 15 January 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>SET</b> <b>switching</b> time of bipolar switching tantalum oxide thin films is studied using pulse measurement techniques. <b>SET</b> <b>switching</b> times are measured by repeating SET and RESET operations {{in a single}} cell. It is found that the distribution measured with a high RESET voltage can be well described by a steep Weibull distribution with a shape parameter > 1, but lowering the RESET voltage results in a broad distribution at high cumulative frequencies. Statistical analysis shows that this broadening of the distribution {{can be attributed to}} the variation of initial conditions for SET, whereas a steep Weibull distribution points to an aging process leading to SET under a voltage stress. It is also shown that although the power of the leakage current before SET determines the fastest limit of the <b>SET</b> <b>switching</b> speed, those <b>SET</b> in the broadened distributions are delayed due to gradual current increase prior to the SET. The waiting time for the start of the gradual current increase has a correlation with the power of the leakage current, showing that Joule heating effect is still a significant factor in the SET mechanism even if the SET time distribution is broadened due to the variation of initial states programmed by low RESET voltages...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the {{scheduling}} problem of adjusting to the fluctuations of a real-time system. We propose to model each variation as a new set of real-time tasks, which would be scheduled by the same or different scheduling policies. Under this model, while each scheduling policy must be able to schedule the corresponding task set, realtime requirements also must be met during the switch for tasks that persist through the switch. In this paper we use validity interval to define the real-time criteria and study the scheduling issues arise during the task <b>set</b> <b>switch.</b> We then get into more details by looking at switching between two polarizing fixed-priority scheduling policies, namely Rate-Montonic scheduling (RMA) and Deferrable Scheduling (DS-FP). ...|$|E

As expected, reaction time on cued switching trials decreased significant after rTMS, as compared to non-cued switch trials. No changes emerged after the placebo sham condition.

40|$|Abstract — Applications {{of stable}} {{matching}} in switch scheduling have been proposed. However, the classical GS stable matching algorithm is infeasible for high-speed implementation {{due to its}} high complexity. Instead, acyclic stable matching algorithms have been shown useful in implementing scheduling for highspeed switches/routers. In this paper, we model the acyclic stable matching problem as the dominating set problem for a rooted dependency graph, and propose a parallel algorithm for finding the dominating set in O(n log n) time. We design and implement a scheduler based on the proposed algorithm in hardware. Simulation {{results show that the}} number of 2 -input NAND gates and the timing of our design are proportional to n 2 and n respectively, making it feasible to be implemented at high speed with current CMOS technologies.

The targets were of the same color (no attentional <b>set</b> <b>switch</b> required) or of different colors (switch of attentional sets necessary), with each color consistently tied to a side, to allow observers to maximally prepare for the switch.

Furthermore, whenever one of the distractors had the color associated with the other attentional set, a substantial proportion of saccades did not end on the target, but on this distractor. A time course analysis revealed that this distractor preference turned into a target preference after about 250 – 300  ms, suggesting that this is the time required to switch attentional sets...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{temporal}} dynamics and capacity-limits of attentional selection and encoding, researchers often employ the attentional blink (AB) phenomenon: subjects 2 ̆ 7 impaired ability {{to report the}} second of two targets in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream that appear within 200 – 500 ms of one another. The AB has now {{been the subject of}} hundreds of scientific investigations, and a variety of different dual-target RSVP paradigms have been employed to study this failure of consciousness. The three most common are those where targets are defined categorically from distractors; those where target definition is based on featural information; and those where there is a <b>set</b> <b>switch</b> between T 1 and T 2, with the first target typically being featurally defined and T 2 requiring a detection or discrimination judgment (probe task). An almost universally held assumption across all AB theories is that these three tasks measure the same deficit; however here, using an individual differences approach, we demonstrate that AB magnitude is only related across categorical and featural tasks. Thus, these paradigms appear to reflect a distinct cognitive limitation from that observed under set-switch conditions...|$|E

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs {{the ability}} to shape {{postural}} responses to contextual factors. It is unknown whether such inflexibility pertains to compensatory steps to overcome balance perturbations. Participants were instructed to recover balance {{in response to a}} platform translation. A step was necessary to recover balance when the translation was large, whereas a feet-in-place (FiP) response was sufficient when the translation was small (i. e. no step). We compared step trials that required a switch away from the current postural <b>set</b> (<b>switch</b> trials: step trials that were preceded by FiP trials) with non-switch trials (i. e. step trials were preceded by identical step trials). 51 PD patients (59 +/- 7 years) were compared with 22 healthy controls (60 +/- 6 years). In a second analysis, we compared a subgroup of 14 freezers (PD-FOG) with a subgroup of 14 non-freezers (PD-noFOG; matched for age, gender and disease severity). Compared to non-switch trials, switch trials resulted in poorer step execution and more steps needed to recover balance. These switching effects were similar in PD patients and controls, and in PD-FOG and PD-noFOG patients. Overall, PD patients demonstrated poorer stepping performance than controls. PD-FOG had a worse performance than PD-noFOG. Moreover, PD patients, and particularly PD-FOG patients, were less able to improve step performance with repetitive step trials, in contrast to controls. Thus, there was no PD-related deficit to switch to an alternative response strategy, neither in patients with FOG nor in patients without FOG. Difficulty to adapt the step trial-by-trial might have contributed to the absence of switch deficits in PD...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{distinct}} event-related potentials (ERPs) {{have been recorded}} from the scalp of human subjects as they switch from one task to another. It is possible that task switching may depend on different mechanisms {{depending on whether the}} switch requires a change in attentional set, in other words the redirecting of attention to different aspects of a sensory stimulus, or whether it requires a change in intentional set, in others words a change in the way that responses are selected. To address this issue, the current study recorded ERPs while subjects switched between attentional sets and the results were compared with those of a previous investigation in which subjects switched between intentional sets. Subjects selected stimuli according to two conflicting attentional sets, each emphasizing one visual stimulus dimension (colour, shape). Pairs of stimuli, only one of which was to be attended, were presented for between eight and seventeen trials then either a switch or a stay cue was shown. The switch cue instructed subjects to switch from the current attentional set to the other set, while the stay cue instructed subjects to maintain the current set. Comparing ERPs time-locked to the switch and stay cues revealed neural correlates of the initiation of a task switch. Comparing the ERPs time locked to the first stimuli after either stay or switch cues identified neural correlates of the implementation of a task switch. A similar modulation over parietal electrodes was seen when subjects were switching between either attentional or intentional sets. While an intentional <b>set</b> <b>switch</b> began with a medial frontal modulation, attentional set switching began with a lateral frontal modulation. Implementing a new attentional set was associated with modulation of relatively early visual potentials, while implementing a new intentional set was associated with modulation of later response-related potentials. The results confirm that task switching consists of a number of constituent processes which may be taxed to different degrees depending on whether a task-switch paradigm requires subjects to change {{the way in which they}} select stimuli or responses...|$|E
