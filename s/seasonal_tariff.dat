This paper presents the findings of a small-scale research project that sought to explore customer attitudes to the use of water and its conservation, particularly in the context of seasonal tariffs used during the summer peak usage months (May to August). Study Design: The study adopted a qualitative approach, implemented through a series of face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted with domestic water users in Bishops Stortford, East Hertfordshire (UK). The research was carried out by staff from the School of Life and Medical Sciences at the University Hertfordshire. The study was conducted over a period of 6 weeks. Methodology: A series of 20 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were carried out with a pre-defined sample population. The selected customers were split into two equal sized groups depending on their relative water usage to reflect either an increase or a decrease in water usage [as a consequence of Affinity Water???s <b>seasonal</b> <b>tariff</b> trial]. Results and Discussion: The study highlights study participants as being disengaged from their water usage and the associated efforts to reduce their usage, so simply increasing water prices at seasonal peak usage times was not, on this occasion, an effective method to adopt to reduce domestic water usage. However, by subsequently exploring customer attitudes towards a selected range of alternative water conservation measures, such as the subsidisation of water efficient appliances, and rebates for reduced water usage, it is established that alternative water conservation measures may have the potential to more effectively encourage a reduction in water usage. However, as {{the findings of this study}} also serve to highlight, the issue of ???institutional trust??? emerges as a key issue to consider when seeking reductions in water usage by increasing its unit cost, with accusation of profiteering looming large. Conclusion: It is suggested that a richer mix of policy responses demand management will be needed to convince domestic water users of the need to reduce their water usage...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} role of {{transportation}} pricing in shaping the incentives of gas pro-ducers with market power. Two downstream gas producers, each located {{at one of the}} ends of a pipeline, serve two markets connected by the pipeline. When pipeline capacity is relatively large, there exists a symmetric equilibrium where the pipeline is not fully utilized. In this case, nodal pricing is not optimal: a budget-constrained and welfare-maximizing transportation operator (TSO) adjusts transportation tar-iffs upwards to account for the presence of downstream market power. When capac-ity is relatively small, an (essentially) unique asymmetric equilibrium exists where one firm lowers its exports until the pipeline is used at full capacity. In this case, gas flows into the market where the price is lower and it is optimal for the TSO to subsidize the reverse flow and tax the dominant one so as to mitigate market power to the extent possible. In this case too, second-best tariffs differ from the nodal pricing system. Our results therefore suggest that the use of <b>seasonal</b> <b>tariffs</b> is optimal...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn this study, we link a water {{resource}} management simulator to multi-objective search {{to reveal the}} key trade-offs inherent in planning a real-world {{water resource}} system. We consider new supplies and demand management (conservation) options while seeking to elucidate the trade-offs between the best portfolios of schemes to satisfy projected water demands. Alternative system designs are evaluated using performance measures that minimize capital and operating costs and energy use while maximizing resilience, engineering and environmental metrics, subject to supply reliability constraints. Our analysis shows many-objective evolutionary optimization coupled with state-of-the art visual analytics can help planners discover more diverse water supply system designs and better understand their inherent trade-offs. The approach is used to explore future water supply options for the Thames water resource system (including London’s water supply). New supply options include a new reservoir, water transfers, artificial recharge, wastewater reuse and brackish groundwater desalination. Demand management options include leakage reduction, compulsory metering and <b>seasonal</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The Thames system’s Pareto approximate portfolios cluster into distinct groups of water supply options; for example implementing a pipe refurbishment program leads to higher capital costs but greater reliability. This study highlights that traditional least-cost reliability constrained design of water supply systems masks asset combinations whose benefits only become apparent when more planning objectives are considered...|$|R

Northwest storage onion producers experience the greatest decline in production; however, analysis suggests that improved storage methods may offset {{a portion of the}} unfavorable impacts of liberalized trade on these producers. In spite of the unfavorable impact of free trade on U. S. dry onion producers, the industry would not be economically devastated. Key Words: dry onion, NAFTA, spatial and intertemporal model. Selected imports of horticultural products from Mexico compete with U. S. production, but histori-cally U. S. <b>seasonal</b> <b>tariffs</b> have mitigated much of this competition (Hanrahan). The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with its sched-uled phaseout of these tariffs, is generating concern among U. S. producers. Because of low labor costs in Mexico and the relatively important contribution of the labor input in horticultural production, U. S. producers argue that their ability to compete in the U.

This study examines the seasonal structure of demand for air passenger transportation in the North Atlantic market to determine the optimal fare structure. The analysis includes a discussion of historical and institutional factors which have influenced both present market structure and pricing policies. Specific attention is directed to the structure and functions of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The theoretical problems of optimal pricing of air transportation under seasonal demand conditions are discussed in the context of both international trade theory and public utility theory. In the discussion of international trade theory it is noted that optimal pricing entails the use of production taxes or subsidies as opposed to tariffs. From this observation, then, Rudiger Dornbusch's analysis of optimum trade intervention, when the choice of policy tools is restricted, serves as a basis for suggested optimal policy criteria. In addition, the analysis of Edward Tower has shown that if one country makes use of quotas and other countries retaliate with optimum tariffs the market can be expected to move to a position of zero trade. In the case of international air transportation, this would entail each country providing service in proportion to the volume of its citizens traveling overseas. Advocates of capacity controls have often suggested the use of this as a criterion for determining capacity limits. The <b>seasonal</b> application of <b>tariffs,</b> assuming the presence of seasonal differences in elasticities, implies different effects upon the domestic price ratios and the subsequent possibility of income transfers between consumers in the separate periods. The application of public utility theory to the problem of peaking demand in international air transportation suggests that the seasonal structure of fares can vary widely depending upon whether welfare or profit maximizing criteria are followed. In addition, however, the structure of costs (i. e., capacity versus operating costs), and seasonal differences in elasticity further alter the optimal fare structure. The combined effects of stochastic demand and rate-of-return constraints are also considered, using a model based upon the work of Sherman and Visscher, and Crew and Kleindorfer. The empirical analysis attempts to test for the presence of seasonal differences in elasticity of demand through the use of multiple regression analysis. Dummy variables are introduced to test for both intercept and slope changes using a log [...] linear demand function. The derived seasonal coefficients for fares suggest that demand is relatively inelastic in the peak period and elastic in the off-peak. In addition, examination of the present pricing structure and cost structure suggests that off-peak passengers are subsidizing peak period passengers. Given the relative inelasticity of peak period demand this result appears irrational under the assumption of either welfare or profit maximizing behavior. It is shown that such a pricing policy may be rational, however, if the elements of stochastic demand and rate-of-return constraints are introduced. Given an inelastic peak period demand, the present fare structure becomes rational only if rate-of-return constraints are relatively loose and if expected excess demand is relatively high in the peak period. The application of optimal trade intervention criteria also suggest that such results are consistent with theoretical expectations, given the correct combinations of domestic marginal propensity to import and foreign elasticity of demand for imports. The combined effects of trade intervention through production taxes (subsidies) and capacity limitations can then be expected to move the market to a point of zero trade...|$|R
