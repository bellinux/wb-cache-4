40|$|Summary. The {{retaining}} walls behavior {{is an interesting}} problem in the <b>soils</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Many of them are built without a clear knowledge of its mechanic behavior, because the most common theories about {{retaining walls}} only are accurate with some types of backfill. This paper presents a simple tool to simulate the retaining walls behavior by the Finite Element Method and numerical methods for non-linear structural problems.

25|$|Identification of soil {{properties}} presents {{challenges to}} geotechnical engineers. Boundary conditions are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties {{and behavior of}} soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on investigation. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear (stress-dependent) strength, stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying <b>soil</b> <b>mechanics</b> all the more difficult.|$|E

The shear strength of soils is primarily derived from friction between the particles and interlocking, which {{are very sensitive to}} the effective stress. The article concludes with some examples of applications of the principles of <b>soil</b> <b>mechanics</b> such as slope stability, lateral earth pressure on retaining walls, and bearing capacity of foundations.|$|E

He invented entirely new apparatus for the measurements and put in many long days of work to carry out the measurements himself. In 1924 he published much of it in his Magnum Opus, Erdbaumechanik (<b>Soil</b> <b>Mechanics),</b> which revolutionized the field to great acclaim.

Because it tracks {{conditions on the}} failure plane, it also provides close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something that other theories {{are not able to}} do. Additionally DSSM explains key relationships in <b>soil</b> <b>mechanics</b> that to date have simply been taken for granted, for example, why normalized undrained peak shear strengths vary with the log of the over consolidation ratio and why stress–strain curves normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-dimensional consolidation the void ratio must vary with the log of the effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for static load increments, and why the ratio of the creep value Cα to the compression index Cc must be approximately constant {{for a wide range of}} soils..|$|E
25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in <b>soil</b> <b>mechanics</b> to describe {{the magnitude of the}} shear stress that a soil can sustain. The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress. The stress-strain relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or residual strength.|$|E
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In <b>soil</b> <b>mechanics,</b> plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|E

In case of numerical analysis by ANSYS program, dominant frequency (DF) was computed by free vibration analysis. <b>Soil</b> <b>mechanic</b> tests for thirteen samples to design IDL formula were carried out. In terms of critical condition for earthquake effect such as resonance, five physical small models were tested using vibrator table under the dominant frequency with scale parameter 1 / 100. As a result, dam was significantly damaged without blanket layer IDL. In order to reduce damage, the best performance was observed using blanket layer (IDL) when this layer was expanded below the reservoir region. The reinforced thickness layer size is one-fourth of dam height. This method is a novel suggestion for earth dam design in seismic zone...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{constitutive}} models incorporate {{void ratio}} {{as a state}} variable. Advantage of these models is the possibility to use a single set of material parameters for modelling of soils with different degrees of overconsolidation. Experiments and model predictions were compared to find the range of application of a single set of material parameters for soils with different degrees of overconsolidation. First model predictions were compared {{with a set of}} experiments on kaolin clay (Hattab a Hicher, 2004) and than with a set of experiments on tertiary clay performed in laboratory of <b>soils</b> <b>mechanics</b> at Charles University as a part of this thesis. The models were evaluated by comparison of stress-strain curves and by one skalar measure of the prediction error. It is demonstrated that at least two sets of material parameters are required for all three models.

During the enquiry all involved in the construction - including the contractor, the head of the Public Works Department, the projects clerk of works and Lawson himself - gave evidence to support their competence. The enquiry decided that it was the architect who carried the ultimate responsibility, and Lawson was found both 'negligent and incompetent'.
