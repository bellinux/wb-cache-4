50|$|The <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> (as the {{earliest}} forms of carriage were known) {{can be traced}} to the fifteenth century. In 1718 the tool-supporting <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> with a set of gears was introduced by a Russian inventor Andrey Nartov and had limited usage in the Russian industry. In the eighteenth century the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> was also used on French ornamental turning lathes. The suite of gun boring mills at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in the 1780s by the Verbruggan family also had slide rests. The story has long circulated that Henry Maudslay invented it, but he did not (and never claimed so). The legend that Maudslay invented the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> originated with James Nasmyth, who wrote ambiguously about it in his Remarks on the Introduction of the Slide Principle, 1841; later writers misunderstood, and propagated the error. However, Maudslay did help to disseminate the idea widely. It is highly probable that he saw it when he was working at the Arsenal as a boy. In 1794, whilst he was working for Joseph Bramah, he made one, and when he had his own workshop used it extensively in the lathes he made and sold there. Coupled with the network of engineers he trained, this ensured the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> became widely known and copied by other lathe makers, and so diffused throughout British engineering workshops. A practical and versatile screw-cutting lathe incorporating the trio of leadscrew, change gears, and <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> was Maudslay's most important achievement.|$|E
50|$|The first fully documented, {{all-metal}} <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe {{was invented}} by Jacques de Vaucanson around 1751.

50|$|Lathes {{have been}} around since ancient times. Adapting them to {{screw-cutting}} is an obvious choice, but {{the problem of how}} to guide the cutting tool through the correct path was an obstacle for many centuries. Not until the late Middle Ages and early modern period did breakthroughs occur in this area; the earliest of which evidence exists today happened in the 15th century and is documented in the Mittelalterliche Hausbuch. It incorporates <b>slide</b> <b>rests</b> and a leadscrew. Roughly contemporarily, Leonardo da Vinci drew sketches showing various screw-cutting lathes and machines, one with two leadscrews. Leonardo also shows change-gears in some of these sketches.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, English {{instrument}} maker Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800) {{was working}} on the toolmaking and [...] end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771-1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.|$|E
50|$|A {{critical}} factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several machine tools, such as the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe, screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer.

50|$|Maudslay did not {{invent the}} slide-rest (as others such as James Nasmyth have claimed), {{and may not}} have been the first to combine a lead screw, slide-rest, and set of change gears all on one lathe (Jesse Ramsden may have done that in 1775; {{evidence}} is scant), but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw, <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> and change gears, sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads.|$|E
40|$|In many {{motorcycle}} accidents, {{the motorcycle}} {{falls to the}} ground and <b>slides</b> to <b>rest</b> following impact or loss of control. The determination of the motorcycle speed just prior to `fallover? is important for biomechanics research and for litigation.

The models represent both the mean and variation present in the available experimental data for dry roads very well and are used to develop confidence limits for accident reconstruction purposes, in cases where only the motorcycle slide distance along the ground is known. Previously proposed confidence limit criteria are applied to predicting motorcycle speed ranges from slide distance, and it is shown that the level of prediction uncertainty can be substantially reduced in cases where additional information specific to the vehicle and road configurations is available...|$|R

5000|$|Interchangeability {{of parts}} was {{achieved}} by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several machine tools, such as the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check {{the accuracy of the}} finished parts. [...] Electrification allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating line shaft drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible. Modern machine tools often have numerical control (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.|$|E
5000|$|Important early {{machine tools}} {{included}} the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine, pattern tracing lathe, shaper, and metal planer, which {{were all in}} use before 1840. [...] With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing interchangeable parts was finally realized. An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw fasteners such as nuts and bolts. Before about {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable. [...] Methods were developed to cut screw thread to a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used. This led to the bar length standards of the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1568, a {{separate}} fly wheel powered a lathe via a drive belt. A master {{would cut the}} wood while an apprentice turned the crank on a huge wheel, often several feet in diameter. This was a continuous revolution lathe, which led to adaptation to external power sources such as water, steam, and electricity. This lathe evolved into the 'queen of machine tools' which {{made it possible to}} turn parts for other machinery. The Holtzapffels developed ornamental turning lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic <b>slide</b> <b>rest.</b> These lathes worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as ebony. They were favored as a hobby by European princes, meriting a mention by Tolstoy in War and Peace (1869).|$|E
5000|$|Drop {{shotting}} {{is a high}} finesse {{technique for}} fishing plastic baits like Senko's, and consist of a small thin-wire hook with a weight attached to the tag {{end of the line}} about 12-18". This is in contrast to the more traditional Texas Rig, where the weight <b>slides</b> inline, <b>resting</b> on the nose of the bait, or the Carolina Rig, where the weight is fixed above the bait. The drop shot rig provides the ability to slack the line and twitch the rod, giving it an enticing wiggle on the way down. This simple, but versatile technique has endless combinations with the different hooks, soft plastics and weights that can be used.|$|R
50|$|To play a note clearly, the {{fingertips}} {{of the left}} hand should be pressed against the string just behind the appropriate fret.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a promising {{new approach to}} rigid body dynamic simulation called impulse-based simulation. The method is well suited to modeling physical systems {{with large numbers of}} collisions, or with contact modes that change frequently, All types of contact (colliding, rolling, <b>sliding,</b> and <b>resting)</b> are modeled through a series of collision im-pulses between the objects in contact, hence the method is simpler and faster than constraint-based simulation. We have implemented an impulse-based simulator that can cur-rently achieve interactive simulation times, and real time simulation seems within reach. In addition, the simulator has produced physically accurate results in several qualitative and quantitative experiments. After giving an overview of impulse-based dynamic simulation, we discuss collision de-tection and collision response in this context, and present results from several experiments. ...|$|R
