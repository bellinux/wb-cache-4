5|$|Most stones form {{due to a}} {{combination}} of genetics and environmental factors. Risk factors include high urine calcium levels, obesity, certain foods, some medications, calcium supplements, hyperparathyroidism, gout and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, <b>struvite,</b> cystine).|$|E
25|$|Bladder stones or uroliths {{are common}} in dogs. The stones form in the urinary bladder in varying size and numbers {{secondary}} to infection, dietary influences, and genetics. Types of stones include <b>struvite,</b> calcium oxalate, urate, cystine, calcium phosphate, and silicate. <b>Struvite</b> and calcium oxalate stones {{are by far the}} most common.|$|E

25|$|The {{drain pipes}} from {{waterless}} urinals {{need to be}} installed correctly in terms of diameter, slope and pipe materials {{in order to prevent}} buildup of <b>struvite</b> ("urine stone") and calcium phosphate precipitates in the pipes, which would cause blockages and could require expensive repairs. Also, the undiluted urine is corrosive to metals (except for stainless steel), which is why plastic pipes are generally preferred for urine drain pipes.|$|E
25|$|Cats on a {{vegan diet}} can develop {{abnormally}} alkaline (high pH) urine {{due to the}} more alkaline pH of plant-based proteins {{in comparison to the}} acidic pH of meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine pH becomes too alkaline, there is an increased risk of formation of <b>struvite</b> (also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate) bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur, but these do not occur if the urine is too alkaline, but rather if it is too acidic. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment.|$|E
25|$|Enteroliths in {{horses are}} round 'stones' of mineral deposits, usually of {{ammonium}} magnesium phosphate (<b>struvite)</b> but sometimes of magnesium vivainite and some amounts of sodium, potassium, sulfur and calcium, which develop within the horse's gastrointestinal tract. They can form around {{a piece of}} ingested foreign material, such as a small nidus of wire or sand (similar to how an oyster forms a pearl). When they move from their original site they can obstruct the intestine, usually in the right dorsal and transverse colon, but rarely in the small colon. They may also cause mucosal irritation or pain when they move within the gastrointestinal tract. Enteroliths are not a common cause of colic, but {{are known to have}} a higher prevalence in states with a sandy soil or an abundance of alfalfa hay is fed, such as California, a state where 28% of surgical colics are due to enteroliths. Alfalfa hay is thought to increase the risk due the high protein content in the hay, which would likely elevate ammonia nitrogen levels within the intestine. They may be more common in horses with diets high in magnesium, and are also seen more often in Arabians, Morgans, American Saddlebreds, Miniature horses, and donkeys, and usually occur in horses older than four years of age. Horses with enteroliths typically have chronic, low-grade, recurring colic signs, which may lead to acute colic and distention of the large colon after occlusion of the lumen occurs. These horse may also have had a history of passing enteroliths in their manure. Level of pain is related to the degree of luminal occlusion. Abdominal radiographs can confirm the diagnosis, but smaller enteroliths may not be visible. In rare instances, enteroliths may be palpated on rectal examination, usually if they are present in the small colon. Once a horse is diagnosed with colic due to an enterolith, surgery is necessary to remove it, usually by pelvic flexure enterotomy and sometimes an additional right dorsal colon enterotomy, and fully resolve the signs of colic. Horses will usually present a round enterolith if it is the only one present, while multiple entheroliths will usually have flat sides, a clue to the surgeon to look for more stones. The main risk of surgery is rupture of the colon (15% of cases), and 92% of horses that are recovered survive to at least 1 year from their surgery date.|$|E

50|$|Even in {{the absence}} of infection, {{accumulation}} of <b>struvite</b> crystals in the urinary bladder is a problem frequently seen in housecats, with symptoms including difficulty urinating (which may be mistaken for constipation) or blood in the urine (hematuria). The protein cauxin, a protein excreted in large amounts in cat urine that acts to produce a feline pheromone, has recently been found to cause nucleation of <b>struvite</b> crystals in a model system containing the ions necessary to form <b>struvite.</b> This may explain some of the excess <b>struvite</b> production in domestic cats. In the past, surgery has been required to remove <b>struvite</b> uroliths in cats; today, special acidifying low magnesium diets may be used to dissolve sterile <b>struvite</b> stones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Struvite</b> {{precipitates}} in alkaline urine, forming kidney stones. <b>Struvite</b> is {{the most}} common mineral found in urinary tract stones in dogs, and is found also in urinary tract stones of cats and humans. <b>Struvite</b> stones are potentiated by bacterial infection that hydrolyzes urea to ammonium and raises urine pH to neutral or alkaline values. Urea-splitting organisms include Proteus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Mycoplasma.|$|E

50|$|Urease {{production}} {{leads to}} precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds, {{which leads to}} <b>struvite</b> stone formation. <b>Struvite</b> stones are composed {{of a combination of}} magnesium ammonium phosphate (<b>struvite)</b> and calcium carbonate-apatite. <b>Struvite</b> stone formation can be sustained only when ammonia production is increased and the urine pH is elevated to decrease the solubility of phosphate. Both of these requirements can occur only when urine is infected with a urease-producing organism such as Proteus. Urease metabolizes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide: urea 2 NH3 + CO2. The ammonia/ammonium buffer pair has a pK of 9.0, resulting in the combination of highly alkaline, ammonia-rich urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Struvite</b> can be {{a problem}} in sewage and waste water treatment, {{particularly}} after anaerobic digesters release ammonium and phosphate from waste material. <b>Struvite</b> can form a scale on lines and belts, in centrifuges and pumps, clog system pipes and other equipment including the anaerobic digester itself. <b>Struvite,</b> also referred to as MAP, forms when there is a mole to mole to mole ratio (1:1:1) of magnesium, ammonia and phosphate in the wastewater. The magnesium can be found in soil, seawater as well as drinking water. Ammonia is broken down from the urea in wastewater, and phosphate, which is found through food, soaps and detergents. These elements in place, <b>struvite</b> is more likely to form in a high pH environment, where there is higher conductivity, lower temperatures, and higher concentrations of magnesium, ammonia and phosphate. Recovery of phosphorus from wastestreams as <b>struvite</b> and recycling those nutrients into agriculture as fertilizer appears promising, particularly in agricultural manure and municipal waste water treatment plants.|$|E

50|$|Many {{studies have}} {{concluded}} magnesium {{in the diet}} is a primary cause of <b>struvite</b> urolithiasis in cats. However, {{researchers have found that}} urine pH is a more important contributing factor. Urine that is acidic helps to dissolve <b>struvite</b> uroliths and also provides a less favourable environment for its formation.Commercial feline diets now limit the amount of magnesium and add acidifiers in the food to increase urine acidity, thereby reducing the likelihood of <b>struvite</b> formation. The decrease of <b>struvite</b> uroliths coincides with an increase in oxalate uroliths, low magnesium levels and urine pH both being a factor in calcium oxalate formation. Oxalate uroliths are not dissolvable in cat urine and have to be removed surgically, barring those small enough to pass out the urinary tract.|$|E

5000|$|Having <b>struvite</b> {{scale in}} a {{wastewater}} treatment system can lead to great inefficiency within the plant or operation due to clogging of the pipes, pumps and equipment.

Chemical cleaning is now predominately used to clear systems of <b>struvite.</b> Chemical cleaning products have been developed to remove and prevent <b>struvite</b> with minimal downtime. Even a chemical-free, electric method of removing and preventing <b>struvite</b> has been developed and tested successfully at wastewater treatment plants in the USA.
