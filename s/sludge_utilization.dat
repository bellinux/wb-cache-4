5000|$|Boris Revut {{was born}} in St. Petersburg, Russia to a {{scientific}} family. Already at the school he showed {{an interest in the}} natural sciences. He studied (1965-1970) organic chemistry at the Pedagogical University of St. Petersburg. During education he was also occupied with a scientific work in a new field of phosphor-organic chemistry (Abramov reaction), that was connected with the organic aminophosphonic acids. These analogies to amino acids, important constituents of proteins, possessed the quality of complex ligands and medicines. Revut graduated from the university and his diploma was distinguished {{as one of the best}} by the union competition of young scientists. Simultaneously he studied contemporaneous English (language and literature) at the same university. Revut took his doctor degree at the chemical department of Saint Petersburg State University in the area of colloid chemistry and nanotechnology. His dissertation was dedicated to a new direction of force microscopy. He developed a method of determination of interaction force, which enabled to carry out the measuring of connection between surfaces with different nature. A researcher observed practically the contact time, which the micro objects together remained. Accordingly, it would have been calculated through the theory of interaction of nano particles the force of the desired connection. It was possible to investigate with this method also the adhesion of the particles to macro surfaces as soon as the interaction of large biomolecules between themselves. This work preceded the invention of first force microscopes. For the latter invention three scientists Ernst Ruska, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer received the 1986 Physics Nobel Prize. The results of doctor's thesis Revut were taken in the textbooks of colloid chemistry [...]Later Revut worked over 20 years at the large state scientific enterprise of paper-pulp industry, where he went the way from an engineer up to a leading expert. He was busy with the environment protection), water purification, biotechnology and fine chemical processing. Throughout this extent he developed the methods of removal of metal ions, petroleum products, poisonous organic substances, hormones, pesticides and gaseous compounds. He elaborated the means for determination of heavy metals, trace elements, petroleum products, organic compounds, nano particles and bioactive substances in water and waste water. He improved the biotechnological processes of the yeast production, water purification and <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization.</b> His inventions were protected with more than 50 Russian patents and distinguished with prizes. In 1996-2002 he worked as a manager at the Institute of Biotechnology Applications in Environment Protection and Medicine in Hamburg. There he succeeded to implement some earlier scientific ideas of him. Since 2006 he engages as a writer. Meanwhile, he has written altogether 16 fiction and poetry books in Russian and German. In his novels he describes violent political and social themes of the past and present. His characters are representations of a lot of professions and social groups, who struggle for freedom and justice.|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{increased}} volumes of liquid sewage sludge being produced in the world annually, means of disposal and recycling have become a serious issue. The disposal of sludge onto agricultural lands has raised concern regarding its environmental implications. The concern stems from the presence of toxic substances often found in sludge which can be harmful to the environment. The <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization</b> programme in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo has shortcomings {{in the areas of}} site evaluation and monitoring, and setting an application agenda tied in with a weather forecasting system. These shortcomings combined with the physical characteristics of the sludge sites may be considered as hindrances to the safe and proper application of sludge onto agricultural lands. Comparing the guidelines which govern <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization</b> on agricultural lands and how they are implemented with those of other countries, suggests that in the Region of Waterloo (Ontario Ministry of the Environment) the standards for sludge quality permitted on land are high, however, implementation of guidelines must be rendered a more strictly monitored operation...|$|E

40|$|This report {{introduces}} the ENPI project called “EMIR - Exploitation of Municipal and Industrial Residues” which was executed in a co-operation between Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), Saint Petersburg State University of Economics (SPbSUE), Saint Petersburg State Technical University of Plant Polymers (SPbSTUPP) and industrial partners from both Leningrad Region (LR), Russia and Finland. The main {{targets of the}} research were to identify the possibilities for deinking sludge management scenarios in co-operation with partner companies, to compare the sustainability of the alternatives, and to provide recommendations for the companies in the Leningrad Region on how to best manage deinking sludge. During the literature review, 24 deinking <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization</b> possibilities were identified, the majority falling under material recovery. Furthermore, 11 potential utilizers of deinking sludge were found within the search area determined by the transportation cost. Each potential utilizer was directly contacted {{in order to establish}} cooperation for deinking <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization.</b> Finally, four companies, namely, “Finnsementti” – a cement plant in Finland (S 1), “St. Gobian Weber” – a light-weight aggregate plant in Finland (S 2), “LSR-Cement” – a cement plant in LR (S 3), and “Rockwool” – a stone wool plant in LR (S 4) were seen as the most promising partners and were included in the economic and environmental assessments. Economic assessment using cost-benefit analysis (CBA) indicated that substitution of heavy fuel oil with dry deinking sludge in S 2 was the most feasible option with a benefit/cost ratio (BCR) of 3. 6 when all the sludge was utilized. At the same time, the use of 15 % of the total sludge amount (the amount that could potentially be treated in the scenario) resulted in a BCR of only 0. 16. The use of dry deinking sludge in the production of cement (S 3) is a slightly more feasible option with a BCR of 1. 1. The use of sludge in stone wool production is feasible only when all the deinking sludge is used and burned in an existing incineration plant. The least economically feasible utilization possibility is the use of sludge in cement production in Finland (S 1) due to the high gate fee charged. Environmental assessment was performed applying internationally recognized life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies: ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. The results of a consequential LCA stated that only S 1 and S 2 lead to a reduction of all environmental impacts within the impact categories chosen compared to the baseline scenario where deinking sludge is landfilled. Considering S 1, the largest reduction of 13 % was achieved for the global warming potential (GWP), whereas for S 2, the largest decrease of abiotic depletion potential (ADP) was by 1. 7 %, the eutrophication potential (EP) by 1. 8 %, and a GWP of 2. 1 % was documented. In S 3, the most notable increase of ADP and acidification potential (AP) by 2. 6 and 1. 5 % was indicated, while the GWP was reduced by 12 %, the largest out of all the impact categories. In S 4, ADP and AP increased by 2. 3 and 2. 1 % respectively, whereas ODP was reduced by 25 %. During LCA, it was noticed that substitution of fuels causes a greater reduction of environmental impact (S 1 and S 2) than substitution of raw materials (S 3 and S 4). Despite a number of economically and environmentally acceptable deinking <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization</b> methods being assessed in the research, evaluation of bottlenecks and communications with companies’ representatives uncovered the fact that the availability of the raw materials consumed, and the risks associated with technological problems resulting from the <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization,</b> limited the willingness of industrial partners to start deinking <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization.</b> The research results are of high value for decision-makers at already existing paper mills since the result provide insights regarding alternatives to the deinking <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization</b> possibilities already applied.

Three composting reactors (A-the control, B-natural zeolite addition, and C- 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) addition) were established to investigate the influence of NI and natural zeolite addition on organics degradation and nitrogen transformation during sludge composting conducted at the lab scale. The results showed that, in comparison with the control, natural zeolite addition accelerated organics degradation and the maturity of sludge compost was higher, while the DMPP addition slowed down the degradation of organic matters. Meanwhile, the nitrogen transformation functional genes including those responses for nitrification (amoA and nxrA) and denitrification (narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ) were quantified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) to investigate the effects of natural zeolites and DMPP addition on nitrogen transformation. Although no significant difference in the abundance of nitrogen transformation functional genes was observed between treatments, addition of both natural zeolite and DMPP increases the final total nitrogen content by 48. 6 % and 23. 1 %, respectively. The ability of natural zeolite for nitrogen conservation was due to the absorption of NH 3 by compost, and nitrogen conservation by DMPP was achieved by the source reduction of denitrification.

They have interesting properties {{to be used as}} an alternative fuel, but also other characteristics must be considered {{from the point of view}} of its safe operation: the most important are ignition sensitivity, explosion severity, thermal sensitivity and thermal stability. The aim of this study was to determine if sewage sludge have different characteristics due to different locations or seasons and how this influences their flammability properties. To study these characteristics sludge samples were selected from different locations in Spain, taken during different seasons. In addition, relationships between flammability parameters and chemical analysis were observed. Some parameters can be controlled during normal operation, such as granulometry or humidity, and may mean a decrease in the risk of explosion. Those relationships are well known for other dusts materials, like coal, but not yet for sewage sludge dusts. Finally, properties related to spontaneous combustion were determined (thermal susceptibility and stability). The addition of those properties to the study provides an overview of the thermal behavior of sewage <b>sludge</b> during their <b>utilization,</b> including transport and storage...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{municipal}} sewage sludge (MSS) elementary analysis and energetic potential based on measurement of {{heat of combustion}} (higher heating value HHV) and calculation of calorific values (lower heating value LHV). The analysis takes into the consideration water content in sewage <b>sludge,</b> at different <b>utilization</b> stages, in wastewater treatment plants in Gdańsk Wschód and Kościerzyna – Pomeranian Voivodeship. The study yielded the following results (in % dry matter) : ash 19 ÷ 31 %, C - 31 ÷ 36 %, H - 5 ÷ 6 %, N - 4 ÷ 6 %, O - 28 ÷ 32 %, S – 1 %. Calorific value of stabilized sludges in Gdańsk was on average 13. 8 ÷ 15 MJ/kg. In case of sludges not undergoing digestion from Kościerzyna WWTP, the calorific value was {{at the level of}} 17. 5 MJ/kg. Thus, sewage sludges are good energy carriers. High water content though is the problem, as it lowers the useful effect of heat. There is no alternative for thermal sewage sludge neutralization, which is in conformity with valid Polish National Waste Management Plan (KPGO 2022) ...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental TechnologyTreatment of {{municipal}} wastewater produces {{large quantities of}} sludge that represents a cost for the individual wastewater treatment plant. Proper sludge treatment enables reuse of sludge, possibly as fertilizers. Fertilizer application of sludge is desirable since it improves the organic material reconstitution of the soil and implies recycling of nutrients. Negative aspects of sludge reuse are accumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the sludge, and fertilizers based on sludge can therefore {{be a source of}} pollution. At present, there are only regulations regarding heavy metals (HMs) for sludge reuse in Norway, however, more stringent requirements is inevitable as the European Union {{is currently working on a}} document on sludge and <b>sludge</b> <b>utilization</b> where maximum levels of other pollutants in fertilizers, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), will be determined. In this thesis, fate of POPs during the processes leading to bio pellets production at the municipal wastewater treatment plant Sentralrenseanlegg Nord-Jæren (SNJ) was examined. Fate of POPs and HMs in anaerobic digesters was determined based on modeling of PAH’s partitioning between sludge particles and water phase using the software AQUASIM. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the distribution of POPs and HMs in the processes of centrifugation and drying. Analyses of samples of spiked sludge, dewatered sludge, reject water, and dried sludge were done externally by Eurofins. Modeling of partitioning of PAHs between sludge and surrounding aqueous phase showed an approxumate setting of equilibrium within the first 10 hours after which almost all of the PAHs were found sorbed to the sludge. Experimental work showed that during the processes of dewatering THC (total hydrocarbon), PAH, PCB, and HM were all tightly bound to sludge whereas BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) was found to follow the reject water. During drying almost all remaining BTEX evaporated whereas THC, PAH, PCB, and HM were found in elevated quantities in the dried sludge, i. e. bio pellets...|$|E
