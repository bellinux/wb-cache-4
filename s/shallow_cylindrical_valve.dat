40|$|We use the {{continuity}} equation and the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations {{to study the}} flow-pattern characteristics around a turbine runner for the small-opening <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> of a hydraulic turbine. For closure, we adopt the renormalization-group k-ε two-equation turbulence model and use the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT to numerically simulate the three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flow through the entire passage of the hydraulic turbine. The results show that a low-pressure zone develops around the runner blades when the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> is closed in a small opening; cavitation occurs at the blades, and a vortex appears at the outlet of the runner. As the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> is gradually closed, the flow velocity over the runner area increases, and the pressure gradient becomes more significant as the discharge decreases. In addition, the fluid flow velocity is relatively high between {{the lower end of}} the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> and the base, so that a high-velocity jet is easily induced.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reported an}} experimental {{answer to the}} long-standing question of how three-dimensionality appears in wall-bounded magnetohydrodynamic flows and presented also an experimental study on the transition to turbulence in a confined, mostly quasi two-dimensional flow. Accordingly, it was shown the analysis of a vortex array with susceptibility to three-dimensionality, enclosed in a cubic container and a mostly, quasi two-dimensional vortex pair confined by {{the walls of a}} <b>shallow,</b> <b>cylindrical</b> container. Both containers were hermetically filled by a liquid metal fluid and subject to a constant, homogeneous magnetic field. The flow forcing was made by injecting constant electric current from one wall that intersects magnetic field lines (Hartmann wall). Flow characteristics and the presence of three-dimensionality were monitored by measuring electric potentials on either Hartmann walls that confined the liquid metal. A form of three-dimensionality termed as weak appeared through differential rotation along the axis of individual vortices, while a strong form manifested itself in vortices that do not extend {{from one to the other}} Hartmann wall. In the cubic container, this resulted into an array of novel, spectacular flow structures that were both steady and strongly three-dimensional, and, yielded to a frequency-selective breakdown of quasi two-dimensionality in chaotic and turbulent flow regimes. The mostly quasi two-dimensional flow in the <b>shallow,</b> <b>cylindrical</b> container was shown to undergo a sequence of supercritical bifurcations to turbulence triggered by boundary layer separations from the circular wall. For very high forcing, the flow reached a turbulent regime where the dissipation increased drastically. This was related to a possible transition from a laminar to a turbulent Hartmann layer...|$|R

40|$|Variable-stiffness panels have {{previously}} shown enhanced buckling performance compared to constant-stiffness panels, {{due to the}} beneficial load and stiffness redistribution. Two semianalytical models based on the Galerkin method and the Ritz method have been developed in order to solve the buckling problem of variable-stiffness composite panels (plates and <b>shallow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> shells). The laminates considered {{are assumed to be}} symmetric, which results in zero extensionbending couplings. However, the bending-twisting couplings, D 16 and D 26, are retained in the model due to their dramatic influence on the convergence of the predicted buckling loads. In the first model the governing equations for composite plates and <b>shallow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> shells with variable stiffness are derived and then solved using the Galerkin method. The variable stiffness in this model is approximated using two-dimensional Fourier series, which, however, appears to be less accurate and less efficient as compared to the Ritz method. The Ritz method avoids using Fourier series to approximate the stiffness. Instead, the stiffness is exactly expressed in the integral of the energy functional. The detailed derivations of the energy functional which were rarely shown in literature have been presented. The buckling analysis of this model comprises two main steps. First, the in-plane loads are calculated by applying the principle of minimum complementary energy in pre-buckling state. Second, the critical buckling loads are determined from the stability equations which are obtained from the total energy functional through applying either adjacent equilibrium criterion or the principle of minimum potential energy. The total energy functional for stability analysis in this model is expressed in terms of out-of-plane displacement and the Airy stress function, which appears to be a combination of negative membrane complementary energy, bending strain energy and external work. In order to ensure fast convergence, several shape functions used in Ritz method were investigated. The in-plane loads were approximated either using the beam characteristic function or polynomial function that were orthogonalized by the Gram-Schmidt process. In addition, the predictions of in-plane loads using sine and cosine function that do not satisfy the boundary conditions of in-plane loads were significantly improved by using Lagrange multiplier method. The out-of-plane displacement was approximated using either sine function or orthogonalized polynomials. The influence of the shape functions on the convergence of the predicted buckling load was analysed and discussed for different examples. These examples included plates and shells with either constant-stiffness or variable stiffness, within which D 16 and D 26 were either zero or non-zero. The boundary conditions considered for these examples were four-edge simply-supported in current thesis. However, the developed model can be easily extended to consider other boundary conditions. The model can solve the buckling problem of variable-stiffness panels under prescribed inplane loads (¯Nx, ¯Ny, ¯Nxy) or prescribed in-plane displacements (¯u, ¯v). In the current thesis, only the prescribed loads ¯Nx, ¯Nxy and the prescribed end-shortenings ¯u have been investigated and compared to Abaqus model; all the results satisfactorily match the results of Abaqus models. In addition, the model have been proved to be able to predict the buckling loads of <b>shallow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> shells with variable curvatures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{results on}} chaotic vibrations of a <b>shallow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> shell-panel under harmonic lateral excitation. The shell with a rectangular boundary is simply supported for deflection {{and the shell}} is constrained elastically in both in-plane directions. The effects of bi-axial in-plane elastic constraint on the chaotic behaviors of the shell are focused on. Using the Donnell-Mushtari-Vlasov type equation modified with an inertia force, the basic equation is reduced to nonlinear differential equation of a multiple-degree-of-freedom system by the Galerkin procedure. To estimate regions of the chaos, first, nonlinear responses of steady state vibration are calculated by the harmonic balance method. Next, time progresses of the chaotic response are obtained numerically by the Runge-Kutta-Gill method. The chaotic responses due to dynamic snap-through are examined by Fourier spectrum, Poincare projection and Lyapunov exponent. Contribution of multiple modes of vibration to the chaos is examined carefully by the Lyapunov dimension. The main results can be summarized as follows.

By defining steady state and transient stability boundaries, frequency regimes of instability may be identified such that they may be avoided in design. Initially a steady state analysis is performed; resonance response curves in the forcing plane are presented and the main instabilities are identified. Finally, the global transient response of the system is investigated in order to quantify the degree of safety of the shell in the presence of small perturbations. Since the initial conditions, or even the shell parameters, may vary widely, and indeed are often unknown, attention is given to all possible transient motions. As parameters are varied, transient basins of attraction can undergo quantitative and qualitative changes; hence a stability analysis which only considers the steady-state and neglects this global transient behavior, may be seriously non-conservative...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} rotating convection in a <b>shallow,</b> <b>cylindrical</b> domain. We {{examine the}} conditions under which the resulting vortex develops an eye at its core; that is, a region where the poloidal flow reverses and the angular momentum is low. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to steady, axisymmetric flows in a Boussinesq fluid. Our numerical experiments show that, in such systems, an eye forms as a passive response {{to the development of a}} so-called eyewall, a conical annulus of intense, negative azimuthal vorticity that can form near the axis and separates the eye from the primary vortex. We also observe that the vorticity in the eyewall comes from the lower boundary layer, and relies on the fact the poloidal flow strips negative vorticity out of the boundary layer and carries it up into the fluid above as it turns upward near the axis. This process is effective only if the Reynolds number is sufficiently high for the advection of vorticity to dominate over diffusion. Finally we observe that, in the vicinity of the eye and the eyewall, the buoyancy and Coriolis forces are negligible, and so although these forces are crucial to driving and shaping the primary vortex, they play no direct role in eye formation in a Boussinesq fluid.

All the computations resulted in axisymmetric steady rolls. The values of the averaged Nu, the averaged velocity components U, V, and W, and the isothermal distributions and flow patterns were almost completely the same, regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of the term of fsc. As a result, we found that the effect of fsc was extremely small, although much previous research emphasized the effect with paramagnetic solutions under an unsteady state. The magnitude of fsc depends not only on magnetic conditions (magnitudes of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic flux density), but also on the thermal properties of the solution (thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and viscosity). Therefore the effect of fb becomes dominant on the magnetothermal convection.
