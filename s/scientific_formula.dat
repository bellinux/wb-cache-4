It is only about things that do not interest one that one can give a really unbiassed opinion, which is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always absolutely valueless. The man who sees {{both sides of a}} question, is a man who sees absolutely nothing at all. Art is a passion, and, in matters of art, Thought is inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluid rather than fixed, and, depending upon fine moods and exquisite moments, cannot be narrowed into the rigidity of a <b>scientific</b> <b>formula</b> or a theological dogma. It is to the soul that Art speaks, and the soul may be made the prisoner of the mind {{as well as of the}} body. One should, of course, have no prejudices; but, as a great Frenchman remarked a hundred years ago, it is one's business in such matters to have preferences, and when one has preferences one ceases to be fair. It is only an auctioneer who can equally and impartially admire all schools of Art. No; fairness is not one of the qualities of the true critic. It is not even a condition of criticism. Each form of Art with which we come in contact dominates us for the moment to the exclusion of every other form. We must surrender ourselves absolutely to the work in question, whatever it may be, if we wish to gain its secret. For the time, we must think of nothing else, can think of nothing else, indeed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper is}} devoted to the results of the Filimage system using Internet {{oriented}} technologies. Our solution is applied to textual documents and the main objective is to provide efficiency the e-document extraction containing mathematical objects. This work deals with the problem of the <b>scientific</b> <b>formulas</b> and the process designed to enable a semantic filtering. The significant interest of the adapted strategy is to bring out the multimedia contents use to perform an information retrieval. We introduce a description of the Contextual exploration method which is carried out for the text semantic filtering. Based on the access to user-relevant information, the system lies on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify the visual components (formulas, tables, diagrams, images [...] .) and the textual extracts at the same time which be used as their comments by A. M. A (Automatic Matching and Associating) operation. The paper gives an overview of the development and shows how is implemented the system. In order to illustrate the results of this process, we expose them by a visualization example containing automatic extracted <b>scientific</b> <b>formulas.</b> At last, we present how the extracted information are stored (<b>scientific</b> <b>formulas,</b> textual comments, title…) for a subsequent using of the results...|$|R
60|$|As one {{passes to}} the rest of the volume, one finds essays on Wordsworth and on Coleridge, on Charles Lamb and on Sir Thomas Browne, on some of Shakespeare's plays and on the English kings that Shakespeare fashioned, on Dante Rossetti, and on William Morris. As that on Wordsworth seems to be Mr. Pater's last work, so that on the singer of the Defence of Guenevere is {{certainly}} his earliest, or almost his earliest, and it is interesting to mark the change that has taken place in his style. This change is, perhaps, at first sight not very apparent. In 1868 we find Mr. Pater writing with the same exquisite care for words, with the same studied music, with the same temper, and something of the same mode of treatment. But, as he goes on, the architecture of the style becomes richer and more complex, the epithet more precise and intellectual. Occasionally one may be inclined to think that there is, here and there, a sentence which is somewhat long, and possibly, if one may venture to say so, a little heavy and cumbersome in movement. But if this be so, it comes from those side-issues suddenly suggested by the idea in its progress, and really revealing the idea more perfectly; or from those felicitous after-thoughts that give a fuller completeness to the central scheme, and yet convey something of the charm of chance; or from a desire to suggest the secondary shades of meaning with all their accumulating effect, and to avoid, it may be, the violence and harshness of too definite and exclusive an opinion. For in matters of art, at any rate, thought is inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluid rather than fixed, and, recognising its dependence upon moods and upon the passion of fine moments, will not accept the rigidity of a <b>scientific</b> <b>formula</b> or a theological dogma. The critical pleasure, too, that we receive from tracing, through what may seem the intricacies of a sentence, the working of the constructive intelligence, must not be overlooked. As soon as we have realised the design, everything appears clear and simple. After a time, these long sentences of Mr. Pater's come to have the charm of an elaborate piece of music, and the unity of such music also.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{aggressive}} war {{may not be}} expressed with the precision of a <b>scientific</b> <b>formula,</b> or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like {{the operation of the}} laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both {{from the point of view}} of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue ... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples ... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907 ... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace. When a nation employs a deceit and treachery, using periods of negotiations and the negotiations themselves as a cloak to screen a perfidious attack, then there is a prime example of the crime of all crimes.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of biomass is becoming vital for selling carbon into {{national and international}} markets. Being a dry continent, Australia’s natural forest has several shrub species. However, because of limited availability of methodology and difficulty in estimation they are unaccounted for in many cases. This paper has three objectives: (a) to address the major problem in multiple regressions, (b) to develop the best allometric equation for the biomass {{estimation of}} a popular shrub species, wild raspberry (Rubus probus) and (c) to prepare a teaching tool, by following systematic and logical steps, for biomass estimation using ForecastXTM software. We identified the possible explanatory variables, by discussing with experts and citing literature, for shrub biomass and then measured them by destructive sampling at Taabinga, near Kingaroy, Queensland. Our research suggests that careful analysis of correlation matrices gives very important clues to which variables we should select and which we should not for the models. High multicollinearity among the independent variables {{is a major problem}} in multiple regressions. This study shows that this problem could easily be solved by using basic <b>scientific</b> <b>formula</b> and applying a single variable instead of applying many highly correlated variables in the model. Unlike most statistical books, our analysis does not suggest to reject that variable from the model whose coefficient is not statistically significantly different from zero as it could be highly influential in another set of combination. Similarly, we recommend using the 'intercept' even if its value is not significantly different with zero as it does not cost extra money to be included but it does help the predictive power of the model. Although we developed a range of biomass prediction models (for wild raspberry) {{that can be used in}} different circumstances, our first recommendation is for the model which is based on girth and crown volume. Where cost is the major issues, we prefer the model which employs girth and crown area, as it gives a good result and needs only three variables to be measured. These findings can be helpful in teaching the practical applications of multiple regression in courses such as Data Analysis and Business Forecasting. ...|$|E
40|$|Taking the {{empirical}} debates and gaps, the main objectives {{of this study}} was to assess the trends and patterns of FDI, to investigate the Short Run (SR) and Long Run (LR) determinants and impacts of FDI on the Ethiopian economy through three basic channels which include real Gross Domestic Product Per capital (GDPP), Human Capital Development (HCD), and Domestic Investment (DI). The study used an Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDLM) with a Bound Test for Co-integration for analyzing the multivariate time series data which covers from 1992 - 2012; and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression estimations was employed in exploring the SR and LR relationship of the variables specified in 5 econometric equations which all satisfy the different goodness-fit-tests. In addition to this the study used a three stage sampling techniques (purposive, stratified and simple random sampling) and using <b>scientific</b> <b>formula</b> draw 93 FDIs as a sample size of the study. Then the primary data were collected from 76 FDIs through a five stage likerts scale type of questionnaire. Then the study took the triangulation effect of the two findings to strengthen the base of the conclusions it made. The study found that having an increasing trend, the pattern of FDI flow is highly volatile and is highly contracted in the periods of political turbulence mainly in the period of power transitions, in the period of border war and the 2005 national election. In the investigation to determinant the study found that the lagged FDI, DI, trade liberalization, economic growth, infrastructure (telecom and road networks) political stability attract FDI favorably. However the macroeconomic instability (inflation rate and exchange rate), the human capital, market size are unfavorable to attract FDI with some exception in LR and SR dynamics. In analyzing the impact the study found that; the economic power of the nation is not strong to reap the benefits of FDI in the SR, FDI has insignificant effect to HCD but SR negative effect and LR positive effect to both GDPP and DI. Doing on the HCD and creating a vertical integration among the FDIs and DIs, a due revision on the macroeconomic policy are few of the many recommendations forwarded by this study...|$|E
40|$|In {{society today}} music use by athletes and {{exercise}} enthusiasts alike has become extremely popular, however the music selection process is typically quite personal and based often on intuition {{rather than any}} type of <b>scientific</b> <b>formula.</b> Some people say {{a certain type of}} music motivates them, some people suggest it is a certain beat or tempo and some people say it is any type of music at all. One thing that is commonly agreed upon however is that for whatever reason the music seems to make exercising more enjoyable. Thus, the present review of literature on music use during exercise is to develop an understanding of the scientific evidence as a basis for the finds that music can assist in exercise performance. The proposed benefits of using music in the exercise setting have intrigued researchers for quite some time even before portable music devices were easily accessible to the general public. There is a whole body of literature that suggests that during repetitive endurance-type activities ' motivational' music can decrease rates of perceived exertion and can lead to a positive impact on exercise performance measures. However, what has not been conclusively shown is whether listening to music has a purely psychological effect, a physiological effect, or a psychophysical effect on the participant and their responses to exercise. The actual mechanisms that are responsible for the beneficial effects music can have on exercise performance are still equivocal. Thus, future research is necessary to develop {{a better understanding of the}} effect and effect limitations of listening to music for improved exercise performance. [...] Evidence indicates that music can have a psychological effect by decreasing rate of perceived exertion and increasing exercise enjoyment. However, it has yet to be concluded whether listening to music affects the physiological responses to exercise, specifically with respect to high intensity or maximal work efforts. The purpose of this study was to assess the following physiological responses: heart rate (HR), ventilatory kinetics, time to task failure (TTF) and blood lactate (BL), as well as perceived exertion; while exercising and listening to high tempo music, all set at a tempo of 130 bpm. The exercise entailed interval training at 80 % of an individual's peak power output (PPO) as assessed during incremental maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) test on a stationary bicycle. The main finding in this study was that the participant's TTF when listening to music during their exercise performance was significantly greater (p< 0. 05), by one minute, than when exercising without music. Exercise heart rate was not significantly affected by music, however heart rate recovery was significantly faster by 13 bpm following the music condition (p< 0. 05). Additionally, participants had higher blood lactate levels and they rated their perceived exertion to be lower at the same or greater workloads when listening to music (p< 0. 05). Lastly, a higher breathing frequency was recorded with music (p< 0. 05). The results demonstrate that listening to music during high intensity exercise results in physiological changes. The results also support the theory that music can contribute to prolonged exercise durations at higher intensities with lower perceived exertion...|$|E
