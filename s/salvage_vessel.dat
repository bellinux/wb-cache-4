5|$|Piper Maru, a French <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel,</b> is {{exploring}} the Pacific Ocean. Gauthier, {{a member of}} the ship's crew, dives down into the sea and finds a sunken fighter plane from World War II. He is shocked to find a man alive in the plane's cockpit, with what looks like black oil in his eyes. When Gauthier returns to the surface, he has become possessed by the black oil.|$|E
5|$|When {{the agents}} go to Allentown, Pennsylvania {{to track down}} the {{distributor}} of the tape, they find him murdered. At the scene, they pursue and capture a Japanese man, Kazuo Sakurai, who is identified as a high-ranking diplomat. Walter Skinner appears and orders Sakurai released. Before doing so, Mulder searches his briefcase and finds both a list of Mutual UFO Network members and satellite images of a ship. The Lone Gunmen identify the ship as the Talapus, a <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> docked in Newport News, Virginia. Meanwhile, Sakurai is killed by an assassin called the Red-Haired Man.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, the {{question}} was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.|$|E

5|$|In September 1923, new {{regulations}} were promulgated, dividing the navy into a fleet, a river flotilla, and naval aviation. Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in Zemun, near Belgrade. The Navy Department, {{now known as}} Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions. The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, {{and by the end}} of 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four Kaiman-class torpedo boats, six s, four Schichau-class minesweepers, the water carrier Perun (ex-Cyclop), the yachts Vila (ex-Dalmat) and Lada (ex-Quarnero), the training ship Vila Velebit, the <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Moćni (ex-Gigant), and four tugs. Kumbor (ex-Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf) had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as Vardar, Drava, Morava and Sava respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three river tugs.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E
5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E
50|$|Later that month, though, Windlass and Salvager again went to sea via Charleston, {{this time}} to 31°19'N/80°58'W, to search for YTB-274. Aided by a blimp, the two <b>salvage</b> <b>vessels</b> {{streamed}} sweep wires and eventually located the sunken wreck of the YTB on 21 October. Windlass and Salvager went into three-point moors over the sunken ship and commenced salvage operations. They recovered one body on 27 October before they blew up the wreck on 2 November to prevent its becoming a navigational menace. After exercises on their return voyage, the two <b>salvage</b> <b>vessels</b> made port at Bayonne on 3 November.|$|R
50|$|After the Russo-Japanese War, the IJN {{purchased}} many steamships {{and converted}} them to <b>salvage</b> <b>vessels.</b> However, {{by the beginning}} of the 1930s, replacements were needed, to this end the IJN introduced the Tategami-class.|$|R
5000|$|RFA King Salvor (A291), {{initially}} HMS King Salvor (W191), was {{the lead}} ship of a class of 12 <b>salvage</b> <b>vessels</b> of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. A 13th ship was completed as a submarine rescue vessel for the Royal Navy as [...]|$|R
25|$|After the {{cessation}} of hostilities, Halifax was paid off from the RCN on 12 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She {{was transferred to the}} War Assets Corporation and sold later that year as the mercantile (<b>salvage</b> <b>vessel)</b> Halifax. The ship was deleted in December 1963.|$|E
25|$|Locals were {{thankful that}} the wreck was mostly cargo, so {{the risk of}} {{pollution}} was much less than it could have been, {{such as in the}} aftermath of the Torrey Canyon oil spill. The specialist <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Salvage Chief removed 90 tonnes (98%) of fuel from the Cita before she sank, leaving only a minor oil slick. Oiled sand on Porth Hellick beach, part of the Isles of Scilly SSSI, was removed by excavation. Three tugs were summoned to collect the containers drifting around the Celtic Sea.|$|E
25|$|The Committee {{handled the}} {{small-scale}} diving operations and underwater {{surveys of the}} Mary Rose wrecksite until 1979, when {{it was decided that}} the remnants of the ship should be fully excavated and salvaged. This required considerable financial means and a considerably larger organisation, leading to the foundation of the Mary Rose Trust. Prince Charles acted as its president and Margaret Rule archaeological director in charge of excavating and preparing the wreck of the Mary Rose for salvage. The project had already received considerable media attention as well as large donations with which the <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Sleipner was purchased.|$|E

50|$|The <b>salvaged</b> <b>vessel</b> was {{returned}} to Eilean Sea Services. John Rose had formed Western Ferries with investment from many commercial interests in Islay and Jura. They bought the Isle of Gigha and had additional buoyancy fitted at overhaul, increasing her range of stability. She re-emerged as Sound of Gigha.|$|R

25|$|On 15 February {{when the}} British {{surrendered}} at Singapore, the Japanese pincers closed on Java. A fleet of 41 transports originating at Jolo in the Philippines were heading {{straight down the}} Makassar Strait and, after a single stop at Balikpapan, moved out across the Java Sea. A second fleet, even larger, was coming {{down out of the}} China Sea around the western curve of Borneo against Batavia and Western Java. The men on the bomber fields in Java received the news of Singapore's surrender as forewarning of their own defeat. Attacks were flown against the fleets heading towards Java, but the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Commission credited the Army airplanes of all Allied Air forces in the theater with no more than three minesweepers, four passenger or cargo vessels, and one converted <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> sunk, and a part in the sinking of two other cargo vessels.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{during the}} cold war era, Hughes was {{approached}} by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. The recovery plan used the special-purpose <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Glomar Explorer. In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel. However, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents were released, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters during a burglary in June 1974. Though he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project. The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean Inc. (an offshore oil and gas drilling rig company) and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices.|$|E
500|$|Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{had long}} been {{interested}} in finding Titanic. Despite early negotiations with possible backers being abandoned when it emerged {{that they wanted to}} turn the wreck into souvenir paperweights, more sympathetic backers joined Ballard to form a company named Seasonics International Ltd. as a vehicle for rediscovering and exploring Titanic. In October 1977 he made his first attempt to find the ship with the aid of the Alcoa Corporation's deep sea <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Seaprobe. This was essentially a drillship with sonar equipment and cameras attached {{to the end of the}} drilling pipe. It could lift objects from the seabed using a remote-controlled mechanical claw. The expedition ended in failure when the drilling pipe broke, sending [...] of pipe and $600,000 worth of electronics plunging to the sea bed.|$|E

5000|$|There is also {{a second}} vessel called Rosebud also a {{schooner}} around {{at the time that}} the Purves owned ship lay abandoned in 1856.

25|$|The term harbour salvage {{refers to}} the <b>salvage</b> of <b>vessels</b> {{stranded}} or sunk in sheltered waters. Such vessels are not normally {{subject to the same}} deterioration caused by marine and weather conditions as offshore <b>salvage</b> <b>vessels</b> are. In addition, unless the <b>vessel</b> to be <b>salvaged</b> is obstructing navigation, then {{there is no need to}} work as swiftly as in offshore salvage. Also, harbour pre-salvage survey and planning stages tend to be less time consuming and environmentally dependent. It is also easier to gain access to local labour resources and heavy equipment such as floating cranes and barges.|$|R
500|$|In fall 2007, Losts writers {{presented}} ABC executives {{with the}} story that a <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> called the Christiane I looking for the Black Rock, among other things, in the Sunda Trench would come across what {{would appear to be}} the wreckage of 815. [...] ABC hired the Australian company Hoodlum to design a $3million viral marketing alternate reality game (ARG) titled Find 815. [...] Find 815 ran from December 28, 2007 to January 31, 2008, beginning with a press release issued from ABC Medianet announcing the fictitious return of the fictional Oceanic Airlines' return to business. [...] The ARG– apparently the largest ever– followed Sam Thomas, an Oceanic technician who had lost his girlfriend in the crash, as he received cryptic e-mails from The Maxwell Group (a division of Widmore Industries, but nonexistent in Lost), joined the crew of the Christiane I and ultimately uncovered 815. [...] Because Find 815 was produced separately from the show and without the show's writers, it contradicts events in the TV series. [...] In [...] "Confirmed Dead", 815 is found by a man not present in the game named Ron; Thomas is not mentioned. [...] Lindelof and Cuse dismissed the game as not being canon (not containing genuine information within the fictional universe) and was largely just a bonus for fans during the between-seasons hiatus.|$|E
500|$|In January 1929, King Alexander {{changed the}} name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and the navy became the Royal Yugoslav Navy ( [...] , Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица, KJRM). In April 1930, the <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Spasilac was added to the fleet, and the {{following}} month the submarine Nebojša was damaged when she collided with a steamer. In July, the two Hrabri-class submarines and Sitnica made a Mediterranean cruise, visiting Alexandria and Beirut. The appointment of a chief of the Maritime Air Force in 1930 signified the separation of naval aviation from army control, with a strength of around 1,000 officers and men, of whom about 80 were pilots. Around 120 naval aircraft were in service. In 1931, the fleet expanded significantly with the completion of the British-built flotilla leader Dubrovnik. The flotilla leader concept involved building large destroyers similar to the World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were known as contre-torpilleurs, and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The KJRM decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would have the ability to reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central Mediterranean, where {{they would be able to}} operate alongside French and British warships. The onset of the Great Depression meant that only one ship of the planned half-flotilla was ever built. Five locally-built Malinska-class minelayers were also added to the fleet in 1931. The following year, a new German-built [...] brigantine sail training ship, Jadran was acquired, and Wickerhauser retired and was replaced by Vice-Admiral N.N. Stanković. The 250t-class torpedo boat T4 ran aground and was broken up in 1932.|$|E

5000|$|The Lapwing-class {{minesweeper}}, {{often called}} the Bird class, was an early [...] "AM-type" [...] oceangoing minesweeper of the United States Navy. Forty-eight ships of the class were commissioned during World War I, and served well into the 1950s. A number were refitted to serve as ocean-going tugs, <b>salvage</b> <b>vessels,</b> seaplane tenders, or submarine rescue ships.|$|R
50|$|ASV Ocean Salvor {{was handed}} to Risdon Beazley Ltd. on delivery; they managed this ship and 29 other Admiralty <b>Salvage</b> <b>Vessels</b> {{until the end}} of the war when 25 were handed to the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service and three {{returned}} to the USA; two were war losses. They were never prefixed HMS as they were civilian manned.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{surviving}} battleships were extensively refitted, including the replacement of their outdated secondary battery of anti-surface 5"/51 caliber guns with more useful turreted dual-purpose 5"/38 caliber guns, allowing them to better cope with the new tactical reality. Addition of modern radar to the <b>salvaged</b> <b>vessels</b> would give them a marked qualitative advantage over those of the IJN.|$|R
2500|$|During one [...] "Market Time" [...] {{patrol in}} the spring of 1968, Warbler {{conducted}} a joint salvage evolution with the <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> [...] She located a downed F-100 Super Sabre fighter, and a wayward box of hypodermic needles. The ship also conducted extensive searches for an A-6 Intruder, a medevac helicopter, and two target drones. The minesweeper then cruised off the demilitarized zone (the DMZ) before heading home to Sasebo, via the Nationalist Chinese port of Kaohsiung.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1942, the Japanese {{launched}} a raid into the Indian Ocean by its fast carrier forces. A RCAF Catalina flying boat spotted the Japanese fleet 350 miles south-east of Ceylon on 4 April and radioed a sighting report before being shot down. Thus warned, all shipping in Columbo and Trincomalee harbours {{was ordered to}} leave port and disperse to avoid the impending Japanese attack. Tenedos, however, was under repair in Colombo harbour and unable to leave, and was sunk {{with the loss of}} 33 officers and men by Japanese bombers when they attacked on 5 April. [...] The wreck was removed in February 1944 by HM <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Salviking.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet Union {{was less}} {{forthcoming}} about such incidents, but the environmental group Greenpeace {{believes that there}} are around forty non-U.S. nuclear devices that have been lost and not recovered, compared to eleven lost by America, mostly in submarine disasters. The U.S. has tried to recover Soviet devices, notably in the 1974 Project Azorian using the specialist <b>salvage</b> <b>vessel</b> Hughes Glomar Explorer to raise a Soviet submarine. After news leaked out about this [...] boondoggle, the CIA would coin a favorite phrase for refusing to disclose sensitive information, called glomarization: We can neither confirm nor deny {{the existence of the}} information requested but, hypothetically, if such data were to exist, the subject matter would be classified, and could not be disclosed.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II the Admiralty requisitioned <b>salvage</b> <b>vessels</b> and most were put under Risdon Beazley's management. By 1945 Risdon Beazley were operating 61 vessels, including 29 that were owned by the Admiralty, working as far east as Colombo. They lost three vessels and a barge in the war. The other managers operated less than 20 vessels between them.|$|R
50|$|A sonar beacon is an {{underwater}} device which transmits sonic or ultrasonic signals {{for the purpose}} of providing bearing information. The most common type is that of a rugged watertight sonar transmitter attached to a submarine and capable of operating independently of the electrical system of the boat.
