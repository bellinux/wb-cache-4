40|$|Abstract：For {{reduction}} {{of the amount of}} CO 2 emitted from ships, power generation characteristics of two power generation systems consisting of a high-efficiency permanent magnet synchronous generator and diode bridge rictifiers are discussed in this paper. One of the discussed <b>systems</b> <b>has</b> three-phase stator windings, and the other has two sets of three-phase (six-phase) stator windings to reduce pulsation in the electromagnetic torque and DC current. Experimental results reveal that the power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is higher than that of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings for a light load. The maximum power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is almost {{the same as that of}} the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings. For the electromagnetic torque of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings, the width of pulsation is about one-fifth compared to the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings.

5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin <b>systems</b> <b>have</b> {{been used}} as examples of selfish DNA {{as part of the}} gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism.

Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E
