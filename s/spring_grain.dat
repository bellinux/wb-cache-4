Around the 10th century, wheat became a more commonly used cultivated grain, but it did not overtake rye or oats. In the Early Middle Ages, the most commonly used cultivation technique was three-shift cultivation. This type of cultivation method involved using one third of the field for autumn grain (especially rye), one third for <b>spring</b> <b>grain</b> and the rest for fallow.

5000|$|Miry usually {{practiced the}} common-field system, {{in which all}} peasants grew the same crop in the same part of the mir's arable at the same time. Thus the whole harvest on a {{particular}} area could be gathered at the same time. This was necessary because of the peasants' custom of pasturing their livestock on the stubble. To preserve soil fertility on the arable, the mir generally employed a crop-rotation with fallow. The distribution of different crops would be `cycled' around from year to year. The most widespread system in use was the three-course or triennial rotation. One-third of the land was dedicated to winter grain (rye or winter wheat), another third to <b>spring</b> <b>grain</b> (oats or spring wheat) and the remainder lay fallow. [...] Other crops (e.g. legumes, vetches) were occasionally grown with the grain and {{took part in the}} same cycle. The three-course rotation was an inefficient system, one-third of the land always lying fallow. During the later 19th and earlier 20th centuries a start was made in introducing improved rotations with reduced or eliminated fallow (see `Improving Agriculture' below).|$|E
50|$|Row and {{industrial}} crops were more remunerative than grain, or at worst provided their cultivators with extra income or consumables (hence {{they were called}} `cash crops'). Their cultivation spread steadily during the late 19th and earlier 20th centuries, and they were increasingly grown as part of improved crop-rotations (see below). Flax and potatoes were grown in the west, north-west, Central Industrial Region and the Urals; sugar-beet in the northern Ukraine and Central Agricultural region; sunflower in south-eastern Russia and the southern Ukraine; cotton in central Asia and Transcaucasia. By 1917 most vegetables {{and industrial}} crops were grown by the peasants. By this time sugar-beet was the only culture to be grown mainly on large estates (and this too largely fell into peasant hands {{as a result of}} the Revolution). These cultures require much more work than grain (hence called `intensive cultures'). Before the mechanization of agriculture potatoes needed 64 man-days of labour a year per desyatin (1 desyatin is about 1.1 hectare), flax or cotton up to 110 man-days, sugar-beet as much as 180. This compared with only 30 and 23 man-days a year for winter and <b>spring</b> <b>grain</b> respectively.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Changes in {{the federal}} farm program, in {{rainfall}} pattern and quantity, and increased incidence of herbicide resistant weeds and diseases have generated increased interest in <b>spring</b> <b>grains</b> in the Pacific Northwest. However, <b>spring</b> <b>grains</b> have traditionally been treated as minor crops in this region, thus {{little research has been}} done on them. Complicating the situation is the diversity in spring growing conditions as well as crops grown. This study was conducted to a) assess the impact of seeding date on the growth and development of the <b>spring</b> <b>grains</b> and b) to determine the differences or extent of differences among genetically diverse grains. Planting date and cultivar had significant effects on number of leaves and tillers as well as dry matter production. The differences among planting dates were mainly as a result of variations in temperature, though soil moisture was of significance in some cases. Among the cultivars, Alpowa had a high tillering rate, while Westbred 936 was poor. The leaves of the cultivars generally emerged at a constant rate (with a few exceptions) within a given planting date, but rates differed among planting dates. Though significant differences in rate of leaf emergence were observed among cultivars, rate of leaf emergence in wheat as a group was not significantly {{different from that of the}} barley or oat cultivar evaluated. Phyllochron decreased with later sowing in only the first year. In the second year, no consistent increase or decrease in phyllochron with planting date was observed. Rate of dry matter production followed an inverse quadratic polynomial trend. Rate increased slowly during early growth and later rising sharply as plant matured regardless of planting date. Among the cultivars, barley plants showed clear superiority in dry matter accumulation. This is likely the reason why barleys seemed to show superior growth to all the other cultivars. A relationship between vegetative growth and grain yields was observed; however, assimilate redistribution was also found to play significant role. Results obtained were a clear reflection of differences in environmental conditions for each year...|$|R

Total endoprotease activity, assayed in solution with azocasein as a substrate, increased {{during the early}} stages of grain development to reach a maximum at 15 d postanthesis that was maintained until the grain was mature. Endoprotease activity was also assayed in gradient polyacrylamide gels co-polymerized with gelatin. The increase in endoproteolytic activity was due to the appearance of up to 18 endoproteolytic bands that were arbitrarily classified into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E). The presence of serine, aspartic, metallo, and, to a lesser extent, thiol proteases in developing wheat grains was demonstrated by the use of class-specific protease inhibitors. The appearance of the different classes of endoproteases during seed development was subject to temporal control; serine proteases were more abundant at early stages and aspartic and metallo proteases were more abundant at later stages. At intermediate stages of development (15 - 20 d postanthesis), most of the endoproteases were localized in the aleurone, testa, and embryo.

Compared to uncoated N, urea coated with Nutrisphere-N improved grain yields by 18. 3 % with applications of 180 kg N ha− 1 in the fall. Application of urea with Nutrisphere-N in the spring produced similar grain yields for treatments with and without Nutrisphere-N.

40|$|The {{breeding}} of triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) {{is of great}} importance in those Mediterranean environments where low winter temperature and soil acidity interact with drought, increasing the adaptability of this species in comparison with other temperate cereals. In order to identify {{the way in which}} the various yield components contribute to the realisation of high yields in a Mediterranean environment, and the effect of a different phenology on these patterns, a two-year trial was carried out in Sardinia (Italy) with 271 pure lines grown under rainfed conditions. The relationships between characters were assessed by phenotypic correlation analysis after grouping the lines into phenological classes. In both years total biomass explained more of the variation in yield than harvest index and was little affected by earliness. Both total biomass and HI were strongly correlated with kernels m &#x 2212; 2.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} non-legume cover crops for growing no-till grain legumes in organic farming systems. Evaluated cover crops should be able to suppress weed growth, reduce plant available nitrogen in the soil and produce large amounts of biomass with slow N mineralisation. Six non-legume species; spring rye (Secale cereale L.), black oat (Avena sativa L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) were tested. Plots with organic fertiliser (50  kg N ha− 1) and without fertiliser incorporation at three locations in south-east Germany were trialled and the cover crops’ ability to produce biomass and accumulate N in plant compartments was evaluated. The N mineralisation from stem and leaf material was simulated using the STICS model. The biomass production ranged from 0. 95 to 7. 73  Mg ha− 1, with fertiliser increasing the total biomass at locations with low-N status. Sunflower consistently displayed large biomass and N accumulation at all locations and fertiliser variations, although not always significantly more than other species. Most N was stored in sunflower leaf material, which can be easily mineralised making it less suited as cover crop before no-till sown <b>spring</b> <b>grain</b> legumes. Rye, which produced slightly less biomass, but accumulated more N in the stem biomass, would be better suited than sunflower in this type of system.
