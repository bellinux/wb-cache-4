6000|$|It is {{interesting}} to observe with what singular unanimity the farthest sundered nations and generations consent to give completeness and roundness to an ancient fable, of which they indistinctly appreciate the beauty or the truth. By a faint and dream-like effort, though it be only by the vote of a scientific body, the dullest posterity <b>slowly</b> <b>add</b> some trait to the mythus. As when astronomers call the lately discovered planet Neptune; or the asteroid Astraea, that the Virgin who was driven from earth to heaven {{at the end of}} the golden age, may have her local habitation in the heavens more distinctly assigned her,--for the slightest recognition of poetic worth is significant. By such slow aggregation has mythology grown from the first. The very nursery tales of this generation, were the nursery tales of primeval races. They migrate from east to west, and again from west to east; now expanded into the [...] "tale divine" [...] of bards, now shrunk into a popular rhyme. This is an approach to that universal language which men have sought in vain. This fond reiteration of the oldest expressions of truth by the latest posterity, content with slightly and religiously retouching the old material, is the most impressive proof of a common humanity.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to cover {{the region of the}} lightest nuclei up to 56Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with 56Ni, however, a number of waiting points are encountered in the reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively long half-lives (compared to the process timescale) and can only <b>slowly</b> <b>add</b> another proton (that is, their cross section for (p,γ) reactions is small). Examples for such waiting points are: 56Ni, 60Zn, 64Ge, 68Se. Further waiting points may be important, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction path. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, they considerably increase the time required to continue the reaction sequences. If the conditions required for this rapid proton capture are only present for a short time (the timescale of explosive astrophysical events is of the order of seconds), the waiting points limit or hamper the continuation of the reactions to heavier nuclei.|$|E

40|$|Background: Recombinant {{proteins}} overexpressed in E. coli {{are usually}} deposited in inclusion bodies. Cysteines in the protein {{contribute to this}} process. Inter- and intra- molecular disulfide bonds in chitinase, a cysteine-rich protein, cause aggregation when the recombinant protein is overexpressed in E. coli. Hence, aggregated proteins should be solubilized and allowed to refold to obtain native- or correctly- folded recombinant proteins. Methods: Dilution method that allows refolding of recombinant proteins, especially at high protein concentrations, is to <b>slowly</b> <b>add</b> the soluble protein to refolding buffer. For this purpose: first, the inclusion bodies containing insoluble proteins were purified; second, the aggregated proteins were solubilized; finally, the soluble proteins were refolded using glutathione redox system, guanidinium chloride, dithiothreitol, sucrose, and glycerol, simultaneously. Results: After protein solubilization and refolding, SDS-PAGE showed a 32 kDa band that was recognized by an anti-chitin antibody on western blots. Conclusion: By this method, cysteine-rich proteins from E. coli inclusion bodies can be solubilized and correctly folded into active proteins...|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} natural {{extensions}} to the presented work: Firstly, for utility evaluation, we used three well-documented point forecasting methods. Point forecasting outputs {{only a single}} (the likeliest) load value for one time interval. An extension to this work would be to evaluate differentially private metering with probabilistic forecasting methods (cf. (Hong and Fan 2016)). Secondly, our concept perturbs and transmits the complete zonal time series to the energy provider and the forecasting model training is performed by the energy provider. In the future, we plan to integrate Differential Privacy directly into a distributed model training approach on the customer side using objective-function perturbation for less privacy loss and tighter guarantees. Thirdly, lowering the local sensitivity by minimizing the household’s peak load leads to a stronger privacy level. Incidentally, automatic energy management systems like the ones described in (Egarter et al. 2014) and (Mauser et al. 2016) are able to shift controllable loads or control battery storages and {{combined heat and power}} plants to facilitate this idea. Fourthly, with the continual release of load data in practice, the privacy loss quantified by ε would <b>slowly</b> <b>add</b> up over the course of time. To be aware of one owns privacy situation, one needs to keep track of how much privacy was already leaked to which party. The data custodian proposed by (Rigoll and Schmeck 2017) provides such an accounting service. Finally, the perturbed data could be filtered (e.g., using moving average or Kalman filters) to compensate the noise as already proposed in (Bao and Lu 2015; Eibl and Engel 2017).|$|E

Weeks ### Abstract SHAPE (selective 2 ’-hydroxyl {{acylation}} {{analyzed by}} primer extension) chemistry {{is a powerful}} approach for single-nucleotide resolution analysis of RNA secondary and tertiary structure. SHAPE uses hydroxyl-selective electrophiles to react with and form covalent adducts at the ribose 2 ’-hydroxyl group. The most useful and robust reagent for routine SHAPE experiments is 1 -methyl- 7 -nitroisatoic anhydride (1 M 7). This protocol describes a straightforward synthesis of 1 M 7 from commercially available precursors. The synthesis of 1 -methyl- 7 -nitroisatoic anhydride was originally described by Mortimer et al.. The reaction scheme is: ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") *Amounts of each starting material can be varied using the above Table*. ### Reagents 1. 4 -nitroisatoic anhydride (4 NIA) (AstaTech, cat. no. 69441) - Sodium hydride (NaH) – 60 % dispersion in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 452912) - Methyl iodide (MeI) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 289566) - Anhydrous dimethylfluoride (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 227056) - HCl (Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

40|$|What Does Food Mean to Me Food {{has always}} been very {{important}} to me and I have always been very interested in it. Even when I was a little kid I would always be in the kitchen helping my mom. Whether I was pouring flour into cookie dough batter, spraying a cupcake pan with pam, or eating the leftover brownie batter, the different tastes and interesting flavors of food have always intrigued me. I noticed that different tastes and smells would trigger important memories for me. The repetition of certain meals helped me remember important moments in my life, this is why traditional meals have always stood out to me. A traditional meal that is very special to me is my grandpa’s homemade spaetzle,. A traditional meal that stands out to me the most is my grandpa’s homemade spaetzle. Many people do not know what spaetzle is because it is very foreign. Spaetzle is a soft egg noodle or dumpling found in cuisines of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary. It is a very unique dish because it can be prepared as a savory or a sweet entrée. I remember the first time I ever laid eyes on it I was a little nervous to even try it. The noodles were a very odd shape and had an odd smell to them. They look like little larva worms with a light brown color to them. Without asking my grandpa would give me {{a large portion of the}} noodles and smile at me as I ate and tasted the delicious worm like noodles. The noodle would slowly melt in my mouth as I began to shove more into my mouth. The noodles were surprisingly addicting. I would not bother looking at the other food on my plate until all the noodles on my plate were gone. I was so intrigued by this oddly named, weird looking, and delicious dish that I had to have more. My two younger sisters and I would ask my grandpa to make his special spaetzle every time we would see him, whether it was an important holiday or a random family gathering, we needed to have it. This is my favorite recipe because it always reminds me of him. My dad agreed with me by saying “If I had to pick one thing that I really loved to cook with him it was spaetzle, essentially a German dumpling. This is one of the reasons why I asked him to teach you, Kara and Grace to make them as well-need to have the tradition carry on. ” This last winter my grandpa grew very ill and we knew he didn’t have much time left with him. We had him come over to our house to have him prepare some of our favorite dishes. I, of course, asked him to show me how to make his homemade spaetzle. I read different versions of the recipe online but his was slightly different. According to my dad “His recipe is not written-down. Like a good chef is comes from practice and taste. This is why he taught us-so we can pass it down. ” When he made his dough, he took a lot of time because he wanted to make sure it would be the perfect consistency. He would hand beat a couple eggs in a bowl and then he would <b>slowly</b> <b>add</b> in small amount of another mixture of flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg (his little special touch). The batter was a lot thinner than I expected it to be but this was because he liked to have the dough form a small noodle rather than a chunky dumpling. He would use his ancient strainer and slowly pour the batter in. The droplets of batter would fall into a boiling pot of salty water. The little noodles would float to the surface of the water and begin to cook. Since the noodles were so thin, they did not take very long to cook. He would then scoop the noodles out of the water and throw them into a sauté pan lined with butter and a little bit f garlic. This was my favorite way to eat them because the little doughy noodles would get caramelized by the copious amounts of butter. My grandpa was very close to my family and not having him around makes the holidays a lot harder. He was a man of very few words, mostly because it was always so hard to understand him. He was fluent in 6 different languages, which gave him a very strange accent. The best way for him to speak was through his cooking. He taught me to appreciate the food that I ate. Food was meant to be simple and made with love. Through him I learned to be patient with food, the best meals take the most time and focus but it was always worth it. I began to appreciate the time I had left with him. He taught me everything I know about German cooking. My family and I miss him dearly. The best way for me to remember him is by preparing his favorite dish, Spatzel. Overall, food is {{very important to me}} because it has helped me remember the important moments in my life and has also provided me with the sense of community...|$|E
