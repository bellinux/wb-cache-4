5000|$|The {{industrial}} structure is relatively focused on car production. The German auto manufacturer Opel built {{an entirely new}} plant in the northwest of the town, after the Wartburg car plant had ceased production in 1991. The new plant opened in 1992. Most other large manufacturers in Eisenach serve as suppliers for Opel, the largest among them is Bosch. BMW runs a factory in the neighbouring municipality of Krauthausen that <b>supplies</b> <b>car</b> parts. Another component supplier is [...] "Truck-Lite Europe". In 2012, there were a total of 19 industrial companies with more than 20 workers in Eisenach, employing 5,600 people and generating a turnover of more than 1.8 billion euros. Of those employees, 3,000 work for just two companies (Opel and Bosch), underlining the dependence of Eisenach on the automotive industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- DC-DC {{converters}} {{are widely}} used in application such as computer peripheral power <b>supplies,</b> <b>car</b> auxiliary power supplies and medical equipments. Positive output element Luo converter performs the conversion from positive source voltage to positive load voltage. Due to the time-varying and switching nature of the power electronic converters, their dynamic behaviour is highly non-linear. Conventional controllers are incapable of providing good dynamic performance and hence optimized techniques {{have been developed to}} tune the PI parameter. In this work, Bacterial Foraging (BF) algorithm and Modified Bacterial Foraging (MBF) algorithm are developed for PI optimization. Simulation results show that the performances of BF-PI and MBF-PI controllers are better than those obtained by the classical ZN-PI controller...|$|E
40|$|Personal {{mobility}} {{offered by}} the motor car is valued in developed nations whose modern societies now rely on it. However freedom comes at a price. Cars consume natural resources and energy during manufacture and operation of the vehicle. Their emissions also pollute our city air. There are now less than 2000 UK deaths per year from road accidents yet estimates that 50, 000 extra deaths have been advanced by air quality degradation. Clean alternative fuels use energy in their production or simply move pollution elsewhere. Many renewable sources consume land and have less energy density than fossil fuels. Different studies predict a doubling of the world motorcar population by 2050. During the same period peak oil {{is expected to be}} reached bringing fears of ‘energy conflict’ as nations seek to protect their oil <b>supplies.</b> <b>Car</b> use is becoming unsustainable. Even fuel-efficient and clean small cars weigh 1400 kg and too often carry a lone 75 kg occupant. Their internal combustion engines pollute at the tailpipe. Car growth has not been matched by increased road space so congestion harms the economy and quality of life leaving big cities close to gridlock. Attempts to make cars lighter for economy are militated by the need for greater occupant safety (with no benefit to pedestrians or other vulnerable road users). The global automotive industry is at a challenging and exciting cusp when radical innovation is possible and indeed necessary but hurdles are not just technical. Legislation must support new approaches to design and safety but more importantly flaws inherent in human nature will have to be overcome to gain acceptance for new and sustainable approaches to personal transportation in wealthy developing countries. This paper will examine critical drivers for change and propose how future designers must prepare society for imperative changes in our attitudes to personal mobility...|$|E
