Having unprotected sex, using poor birth control methods (e.g. withdrawal), having multiple sexual partners, and poor communication are {{some aspects of}} sexual behavior that increase individual and/or <b>social</b> <b>risk.</b> Some qualities of adolescents' lives that are often correlated with risky sexual behavior include higher rates of experienced abuse, lower rates of parental support and monitoring.|$|E

500|$|In 1839, while Liszt {{continued}} his travels, Marie took the <b>social</b> <b>risk</b> {{of returning to}} Paris with her daughters. Her hopes of recovering her status in the city were dented when her influential mother, Madame de Flavigny, refused to acknowledge the children; Marie would not be accepted socially while her daughters were clearly in evidence. Liszt's solution was to remove the girls from Marie and place them with his mother, Anna Liszt, in her Paris home while Daniel remained with nurses in Venice. By this means, both Marie and Liszt could continue their independent lives. Relations between the couple cooled, and by 1841 they were seeing little of each other; {{it is likely that}} both engaged in other affairs. By 1845 the breach between them was such that they were communicating only through third parties. Liszt forbade contact between mother and daughters; Marie accused him of attempting to steal [...] "the fruits of a mother's womb", while Liszt insisted on his sole right to decide the children's future. Marie threatened to fight him [...] "like a lioness", but soon gave up the struggle, perhaps valuing the preservation of her social status above her duties as a mother. Though they were living in the same city, she did not see either of her daughters for five years, until 1850.|$|E

60|$|The {{answer is}} that a pamphlet, a {{newspaper}} article, or a resolution moved at a political meeting can do all the mischief that a play can, and often more; yet we do not set up a permanent censorship of the press or of political meetings. Any journalist may publish an article, any demagogue may deliver a speech without giving notice to the government or obtaining its licence. The risk of such freedom is great; but {{as it is the}} price of our political liberty, we think it worth paying. We may abrogate it in emergencies by a Coercion Act, a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, or a proclamation of martial law, just as we stop the traffic in a street during a fire, or shoot thieves at sight if they loot after an earthquake. But when the emergency is past, liberty is restored everywhere except in the theatre. The Act of 1843 is a permanent Coercion Act for the theatre, a permanent suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act as far as plays are concerned, a permanent proclamation of martial law with a single official substituted for a court martial. It is, in fact, assumed that actors, playwrights, and theatre managers are dangerous and dissolute characters whose existence creates a chronic state of emergency, and who must be treated as earthquake looters are treated. It is not necessary now to discredit this assumption. It was broken down by the late Sir Henry Irving when he finally shamed the Government into extending to his profession the official recognition enjoyed by the other branches of fine art. To-day we have on the roll of knighthood actors, authors, and managers. The rogue and vagabond theory of the depravity of the theatre is as dead officially as it is in general society; and with it has perished the sole excuse for the Act of 1843 and for the denial to the theatre of the liberties secured, at far greater <b>social</b> <b>risk,</b> to the press and the platform.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the trajectories of welfare state change through policy {{response}} to new <b>social</b> <b>risks</b> and methodologically categorizes the pattern of trajectories with sequence analysis. New <b>social</b> <b>risks</b> are the risks that people face in their life course due to {{the economic and social}} changes related to post-industrialization. By comparing a typology of welfare states based on trajectories of policy change in last three decades with Esping-Andersen’s threefold typologies of welfare states, we can determine whether welfare states maintain their existing welfare systems or change them. The results of sequence analysis on social expenditures and total tax revenue show that welfare regimes undergo a substantial change. In particular, conservative welfare regime countries show various trajectories when reacting to new <b>social</b> <b>risks.</b> This finding empirically supports studies that assert the transformation of the welfare state...|$|R

As a consequence of a difficult and still uncompleted process of recalibration (functional, distributive, normative and institutional), the welfare states in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Russian Federation are called to face a double burden of responsibilities: they must ensure protection against old and new <b>social</b> <b>risks</b> for a larger proportion of citizens than those in the West, while, simultaneously, dealing with the most serious social, economic and political challenges stemming from the transition. ...|$|R

What are the main factors and mechanisms contributing to the rise of social vulnerability in urban contexts? What are the material conditions and coping strategies adopted by vulnerable groups to deal with these risks? And, finally, what is the role played by local welfare systems in times of welfare retrenchment at the national level? The focus of the book is on urban contexts: it is in cities that most of the new <b>social</b> <b>risks</b> are concentrated and welfare policies face the most dramatic tensions in times of austerity...|$|R

The second section examines the shift to new <b>social</b> <b>risks</b> throughout Europe, looking at current trends in employment, housing conditions, work-care reconciliation, immigration, and income vulnerability. In the third section, policy implications are discussed, by considering to what extent local welfare systems in Europe are able to deal with (new) <b>social</b> <b>risks</b> and what are the main challenges on the table.

40|$|Issues such as {{caring and}} family policy have {{received}} increased attention within the sociological {{literature on the}} welfare state during the past decades. At the same time, {{there has been much}} debate about the protection of <b>social</b> <b>risks.</b> In particular, scholars have questioned the ability of welfare states to respond to so-called new <b>social</b> <b>risks,</b> such as reconciling work and care. The literature on new <b>social</b> <b>risks</b> assumes welfare states will have difficulty addressing these risks due to pressures for reform and assumed individual responsibility for new <b>social</b> <b>risks.</b> In contrast, the Dutch welfare state has been successful in re-orienting existing institutions to develop a semi-collectivised yet market-driven form of childcare policy. Using qualitative interview data and document analysis, this article analyses the development of Dutch childcare policy from 1995 to 2009. The development of childcare policy is attributed to three social mechanisms: a common perception among actors viewing childcare as a solution to improve women's employment; a party politics mechanism, which creates a distinct Dutch approach to childcare; and a corporatist mechanism, referring to the interaction between the state and industrial relations, which failed in the area of childcare policy. The development of childcare policy has not been wholly unproblematic, however, and therefore a critical discussion of these developments is offered. Also, an update of policy developments through to 2013 is provided. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014...|$|R
