5|$|To {{combat the}} {{perceived}} threat of brucellosis transmission to cattle, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds {{back into the}} park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996–97, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. Animal rights activists argue {{that this is a}} cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to <b>seasonal</b> <b>grazing</b> areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.|$|E

30|$|The nomadic mode of {{production}} underwent {{a series of}} changes, including specialization, sedentarization, {{and the introduction of}} new technologies, which improved the productivity of both animal and people. Sedentarization facilitated government service delivery, such as postal services, business services, education, and health care, which greatly improved the resilience of the herding community (Wang 2006). By 1965, traditional nomadism was largely abandoned (Xu 1999). Then, a pastoral system based on <b>seasonal</b> rotational <b>grazing</b> within a production unit was formed (Wang 2006, 2013). Meanwhile, the introduction of machinery like harvesters and wind generators, as well as breeding stations, greatly promoted the efficiency of animal husbandry (Lin and Zheng 1990). The efficiency of livestock raising was high, while its impacts on the environment were relatively low.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT] Large paddock size, complex {{vegetation}} {{patterns and}} variable rainfall combine to make assessment of grazing impact difficult in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s arid and semi-arid lands. Satellite data {{are useful in}} separating adverse grazing effects on vegetation cover from that caused by spatial and <b>seasonal</b> variability. <b>Grazing</b> is focussed on watering points and cover varies systematically with distance from water to produce a 2 ̆ 2 grazing gradient 2 ̆ 2. After good rains, vegetation cover is fully restored close to watering points if landscapes are not degraded while the persistence of a gradient indicates land degradation or desertification. Two operational methods for objectively determining desertification over large areas are illustrated. We also show how the results of analysing satellite data can be effectively verified with airborne video data...|$|R
40|$|Invasive species {{threaten}} {{biodiversity and}} incur costs exceeding billions of US$. Eradication efforts, however, are nearly always unsuccessful. Throughout much of North America, land managers have used expensive, and ultimately ineffective, techniques to combat invasive Phragmites australis in marshes. Here, we reveal that Phragmites may potentially {{be controlled by}} employing an affordable measure from its native European range: livestock grazing. Experimental field tests demonstrate that rotational goat grazing (where goats {{have no choice but}} to graze Phragmites) can reduce Phragmites cover from 100 to 20 % and that cows and horses also readily consume this plant. These results, combined with the fact that Europeans have suppressed Phragmites through <b>seasonal</b> livestock <b>grazing</b> for 6, 000 years, suggest Phragmites management can shift to include more economical and effective top-down control strategies. More generally, these findings support an emerging paradigm shift in conservation from high-cost eradication to economically sustainable control of dominant invasive species...|$|R

50|$|Farming and {{agriculture}} {{are part of}} the Alpine transhumance, a 3-phase cultivation and inclusion of all mountain levels.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} re-establishing <b>seasonal</b> cattle <b>grazing</b> by 0. 7 animal. ha(- 1) on vegetation in a long-term abandoned, and partly degraded, semi-natural mountain pasture in the Sumava National Park, Czech Republic. There was very uneven grazing intensity inside the locality, and grazing preference changed during the season: cattle grazed {{most of the time}} in productive but species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards, but changed to a species-rich Violion caninae stand {{in the middle of the}} summer. A species-rich Carex rostrata community was only grazed at the end of the season. Species-poor swards dominated by Nardus stricta and Carex brizoides were mainly used as resting areas. Both grazing and excluding from grazing had a negative effect on species diversity of the Deschampsia cespitosa swards. The soil seed bank contained only few species that are characteristic of mountain grassland communities, and seed dispersal of the target species by cattle dung was also found to be very limited. Thus both grazing and exclusion from grazing are probably of limited value for the restoration of species-rich grasslands from species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards in this case...|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessors}} to {{the zones}} on the SNNR map may be grazing zones which {{were part of}} the tuimu huancao, ‘converting pastures to grasslands’ program, which got its start in 2000.

The first two of these zones correspond to what is referred to on the SNNR map as the ‘core zone’, the third to the ‘buffer zone’, and the fourth to the ‘experimental zone’. In the third (i.e. buffer) zone there was to be a reduction in grazing or a ban on grazing for five or ten years, and in the fourth (i.e. experimental) zone there was to be rotational grazing to capacity.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>seasonal</b> cattle <b>grazing</b> on a newly reintroduced {{population}} of California bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis californiana) in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Idaho, was studied. The hypothesis that bighorn sheep avoid cattle was tested. The issue of avoidance between bighorn sheep and livestock is arguable. Some {{studies have found}} that bighorn sheep avoid cattle while others have found no response of bighorn sheep to cattle. Evidence was found to document the avoidance of cattle by bighorn sheep. The size of the bighorn 2 ̆ 7 s home range and core area decreased with the movement of cattle into areas of high bighorn use. As cattle were moved into bighorn core areas, sheep responded by relocating. Bighorn sheep decreased their distance to escape terrain as cattle moved closer. The level and location of human disturbance on the study area did not have any effect on bighorn sheep movements or how sheep used the habitat. The severity of response observed is in marked contrast with the response of established bighorn populations to cattle. I suggest that newly reintroduced bighorn sheep are extremely sensitive to disturbance as a result of relocation trauma. Sensitivity may diminish over time...|$|R
5000|$|Gilgais were an {{important}} source of water for Indigenous Australians and enabled people to seasonally forage over areas that lacked permanent water.

40|$|The C {{balance of}} a grazed pasture {{situated}} in Condroz (Wallonia) and {{its dependence on}} climatic conditions and grazing management were investigated {{on the basis of}} eddy covariance measurements and horizontal C flow estimates.

Management by the farmer (organic fertilization), but also climate conditions influencing management (feed supplements), were the main factors impacting the C balance inter-annual variability. At a daily and <b>seasonal</b> scale, <b>grazing</b> impact on CO 2 fluxes did not appear explicitly, being blurred by flux response to climate drivers. It was highlighted by specific investigations. The indirect grazing impact (photosynthesizing biomass consumption, excretions, soil compaction) was deduced from an analysis of the flux to PPFD response evolution during grazing period; the direct impact (livestock respiration) was investigated through confinement experiments. Result showed that saturation GPP changes were negatively correlated to grazing intensity (product of the stocking rate and grazing duration).

30|$|A further {{integral}} {{component of}} herd mobility {{and use of}} pasture {{in accordance with the}} environmental conditions is the exploitation of <b>seasonal</b> pastures. <b>Grazing</b> itineraries and the resultant theoretical utilized pasture area are determined by a variety of factors such as meteorological conditions, topographic features, the spatial expansion of the pasture, herbage yield and quality, animals’ dietary preferences, distance to water, land use rights and management strategies such as daily herding practices (Baumont et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2011; Askar et al. 2013). The average daily walked distance in the study area was slightly lower (particularly during autumn and winter) than reported by studies of transhumance systems in sub-Saharan Africa (Turner et al. 2005; Schlecht et al. 2006; Butt 2010; Raizman et al. 2013). Environmental conditions such as low temperature, snow cover and strong wind as well as the herd-release strategy (small ruminants) or absence of active herding (cattle) likely reduced the length of daily grazing itineraries (Vetter 2005; Schlecht et al. 2006; Squires et al. 2010). This assumption is substantiated by a comparison with daily itineraries tracked under similar management conditions in Inner Mongolia, Mongolia and the Tibetan plateau, which closely matched the data of the current study and ranged between 3 and 13  km per day (Kawamura et al. 2005; Joly et al. 2013; Ding et al. 2014).|$|R
