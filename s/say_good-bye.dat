500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} the song only on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, {{where it was}} the closing song of the set list.

The shows featured an introductory verse from [...] "Family Affair" [...] by Sly and the Family Stone. Madonna wore an all-black ensemble involving a cage vest, the longline bra, skintight shorts, knee-pads and a bowler hat. Her getup was a nod to actress Liza Minnelli in the film Cabaret. The performance started with her dancers appearing on the stage, with chairs on their back. Madonna appeared in their middle and started doing push-ups on the stage. She started singing [...] "Family Affair", then midway through the song, changed to [...] "Keep It Together". During the intermediate music, Madonna and her dancers performed an intricate choreography with the chairs.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1750s Elizabeth's health started to decline. She began {{to suffer a}} series of dizzy spells and refused to take the {{prescribed}} medicines.

[...] This she could not do, though she liked the shy handsome boy and remembered him with affection to the end of a long life. It was the one romance of Gordon's life.|$|E

They woke up the next day at the hotel and Kilroy's whereabouts were still unknown. His friends then contacted the police to report him missing.|$|E

[...] Further, after the National Anthem was sung and the officials were about to leave the stage, Rev. William Duffy, Minister at Wollongong and a parent of a P.L.C student, stood up and asked the chairman to be seated. He said that McQueen had been wronged and what was more, he was not even allowed to <b>say</b> <b>good-bye.</b> Council subsequently rushed out quickly and locked themselves in the dining room.
