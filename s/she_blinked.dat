She and the Doctor leave to study a text written about Angels, {{learning}} that even an image of an Angel can become an Angel itself. They are unaware that Amy stayed to watch the footage, and when <b>she</b> <b>blinks,</b> the Angel appears to move. The Doctor helps her stop the video feed, and believes Amy is safe, but she feels something in her eye.|$|R

60|$|She was {{trembling}} slightly. But {{it occurred to}} Razumov {{that they might have}} been observed from the house, and he became anxious to be gone. <b>She</b> <b>blinked,</b> raising up to him her puckered face, and seemed to beg mutely to be told something more, to be given a word of encouragement for her starving, grotesque, and pathetic devotion.|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{realized}} that {{there was nothing else to}} do. Her lips trembled and tears came into her eyes. <b>She</b> <b>blinked</b> savagely--she would not let Mary Vance see her crying. But to be forgotten like this! To think nobody had thought it worth while to make sure where she was--not even Walter. Then she had a sudden dismayed recollection.|$|E
60|$|There was languor in his utterance, {{hinting at}} a {{possibility}} that it was perfunctorily made. Laura picked up her articles, answering that he certainly could so ask her--she was free. Yet not her expression either could be called an ardent response. Then <b>she</b> <b>blinked</b> more and more quickly and put her handkerchief to her face. She was weeping violently.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} opens on a closeup of Kate Bush, dressed in dark green camouflage, holding a child. <b>She</b> <b>blinks</b> in {{synchronisation}} with the song's sampled gun cocks. The camera pulls out and shows that Bush has a white-haired child on her lap. The child walks off and returns in military combat uniform. Bush and several soldiers (one of whom has [...] "KT8" [...] or [...] "KTB" [...] stencilled on {{the butt of}} his rifle: [...] "KTB" [...] was a monogram used by Bush early in her career) make their way through woodland, amid explosions. As the song progresses, Bush reaches out for the child soldier, but he disappears. Finally, one of the soldiers is blown up.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>blinked</b> {{up out of}} her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, {{showing him}} her milkwhite teeth.

60|$|When {{she awoke}} all was bright. The sun shone almost {{directly}} overhead. Helen was astounded. Bo lay wrapped in deep sleep, her face flushed, with beads of perspiration on her brow and the chestnut curls damp. Helen threw down the blankets, and then, gathering courage--for {{she felt as}} if her back was broken--she endeavored to sit up. In vain! Her spirit was willing, but her muscles refused to act. It must take a violent spasmodic effort. She tried it with shut eyes, and, succeeding, sat there trembling. The commotion she had made in the blankets awoke Bo, and <b>she</b> <b>blinked</b> her surprised blue eyes in the sunlight.|$|E

House {{and the team}} discuss this and {{they come to the}} conclusion she has fungus, but they do not know which one. House tells them to go broad, and Cameron suggests Aspergillus. He tells them to give her the anti-fungal for that. Wilson accuses House of running the paternity test from the beginning. Cameron comes in and says Leona's lungs collapsed and they are treating for the wrong fungus. He goes to Leona and asks if she lied to Dylan about where she was. After hesitating twice, <b>she</b> <b>blinks,</b> signaling <b>she</b> did. House discovers that the patient had gone to a recording studio before she experienced the hallucinations. She had inhaled mold in the studio, contracting zygomycosis.|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Slipstream is a magic realist novella with a {{cyclical}} plotline. The story captures the university share-house scene of Sydneyâ€™s inner west through the split psyche of Ellen/Mackenzie, {{a young woman}} dealing with questions about time, love, the nature of existence, and whether <b>she</b> <b>blinks</b> too fast. The accompanying critical exegesis investigates narrative strategies for capturing the complex states of mind that arise out of trauma and mental illness. Positing Slipstream as a magic realist novella, the exegesis examines various techniques employed by authors and filmmakers whose work in this genre includes similar themes to Slipstream. Finally, the exegesis examines different methods contemporary authors use when portraying queer relationships, gender, love, friendship, the trauma of sexual assault, {{and the nature of}} memory...|$|R

6000|$|Miss Cameron {{drew her}} to the rock where she sat, and pushing the {{hair out of her}} eyes, revived her with a hearty 'Bravo! bravo!' which assured the girl that her first act was a hit. Josie had often {{imagined}} her meeting with the great actress--the dignity and grace with which she would enter and tell her ambitious hopes, the effective dress she would wear, the witty things she would say, the deep impression her budding genius would make. But never in her wildest moments had she imagined an interview like this; scarlet, sandy, streaming, and speechless she leaned against the illustrious shoulder, looking like a beautiful seal as <b>she</b> <b>blinked</b> and wheezed till she could smile joyfully and exclaim proudly: ...|$|E
60|$|When {{she was up}} on {{the earth}} again <b>she</b> <b>blinked</b> and peered at the world in amazement. What a pretty, {{luminous}} place it was, carved in substantial luminosity. What a strange and lovely place, bubbling iridescent-golden {{on the surface of}} the underworld. Iridescent golden--could anything be more fascinating! Like lovely glancing surface on fluid pitch. But a velvet surface. A velvet surface of golden light, velvet-pile of gold and pale luminosity, and strange beautiful elevations of houses and trees, and depressions of fields and roads, all golden and floating like atmospheric majolica. Never had the common ugliness of Woodhouse seemed so entrancing. She thought she had never seen such beauty--a lovely luminous majolica, living and palpitating, the glossy, svelte world-surface, the exquisite face of all the darkness. It was like a vision. Perhaps gnomes and subterranean workers, enslaved in the era of light, see with such eyes. Perhaps that is why they are absolutely blind to conventional ugliness. For truly nothing could be more hideous than Woodhouse, as the miners had built it and disposed it. And yet, the very cabbage-stumps and rotten fences of the gardens, the very back-yards were instinct with magic, molten as they seemed with the bubbling-up of the under-darkness, bubbling up of majolica weight and luminosity, quite ignorant of the sky, heavy and satisfying.|$|E
40|$|Facial synkinesis is an {{abnormal}} involuntary movement of {{one set of}} facial muscles accom-panying a voluntary movement of a different facial muscle. It {{is not uncommon for}} patients with long-standing facial paralysis to present with abnormal, involuntary facial movements that impair facial symmetry and compromise facial function and expressivity. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previ-ous reports of facial synkinesis after fat graft. A 38 -year-old Asian woman complained of con-joint movement of her left cheek while blinking her eyes. The malar area of her left cheek moved inward when <b>she</b> <b>blinked.</b> The patient felt awkward and nervous about the involuntary movement of her left cheek.

50|$|Having {{survived the}} assault, Thrax breaks into the {{hypothalamus}} gland and steals a DNA bead from a chromosome. His actions disable Frank's ability to regulate temperature, causing {{his body to}} burn up. Thrax then kidnaps Leah and flees to the mouth to escape. As Frank is {{taken to the hospital}} in a fever coma, Ozzy and Drix reconcile and proceed to rescue Leah, but Thrax escapes using pollen which causes Frank to cough, expelling Thrax from his body. Ozzy pursues Thrax to the surface of Shane's left eye, and later her false eyelash when <b>she</b> <b>blinks.</b> Thrax's physical superiority and heated claws allows him to pin Ozzy down. He threatens to kill Shane but becomes stuck in the false eyelash; Ozzy's pliable body allows him to escape as the eyelash slides off and lands in a glass of alcohol, dissolving Thrax.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{demonstrate}} {{the effect of}} acupuncture in a child with chronic Bell's palsy of 7 years duration. Subject: A 15 -year-old girl had Bell's palsy for 7 years and {{did not respond to}} steroid treatment in the acute phase. On examination, her eyes were asymmetric, with the right eye smaller. Muscle contracture was noted around the right nasalis. She had synkinesis (i. e., when <b>she</b> <b>blinked,</b> there was involuntary twitching of her mouth at the right side). She showed marked facial distortion when puffing out cheeks, smiling, and raising her eyebrows. The tip of her tongue was swollen with red spikes. House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system (HBS) before treatment was grade 4. Treatment: Patient was given 25 acupuncture treatment sessions in 2 months. Local acupuncture points used were: LI 20, ST 2, ST 3, ST 4, ST 6, ST 7, SI 18, BL 2, TE 17, TE 23, GB 14, GV 26, CV 24, EX-HN 5, and EX-HN 16; distant points used were: LI 11, ST 36, ST 40, SP 6, SP 10, HT 8, SI 3, BL 67, PC 8, TE 5, and LR 3. About 10 points were selected from the above set in each session with needles inserted to elicit the de qi response. The patient was asked to report any change in muscle strength or any differences noted after each acupuncture session. Photographs and videos were taken for blind assessors to comment on. Result: The patient rated an overall improvement of 60 - 70 %. Self-perceived muscle strength when smiling and puffing out cheeks increased from 20 % of normal strength to 65 %, and the strength when raising eyebrows increased from 10 % to 70 %. Synkinesis was attenuated. Photographs and videos showed improvement in facial asymmetry. HBS changed to grade 3 after treatment. Conclusions: Our study showed that acupuncture can be effective in improving functional and cosmetic outcome even for chronic Bell's palsy.
