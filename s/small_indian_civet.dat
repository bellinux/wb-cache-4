5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} has both native and {{introduced}} predators. Native predators include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the Madagascar ground boa (Boa madagascariensis). Introduced predators include the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civet</b> (Viverricula indica), the domestic cat and the domestic dog.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{habitat of}} Lac Alaotra is {{threatened}} by pollution, destruction of marshes {{for the construction of}} rice fields, overfishing, and introduced species such as exotic fish, plants, the black rat (Rattus rattus), and the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civet</b> (Viverricula indica), another small carnivoran. A bird restricted to the area, the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus), was declared extinct in 2010 and the population of the bamboo lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999. As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, S.durrelli is likely to be threatened by degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition with the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civet</b> and the black rat, but its conservation status has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a protected area.|$|E

40|$|The food habits, {{movement}} and activity patterns, and habitat use of sympatric carnivores, and wildlife harvest and utilization, were {{studied at the}} Taohong Village, Jiangxi Province, southeastern China during 1992 â€“ 1996. ^ Food habits of four species of sympatric carnivores were studied by scat analysis. Crab-eating mongooses (Herpestes urva) had the most diversified diet that included many water-edge food items. Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) consumed {{a large proportion of}} fruits. Both <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civets</b> (Viverricula indica) and hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris) fed heavily on rodents. Though there was a certain degree of difference in habitat use among these species, the rather high diet overlap suggested that the population densities of these species were reduced to a very low level by constant harvest pressure and secondary poisoning so that the diet ceased to have relevant effect on the sympatry of these species. The food habits (based on scat analysis) of the sympatric dhole (Cuon alpinus) and wolf (Canis lupus) showed that their depredation on the endangered Sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi), domestic animals and small carnivores was negligible. ^ Telemetry studies showed that <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civets,</b> masked palm civets, and crab-eating mongooses did not have permanent dens but moved among their numerous daybeds. <b>Small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civets</b> used daybeds among the bushes and grass on the ground while other species used underground dens exclusively. <b>Small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civets</b> and crabeating mongooses limited their activity to the foothills at low altitude, while masked palm civets included habitat of higher altitude in their home ranges. Both <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civets</b> and masked palm civets were nocturnal, but the latter had a low activity level in the daytime. Crab-eating mongooses were active in the daytime. ^ Ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) were strictly nocturnal. Their daybeds included both natural and man-made sites. The lack of direct conflict of interest with humans allowed them to live in close proximity to human settlement. ^ Wildlife harvest during the 1992 / 96 harvest seasons was studied by the method of participant observation. Wildlife harvesters comprised 1. 5 % of the local population, and a few professional harvesters accounted for {{a large proportion of the}} game yield. Shotguns and two kinds of traps were the most common harvest methods used. Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and hares (Lepus sinensis and L. capensis) were the most important game species. In spite of the steady increase in the price of wildlife parts, the game yields experienced a gradual decline due to reduced harvest efforts. Wildlife harvest was market-oriented and played an insignificant supplemental role in the local economy. Marketing channels for both pelt and game meat have been well established and are spreading. Wildlife harvest remained largely unregulated. The prospect of wildlife harvest at Taohong is discussed and recommendations to control harvest are proposed. ...|$|R

500|$|Taboo, {{known in}} Madagascar as fady, offers {{protection}} for the fossa and other carnivores. In the Marolambo District (part of the Atsinanana region in Toamasina Province), the fossa has traditionally been hated and feared as a dangerous animal. It {{has been described as}} [...] "greedy and aggressive", known for taking fowl and piglets, and believed to [...] "take little children who walk alone into the forest". Some do not eat it for fear that it will transfer its undesirable qualities to anyone who consumes it. However, the animal is also taken for bushmeat; a study published in 2009 reported that 57percent of villages (8 of 14 sampled) in the Makira forest consume fossa meat. The animals were typically hunted using slingshots, with dogs, or most commonly, by placing snare traps on animal paths. Near Ranomafana National Park, the fossa, along with several of its smaller cousins and the introduced <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>civet</b> (Viverricula indica), are known to [...] "scavenge on the bodies of ancestors", which are buried in shallow graves in the forest. For this reason, eating these animals is strictly prohibited by fady. However, if they wander into villages in search of domestic fowl, they may be killed or trapped. Small carnivore traps have been observed near chicken runs in the village of Vohiparara.|$|E
