5|$|After several revisions, the <b>studbook</b> {{was closed}} in 1922 after {{registering}} 424 foundation horses. The {{closing of the}} <b>studbook</b> brought about additional purebred breeding and selection based on conformation, color and working ability. In 1923, an association of Poitevin breeders was founded, but declining livestock production pushed the group to reorganize in 1937 {{in order to gain}} more support from the government, through bonuses and subsidies.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Anglo-Norman <b>studbook</b> was {{combined}} with other regional warmblood saddle horses such as the Demi-sang du Centre and the Vendéen {{in order to create}} a unified national warmblood <b>studbook</b> for the Selle Français or French saddle horse. The French government actively supported the merger of regional types and breeds with a large financial appropriation. In spite of this merger, for decades afterwards, horses from Anglo-Norman bloodlines were clearly identifiable within the Selle Français due to differences in conformation.|$|E

5|$|According to the Kennel Club <b>studbook,</b> Old Jock was bred at {{some point}} during 1859 either by Captain Percy Williams in his Rufford Kennels, or by Jack Morgan who at the time was a huntsman with the Grove Kennels. He was bred from Jock and Grove Pepper, both huntman's terriers. Jock was owned by Captain Williams, while Grove Pepper was owned by Morgan. It was claimed in W.D.

5|$|The Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. Developed as an {{all-around}} farm and riding horse in eastern Kentucky, it {{is related to}} the Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breeds. In 1989 the Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse Association (KMSHA) was formed, and in 2002, the subsidiary Spotted Mountain Horse Association (SMHA) was developed to register Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses with excessive white markings and pinto patterns. Conformation standards are the same for the two groups of horses, with the main difference being the color requirements. The KMSHA <b>studbook</b> is now closed to horses from unregistered parents, although it cross-registers with several other registries, while the SMHA <b>studbook</b> remains open.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient the breed towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized the breed association. In 1992, a new <b>studbook</b> {{was created for}} the breed, with new selection criteria designed to preserve {{the quality of the}} breed, particularly its gaits. The latest editions of the breed registry and <b>studbook</b> are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works to preserve and promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, Vendee and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included approximately half of the Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the Norwegian or Dole Trotter <b>studbook</b> {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. The Dole Trotter <b>studbook</b> is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of the same standards. The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais or Charollais is an extinct {{breed of}} warmblood horse from the Charolais region of France {{surrounding}} {{the town of}} Charolles, now in the Saône-et-Loire department of Burgundy, in eastern central France. Like other French warmbloods, it {{was the result of}} crossing local agricultural horses with the Thoroughbred, and was known by the name of the region in which it was bred. The Charolais never had a breed-specific <b>studbook.</b> The Charolais and other French warmblood breeds were fused in 1958 to create the national warmblood <b>studbook</b> for a unified breed, the Selle Français. It was originally used as a multipurpose horse for riding, driving, and agriculture. During the late 19th century, additional Thoroughbred blood was added and a new type emerged that was principally used as a light cavalry mount. It was also used for dressage and show jumping.|$|E

L'association nationale des races mulassières du Poitou manages the <b>studbook</b> for the Poitevin horse, the Poitou donkey and the Poitou mule, and is recognized by the French Ministry of Agriculture.

5|$|The Dole Gudbrandsdal, Dølahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway. The Dole Trotter is {{alternately}} {{considered a}} subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{and a separate}} breed; it is also considered {{a part of the}} Coldblood trotter type. The Dole Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse, known for its pulling power and agility, while the Dole Trotter is a smaller, faster horse used for harness racing; the two types are commonly interbred. Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the <b>studbook,</b> which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type. The Dole is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley, and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse. Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred, Arabian and other blood added in, especially during the creation of the Dole Trotter in the 19th century. The first <b>studbook</b> was created in 1941, and the current breed association formed in 1947. Although originally used mainly as a pack horse, today the heavier Dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes. The Dole Gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding.|$|E
