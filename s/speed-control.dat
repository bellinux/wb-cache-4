25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or <b>speed-control</b> feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E

His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub-chassis as part of the <b>speed-controlling</b> system. Moghaddam built a prototype using a fire door. Hashemi, a friend who had heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one, teamed up to start the company. The Darius loudspeaker design, based on the re-examination of the relationship between and magnitudes of movements of the tweeter and the woofer, was already in prototype.

He believed that the mean line traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant.

Needing a top plinth roughly an inch (25mm) thick made from wood with a density of about 700 to 800kg/m3, Moghaddam found suitable material in a fire door with which he built a prototype. His friend Tufan Hashemi – then an investment analyst – heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one. They agreed to team up to start production; Roksan Audio was formed. The Xerxes, introduced in 1985, secured the advocacy of Roger Macer, a successful independent hi-fi retailer in London who sold the then market leader, the Linn Sondek. Hashemi credits Macer with urging him to start satisfying the demand of [...] "dozens or more a week" [...] from his customers. The product, named after the Persian king Xerxes I, was launched at a hi-fi show in 1985 where the Roksan Darius loudspeaker concept was also unveiled.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} neural network models for adaptive control of arm movement trajectories during visually guided reaching and, more generally, {{a framework for}} unsupervised real-time error-based learning. The models clarify how a child, or untrained robot, can learn to reach for objects that it sees. Piaget has provided basic insights with his concept of a circular reaction: As an infant makes internally generated movements of its hand, the eyes automatically follow this motion. A transformation is learned between the visual representation of hand position and the motor representation of hand position. Learning of this transformation eventually enables the child to accurately reach for visually detected targets. Grossberg and Kuperstein have shown how the eye movement system can use visual error signals to correct movement parameters via cerebellar learning. Here it is shown how endogenously generated arm movements lead to adaptive tuning of arm control parameters. These movements also activate the target position representations {{that are used to}} learn the visuo-motor transformation that controls visually guided reaching. The AVITE model presented here is an adaptive neural circuit based on the Vector Integration to Endpoint (VITE) model for arm and speech trajectory generation of Bullock and Grossberg. In the VITE model, a Target Position Command (TPC) represents the location of the desired target. The Present Position Command (PPC) encodes the present hand-arm configuration. The Difference Vector (DV) population continuously. computes the difference between the PPC and the TPC. A <b>speed-controlling</b> GO signal multiplies DV output. The PPC integrates the (DV) ·(GO) product and generates an outflow command to the arm. Integration at the PPC continues at a rate dependent on GO signal size until the DV reaches zero, at which time the PPC equals the TPC. The AVITE model explains how self-consistent TPC and PPC coordinates are autonomously generated and learned. Learning of AVITE parameters is regulated by activation of a self-regulating Endogenous Random Generator (ERG) of training vectors. Each vector is integrated at the PPC, giving rise to a movement command. The generation of each vector induces a complementary postural phase during which ERG output stops and learning occurs. Then a new vector is generated and the cycle is repeated. This cyclic, biphasic behavior is controlled by a specialized gated dipole circuit. ERG output autonomously stops in such a way that, across trials, a broad sample of workspace target positions is generated. When the ERG shuts off, a modulator gate opens, copying the PPC into the TPC. Learning of a transformation from TPC to PPC occurs using the DV as an error signal that is zeroed due to learning. This learning scheme is called a Vector Associative Map, or VAM. The VAM model is a general-purpose device for autonomous real-time error-based learning and performance of associative maps. The DV stage serves the dual function of reading out new TPCs during performance and reading in new adaptive weights during learning, without a disruption of real-time operation. YAMs thus provide an on-line unsupervised alternative to the off-line properties of supervised error-correction learning algorithms. YAMs and VAM cascades for learning motor-to-motor and spatial-to-motor maps are described. YAM models and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) models exhibit complementary matching, learning, and performance properties that together provide a foundation for designing a total sensory-cognitive and cognitive-motor autonomous system.

40|$|The speed-sensorless vector-controlled induction-motor {{drive is}} {{superior}} to the conventional vector-controlled induction-motor drive in terms of drive cost and reliability.

However, the performance is limited by the DC-drift problems that prohibit the use of open integration of the flux-producing voltage component for flux estimation. The paper proposes a flux-estimation method that gives the effect of open integration along with an inherent error-decaying mechanism to resolve the DC-drift problem. A stator-resistance-adaptation method is also incorporated in the flux estimator, which makes the flux-position estimation independent of resistive parameters of the motor.

Guide robots for geriatric patients or the visually impaired should follow user’s control command, keeping a certain desired distance allowing the user to work freely. Therefore, it is necessary to acquire control commands and a user’s position on a real-time basis. We suggest a new sensor fusion system to achieve this objective and we will call this sensor the “intelligent lead”. The objective of the intelligent lead is to acquire a stable distance from the user to the robot, <b>speed-control</b> volume and turn-control volume, even when the robot platform with the intelligent lead is shaken on uneven ground. In this paper we explain a precise Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) procedure for this. The intelligent lead physically consists of a Kinect sensor, the serial linkage attached with eight rotary encoders, and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and their measurements are fused by the EKF. A mobile robot was designed to test the performance of the proposed sensor system. After installing the intelligent lead in the mobile robot, several tests are conducted to verify that the mobile robot with the intelligent lead is capable of achieving its goal points while maintaining the appropriate distance between the robot and the user.

This research {{is an effort to}} experimentally verify if Ethernet {{can be used as a}} real-time communication standard in a factory automation setup, by observing the effects of packet delays, packet loss, and network congestion on the performance of a networked control system (NCS). The NCS experimental setup used in this research involves real-time feedback control of multiple plants like DC motors and a magnetic-levitation system connected to one or more controllers. A multi-client-multi-server architecture on a local area network (LAN) was developed using user datagram protocol (UDP) as the communication protocol. Key observations are as follows. (1) The multi-client-single-server system showed the highest packet delays compared to single-client-single-server architecture. (2) In the singleclient- single-server system, as the Ethernet link utilization increased beyond 82 percent, the average packet delays and steady-state error of the DC motor <b>speed-control</b> system increased by 2231 percent and 304 percent, respectively. (3) Even under high link utilization, adding an additional server to the NCS reduced average packet delays considerably. (4) With large packet sizes, higher packet rates were automatically throttled by Ethernet?s flow control mechanism affecting the real-time communication negatively. (5) In the multiclient- multi-server architecture, average packet delays at higher packet rates, and at higher packet lengths were found to be 40 percent lesser than the those of the single-clientsingle- server system and 87. 5 percent lesser than those of the multi-client-single-server system...|$|E
40|$|A {{networked}} {{control system}} (NCS) is a control system where sensors, actuators, and controllers are interconnected over a communication network. This dissertation presents {{a framework for}} modeling, stability analysis, optimal control, and bandwidth allocation of the NCS. A ball magnetic-levitation (maglev) system, four DC motor <b>speed-control</b> systems, and a wireless autonomous robotic wheelchair are employed as test beds to illustrate and verify the theoretical results of this dissertation. This dissertation first proposes an output feedback method to stabilize and control the NCSs. The random time delays in the controller-to-actuator and sensor-to-controller links are modeled with two time-homogeneous Markov chains while the packet losses are treated with Dirac delta functions. An asymptotic mean-square stability criterion is established {{to compensate for the}} network-induced random time delays and packet losses in the NCS. Then, an algorithm to implement the asymptotic mean-square stability criterion is presented. Experimental results illustrate effectiveness of the proposed output feedback method compared to conventional controllers. The proposed output feedback controller could reduce the errors of the NCS by 13 % and 30 ? 40 % for the cases without and with data packet losses, respectively. The optimal bandwidth allocation and scheduling of the NCS with nonlinear-programming techniques is also presented in the dissertation. The bandwidth utilization (BU) of each client is defined in terms of its sampling frequency. Two nonlinear approximations, exponential and quadratic approximations, are formulated to describe the system performance governed by discrete-time integral absolute error (DIAE) versus sampling frequency. The optimal sampling frequencies are obtained by solving the approximations with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulation and experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approximations and the bandwidth allocation and scheduling algorithms. In simulations and experiments, the two approximations could maximize the total BU of the NCS up to about 98 % of the total available network bandwidth...|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric motors use {{the inverse}} {{piezoelectric}} effect, where microscopically small periodical displacements are transferred to continuous or stepping rotary or linear movements through frictional coupling between a displacement generator (stator) and a moving (slider) element. Although many piezoelectric motor designs have various drive and operating principles, microscopic displacements at the interface of a stator and a slider can have two components: tangential and normal. The displacement in the tangential direction has a corresponding force working against the friction force. The {{function of the}} displacement in the normal direction is to increase or decrease friction force between a stator and a slider. Simply, the generated force alters the friction force due to a displacement in the normal direction, and the force creates movement due to a displacement in the tangential direction. In this paper, we first describe how {{the two types of}} microscopic tangential and normal displacements at the interface are combined in the structures of different piezoelectric motors. We then present a new resonance-drive type piezoelectric motor, where an octagonal plate, with two eyelets {{in the middle of the}} two main surfaces, is used as the stator.

Increased walking variability can lead to increased energetic cost and/or increased fall risk. Conversely, biological noise may be beneficial, even necessary, to enhance motor performance. Indeed, encouraging more variability actually facilitates greater improvements in some forms of locomotor rehabilitation. Thus, {{it is critical to}} identify the fundamental principles humans use to regulate stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking. This study sought to determine how humans regulate stride-to-stride fluctuations in stepping movements during treadmill walking. We developed computational models based on pre-defined goal functions to compare if subjects, from each stride to the next, tried to maintain the same speed as the treadmill, or instead stay in the same position on the treadmill. Both strategies predicted average behaviors empirically indistinguishable from each other and from that of humans. These strategies, however, predicted very different stride-to-stride fluctuation dynamics. Comparisons to experimental data showed that human stepping movements were generally well-predicted by the <b>speed-control</b> model, but not by the position-control model. Human subjects also exhibited no indications they corrected deviations in absolute position only intermittently: i. e., closer to the boundaries of the treadmill. Thus, humans clearly do not adopt a control strategy whose primary goal is to maintain some constant absolute position on the treadmill. Instead, humans appear to regulate their stepping movements in a way most consistent with a strategy whose primary goal is to try to maintain the same speed as the treadmill at each consecutive stride. These findings have important implications both for understanding how biological systems regulate walking in general and for being able to harness these mechanisms to develop more effective rehabilitation interventions to improve locomotor performance...|$|E
40|$|TutorialTwo {{types of}} prime movers are {{continuously}} applied for rotating machinery: mechanical and electric drives. This tutorial focuses on electric drives, which are actually composed of separate components: electric motor, frequency converter (optional), and electric network including transformers. The main {{aim of this}} tutorial is to explain the phenomena of electric drives related to the torsional vibrations. All the components of an electric drive may affect torsional dynamics of the system. Naturally the main concern is torsional excitations. Another aspect is the electromechanical interaction in the air-gap of the motor that produces electromagnetic torsional stiffness and damping. These and other similar phenomena, related to the electric drives, have been observed on test fields and site conditions. The scope of the paper includes the most common induction, synchronous and permanent magnet motors. First, the various rotor structures of electric motors are discussed. Then, the effects of electromagnetic stiffness and damping on the torsional dynamics are introduced. Next, the main electric excitations are presented and their effect on drivetrain dimensioning is discussed. Various modelling and analysis methods are also presented for drive-trains with an electric motor. The previous sections focus on the motor without any frequency converter. The rest of the paper deals with the variable speed drives. First the main voltage source inverter, current source inverter and load commutated inverter drive types, their operational principles and application areas are introduced. Then the harmonic and inter-harmonic torsional excitations are explained that depend on the configuration {{and control of the}} frequency converter. The main functionality of a variable speed drive system is the <b>speed-control</b> feedback loop. This loop is used to maintain the preset speed. Although this feedback loop is also a potential source of instability it can with proper tuning be used to damp low frequency torsional resonances. The analysis guidelines and design principles are distributed throughout the paper. The paper is concluded with summary and main recommendations...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{closed-loop}} control strategies over {{a communication network}} with multiple clients are developed. To accomplish this objective, a steel-ball magnetic-levitation system, a DC motor <b>speed-control</b> system, and an autonomous wheelchair robot referred to as Clients 1, 2, and 3, respectively were used as Networked-Based-control (NCS) test beds to validate the proposed strategies. For real-time operation, Linux with Real-Time Application Interface (RTAI) and Control and Measurement Interface (Comedi) were used as the operating system for Clients 1 and 2. Client 3 's software was written in Microsoft Visual Basic 6. 0 on the Windows XP operating system (OS). User datagram protocol (UDP) {{was used as the}} communication network protocol in this research due to its better real-time performance instead of transmission control protocol (TCP). Although UDP has no guarantee for transferring data, it has smaller overheads and less time delay than TCP. Since the robotic wheelchair and the server are run on different OSs, Samba was used to put both systems into the same LAN with a fast data-transmission speed. Using Samba, the round-trip communication time between the robotic wheelchair and the server is only 11. 2 ms whereas 30. 8 ms is taken without using Samba. When the server receives the sensor data from multiple clients at the same time, the NCS stability may be deteriorated due to the limitation of the system bandwidth. The NCS stability is affected by the sampling period of the system, and the reduction of the sampling period improves the control loop's performance. However, a shorter sampling period requires more network bandwidth to transmit more sensor data or control data, which increases the network traffic load. Using the PING test, the transmission time for each control loop was measured. The processing time for each system was also measured by a time-stamp function, and the operation time for each control loop was obtained. In order to maintain the NCS stable, several combinations of the sampling periods for each client are suggested and verified. The bandwidth utilization of Client 1 is set to be 43. 5 % and the range of the bandwidth utilization of Client 2 with guaranteed stability was found to be between 9. 1 % and 45. 3 %. Thus, the bandwidth utilization of Client 3 is from 11. 8 % to 46. 8 %. The multiple-client NCS test bed could maintain its stability within these ranges of the bandwidth utilizations of all clients...|$|E
