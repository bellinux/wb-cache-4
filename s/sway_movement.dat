There are two main expansion joints, one at each interface between the suspended span and the cantilever arms, and there are others at the towers and at the interface of the steel and concrete structures at both approach. There are total 8 articulation joints, 3 at each of the cantilever arms and 1 each in the suspended portion. These joints divide the bridge into segments with vertical pin connection between them to facilitate rotational movements of the deck. The bridge deck has longitudinal ruling gradient of 1 in 40 from either end, joined by a vertical curve of radius 4,000 ft. The cross gradient of deck is 1 in 48 between kerbs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The post-buckling {{behavior}} of rectangular frames in an elastic domain is studied in depth. In analysis, unsymmetrical geometry, sway possibility and support conditions are considered {{in order to}} find their influences on load-deflection paths and non-linear deformations. The static perturbation technique is used for analysis and discussion. The first, a second order perturbation problem as an accurate measurement for the frame, is solved and the solutions compared with previously published papers. The results reveal that symmetric frames with a <b>sway</b> <b>movement,</b> due to lack of an axial force in the beam in the first order perturbation analysis, have a symmetric bifurcation point. However, the post-buckling {{behavior of}} un-symmetric frames with or without sway is bifurcated in an asymmetric manner...|$|E

Differences associated with the dominant foot could represent the difference in space perception of each person. Objectives: To examine whether the dominant foot could affect the postural control mechanism using the BTT. Methods:Ninety-seven healthy participants enrolled {{in the study were}} classified into right-foot and left-foot dominance groups, and their performances were compared. For the BTT, each participant stood on a stabilometer and caught the movement of a visual target moving vertically (anterior-posterior) or horizontally by the center of pressure movement, displayed on a 14 -inch screen monitor at 100 cm in front of the subject. The mean displacement angle of the obtained stabilogram was evaluated by principal component analysis. Results: The AP BTT in the right-foot dominance group showed a clockwise tilt with a mean displacement angle of 3. 022 ± 3. 761, whereas the group with left-foot dominance had a modest counter-clockwise tilt with a mean displacement angle of – 0. 694 ± 4. 497.

40|$|We {{describe}} reversals of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) {{with the}} phase of a voluntary cyclic whole-body <b>sway</b> <b>movement.</b> Subjects (n = 9) held a standard load in extended arms and released it by a bilateral shoulder abduction motion in a self-paced manner at different phases of the sway. The load release task was also performed during quiet stance in three positions: {{in the middle of}} the sway range and close to its extreme forward and backward positions. Larger APAs were seen during the sway task as compared to quiet stance. Although the direction of postural perturbation associated with the load release was always the same, the direction of the APAs in the leg muscles reversed when the subjects were close to the extreme forward position as compared to the APAs in other phases and during quiet stance. The trunk muscles showed smaller APA modulation at the extreme positions but larger modulation when passing through the middle position, depending on the direction of sway, forward or backward. The phenomenon of APA reversals emphasizes the important role of safety in the generation of postural adjustments associated with voluntary movements. Based on these findings, APAs could be defined as changes in the activity of postural muscles associated with a predictable perturbation that act to provide maximal safety of the postural task component...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the use of Kinect, a commonly available video game sensor, for capturing and analyzing whole body movement patterns. Healthy adults (n= 20) played a weight shifting exergame under five different conditions with varying amplitudes and speed of <b>sway</b> <b>movement,</b> while 3 D positions of ten body segments were recorded in the frontal plane using Kinect and a Vicon 3 D camera system. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract and compare movement patterns and the variance in individual body segment positions explained by these patterns. Using the identified patterns, balance outcome measures based on spatiotemporal sway characteristics were computed. The results showed that both Vicon and Kinect capture > 90 % variance of all body segment movements within three PCs. Kinect-derived movement patterns were found to explain variance in trunk movements accurately, yet explained variance in hand and foot segments was underestimated and overestimated respectively by as much as 30 %. Differences between both systems with respect to balance outcome measures range 0. 3 – 64. 3 %.

40|$|Total body {{center of}} mass (TBCM) is a useful {{kinematic}} measurement of body sway. However, expensive equipment and high technical requirement limit the use of motion capture systems in large-scale clinical settings. Center of pressure (CP) measurement obtained from force plates cannot accurately represent TBCM during large body <b>sway</b> <b>movement.</b> Microsoft Kinect is a rapidly developing, inexpensive, and portable posturographic device, which provides objective and quantitative measurement of TBCM sway. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate Kinect as a clinical assessment tool for TBCM sway measurement. The performance of the Kinect system was compared with a Vicon motion capture system and a force plate. Ten healthy male subjects performed four upright quiet standing tasks: (1) eyes open (EOn), (2) eyes closed (ECn), (3) eyes open standing on foam (EOf), and (4) eyes closed standing on foam (ECf). Our results revealed that the Kinect system produced highly correlated measurement of TBCM sway (mean RMSE = 4. 38 mm; mean CORR = 0. 94 in Kinect-Vicon comparison), as well as comparable intra-session reliability to Vicon. However, the Kinect device consistently overestimated the 95 % CL of sway by about 3 mm. This offset could be due to the limited accuracy, resolution, and sensitivity of the Kinect sensors. The Kinect device was more accurate in the medial-lateral than in the anterior-posterior direction, and performed better than the force plate in more challenging balance tasks, such as (ECf) with larger TBCM sway. Overall, Kinect is a cost-effective alternative to a motion capture and force plate system for clinical assessment of TBCM sway...|$|E

The present study aimed {{to evaluate the}} Kinect V 2 sensor against a gold standard motion capture system with respect to accuracy of tracked landmark movements and accuracy and repeatability of derived clinical parameters. Nineteen healthy subjects were concurrently recorded with a Kinect V 2 sensor and an optical motion tracking system (Vicon). Six different movement tasks were recorded with 3 D full-body kinematics from both systems. Tasks included walking in different conditions, balance and adaptive postural control. After temporal and spatial alignment, agreement of movements signals was described by Pearson's correlation coefficient and signal to noise ratios per dimension. From these movement signals, 45 clinical parameters were calculated, including ranges of motions, torso <b>sway,</b> <b>movement</b> velocities and cadence. Accuracy of parameters was described as absolute agreement, consistency agreement and limits of agreement. Intra-session reliability of 3 to 5 measurement repetitions was described as repeatability coefficient and standard error of measurement for each system. Accuracy of Kinect V 2 landmark movements was moderate to excellent and depended on movement dimension, landmark location and performed task. Signal to noise ratio provided information about Kinect V 2 landmark stability and indicated larger noise behaviour in feet and ankles. Most of the derived clinical parameters showed good to excellent absolute agreement (30 parameters showed ICC(3, 1) > 0. 7) and consistency (38 parameters showed r > 0. 7) between both systems. Given that this system is low-cost, portable and does not require any sensors to {{be attached to the}} body, it could provide numerous advantages when compared to established marker- or wearable sensor based system.

Unfortunately, many seniors who experience a fall never fully recover from the broken bones or fractures. Research indicates that incorrect shifting of body weight is the most common reason for falls among the elderly Improving balance and gait can play an important role in helping older people avoid falls and injury as well as improving their mobility confidence. Our ability to balance decreases naturally as we age—mainly because we lose muscle tone and reflex speed. With this in mind, balance training has become an integral part of a complete fitness programme for seniors geared towards improving balance which can significantly reduce one’s chance of falling. The Wii-Fit is a Nintendo game used for aerobics, strength training, and balance activities. The Nintendo Wii gaming device includes a balance board that senses weight, postural <b>sway</b> <b>movement</b> and balance. The Nintendo Wii Balance Board collects data comparable to a force plate. The Wii board records movements and gives feedback on performance. Though originally designed as a video game controller, the Balance Board has become a proven tool for assessing centre of pressure displacement. It is proven to be both valid and reliable. Clark & Kraemer, (2009) performed a study to prove the validity and test-retest reliability of the use of a Wii balance board. Their study found the Wii Balance Board to be both valid and have high test-retest reliability. The Wii board has the added benefit of being a low-cost, simple to use, wireless and portable device. Articles were retrieved through database searching of Google scholar, PubMed, SportDiscus, EBSCOhost, Medline and online e Journals.
