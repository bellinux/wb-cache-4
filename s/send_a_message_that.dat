5|$|The series {{premiere of}} The Playboy Club was {{initially}} broadcast on September 19, 2011 in the United States on NBC. It was watched by 5.02 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with Hawaii Five-0 on CBS and Castle on ABC. That {{was the lowest}} viewership among the major networks in its 10 p.m. timeslot, with Castle drawing 13.28 million households and Hawaii Five-0 attaining 12.19 million households. The episode gradually shed viewers from the first half to the next, {{with an average of}} 5.36 million households tuning in for the first half-hour and an average of 4.69 million households for the second. The debut earned a 1.6 rating/4 share among viewers in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielson ratings, indicating it was viewed by four percent of those in the demographic who were actively watching television during the broadcast, which represented 1.6 percent of the total demographic. This was considered a disappointing result for a coveted demographic. Speculations regarding the possible cancelation of the series immediately surfaced, but NBC officials told Deadline.com that such a decision would not be rushed because NBC Chairman Bob Greenblatt wanted to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> the network was willing to give all their new shows the necessary time to find an audience and succeed. Similarly in Canada, the pilot episode was viewed by 485,000 viewers.|$|E

25|$|Still more pacifists {{would argue}} that a nonviolent {{reaction}} may not save lives immediately but would in the long run.

It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.|$|E

500|$|Many others {{argued that}} the ship should be removed. Louise Solliday, the {{director}} of the Oregon Department of State Lands, called the removal of the stern a necessary step to demonstrate that the state is [...] "serious about removing wrecks". She stated that if the stern were not removed, the argument that the ship is trespassing on state property (used in the state's lawsuit against New Carissa owners) would be undermined should another vessel wreck off the Oregon coast. The sentiment was later echoed by Oregon Secretary of State Bill Bradbury, who also noted that the settlement of the lawsuit with the ship's owners leaves the state exposed to any liability issues concerning the ship. Many environmentalists, as well as federal biologists and residents of the local community, were concerned about the potential for further ecological damage should the vessel leak any of the fuel oil that remained on board. The editorial board of The Oregonian argued that allowing the stern to remain would <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> the state is willing to [...] "tolerate permanent damage to its beaches". The newspaper also rejected the notion that the wreckage should be compared to the Peter Iredale, a sailing ship that wrecked on a beach near Astoria in the early 1900s, and whose remnants are a popular tourist draw.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, {{gay rights}} groups in New Zealand protested after {{controversial}} rapper Beenie Man {{was included in}} the second round of announcements for the 2010 tour.

The group called for Big Day Out organisers to drop Beenie Man from the line up [...] "to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> homophobia is unacceptable", and over 850 people joined a Facebook group to oppose his appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{refers to}} the actual prosecution of traffickers; UNICEF maintains that successful prosecution of child traffickers is {{the surest way to}} <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> child trafficking will not be tolerated. Traffickers can be [...] "caught" [...] at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as child labour laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by UNICEF which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities.|$|E

Federal judge Emmet G. Sullivan soon signed the order, and since it occurred prior to sentencing it {{had the effect of}} vacating Stevens's conviction. [...] During the trial, Sullivan expressed concern and anger regarding prosecutorial conduct and related issues. [...] Holder, who had taken office only three months earlier, was reportedly very angry at the prosecutors' apparent withholding of exculpatory evidence, and wanted to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> prosecutorial misconduct would not be tolerated under his watch. [...] After Sullivan held the prosecutors in contempt, Holder replaced the entire trial team, including top officials in the public integrity section.|$|E
2500|$|The writers {{felt that}} by killing Dixie, it was {{unexpected}} and went beyond [...] "just being {{about the women}} of Fusion". Killing Dixie was to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> anyone {{could be the next}} to die.

2500|$|The British {{rounded up}} {{a number of}} members of the old {{establishment}} and interned them in Malta, awaiting their trial for alleged crimes during World War I. Calthorpe included only Turkish members of the Government of Tevfik Pasha and the military/political personalities. He wanted to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> a military occupation was in effect and failure to comply would end with harsh punishment. His position was not shared with other partners. The French Government's response to those accused was [...] "distinction to disadvantage of Muslim-Turks while Bulgarian, Austrian and German offenders were as yet neither arrested nor molested". However, the government and the Sultan understood the message. In February 1919, allies were informed that the Ottoman Empire was in compliance with its full apparatus to the occupation forces. Any source of conflict (including Armenian questions) would be investigated by a commission which neutral Governments can attach two legal superintendents. Calthorpe's correspondence to Foreign Office was [...] "The action undertaken for the arrests was very satisfactory, and has, I think, intimidated the Committee of Union and Progress of Constantinople".|$|E
2500|$|In Giuliani's {{first term}} as mayor, the New York City Police Department at the {{instigation}} of Commissioner Bill Bratton adopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on James Q. Wilson's [...] "Broken Windows" [...] approach. This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, cannabis possession, and aggressive panhandling by [...] "squeegee men", {{on the theory}} that this would <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> order would be maintained. The legal underpinning for removing the [...] "squeegee men" [...] from the streets was developed under Giuliani's predecessor, Mayor David Dinkins. Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner Jack Maple, also created and instituted CompStat, a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions. Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data. An extensive study found a high correlation between crime rates reported by the police through CompStat and rates of crime available from other sources, suggesting there had been no manipulation. The CompStat initiative won the 1996 Innovations in Government Award from the Kennedy School of Government.|$|E
2500|$|The Security and Freedom Ensured Act (SAFE) was {{introduced}} {{some time later}} by Republican Senator Larry Craig (R-ID). It {{was introduced}} on October 2, 2003 and was co-sponsored by Senators John E. Sununu (R-NH) and Richard Durbin (D-IL) and would have limited the scope of roving wiretaps, changed the [...] "sneak and peek" [...] delayed notification period from [...] "within a reasonable period" [...] to not later than 7 days after execution of the warrant, restored the requirements for seizure of business records that there are specific and articulate facts that business records are those of a foreign power or agents of a foreign power and prevent the use of National Security Letters {{to gain access to}} library records. It also would have extended the sunset provisions of the Patriot Act to include section 213 (Authority for delaying notice of the execution of a warrant), section 216 (Modification of authorities relating to use of pen registers and trap and trace devices), section 219 (Single-jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism) and section 505 (Miscellaneous national security authorities). The EFF urged the swift passage of the bill, while Senator Russell Feingold urged the bill be passed as [...] "hese are reasonable and moderate changes to the law. They do not gut the provision. They do not make it worthless. They do recognize the growing and legitimate concern from across the political spectrum that this provision was passed in haste and presents the potential for abuse. They also <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> fourth amendment rights have meaning and potential violations of those rights should be minimized if at all possible." [...] In Congressional debate, Rick Durbin stated that [...] "many in Congress did not want to deny law enforcement some of the reasonable reforms contained in the PATRIOT Act that they needed to combat terrorism. So, we reluctantly decided to support the administration's version of the bill, but not until we secured a commitment that they would be responsive to Congressional oversight and consult extensively with us before seeking any further changes in the law." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E
