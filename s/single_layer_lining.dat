30|$|There is {{controversy}} about {{the hypothesis that}} ovarian epithelial tumours arise from the <b>single</b> cell <b>layer</b> <b>lining</b> the ovarian surface. This theory fails to explain the morphological resemblance of tumours found outside the ovary that are identical to ovarian carcinomas. Further, it fails to explain why some ovarian tumours resemble tumours derived from the Müllerian ducts, such as the fallopian tubes, endometrium and endocervix. The alternate hypothesis is that components of the secondary Müllerian system, which includes endosalpingiosis, endometriosis, paraovarian/paratubal cysts, rete ovarii and endocervicosis, {{may play a role}} in tumourigenesis [22]. The possibility of malignant change of endosalpingiosis must be considered, analogous to carcinoma arising in endometriosis. In endosalpingiosis, the tubal nature of the epithelium may be obscured by cell flattening in an expanding cyst or be distorted by proliferating cells. The end of the spectrum is a serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, or more rarely, a papillary carcinoma of the peritoneum. Although the incidence of this malignant transformation is not known, it is important to evaluate each focus of endosalpingiosis.|$|R

Endothelial dysfunction independently predicts cardio-vascular events and improvement in endothelial function is associated with decreased vascular risk. Previous studies have suggested that exercise training improves endothelial function in macrovessels, a benefit mediated via repeated episodic increases in shear stress. However, less is known of the effects of shear stress modulation in microvessels. In the present study we examined the hypothesis that repeated skin heating improves cutaneous microvascular vaso-dilator function via a shear stress-dependent mechanism. We recruited 10 recreationally active males who underwent bilateral forearm immersion in warm water (42 ◦C), 3 times per week for 30 min. During these immersion sessions, shear stress was manipulated in one arm by inflating a pneumatic cuff to 100 mmHg, whilst the other arm remained uncuffed.

40|$|Layered {{materials}} have been extensively studied and {{have found a}} wide range of applications predominately in the form of intercalated layered hybrids, or as exfoliated <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets. Previous investigations in layered materials mainly focused on the preparation of layered intercalation compounds and obtaining <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets. The preparation of layered intercalation compounds and exfoliation to obtain <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets typically consists of two steps, where a layered material is first synthesized and subsequently intercalated/exfoliated through different approaches. However, the two step process is time consuming and inefficient. Moreover, the desired intercalation and exfoliation may not proceed as planned. Thus, it is highly desirable to explore new methodologies for facile synthesis of layered intercalation compounds and <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets. This dissertation reports a novel approach to directly synthesize layered intercalation compounds and <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets via a one-step process. Two model layered compounds: α-zirconium phosphate (α-ZrP) with negative layer charge and layered double hydroxide (LDH) with positive layer charge were selected for the one-step direct synthesis of layered intercalation compounds and <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets, respectively. The introduction of a layer growth coordinator and inhibitor was proposed to guide or inhibit the growth of layered materials in the third dimension for the formation of layered intercalation compounds and <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets, respectively. Our results have proved that the proposed one-step direct synthesis process to obtain layered intercalation compounds and <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets is feasible. Detailed reaction mechanisms and the factors that influence the direct synthesis of layered intercalation compounds and <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> nanosheets were studied in detail.
