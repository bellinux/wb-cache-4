40|$|International audienceHerein {{we report}} the {{preparation}} of hierarchically micro- and nanostructured polymer surfaces in block copolymer/homopolymer blends. The structural order at different length scales was obtained combining two methodologies, e. g., the breath figures method to produce porous microstructures ("top-down" approach) with block copolymer self-assembly to induce microphase separation at the nanometer length scale ("bottom-up" approach). The interplay of the breath figure formation during the spin-coating and self-assembly of the triblock copolymer allowed {{the preparation of}} polymer surfaces having micrometer-sized cavities decorated with nanostructured block copolymers. The system described herein possesses unique characteristics. First, the surface chemical composition can be varied by a surface rearrangement upon <b>annealing</b> either <b>to</b> dry or humid air. Moreover, surface rearrangement is accompanied with structural changes, i. e. both topography and nanostructuration can be reversibly modified upon annealing. In terms of topograghy, a transition between holes and hills was obtained upon <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> <b>to</b> water vapor and can be recovered upon <b>annealing</b> <b>to</b> dry air.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research on}} the effects of <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> parameters on a change of the impact strength KC and Brinell hardness (HB) of the EN AC-AlSi 11 alloy. The research has been performed according to the trivalent testing plan for two input parameters – temperature in the range between 280 °C and 370 °C and time in the range between 2 and 8 hours. The application of such heat treatment improves the plasticity of the investigated alloy. The improvement of the impact strength KC by 71 % and the decrease of the hardness HB by 20 % was achieved for the <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> treatment conducted at a temperature 370 °C for 8 hours, compared to the alloy without the heat treatment. A change of the form of eutectic silicon precipitations which underwent refinement, coagulation and partial rounding, had a direct effect on the hardness HB and impact strength KC.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} results of {{laboratory}} testing of compression and bolted splices installed on stranded aluminum power conductors. The tests on compression splices involved connectors of 10 different designs using 240 mm 2 stranded aluminum cable. Testing on the bolted splices was performed on connectors of 16 different designs installed on stranded aluminum cable with dimensions of 50 and 240 mm 2. Splice performance was assessed {{on the basis of}} resistance measure-ments during short-circuit tests and thermal cycling as specified by the IEC 61238 - 1 standard, and from inspections of cross-sectioned connections. Differences in splice performance are related to such factors as physical properties of the materials in contact, splice assembly procedures, number of compression indentations or number of bolts, and other rele-vant parameters. The influence of conductor deformation on the ability to disrupt of aluminum oxide films on the conductor surface during connector installation is addressed. The laboratory data indicate that large mechanical deformations in a splice significantly improve connector performance. For com-pression splices, relatively <b>soft</b> (<b>annealed)</b> conductors lead <b>to</b> inferior performance than hard-drawn conductors, unless the soft conductor hardens significantly when it is deformed during installation.

40|$|Abstract. Pearlite {{spheroidisation}} of 100 CrMn 6 steel was investigated. This {{process is}} well known and studied during conventional <b>soft</b> <b>annealing.</b> Presented paper describes cementite lamellae fragmentation during accelerated carbide spheroidisation. Mechanism of cementite lamellae fragmentation during conventional <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> depends on carbon and iron diffusion in ferrite-cementite system. On the other hand, accelerated carbide spheroidisation relies on partial pearlite austenitization and backward austenite decomposition. Aim of presented experiments was to examine shape evolution of cementite particles during transition from lamellar to globular form. Pearlite spheroidisation is normally quantified by image analysis of 2 D metallographic section. Conventional metallographic observation was used for globular-lamellar particle ratio estimation. However, whole lamellae observation is necessary for spheroidisation process revelation. Ferrite matrix deep etching and cementite separation was performed to study morphological aspects of acceolerated carbide spheroidisation...|$|R
