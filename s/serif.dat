5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a <b>serif</b> font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill's work, as are Charlotte Sans and <b>Serif</b> by Michael Gills for Letraset and Mr and Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, {{which are based on}} Baskerville. Indeed, Monotype themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised sans-serif font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill's <b>serif</b> design Joanna. It is intended for use at smaller sizes than Gill Sans.|$|E
5|$|Garamond is a {{group of}} many old-style <b>serif</b> typefaces, named for sixteenth-century Parisian {{engraver}} Claude Garamond (generally spelled as Garamont in his lifetime). Garamond-style typefaces are popular and often used, particularly for printing body text and books.|$|E
5|$|A major {{professional}} competitor to Bembo is Agmena, {{created by}} Jovica Veljović and released by Linotype in 2014. Intended {{as a unified}} <b>serif</b> design supporting Roman, Greek {{and a range of}} Cyrillic alphabets such as Serbian, it features a more calligraphic italic than Bembo with swash capitals and support for Greek ligatures.|$|E
5000|$|Narrow and unbracketed (hairline) <b>serifs.</b> (The <b>serifs</b> have a {{constant}} width along their length.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to these differences in shape of letters, italic lowercases usually lack <b>serifs</b> at the bottoms of strokes, since a pen would bounce up to continue the action of writing. Instead they usually have one-sided <b>serifs</b> that curve up on the outstroke (contrast the flat two-sided <b>serifs</b> of a roman font). One uncommon exception to this is Hermann Zapf's Melior. (Its outstroke <b>serifs</b> are one-sided, but they don't curve up.) ...|$|R
25|$|As <b>serifs</b> {{originated}} in inscription, {{they are generally}} not used in handwriting. A common exception is the printed capital I, where the addition of <b>serifs</b> distinguishes the character from lowercase L. The printed capital J and the numeral 1 are also often handwritten with <b>serifs.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in 'old-style' <b>serif</b> typefaces {{took place in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This saw a revival of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (the office was now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond's own work, had survived in Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its italic, {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular <b>serif</b> at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full <b>serif.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} an {{extensive use of}} Eurostile Bold Extended, Futura and other sans <b>serif</b> typefaces as design elements of the 2001 world. Computer displays show high resolution fonts, color and graphics—far in advance of computers in the 1960s when the film was made.|$|E
50|$|Display-oriented slab <b>serifs</b> {{are often}} {{extremely}} bold, intended {{to grab the}} reader's attention on a poster, while slab <b>serifs</b> oriented towards legibility at small sizes show less extreme characteristics. Some fonts oriented towards small print use and printing on poor-quality newsprint paper may have slab <b>serifs</b> to increase legibility, while their other features are closer to conventional book type fonts.|$|R
50|$|Letters without <b>serifs</b> {{have been}} common in writing across history, {{for example in}} casual, non-monumental {{epigraphy}} of the classical period. However, Roman square capitals, the inspiration for much Latin-alphabet lettering throughout history, had prominent <b>serifs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The fonts {{available}} for the IBM Executive typewriters helped to convey the impression of typeset text. Fonts on monospaced typewriters usually have very wide <b>serifs</b> on narrow letters like [...] "i" [...] so that they visually fill the same horizontal space as letters like [...] "m" [...] and [...] "w". So that these letters do not look out of place, {{most of the others}} are given strong <b>serifs</b> as well. Along with the constant spacing, these <b>serifs</b> give a distinctive [...] "typewriter look" [...] to documents. With proportional spacing, the IBM Executive typewriters could abandon the wide <b>serifs</b> and use fonts that closely resembled those used in typesetting.|$|R
5|$|The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 {{were painted}} {{in a special}} version of the {{standard}} crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered with fine red lines. <b>Serif</b> lettering and numerals in gold leaf and vermillion shading were applied. Handrails and sundry small external fittings were chrome-plated, as were the nameplates, which had a black background.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style <b>serif</b> fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style <b>serif</b> letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with a slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{monoline}} slab <b>serifs</b> such as Serifa, Helserif and Roboto Slab {{have been}} designed {{under the influence of}} neo-grotesque or realist sans-serif fonts of the 1950s and 60s onwards, and these may be called [...] "neo-grotesque" [...] slab <b>serifs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Japanese typography, the {{equivalent}} of <b>serifs</b> on kanji and kana characters are called uroko—"fish scales". In Chinese, the <b>serifs</b> are called either youjiaoti (有脚体, lit. [...] "forms with legs") or youchenxianti (有衬线体, lit. [...] "forms with ornamental lines").|$|R
500|$|Some 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) {{have the}} <b>serifs</b> {{at the foot}} of the [...] "R" [...] in [...] "LIBERTY" [...] missing; this is dubbed the [...] "peg leg" [...] variety. The <b>serifs</b> are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint {{obtained}} better steel for dies, the <b>serifs</b> returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks <b>serifs</b> on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower's head during the coin's tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.|$|R
5|$|There {{are nearly}} 100,000 hatt-ı hümayuns in the Ottoman {{archives}} in Istanbul. Among the more famous are the Edict (hatt-ı <b>şerîf)</b> of Gülhane of 1839 and the Imperial Reform Edict (hatt-ı hümayun) of 1856. For this last one, the Turkish term Tanzimat Fermanı is more accurate. This decree, which started the so-called Tanzimat reforms, is so called because it carries a handwritten order by the sultan {{to the grand}} vizier to execute his command.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Monotype's current {{digitisation}} of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants, {{including some}} of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight (once an option in metal type) which had been digitised for Grazia. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed 'Medium'. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill's work, as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill's <b>serif</b> design Joanna. One addition was italic swash caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.|$|E
5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in <b>serif</b> style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E

5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no <b>serif</b> pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result of}} defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
5|$|Old-style <b>serif</b> typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E
25|$|<b>Serif,</b> or Roman, typefaces {{are named}} for the {{features}} {{at the ends of}} their strokes. Times Roman and Garamond are common examples of <b>serif</b> typefaces. <b>Serif</b> fonts are probably the most used class in printed materials, including most books, newspapers and magazines. <b>Serif</b> fonts are often classified into three subcategories: Old Style, Transitional, and Didone (or Modern), representative examples of which are Garamond, Baskerville, and Bodoni respectively.|$|E

[...] Usually these are considered equivalent, but they are distinguished in some extended Latin alphabet systems, such as the 1978 version of the African reference alphabet. In that system, the former is the uppercase counterpart of ɪ and the latter is the counterpart of 'i'.|$|R
25|$|Typefaces can {{be divided}} into two main categories: <b>serif</b> and sans <b>serif.</b> Serifs {{comprise}} the small features at the end of strokes within letters. The printing industry refers to typeface without serifs as sans <b>serif</b> (from French sans, meaning without), or as grotesque (or, in German, grotesk).|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Typographers and {{printers}} traditionally regard typefaces with <b>serifs</b> as more legible than typefaces without <b>serifs.</b> Authors {{argue that}} readers prefer seriffed typefaces, read them faster, recognize them easier {{and that there}} could possibly be a higher comprehension rate with material printed in these typefaces. There is also the belief that seriffed typefaces assist in a horizontal movement whilst reading, and that the <b>serifs</b> help to distinguish different letters from each other [1, p. 30]. This alleged horizontal flow that is necessary for comfortable reading {{does not seem to}} concur with the saccadic eye movements that really occur during reading.
