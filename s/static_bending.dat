40|$|Long {{molecules}} of DNA have the statistical properties of a worm-like coil. Deviations from linearity occur {{both because of}} small dynamic bends induced by thermal motion and from a random distribution of <b>static</b> <b>bends.</b> The latter originate in the different conformations {{of each of the}} possible base pair sequences. In this paper a statistical theory of the persistence length of DNA is developed which includes both static and dynamic effects for each base pair sequence, as well as the sequence-dependent correlations of bending angles. The result applies to a generic DNA, i. e., the average over an ensemble of all possible sequences. The theory is also applied to the generation of the average properties of curved DNAs by an analytic method that includes dynamic averaging as well as correlated bends. These results provide information which supplements that obtained by others using Monte Carlo methods. The additivity relation l/P = l/P, + l/P, proposed by Trifonov et al., where P is the persistence length and P, and Pd are the persistence lengths arising from purely static and dynamic effects, respectively, has been verified to be accurate to better than 0. 5 %.

A reversed bending load is applied using a rotating drill pipe in a four point <b>static</b> <b>bend</b> arrangement {{with the possibility of}} applying an additional static tension load. Drill pipes were tested with and without static tension at different cyclic bending stresses. The stress amplitudes ranged from 30 MPa to 230 MPa on the outside surface of the drill pipe. The test results show a consistent failure mode with a circumferential crack propagating in the groove of the first engaged thread of the pin, i. e. the male section of the joint. The fracture surface as well as ultrasonic monitoring of the sample during the testing suggest that the circumferential crack growth rate is fast, and final fracture occurs within {{a relatively small number of}} cycles as soon as a through wall crack has been formed.

We report here studies indicating that the requirement for IHF binding near the pSC 101 replication origin is circumvented partially or completely by (i) mutation of the plasmid-encoded repA (replicase) gene or the chromosomally encoded topA gene, (ii) the presence on the plasmid of the pSC 101 partition (par) locus, or (iii) replacement of the par locus by a strong transcriptional promoter. With the exception of the repA mutation, the factors that substitute for a functional origin region IHF binding site are known to alter plasmid topology by increasing negative DNA supercoiling, as does IHF itself. These results are consistent with the proposal that IHF binding near the pSC 101 replication origin promotes plasmid replication by inducing a conformational change leading to formation of a repA-dependent DNA-protein complex.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved crack model incorporating non-linearity of flexural damage in concrete to reproduce changes in vibration properties of cracked reinforced concrete beams. A reinforced concrete beam model with multiple-distributed flexural cracks is developed, {{in which the}} cracked regions are modelled using the fictitious crack approach and the undamaged parts are treated in a linear-elastic manner. The model is subject to incremental <b>static</b> four-point <b>bending,</b> and its dynamic behaviour is examined using different sinusoidal excitations including swept sine and harmonic signals. From the swept sine excitations, the model simulates changes in resonant frequency with increasing damage. The harmonic excitations are utilised to investigate changes in modal stiffness extracted from the restoring force surfaces, {{and changes in the}} level of non-linearity are deduced from the appearance of super-harmonics in the frequency domain. The simulation results are compared with experimental data of reinforced concrete beams subject to incremental <b>static</b> four-point <b>bending.</b> The comparisons revealed that the proposed crack model is able to quantitatively predict changes in vibration characteristics of cracked reinforced concrete beams. Changes are sensitive to support stiffness, where the sensitivity increases with stiffer support conditions. Changes in the level of non-linearity with damage are not suitable for damage detection in reinforced concrete structures because they do not follow a monotonic trend.
