40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] productivity of <b>space-based</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>satellite</b> sensors to collect images {{is directly related to}} the agility of the spacecraft. Increasing the satellite agility, without changing the attitude control hardware, can be accomplished by using optimal control to design shortest-time maneuvers. The performance improvement that can be obtained using optimal control is tied to the specific configuration of the satellite, e. g. mass properties and reaction wheel array geometry. Therefore, it is generally difficult to predict performance without an extensive simulation study. This paper presents a simple idea for estimating the agility enhancement that can be obtained using optimal control without the need to solve any optimal control problems. The approach is based on the concept of the agility envelope, which expresses the capability of a spacecraft in terms of a three-dimensional agility volume. Validation of this new approach is conducted using both simulation and on-orbit data...|$|E

40|$|A loop {{heat pipe}} (LHP) {{is a very}} {{versatile}} heat transfer device that can transport a large heat load over a long distance with a small temperature difference. All LHPs currently servicing orbiting spacecraft are designed {{to operate in the}} room temperature range. Future space telescopes and <b>space-based</b> Earth resource <b>imaging</b> <b>satellites</b> require passive cryogenic heat transport devices that can thermally couple remote cryocoolers to sensor or instrument of interest while providing the capability of payload vibration jitter isolation, implementation of redundant coolers, and coupling of multiple sensors to a common heat sink. All of these requirements can be satisfied by using a cryogenic LHP (CLHP). Although the development of CLHPs faces several technical challenges, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has devoted extensive efforts in developing CLHP technology over the past decade and has made significant progress. In particular, the combination of the innovative ideas of using a secondary capillary pump to manage the parasitic heat gain and using a hot reservoir to reduce the system pressure under the ambient condition has led to the successful development of the CLHP. Several CLHPs charged with nitrogen and hydrogen were built and tested in thermal vacuum chambers. These CLHPs demonstrated reliable start-up and robust operation during power cycle and sink temperature cycle tests...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{demand for}} space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data {{has grown to}} the point where {{significant}} commercial funding of advanced space-borne radar system development has been being made available. The current generation of commercial <b>space-based</b> SAR <b>imaging</b> <b>satellites,</b> such as RADARSAT- 2, Sentinel- 1, TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (PAZ), COSMO-SkyMED and ALOS- 2, operate at a single frequency (L-, Cand X-band) and are based on active phased array antenna technology that offers beam agility and adds polarization diversity. Consequently, these modern satellites are equipped with more than one receive channel (i. e., AD-converter) that can also be utilized to record measurements from multiple apertures in along-track direction. This is the principal prerequisite for a ground moving target indication (GMTI) 1 capability. While space-based SAR GMTI offers many advantages like global ground coverage and access to strategic regions, it also faces several obstacles such as high satellite velocity, Earth rotation and oftentimes small target reflection energy caused by the enormous distances of more than 1, 000 km among others. This book chapter presents the state-of-the-art of space-based SAR-GMTI science and technology with focus on recent advances and the latest direction of research and development (R&D) activities. Owing to an exponential cost jump, technological advances of space-based radars especially with regard to increased power, increased aperture sizes and additional receiver channels have only been somewhat incremental in the last decades. Spacecraft with more than two parallel receive paths are only expected to materialize two generations down the line. Hence, current R&D put emphasis on innovative new concepts trying to circumvent these technological limitations thereby often pushing the resources on existing SAR payloads to their limits. 2 Virtually all of these concepts are accompanied by cutting-edge but complex and resource-hungry signal-processing algorithms that only recently became feasible based on the fast-paced evolution in computing power over the last decade. Many of the presented proof-of-concept studies are considered building blocks of future operational space-based SAR capabilities, for instance, the synergy between high-resolution-wide-swath (HRWS) imaging and motion indication and estimation. This chapter attempts to provide a comprehensive, in-depth overview of the theory and the radar signalprocessing techniques required for space-based SAR-GMTI corroborated by real multichannel data from RADARSAT- 2...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNanoSats {{have become}} viable {{alternative}} to larger spacecraft that focuses on providing the end user with access to space and similar functionality to mainstream missions. However, motion blur ruins the images captured under the situation that NanoSats work in low-earth orbit at high speeds. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} deblurring images degraded due to <b>space-based</b> <b>imaging</b> system shaking or movements of observing targets. We propose a motion deblurring strategy relying on the powerful on-board computing capability of our Sandroid CubeSats, a member of NanoSats, to compensate for the functional inadequacy of hardware. We use Improved Genetic Algorithm within the strategy to obtain a better linear motion blur kernel and then perform non-blind deconvolution on a single image taken by the <b>space-based</b> <b>imaging</b> system on our Sandroid CubeSats to produce a deblurred result. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed strategy...|$|R

40|$|Imaging {{satellites}} {{are traditionally}} scheduled in a static fashion; namely the schedule is created off-line and then uploaded {{to one or}} more <b>imaging</b> <b>satellites</b> to be executed as an immutable sequence of commands.

We develop the remote sensing scheduling problem and discuss contingency conditions under which the satellite scheduling problem becomes dynamic. We then review existing work on contingency scheduling and conditional scheduling and propose extensions to address the dynamic satellite scheduling problem. Dynamic schedules will yield improved mission schedules and reduced mission costs. 1...|$|R

Besides, a novel dynamic emergency scheduling algorithm called DM-DES is presented, which considers the dynamic merging. To demonstrate the superiority of our DM-DES, we conduct extensive experiments by simulations to compare DM-DES with an existing algorithm––RBHA as well as a baseline algorithm––DES.
