40|$|The <b>daily</b> <b>site</b> <b>report</b> (DSR) —a common tool, which {{contains}} {{a lot of}} valuable data— is normally used for litigation purposes, i. e. claims and dispute resolution. All these valuable data are rarely used for the management {{and control of the}} ongoing project. The purpose of the current research is to develop a tool that uses data taken from a computerized DSR to generate monitoring and control information. We have developed a progress monitoring model, which uses data from a computerized DSR to generate information regarding the actual progress and then transfer it to the scheduling software. The model was developed and implemented in a concept proving prototype using Excel and MS Project. The operation and the usefulness of the prototype are demonstrated with a case study, synthetic, project. The results indicate that the DSR is a useful data collection tool for progress monitoring. The cost of the information generated from these data is low because no additional manual operations are required in order to collect the data. <b>Daily</b> <b>site</b> <b>report,</b> data collection, progress control, project control, site records,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Current {{monitoring}} and control methods rely on massive manual work. As a result, control information is expensive to acquire, or is generated irregularly. Additionally, the information is only available infrequently and its quality and integrity are low. The purpose of the work {{presented in this paper}} is to improve {{monitoring and}} control information, i. e. to offer it on a daily basis, to improve its quality and integrity and to reduce the cost of generating it. To do all this, the Technion APPC researcher group started exploring the use of automated data collection (ADC) technologies. We developed models for automated labor and earthmoving equipment control, as well as models which utilize data from an existing systems – <b>daily</b> <b>site</b> <b>reporting</b> and building programs...|$|R

Because the composer respects the artist and the artist’s feeling 120%, recording was so pleasant. This time I choked and coughed a bit when I was singing, but the composer Automatic treated me so nicely, by telling me that I could rest as much as I want to or have a cup of warm tea and try again, that I didn’t know what to do. It was pleasant to work with them."4 ...|$|R

The MyNoggin website was initially scheduled to launch in early September of that year, but was not {{made available to the}} public until October. The site's content was curriculum-based and intended for children in preschool through first grade. The games on MyNoggin covered major school subjects and included Noggin characters. In addition to activities, MyNoggin included printable workbooks that expanded upon math and science concepts. Parents were able to monitor their children's growth and activity on the <b>site</b> through <b>daily</b> progress <b>reports.</b> The website was free of advertisements and supported by subscriptions, which were available for online purchase and through prepaid game cards sold throughout 2008. Charter, Insight and Cox Communications customers were given unlimited access to MyNoggin as part of their cable subscriptions. The site also offered a week-long free trial.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. This paper describes <b>daily</b> <b>report</b> cards and the evidence relating to their use in schools for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This intervention typically involves teachers evaluating a student's behaviour at school against pre-determined targets and parents subsequently providing reinforcement at home for positive reports. Research suggests that the <b>daily</b> <b>report</b> card has been effective in treating a range of ADHD symptoms and improving school outcomes, including academic achievement in some cases. The <b>daily</b> <b>report</b> card also encourages collaboration between teachers and parents, and evidence suggests that the intervention benefits from the inclusion of reinforcement at home. <b>Daily</b> <b>report</b> cards are easy to implement and research finds that teachers consider them an acceptable intervention for ADHD. This paper also considers challenges in using <b>daily</b> <b>report</b> cards, including barriers to their use over the long-term and the risk of stigma for children with a report card. Ideas to address these issues are suggested...|$|R
