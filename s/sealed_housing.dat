40|$|The unique {{features}} and {{applications of the}} presented electrical permanent magnetic bearing system essentially result from three facts: (1) the only bearing rotor components are nonlaminated ferromagnetic steel collars or cylinders; (2) all radial and axial forces are transmitted via radial gaps; and (3) large radial bearing gaps can be provided with minimum electric power consumption. The large gaps allow for effective encapsulation and shielding of the rotors at elevated or low temperatures, corrosive or ultra clean atmosphere or vacuum or high pressure environment. Two significant applications are described: (1) a magnetically suspended x ray rotary anode was operated under high vacuum conditions at 100 KV anode potential, 600 C temperature at the rotor collars and speed 18000 rpm with 13 mm radial bearing gap; and (2) an improved Czochralski type crystal growth apparatus using the hot wall method for pulling GaAs single crystals of low dislocation density.

40|$|Rim driven {{thrusters}} with structurally integrated brushless PM motors are now {{an established}} technology with an increasing range of applications. In these thrusters, the stator {{of the motor}} is housed within the thruster duct, and the rotor forms a ring around {{the tips of the}} propeller. Such high pole number motors tend to be very thin radialy, have very small length to diameter ratios, and have relatively large airgaps to accommodate corrosion protection layers on the surfaces of the rotor and stator. The relatively large diameter stator laminations of such machines tend therefore to have very thin back of core and narrow teeth, which make them expensive and difficult to manufacture. This paper proposes an alternative potentially lower cost motor topology featuring a slotless stator whose laminations are manufactured from a single strip of steel that is edge wound into a spiral (like a “slinky ” and then fitted over the windings that are preformed on the outside surface of a non-conducting former. The former is also part of the <b>sealed</b> <b>housing</b> that protects the stator from corrosion in seawater.

40|$|Autonomous {{self-powered}} devices may use energy {{harvested from}} the environment. However, both the harvested power, and the demanded power are typically nonconstant and not matching. In order to enable a sustained energy efficient operation, an energy storage device as buffer is needed.

Numerous different battery chemistries are commercially available and differ significantly in their characteristics.

In particular, specific energy and power are typical conflicting objectives for the design of a battery.
