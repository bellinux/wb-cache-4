40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>lock</b> block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is installed, an apertured-end portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R

5000|$|Captained by the 55-year-old James Ferguson, {{the vessel}} left Stranraer's railway loading pier at 07:45 AM with 44 tons of cargo, 128 {{passengers}} and 51 crew.
