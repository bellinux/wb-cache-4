500|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 {{called for}} the {{disarmament}} of militia with the Taif agreement {{at the end of}} the Lebanese civil war. Hezbollah denounced, and protested against, the resolution. The 2006 military conflict with Israel has increased the controversy. Failure to disarm remains a violation of the resolution and agreement as well as subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Since then both Israel and Hezbollah have asserted that the organization has gained in military strength. A Lebanese public opinion poll taken in August 2006 shows that most of the Shia did not believe that Hezbollah should disarm after the 2006 Lebanon war, while the majority of Sunni, Druze and Christians believed that they should. The Lebanese cabinet, under president Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, guidelines state that Hezbollah enjoys the right to [...] "liberate occupied lands."

It was reported by CBS News that a senior Israeli official said that British police told the Israeli embassy in London minutes before the explosions that they had received warnings of possible terror attacks in the UK capital. An AP report used by a number of news sites, including The Guardian, attributed the initial report of a warning to an Israeli [...] "Foreign Ministry official, <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> anonymity", but added Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom's later denial on Israel Defense Forces Radio: [...] "There was no early information about terrorist attacks."

2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} released {{footage of}} a captured RQ-170 on 8 December. The captured drone {{appeared to be}} largely intact, except for minor damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, {{an analyst at the}} Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled out the possibility of an engine or navigational malfunction: [...] "Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought the system down or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system". On 8 December, a senior U.S. official, <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that [...] "We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire." [...] A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained [...] "virtually intact," [...] given the high altitude from which it is thought to have crashed. After examining the video on 8 Dec, US officials confirmed that the drone was genuine, even though some civilians had initially expressed doubt. Bill Sweetman, an author with an interest in military planes, speculated that the Iranians did not shoot down the plane (citing the lack of burn marks, holes, or outward damage) or hack into the system, postulating that a system failure downed the plane, and that the plane could be intact from what is known as a [...] "flat spin" [...] or [...] "falling leaf departure".|$|E
2500|$|On 11 July 2012, Ynetnews {{reported}} that {{on that day}} the Iron Dome system was deployed in the greater Eilat area {{as a part of}} an IDF survey meant to test it in various areas across Israel. The IDF published on its website that the Iron Dome battery will be temporarily stationed there {{as part of an effort}} to test and prepare different sites across the country for the possibility of permanently stationing there additional batteries. [...] "Since the system continues to grow and improve, it is important to test potential sites," [...] said a commander from the Air Defense Formation. [...] "After stationing Iron Dome batteries in numerous regions in southern Israel, including Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and Gush Dan—it is time to test the southernmost region in the country, Eilat." [...] Haaretz {{reported that}} an official, <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> said the interceptors were set up on 9 July. Three weeks beforehand, two Katyhusha rockets were fired into southern Israel, and according to The Jerusalem Post the IDF believes that they originated from the Sinai. According to the report, IDF assessments are that they were either fired by a Palestinian rocket cell from Gaza—affiliated either with Hamas or Islamic Jihad—or by Bedouin freelancers who work for them. The launches followed an earlier one in April 2012, when at least one Katyusha rocket was fired from the Sinai to Eilat. Ynetnews reported that according to a military source, following these rocket attacks, the IDF decided not to take any chances and calibrated the system to the region's topography, before finally deploying it. The system's deployment was coordinated with local communities and the City of Eilat, in order to prevent public panic.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an effort}} to {{exacerbate}} racial tensions in the United States, the Japanese enacted what was titled, [...] "Negro Propaganda Operations." [...] This plan, created by Yasuichi Hikida, the director of Japanese propaganda for Black Americans, consisted of three areas. First was gathering information pertaining to Black Americans and their struggles in America, second {{was the use of}} Black prisoners of war in the propaganda, and third was the use of short-wave radio broadcasts. [...] Through shortwave radio broadcasts, Japanese used their own radio announcers and African American POWs to spread propaganda to the United States. Broadcasts focused on U.S. news stories involving racial tension, such as the Detroit Race riots and lynchings. For example, one broadcast commented, [...] "notorious lynchings are a rare practice even among the most savage specimens of the human race." [...] In {{an effort to}} gain more listeners, POWs would be allowed to address family members back home. The Japanese believed propaganda would be the most effective if they used African American POWs to communicate to African Americans back home. Using programs titled [...] "Conversations about Real Black POW Experiences" [...] and [...] "Humanity Calls", POWs would <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> war, and their treatment in the military. POWs with artistic strengths were used in plays and or songs that were broadcast back home.The success of this propaganda is much debated, as only a small minority of people in America had shortwave radios. [...] Even so, some scholars believe that the Negro Propaganda Operations, [...] "evoked a variety of responses within the Black community and the sum total of these reactions forced America’s government to improve conditions for Blacks in the military and society." [...] Even the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) saw the propaganda as, [...] "...a media tool in the struggle against racial discrimination". [...] Despite these debates both sides agree that these programs were particularly dangerous because of their foundation in truth.|$|R
