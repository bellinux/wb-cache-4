40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{exploratory}} survey {{has been made}} on the magnetic fabric {{of a variety of}} sediments from Legs I-VI of the Deep Sea Drilling Project. Pelagic clays and calcareous and <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossil</b> oozes have generally proved to have no significant magnetic fabric. In the majority of the remaining sediments, primary style fabrics are rare, probably as a result mainly of deformation during drilling. Sufficient undisturbed specimens have been measured, principally from the coarser silts, to indicate that useful fabric information can be obtained from the cores by this method. Measurements from Hole 1 tend to confirm the view that chevron folding in some cores is due to penecontemporaneous mass movement of near-surface material. Results from Holes 26, 35 and 60 indicate that drilling disturbance is comparatively slight. The influence of palaecurrents is seen; their directions might be determined in oriented cores...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that {{the composition of}} seawater varied significantly during the Phanerozoic, and that the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater {{is a major factor}} in synchronized secular oscillations in the mineralogical composition of marine evaporites and nonskeletal as well as biogenic carbonates. However, the nature of the Mg sink is still subject to debate. We describe early diagenetic sepiolite from the Chih-sia Formation (middle Permian) of South China. The Mg incorporated in sepiolite likely was furnished by stabilization of high-Mg calcite, and silica was derived from <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossils.</b> Two factors facilitated the ac-cumulation of sepiolite in the Chihsia Formation. The first is a Chih-sian depositional environment of an intra-oceanic carbonate platform that lacked detrital terrestrial input, which enhanced the availability of biogenic silica for sepiolite formation. The second is the chemical composition of Permian seawater, as the precipitation of high-Mg cal-cite was aided by a high Mg/Ca ratio associated with an aragonite sea...|$|R

40|$|The sea-surface {{distribution}} of four selected fossilizable phytoplankton groups (coccolithophores, diatoms, silicoflagellates and dinoflagellates) {{has been studied}} along a transect from Cape Town (34 °S) to South Sandwich Islands (57 °S) during the late austral summer. The observed {{distribution of}} these groups shows that their biogeographical distribution is significantly constrained by the water masses and associated frontal systems of the Southern Ocean. Coccolithophores are the dominant group and show cell abundances up to 51 × 103 cells/l down to 57 °S. Three restricted areas are marked by particularly high cell densities: the continental shelf of South Africa, the area between the Sub-Tropical Convergence and the Sub-Antarctic Front, and the southern border of the Antarctic Polar Front, where the highest abundances are recorded (> 650 × 103 cells/l). The species composition of the various assemblages representative of the four groups defines distinct biogeographical zones bounded by marked sea-surface temperature gradients. This biogeographical distribution is confirmed by {{factor analysis of the}} coccolithophore (5 factors, 85 % of the total variance) and diatom and silicoflagellate (7 factors, 87. 5 % of the total variance) populations.

40|$|We {{subdivided}} volcaniclastic layers drilled during Leg 157 around Gran Canaria at distances up to 70 km {{from the}} shore of the island at Hole 953 C, 955 A, and 956 B deposited between 14 and ~ 11. 5 Ma into> 100 volcaniclastic units at each site. Most volcaniclastic layers are < 20 cm thick, but complex turbidite units up to 1. 5 m thick make up 10 % to 20 % of all volcaniclastic units in Holes 953 C and 956 B. We distinguish several types of clasts: felsic vitroclasts, (1) bubble-wall/junction shards, (2) brown nonvesicular felsic shards, (3) welded tuff clasts, (4) pumice shards, and (5) sideromelane shards. Mineral phases com-prise anorthoclase and lesser amounts of plagioclase, calcic and sodic amphibole (kaersutite, richterite, and edenite), clinopy-roxene (titanaugite to aegirine), hypersthene, minor enstatite, phlogopite, Fe/Ti oxides, sphene, chevkinite, apatite, and zircon. Xenocrysts are dominantly titanaugite derived from the subaerial and submarine shield basalts. Lithoclasts are mainly tachylitic and crystalline basalt, the latter most common in Hole 953 C, and fragments of felsic lava and ignimbrite. Bioclasts consist of open planktonic foraminifers and nannofossil ooze in the highly vitric layers, while filled planktonic foraminifers, benthic fora-minifers, and a variety of shallow water calcareous and <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossils</b> and littoral skeletal debris are common in the basal coarser grained parts of turbidites. Volcaniclastic sedimentation during the time interval 14 – 9 Ma was governed dominantly by direct and indirect volcanic processes rather than by climate and erosion.

40|$|International audienceIron-rich {{smectite}} {{is commonly}} {{described in the}} diagenetic fraction of deep-sea sediment, as millimeter to centimeter aggregates dispersed in the sediment, or as a coating on sedimentary particles or nodules. This study examines several factors to elucidate formation mechanisms of a particular iron-rich smectite and its potential transformation to glauconite. The study combines a detailed mineralogical investigation on natural samples and a chemical modeling approach to assess mineralogical reactions and pathways. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations and analytical electron microscopy (TEM-AEM) analyses were conducted on microtomed samples of millimeter- to centimeter-long green grains. These grains are widespread in pelagic calcareous sediment from the Costa Rica margin. They are composed of pyrites that are partially dissolved and are surrounded by amorphous or very poorly crystallized iron-rich particles. Iron-rich montmorillonite grows from an amorphous precursor and its formation requires the input of Si, O, Mg, K, Na and Ca; our results suggest that these inputs are supported by the dissolution of sedimentary phases such as volcanic glasses, <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossils</b> and silicates. Thermodynamic modeling of fluid-sediment interactions was conducted with the geochemical computer code PhreeqC, using mineralogical and pore fluid compositions from sediment samples and calculated estimates for thermodynamic constants of smectites that are not maintained by the computer code. Simulations confirm {{the possibility that the}} green grains are the product of pyrite alteration by seawater under oxidizing conditions. The extent of smectite production is controlled by the kinetics of pyrite dissolution and fluid migration. The absence of aluminum in the Costa Rica margin system explains the formation of an iron-rich montmorillonite instead of glauconite, whereas the presence of calcite that buffers the system explains the formation of an iron-rich montmorillonite instead of iron oxides...|$|R
40|$|An {{undisturbed}} 16 m late Pliocene-Pleistocene sediment core spanning 2. 6 Myr of deposition {{was recovered}} from the Manihiki Plateau by the German research vessel Sonne in 1990. This core 34 KL complements the heavily disturbed late Pliocene-Pleistocene core sections of DSDP Site 317, and is well suited for stratigraphic correlation. The sediments consist of calcareous microfossils (93 - 97 % CaCO 3), minor portions of siliceous microfossils and detrital minerals. All important calcareous microfossil zones could be identified and correlated with the magnetostratigraphic and isotope stratigraphic events, stages and periods. Due to {{the high degree of}} silica dissolution, the late Quaternary radiolarian Buccinosphaera invaginata Zone is the only <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossil</b> zone which could be identified. An interval with Globigerinoides gomitulus/pink was found within the middle Pleistocene which is clearly distinguished from the Globigerinoides ruber/pink interval of the late Pleistocene. The magnetostratigraphic Gauss-Matuyama and Matuyama-Brunhes boundaries as well as the Olduvai and Jaramillo events were clearly identified. The d 18 O curve displays the 100 kyr (Milankovitch) and the 41 kyr (Laplace) cyclicity periods. The beginning of the Laplace Period and the last occurrence of the calcareous nannofossil Discoaster brouweri, which marks the end of the Pliocene, fall within the base of the Olduvai Event. There is also a marked drop in sedimentation rates around this time, which seems to be a regional phenomenon. Prominent 3. 5 kHz subbottom reflectors at 8 ms and 15 ms reflection time are related to lithologic changes near the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (MPR) {{and the beginning of the}} Laplace Period or the Pleistocene, respectively. It is possible to trace these reflectors laterally to the eroded eastern edge of the Manihiki Plateau where they can be tied to older strata...|$|R

40|$|Neogene sand layers were {{recovered}} during DSDP Legs 14 and 41 in seven holes at the West African continental margin, between 12 ° and 35 °N. Based on their sedimentary structures, grain sizes, and {{the composition of}} their coarse fractions, three major genetic groups of sand layers are distinguished: contourites, turbidites originating from fluvial deltas, and turbidites formed by eolian dune sands, both in proximal and distal facies. The source environments are characterized by compositional features, which are independent of transport sorting, such as the abundance of feldspar, of stained and frosted quartz, or the composition of reworked faunas. Eolian-sand turbidites are the only layers with noticeable open porosity. They occupy a time-transgressive zone which follows a northward plate-tectonic shift from the Pleistocene to the early Miocene of the area between 14 °- 20 °N by 6 to 7 degrees of latitude. During the Pleistocene, this zone is marked as the synglacial position of Sahara dunes advancing towards the shore line at the shelf edge and generating turbidity currents at the slope. Fluvial-sand turbidites occur further {{to the south and}} north. The turbidites at Sites 370 and 135 are additionally influenced by the rising Atlas Mountains. Turbidites and contourites both appear concentrated in a few stratigraphic horizons: at 23 to 20, ~ 13, and 3 to 2 m. y. B. P. The paleoenvironment of these horizons can be characterized by a low sea level (indicated by the formation of eolian-sand turbidites itself and by abundant erosion of glauconite on emerged shelf plains), by vigorous off-shore Trade Winds (moving dunes towards the shore and forming dust beds on the slope), by strong coastal upwelling (dominance of fish remains and <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossils</b> at the supposed center of Trade Winds influence), by temperate temperatures in coastal waters (skeletal sands of "Foramol " group), and by increased bottom-current activity (contourites). In conclusion, these conditions resemble Pleistocene glacial events and agree well with evidence {{from other parts of the}} oceans.

40|$|The {{origin of}} authigenic {{minerals}} {{on the ocean}} floor has been extensively discussed in the past with emphasis on two major processes; precipitation from solutions originating from submarine eruptions, and slow precipitation from sea water of dissolved elements, originating from weathering of continental rocks. It is concluded that in several marine authigenic mineral systems these processes overlap. A diagnostic principle is suggested, permitting a qualitative or semiquantitative discrimination between marine authigenic minerals crystallized from dissolved species, which have spent a long time in solution on the one hand, and the same minerals generated from solutions, near their source on the other. Extensive data are available for the manganese and iron oxide minerals forming manganese nodules. It is indicated {{on the basis of their}} composition and structure that many of the nodules found in the vicinity of the continents are made up essentially of manganese derived from continental weathering. In contrast to this group, all of the nodules found in the Pacific area of submarine vulcanism display the criteria for rapid precipitation near the source of solution. The distribution of barium minerals over the deep ocean floor is discussed. The same diagnostic principle is suggested for application to these solids, in order to discriminate between baryte and harmotome crystallized near the source of barium- rich, acidic vulcanites, and the same minerals formed from continental solution with passage through the biosphere. In the case of the authigenic aluminosilicates it is found that many of the framework elements (Si and particularly Al) have low passage time through solution, and the major fraction of these elements is consequently removed from solution in the vicinity of the eruptive source materials. Extensive modification of the crystal structures, however, takes place over long periods of time, adding particularly cations from sea water, and probably to some extent silica from <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossils,</b> which on their decay {{on the ocean floor}} appear to contribute to the silicate framework of growing zeolites. The marked fractionation of the rare earth ions between coexisting phases is pointed out, with discussion of the potential use of this phenomenon to indicate the processes of formation. The use of the hafnium/zirconium ratio as a tracer for the igneous source type is suggested, and the application of ideally imperfect tracers to establish the varying relative importance of volcanic versus halmeic source of marine minerals is discussed in general...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of DSDP Leg 94 was to obtain continuous paleoclimatic records along a roughly north-south transect in the North Atlantic. The magnetostratigraphy of 21 holes at 6 sites cored with the hydraulic piston corer and extended-core-barrel corer is presented here and establishes an independent chronology for these sediments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a biostratigraphic analysis of pyritized diatom assemblages in the Saint-Josse core (CC 82) located {{in the northern part of}} the Paris basin (coordinates: X = 555 000, Y = 307 324 and Z = 56. 9 m). During the Paleocene-Eocene this locality was situated in a small bight of the North Sea Basin. The results are obtained from sediments of the Thanet and Mont-Bernon group equivalents belonging to the Paleocene-Eocene interval. Thirteen samples were studied and eleven contain pyritized diatoms. By epigenesis, the siliceous frustule of the diatom is changed into a pyritized skeleton with all the ornamentation very well preserved such as the velum, the areolae, the labiate processes, etc. Dispersive X-Ray analyses show this complete replacement of silica by pyrite. Another form of pyritization is crystallization of pyrite (in cubes, pyritohedrons, octahedrons, framboids) in internal cavities of the diatoms to produce internal moulds, also called steinkerns, which preserve the external morphology of the diatoms and some details such as the girdle. Despite pyritization, diatoms can often be recognized at the species level; brackish and marine species were observed but no fresh water specimens were encountered. Pyrite is easily altered into iron oxides. In outcrops, pyritized diatoms can be obscured or destroyed by oxidation. We have chosen borehole samples for this study to avoid the affects of weathering. Deposits from the Sorrus Unit (of the Thanet Group) have low abundances of pyritized diatoms (3 to 25 specimens per sample). This unit contains allochtonous diatom assemblages comprising Actinoptychus senarius, Coscinodiscus morsionus var. morsianus, and Coscinodiscus morsianus var. moelleri. Sample 34. 31 - 34. 45 from this unit is particularly interesting. It contains three specimens of Paralia siberica var. laevis, which is typical of an estuarine or littoral paleoenvironment, and corresponds to the more continental deposit of the Sorrus Unit. Seven samples, taken in the Argile de Saint-Aubin Unit (from the Mont-Bernon Group), contain more than 200 pyritized diatoms and between 9 to 16 different species per sample. A brackish assemblage (Actinoptychus senarius, Coscinodiscus commutatus and Stellarima microtrias) and a marine assemblage (C. morsianus var. morsianus, Coscinodiscus var. moelleri, Fenestrella antiquo, Odontella heibergii, Rhizosolenia sp. 1 and Trinacria regina) are observed. The brackish assemblage expands in the upper part of the Saint-Aubin Unit indicating more widespread brackish paleoenvironmental conditions. Pyritized diatoms are important fossil markers in the Paris basin mainly when <b>siliceous</b> <b>fossils</b> (silicoflagellates or radiolarians) and others microfossils (foraminifers and dinoflagellates) are very poor or absent. Two diatom assemblages have been identified in the Saint-Josse borehole. The first assemblage D 1, comprising C. morsiallus var. moelleri (high occurrence), C. morsianus (a few) and T. regina (rare), is recorded in the Sorrus, La Calotterie, Bois Gorguette, Le Goulet and lower Saint-Aubin Units. The second assemblage D 2, characterized by great abundance of F. antiqua and decreasing numbers of C. morsianus species, is found in the upper part of the Saint-Aubin Unit. These diatom assemblages can be correlated with other biozonations established in the North Sea basin and based on nannoplankton and diatoms (King, 1983), diatoms (Mitlehner, 1996) and calcareous nannoplankton (Martini, 1971). F antiqua and C. morsianus var. moelleri are the more important diatom species encountered. E ntiqua (previously named Coscinodiscus sp. 1, King, 1983) is the fossil marker used by King to define his NSP 4 biozone. The base of NSP 4 corresponds to the lowest occurrence of F antiqua and the top is marked by the highest occurrence of this species.
