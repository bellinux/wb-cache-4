40|$|Formal {{language}} models which employ <b>shuffling,</b> or interleaving, <b>of</b> strings are {{of interest}} {{in many areas of}} computer science. Notable examples include system verification, plan recognition, and natural language processing. Membership problems for the <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> languages are especially interesting. It is known that deciding membership for <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> regular languages can be done in polynomial time, and that deciding (non-uniform) membership in the <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> two deterministic context-free languages is NP-complete. In this paper we narrow the gap by showing that the non-uniform membership problem for the <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> two deterministic *linear* context-free languages is NP-complete...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a general shuffling operation for finite and infinite words {{which is not}} necessarily fair. This means {{that it may be}} the case that in a <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> two words, from some point onwards, one of these words prevails ad infinitum even though the other word still has letters to contribute. Prefixes and limits <b>of</b> <b>shuffles</b> are investigated, leading to a characterization <b>of</b> general <b>shuffles</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> finite words, a result which does not hold for fair <b>shuffles.</b> Associativity <b>of</b> <b>shuffling</b> is an immediate corollary. ...|$|R
40|$|Multiple Dedekind zeta {{values were}} {{recently}} {{defined by the}} second author. In a separate paper, the second author constructed double shuffle relations in some cases {{as a response to}} questions asked by Richard Hain and Alexander Goncharov. In this paper, we develop the technique for obtaining more shuffle relations and produce many examples <b>of</b> <b>shuffle</b> products over an imaginary quadratic field. We also define the notion <b>of</b> self <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> a (multiple) Dedekind zeta value and use it at many instances. We define a refinement of the multiple Dedekind zeta values. Our key examples are self <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> the Dedekind zeta at 2 and at 3, the <b>shuffle</b> product <b>of</b> the Dedekind zeta of 2 times itself, and the <b>shuffle</b> product <b>of</b> the Dedekind zeta at 2 times the Dedekind zeta at 3. We obtain one unexpected result that the self <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> multiple Dedekind zeta at (1, 2) minus the self <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> the twisted (with a permutation) multiple Dedekind zeta value at (1, 2) is a very simple expression in terms of the refined multiple Dedekind zeta values.

40|$|Using a {{characterization}} of Mutual Complete Dependence copulas, we show that, {{with respect to}} the Sobolev norm, the MCD copulas can be approximated arbitrarily closed by <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> Min. This result is then used to obtain a characterization <b>of</b> generalized <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> copulas introduced by Durante, Sarkoci and Sempi in terms of MCD copulas and the -product discovered by Darsow, Nguyen and Olsen. Since <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> a copula is the copula <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> the two continuous random variables, we define a new norm which is invariant under shuffling. This norm gives rise to a new measure of dependence which shares many properties with the maximal correlation coefficient, the only measure of dependence that satisfies all of Rényi's postulates.

50|$|Exon {{shuffling}} is {{the combination}} of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon shuffling involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> <b>of</b> entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> <b>of</b> exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> <b>of</b> entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> <b>of</b> non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{sequence}} of Smith invariants defined by certain sequences of products of matrices, with entries in a local principal ideal domain, are combinatorially described by tableau-pairs (T, K) where T is a tableau of skew-shape which rectifies to the key-tableau K. It is a fact that the set <b>of</b> all <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> the columns of a key-tableau is a subset of its Knuth class. Here, under the condition that the word of T is a <b>shuffle</b> <b>of</b> the columns of the key-tableau K, we show the converse, that is, every tableau-pair under the aforesaid restrictions has a matrix construction. In the case of a four-letter alphabet, since we are able to give an explicit description of the Knuth class of a key-tableau as a union <b>of</b> the <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> certain subsets of words containing the key-tableau columns, our construction is general. This may be seen as an indication of a general procedure if a subset <b>of</b> <b>shuffling</b> generators <b>of</b> a generic key-tableau Knuth class is provided. At the moment however, this seems to be a very difficult problem...|$|R

40|$|A key H is a {{semi-standard}} tableau of partition shape whose {{evaluation is}} {{a permutation of}} the shape. We give a necessary and sufficient condition that the Knuth class of a key equals the set <b>of</b> <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> its columns. In particular, on a three-letter alphabet the Knuth class of a key equals the set <b>of</b> <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> its columns, and on a four-letter alphabet, the Knuth class of a key is either the set <b>of</b> <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> its columns or the set <b>of</b> <b>shuffles</b> <b>of</b> its distinct columns with a single word taking appropriate multiplicities. For some instances of H this result has been already applied to exhibit a matrix realization, over a local principal ideal domain, {{of a pair of}} tableaux (T, H), where T is a skew-tableau whose word is in the Knuth class of H. Generalized Lascoux–Schützenberger operators, based on nonstandard matching of parentheses, arise in the matrix realization, over local principal ideal domain, of a pair (T, H) on a two-letter alphabet, and they are used to show that, over a t-letter alphabet, the pair (T, H) has a matrix realization only if the word of T is in the Knuth class of H...|$|R

40|$|In mathematics, a {{permutation}} {{is a list}} {{of numbers}} where order of the numbers matters. For many years, the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>shuffling,</b> like a deck of cards, has been studied by many different mathematicians.
