50|$|On 28 January 2012, Stettner {{stepped down}} from the {{parliamentary}} group after the Berlin public prosecutor's office filed charges against him for suspicion of fraud, insolvency protraction, and wrongful withholding of social services.

On 12 March 2016, {{with just a few}} months to go for the next regional election to be held, Besteiro was accused of a further six crimes—new bribery, prevarication and influence peddling crimes, as well as abuse of public administrations, <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> and embezzlement of public funds—which prompted him to announce his declination to be the party's candidate to the Xunta de Galicia in the next regional election the following day. Mounting pressure from his party's colleagues, however, eventually led to Besteiro resigning as party leader on 18 March. Xoaquín Fernández Leiceaga was elected on 28 May through a primary election to be Besteiro's replacement as candidate to the Xunta, while a management committee took charge of the party.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the forms, {{methods and}} causes of fraud that are perpetrated {{to the detriment}} of the budget of the European Union. The forms in which EU fraud appears are shown according to the criterion of kind of budgetary resource. Crime affecting the budgetary revenue of the EU tends to appear in the form of customs duty-evasion and false declarations concerning the customs-relevant information about goods. Crime adversely affecting the expenditure side of the EU budget appears in the form of <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy, and <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> in the area of the structural policies. The methods used for the EU fraud committed and considered in the paper are document forgery, concealment of goods, corruption, violence and fictional business and evasion of the laws. In conclusion an explanation is given of the main exogenous criminogenic factors that lead to the EU frauds commonly perpetrated.

40|$|Crime of fraud, {{credit and}} loan fraud {{pursuant}} to section 209, 210, 211 and 212 of the Criminal Code Criminal code, No. 40 / 2009 Coll., contains the criminal offence of a fraud (Section 209) and it's special {{cases such as}} the insurance (Section 210), loan (Section 211) and <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> (Section 212), in total of four separate offences dealing with fraudulent deliquency. The author of the thesis deals with the characterization of facts of fraud. Property fraud (Section 209) is a damage crime, but the special forms of fraud have features of pre-accomplished crime (preparation of crime). Fraudster's criminal liability for insurance, loan or <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> is rather larger than criminal liability for general type of fraud. Analysis of the judicial decisions of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court of the Czech republic is {{one part of the}} diploma thesis. From the results of the analysis the author concludes that there is a personal criminal liability for fraud when the perpetrator sues for a fake debt. This kind of deceptive activity is an attempt of crime of the fraud. The difference between special type of fraud (insurance, loan or subsidy Sec. 210 - 212 Criminal code) and general fraud (Sec. 209 Criminal code) is evident also in the level of evidence. Culpability of fraud must comprise of the intent to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In 2004, one of {{the biggest}} ferry {{operators}} in Norway was found guilty of having intentionally attempted to defraud the state of about 113 million Norwegian kroner in subsidies by underreporting revenues and overstating costs during the period 1992 - 2002. The company and five of the top managers were convicted and the case was regarded as {{one of the}} most serious subsidy offences ever committed in Norway. The aim of this article is to show that standardized revenue and cost norm models from the state can deter operators from committing such offences and when relevant detecting the fraud attempts at an early stage. Our model suggests that the operator in question overstated costs by about 19 % and that the actual <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> attempt was about three times higher than concluded by the Court...|$|E

40|$|This thesis complexly {{describes}} {{the crimes of}} fraud, insurance fraud, credit fraud and <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> as regulated by sections 209 to 212 of Act No. 40 / 2009 Coll. Penal Code. First {{the historical development of}} these crimes is described, both from the view of legislation and criminology. Further, the sources of the legislative regulation of these crimes are defined. Since fraud belongs in the category of property crimes, these are also discussed collectivelly, with emphasis on the individual common elements of the above-mentioned crimes. The above-mentioned crimes are each individually described with respect to their individual elements including the description of eventual problematic elements of the current legislation. In case of the special elements of these crimes the legislation regarding the respective contractual obligations is described. In addition to the above-described exposition a comparison with the crime of Act detrimental to the financial interests of the European Union is included. In the conclusion the current legislation is evaluated positively {{with the exception of the}} admonition regarding the casuictic legislative regulation of the special merits of these crimes including the question of sustainability of the current legislative state with respect to the technological and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{effective}} Criminal code, No. 40 / 2009 Coll., {{contains the}} criminal offence of a fraud (Section 209) and it's special {{cases such as}} the insurance (Section 210), loan (Section 211) and <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> (Section 212). Nevertheless, the situation hasn't been always like this. Less than twenty years ago the Czech effective legislature contained only the criminal offence of the so called "general" fraud. However the impossibility to persecute all of the fraudulent delinquency by applying the "general" fraud section led the legislator to amend the Criminal Code by adding three above mentioned special sections. The imperfection {{of the legal system}} in regards to the fraudulent behaviour (especially related to banks and insurance companies) in the 1990 's had dramatically effected the economy of the country and formed a negative prejudice and inauspicious experience with privatisation of the state property etc. among the entire society. These days during the global financial recession has the number of fraudulent behaviour risen significantly, since the lack of procurements, the low employment rate, the general indebtedness etc. bring the debtors to the very boarder of the financial cliff of insolvency and "force" them to commit criminal offences. Therefore, it's highly important to use special tools to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As {{the title}} says, this thesis {{is about the}} crime of fraud, insurance, credit and <b>subsidy</b> <b>fraud</b> under section 209 - 212 of the Criminal Code. These four crimes against {{property}} belong to the group of crimes, which cannot be overlooked, because the total number of sentenced frauds is not low at all. We can also notice that these kinds of frauds are often being mentioned in mass media. The aim of this thesis is not to give an exhaustive explanation of frauds, but to provide reader with a comprehensive overview of these crimes. The thesis is systematically divided into eleven chapters. In the first chapter of the thesis reader can find brief characterization of Chapter V. of the special part in Criminal Code, which regulates property crimes. Second chapter acquaints the reader with the development of provisions of different frauds in the previous Penal Code (Act. No. 140 / 1961 Coll.) since 1962. Firstly, there was only a provision of general fraud under section 250 of Penal Code. However due to the different political regime special kind of fraud was also established, which was placed in the provision called theft of socialist property under section 132 of Penal Code (section 132 was repealed in 1990). As the authorities involved in criminal proceedings had problems with sentencing offenders of [...] ...|$|E
