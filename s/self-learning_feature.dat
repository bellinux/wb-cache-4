On the basis of analyzing the image properties, Bayesian classifier and identification method are proposed. Based on the Bayesian decision theory, five kinds of image features such {{as the number of}} light spot, dark spot, edge spot, block and area are applied. Normal distribution is made use to building classifier and studying the correction strategy of model. In the process of identification, dynamical correction and model parameters completion make the classifier have some degree of <b>self-learning</b> <b>feature</b> and higher identification accuracy...|$|E

In this paper, considering the correlation of various factors, the correlation of those factors according to experiment data was analysis and optimized, and a dynamic model of thermal error compensation of CNC machine tool based on Bayesian Network theory was found. Moreover, because of the <b>self-learning</b> <b>feature</b> of Bayesian network, the model can be continuously optimized by updating dynamic coefficient, and reflect the changes of processing condition. Finally, the feasibility and validation of this model were proved through the experiment...|$|E

Real-time monitoring of changes in the product endpoint curve in situ can allow early detection of abnormalities and prevent losses from these abnormalities. This research has focused on discovering a feasible way to replace manual monitoring and the curve determination currently used on production lines. In this study, we take advantage of a unique neural network curve classification feature- the <b>self-learning</b> <b>feature.</b> The Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) was used as the backbone of this study. Etching endpoint curve digital data collected from wafer fab was used as analysis database. This study selected 200 samples from each of the 3 randomly chosen process recipes to train the learning process. This study also used the remaining 100 samples as a comparison to our trained results. The classification results in an accuracy of over 96 %. Therefore, this system can reduce the uncertainty in the process curve classifica-tion and provide in-time and effective suggestions for shutting down machines on the pro-duction line...|$|E
40|$|A coupled map lattice (CML) with <b>self-learning</b> <b>features</b> is {{developed}} to model flow over freely vibrating cables and stationary cylinders at low Reynolds numbers. Coupled map lattices that combine {{a series of}} low-dimensional circle maps with a diffusion model have been used previously to predict qualitative features of these flows. However, the simple nature of these CML models implies {{that there will be}} unmodeled wake features if a detailed, quantitative comparison is made with laboratory or simulated wake flows. Motivated by a desire to develop an improved CML model, we incorporate <b>self-learning</b> <b>features</b> into a new CML that is first trained to precisely estimate wake patterns from a target numerical simulation. A new convective-diffusive map that includes additional wake dynamics {{is developed}}. The new self-learning CML uses an adaptive estimation scheme (multivariable least-squares algorithm). Studies of this approach are conducted using wake patterns from a Navier-Stokes solution (spectral element-based NEKTAR simulation) of freely vibrating cable wakes at Reynolds numbers Re= 100. It is shown that the self-learning model accurately and efficiently estimates the simulated wake patterns. The self-learning scheme is then successfully applied to vortex shedding patterns obtained from experiments on stationary cylinders. This constitutes a first step toward the use of the self-learning CML as a wake model in flow control studies of laboratory wake flows...|$|R

It is in extensive application {{in the field of}} the data classification, knowledge acquisition, process monitoring fault identification and so on. SOM network is used for rotor fault diagnosis. The U matrix map and D matrix is used as visualization tools to simulate and analyses the classification results, and it is com-pared with the general SOM network clustering results.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{framework}} where an initial classifier is learned by incorporating prior information extracted from an existing sentiment lexicon. Preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words are expressed using generalized expectation criteria. Documents classified with high confidence are then used as pseudo-labeled examples for automatical domain-specific feature acquisition. The word-class distributions of such <b>self-learned</b> <b>features</b> are estimated from the pseudo-labeled examples {{and are used}} to train another classifier by constraining the model's predictions on unlabeled instances.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} determining a schedule of capacity expansions for m producing regions and a schedule of shipments from the regions to n markets so as to meet market demands over a T-period planning horizon at minimum discounted capacity expansion and shipment costs. The proposed algorithm permits capacity expansion costs to be arbitrary nonnegative increasing functions of the expansion amounts, but the shipment (and production) costs are restricted to be proportional to the amounts shipped. The algorithm does not require market demands to be increasing over time. The cost functions are allowed to be nonstationary {{and the possibility of}} imports is considered. The proposed heuristic algorithm improves on feasible solutions by simultaneously reassigning several capacity expansions to different regions and/or time periods. A look-ahead feature prevents the algorithm from becoming myopic and a <b>self-learning</b> <b>feature</b> dynamically updates computational parameters. The heuristic algorithm was tested on both randomly generated and real-life based problems with m < 15, and n < 15 and T < 25. The test problems had increasing market demands, capacity expansion costs specified {{in the form of a}} concave power function or a fixed charge plus linear function, stationary costs (aside from a constant discount factor), and no imports. Results indicate that for the class of problems tested, the heuristic algorithm is computationally efficient and provides solutions that are closer to optimum than those obtained by previous algorithms. facilities/equipment planning: capacity expansion, heuristics...|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{traditional}} Logo detection and recognition method is strongly {{dependent on the}} characteristics of artificial selection. The depth learning model proposed by Hinton in 2006 breaks this difficulty. He proposed a depth learning model using multiple hidden layers to learn high-level representations [11] and mentioned that deep neural networks could be used to automatically learn high-level features from large amounts of data. Compared with the characteristics of traditional methods, the deep learning model has richer <b>self-learning</b> <b>features,</b> higher abstraction level, and stronger expressive ability. Common deep learning models include deep learning models based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [12, 13], deep learning models based on autoencoder [14 – 16], and deep learning models based on the convolution neural network (CNN) [17 – 19].|$|R
40|$|Well-designed network {{topology}} provides vital support for routing, data fusion, and target tracking in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). Self-organization feature map (SOFM) neural network is a major branch of artificial neural networks, which has self-organizing and <b>self-learning</b> <b>features.</b> In this paper, we propose a cluster-based topology control algorithm for WSNs, named SOFMHTC, which uses SOFM neural network to form a hierarchical network structure, completes cluster head selection by the competitive learning among nodes, and takes the node residual energy and {{the distance to the}} neighbor nodes into account in the clustering process. In addition, the approach of dynamically adjusting the transmitting power of the cluster head nodes is adopted to optimize the {{network topology}}.

40|$|In {{the domain}} of {{electrical}} power grids, there is a particular interest in time series analysis using artificial intelligence. Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning {{is a set of}} cutting-edge machine learning algorithms that are inspired by how the human brain works. It allows to <b>self-learn</b> <b>feature</b> hierarchies from the data rather than modeling hand-crafted features. It has proven to significantly improve performance in challenging signal processing problems. In this tutorial, we will first provide an introduction to the theoretical foundations of neural networks and Deep Learning. Second, we will demonstrate how to use Deep Learning for load forecasting with TensorFlow, Google’s in-house Deep Learning platform made for Big Data machine learning applications. The advantage of Deep Learning is that the results can easily be applied to other problems, such as detection of nontechnical losses.

40|$|Sentiment {{analysis}} {{concerns about}} automatically identifying sentiment or opinion {{expressed in a}} given piece of text. Most prior work either use prior lexical knowledge defined as sentiment polarity of words or view the task as a text classification problem and rely on labeled corpora to train a sentiment classifier. While lexicon-based approaches do not adapt well to different domains, corpus-based approaches require expensive manual annotation effort. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where an initial classifier is learned by incorporating prior information extracted from an existing sentiment lexicon with preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words being expressed using generalized expectation criteria. Documents classified with high confidence are then used as pseudo-labeled examples for automatical domain-specific feature acquisition. The word-class distributions of such <b>self-learned</b> <b>features</b> are estimated from the pseudo-labeled examples and are used to train another classifier by constraining the model’s predictions on unlabeled instances.

40|$|Deep {{reinforcement}} learning {{is becoming increasingly}} popular for robot control algorithms, with the aim for a robot to <b>self-learn</b> useful <b>feature</b> representations from unstructured sensory input leading to the optimal actuation policy. In addition to sensors mounted on the robot, sensors might also be deployed in the environment, although these might need to be accessed via an unreliable wireless connection. In this paper, we demonstrate deep neural network architectures {{that are able to}} fuse information coming from multiple sensors and are robust to sensor failures at runtime. We evaluate our method on a search and pick task for a robot both in simulation and the real world. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IROS 201...|$|R
30|$|These {{samples are}} not {{associated}} with the subsequent images used for the sky target object classification. In this paper, we respectively collect 1000, 10, 000, and 100, 000 number 8 [*]×[*] 8 size of image blocks {{to carry on the}} feature learning by a completely random way from the database of Abstract 100, Abstract 280, and STL- 10. And in the final classification experiments, we repeat five times random sampling to test sample size’s impact on the overall performance. The regularization coefficient was set to 0.1 in the whitening pretreatment process, and adopted 400 hidden layer units (corresponding to 400 <b>self-learning</b> <b>features)</b> in the SAE model; the training parameters were set to be the same as λ[*]=[*] 3 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 and the number of the training parameters β[*]=[*] 5 and ρ[*]=[*] 0.035. When the training samples were too small, the weights of three databases were ambiguous. With the increase of training samples, the learning effect has increased significantly based on the features of the STL- 10 database; when the training sample reaches to 100, 000, feature weights with a relatively clear edge can be learnt in the STL- 10 database. However, the learning effect on Abstract 100 and Abstract 280 is not significantly improved, which indicates that it is less effective to collect a large amount of data from the small sample for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, {{the lower part of the}} feature weight is more obvious after ascending the weight according to the mAG value. That is to say, mAG value can reflect the edge of the self-learning weight performance; according to its order, the purpose of roughly dividing feature weight marginal strength can be achieved. And according to this order, we can more intuitively observe and compare the effect of learning. In the following experiment, we select the STL- 10 composed of 100, 000 unmarked images covering a wide range of vehicles and animals database to complete the cross-domain unsupervised learning.|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis aims to design and develop a new neuro-fuzzy control system for robotic manipulators using Machine Learning Techniques, Fuzzy Logic Controllers, and Fuzzy Neural Networks. The main idea is to integrate these intelligent techniques to develop an adaptive position controller for robotic manipulators. This will finally lead to utilising one or two coordinated manipulators to perform upper-limb rehabilitation. The main target is to benefit from these intelligent techniques in a systematic way that leads to an efficient control and coordination system. The suggested control system possesses <b>self-learning</b> <b>features</b> {{so that it can}} maintain acceptable performance in the presence of uncertain loads. Simulation and modelling stages were performed using dynamical virtual reality programs to demonstrate the ideas of the control and coordination techniques. The first part of the thesis focuses on the development of neuro-fuzzy models that meet the above requirement of mimicking both kinematics and dynamics behaviour of the manipulator. For this purpose, an initial stage for data collection from the motion of the manipulator along random trajectories was performed. These data were then compacted with the help of inductive learning techniques into two sets of if-then rules that form approximation for both of the inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics of the manipulator. These rules were then used in fuzzy neural networks with differentiation characteristics to achieve online tuning of the network adjustable parameters. The second part of the thesis introduces the proposed adaptive neuro-fuzzy joint-based controller. To achieve this target, a feedback Fuzzy-Proportional-Integral-Derivative incremental controller was developed. This controller was then applied as a joint servo-controller for each robot link in addition to the main neuro-fuzzy feedforward controller used to compensate for the dynamics interactions between robot links. A feedback error learning scheme was applied to tune the feedforward neuro-fuzzy controller online using the error back-propagation algorithm. The third part of the thesis presents a neuro-fuzzy Cartesian internal model control system for robotic manipulators. The neuro-fuzzy inverse kinematics model of the manipulator was used in addition to the joint-based controller proposed and the forward mathematical model of the manipulator in an adaptive internal model controller structure. Feedback-error learning scheme was extended to tune both of the joint-based neuro-fuzzy controller and the neuro-fuzzy internal model controller online. The fourth part of the thesis suggests a simple fuzzy hysteresis coordination scheme for two position-controlled robot manipulators. The coordination scheme is based on maintaining certain kinematic relationships between the two manipulators using reference motion synchronisation without explicitly involving the hybrid position/force control or modifying the existing controller structure for either of the manipulators. The key {{to the success of the}} new method is to ensure that each manipulator is capable of tracking its own desired trajectory using its own position controller, while synchronizing its motion with the other manipulator motion so that the differential position error between the two manipulators is reduced to zero or kept within acceptable limits. A simplified test-bench emulating upper-limb rehabilitation was used to test the proposed coordination technique experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{emerging}} telecom services make use of Outer Edge Networks, in particular Home Area Networks. The configuration and maintenance of such services may not be under full control of the telecom operator which still needs to guarantee the service quality experienced by the consumer. Diagnosing service faults in these scenarios becomes especially difficult since there may be not full visibility between different domains. This paper describes the fault diagnosis solution developed in the MAGNETO project, based on the application of Bayesian Inference {{to deal with the}} uncertainty. It also takes advantage of a distributed framework to deploy diagnosis components in the different domains and network elements involved, spanning both the telecom operator and the Outer Edge networks. In addition, MAGNETO <b>features</b> <b>self-learning</b> capabilities to automatically improve diagnosis knowledge over time and a partition mechanism that allows breaking down the overall diagnosis knowledge into smaller subsets. The MAGNETO solution has been prototyped and adapted to a particular outer edge scenario, and has been further validated on a real testbed. Evaluation of the results shows the potential of our approach to deal with fault management of outer edge networks...|$|R
