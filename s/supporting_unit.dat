25|$|The 119 CACS was {{originally}} activated as 119th Aircraft Warning and Control Squadron in 1950. Since its inception, the 119 ACS had always operated tactical (mobile) radar systems, but was slated {{to lose its}} mission and association with Air Combat Command. This provided a fortuitous opportunity for the unit {{to be associated with}} USSPACECOM as a direct <b>supporting</b> <b>unit.</b> In the mid-1990s, USSPACECOM commander Gen Howard Estes III directed the command to expand the role of guard and reserve forces in operations from two percent to 20 percent.|$|E
25|$|On {{the left}} flank, the 8th RF {{captured}} craters 4, B and C but {{the party that}} attacked to capture The Chord from B to C4 were caught in no man's land by the Germans; only two men reached the objective. Twenty men from a <b>supporting</b> <b>unit</b> joined the two survivors but The Chord had mostly been destroyed in the area, leaving little cover. The British eventually fell back to the crater line, where another twenty men arrived and helped to hold the position and consolidate craters 4, B and C. German counter-attacks were made all through the night but were repulsed and consolidation was begun, despite the loss of contact with the rear and the soft ground. The 170th Tunnelling Company followed up the infantry and began {{to blow up the}} German gallery entrance found in Triangle Crater. The objectives of the attack had been achieved, except {{at the north end of}} The Chord and a later bombing attack up The Chord from the south by the 9th RF, was also repulsed.|$|E
500|$|The 89th Military Police Brigade was {{originally}} activated as a [...] "group", {{roughly the size}} of a modern regiment. The 89th Military Police Group was constituted in the Regular Army on 19 February 1966 and activated on 15 March of that year in the Republic of Vietnam. The mission of the 89th Military Police Group was to provide general military police support for the III Corps and IV Corps Tactical Zones. The group stayed in Vietnam in support of the two corps' areas of operation. As the group was a <b>supporting</b> <b>unit,</b> it never saw front line combat. However, it did receive all 15 campaign streamers that could be earned for Vietnam service. With the removal of US forces from Vietnam, the organization was inactivated on 21 December 1971.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 May 1987, {{at least}} eight members of the brigade {{launched}} another attack on the unmanned Loughgall RUC base. The IRA unit used the same tactics as it had done in The Birches attack. It destroyed {{a substantial part of}} the base with a 200lb bomb and raked the building with gunfire. However, as their attack was underway, the IRA unit was ambushed by a Special Air Service (SAS) unit. The SAS shot dead eight IRA members and a civilian who had accidentally driven into the ambush. This was the IRA's greatest loss of life in a single incident {{since the days of the}} Anglo-Irish War (1919-1922). Six IRA members from a <b>supporting</b> <b>unit</b> managed to escape.
