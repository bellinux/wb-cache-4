40|$|Little {{research}} {{examines the}} reasons adult siblings might provide social support to unmarried, dependent brothers and sisters. This article examines how obligation, reciprocity, {{and the quality}} of personal relationships affect whether siblings provide social support to the <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill.</b> It uses a sample of 108 siblings of 85 participants in a treatment program for the <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill</b> to examine the factors that predict several aspects of help provision. Reciprocity is an important predictor of reported and projected support: The more help respondent siblings receive from ill siblings, the more willingness to help they show in return. The availability of parental and other sibling caregivers is also associated with reported help from siblings. Neither norms of family obligation nor relational quality are highly correlated with support. The results indicate that professionals should take into account the potential importance of siblings as providers of social support to the <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill</b> and encourage their clients to develop reciprocal interactions with their brothers and sisters...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the growing number}} of inmates with a mental illness in correctional facilities in Canada which continues to attract public attention and concern. Several explanations have been put forward to explain the {{rise in the number of}} inmates with a mental illness. These include: the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill that began in the 1970 ’s, lack of treatment availability for those released into the community, and criminalization of persons with a mental illness by the justice system. The increasing numbers of persons with a mental illness in the correctional system has led to serious concerns about the capacity of this system to manage, treat, and rehabilitate individuals with a mental illness. Lack of proper treatment, management, rehabilitation and monitored discharge means that inmates with serious mental illness are more likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system more frequently. 	 This thesis examines the incidence <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill</b> offenders and their propensity to recontact. Three hundred and ninety eight face-to-face assessments were conducted using the Resident Assessment Instrument-Mental Health 2. 0 (RAI-MH) and from total scores from the Level of Service Inventory Ontario Revision (LSI-OR). These assessments were conducted in 14 Ontario Provincial Correctional facilities during the years 2005 - 2008. Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to assess recontact rates for serious mentally disordered and non-mentally disordered offenders. 	 With regards to recontact, no differences were revealed between the <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill</b> offender and non-mentally ill offender. This null finding on recontact is very surprising given the current literature on the <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill.</b> An additional finding revealed that for offenders with or without a serious mental illness, having a higher score on the scale of criminogenic tendencies (LSI-OR) increased rates for recontact. Another surprising finding is that <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill</b> offenders were more likely to commit minor crimes upon release, rather than violent crimes as current literature suggests. A more accurate research tool, as well as a larger sample size, will be required to assess the validity of these results. The implications of the negative outcome with respect to recontact and issues of identifiable risk factors for recidivism for both <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill</b> and non-mentally ill inmate populations are discussed in relation to outcomes in terms of both improvements to Corrections policy and theories of criminology. It is important to continue research in this area, to determine the true gravity of the incidence and recontact rates of mentally ill offenders. ...|$|R
