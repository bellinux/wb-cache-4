40|$|A spark {{detection}} system was constructed at the test station for the 400 MeV Linac Upgrade at Fermilab. To locate sparks in RF Cavities we placed five Ion Gauge Detectors along an accelerating module.

40|$|Abstract The {{production}} of nanoparticles by microsecond spark discharge evaporation in inert gas is studied systematically applying transmission electron microscopy, mobility analysis and BET surface area measurement. The method of spark discharge is of special interest, {{because it is}} con-tinuous, clean, extremely flexible with respect to material, and scale-up is possible. The particle size distributions are narrow and the mean primary particle size can be controlled via the energy per spark. Separated, unagglomerated particles, 3 – 12 nm in size, or agglomerates can be obtained depending on the flow rate. The nanoparticulate mass produced is typically 5 g/kWh. A formula is given, which estimates the mass production rate via thermal conductivity, evaporation enthalpy and the boiling point of the material used. We showed that with gas purified at the spot, the method produced gold particles that were so clean that sintering of agglo-merated particles occurred at room temperature. The influence {{of a number of}} parameters on the primary particle size and mass production rate was studied and qualitatively understood with a model of Lehtinen and Zachariah (J Aerosol Sci 33 : 357 – 368, 2002). Surpris-ingly high charging probabilities for one polarity were obtained. <b>Spark</b> <b>generation</b> is therefore of special interest for producing monodisperse aerosols or par-ticles of uniform size via electrical mobility analysis. Qualitative observations in the present study include the phenomenon of material exchange between the electrodes by the spark, which opens the possibility of producing arbitrary mixtures of materials on a nano-scale.

40|$|AbstractThe diastolic {{membrane}} potential (Vm) can be hyperpolarized or depolarized by various {{factors such as}} hyperkalemia or hypokalemia in the long term, or by delayed afterdepolarizations in the short term. In this study, we investigate how Vm affects Ca sparks and waves. We use a physiologically detailed mathematical model to investigate individual factors that affect Ca <b>spark</b> <b>generation</b> and wave propagation. We focus on the voltage range of − 90 ∼ − 70  mV, which is just below the Vm for sodium channel activation. We find that Vm depolarization promotes Ca wave propagation and hyperpolarization prevents it. This finding is directly validated in voltage clamp experiments with Ca waves using isolated rat ventricular myocytes. Ca transport by the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) is determined by Vm as well as Na and Ca concentrations. Depolarized Vm reduces NCX-mediated efflux, elevating [Ca]i, and thus promoting Ca wave propagation. Moreover, depolarized Vm promotes spontaneous Ca releases that can cause initiation of multiple Ca waves. This indicates that during delayed afterdepolarizations, Ca release units (CRUs) interact with not just the immediately adjacent CRUs via Ca diffusion, but also further CRUs via fast (∼ 0. 1  ms) changes in Vm mediated by the voltage and Ca-sensitive NCX. This may contribute significantly to synchronization of Ca waves among multiple cells in tissue...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectric Discharge Machining (EDM) is a thermo-electric {{non-traditional}} {{machining process}} in which material removal takes place {{through the process of}} controlled <b>spark</b> <b>generation</b> between a pair of electrodes which are submerged in a dielectric medium. Due to the difficulty of EDM, it is very complicated to determine optimal cutting parameters for improving cutting performance. So, optimization of operating parameters is an important action in machining, particularly for unconventional electrical type machining procedures like EDM. A proper selection of machining parameters for the EDM process is heavily on the operator's technologies and experience because of their numerous and diverse range. Machining parameters provided by the machine tool builder cannot meet the operator's requirements. Since for an arbitrary desired machining time for a particular job, they do not provide the optimal conditions. To solve this task, multiple regression model and modified Genetic Algorithm model are developed as efficient approaches to determine the optimal machining parameters in electric discharge machine. In this paper, working current, working voltage, oil pressure, spark gap Pulse On Time and Pulse Off Time on Material Removal Rate (MRR) and Surface Finish (Ra) has been studied. Empirical models for MRR and Ra have been developed by conducting a designed experiment based on the Grey Relational Analysis. Genetic Algorithm (GA) based multi-objective optimization for maximization of MRR and minimization of Ra has been done by using the developed empirical models. Optimization results have been used for identifying the machining conditions. For verification of the empirical models and the optimization results, focused experiments have been conducted in the rough and finish machining regions...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular Ca(2 +) levels control both {{contraction}} {{and relaxation}} in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Ca(2 +) -dependent relaxation is mediated by discretely localized Ca(2 +) release events through ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These local increases in Ca(2 +) concentration, termed sparks, stimulate nearby Ca(2 +) -activated K(+) (BK) channels causing BK currents (spontaneous transient outward currents or STOCs). STOCs are hyperpolarizing currents that oppose vasoconstriction. Several RyR isoforms are coexpressed in VSMCs; however, {{their role in}} Ca(2 +) <b>spark</b> <b>generation</b> is unknown. To provide molecular information on RyR cluster function and assembly, we examined Ca(2 +) sparks and STOCs in RyR 3 -deficient freshly isolated myocytes of resistance-sized cerebral arteries from knockout mice and compared them to Ca(2 +) sparks in cells from wild-type mice. We used RT-PCR to identify RyR 1, RyR 2, and RyR 3 mRNA in cerebral arteries. Ca(2 +) sparks in RyR 3 -deficient cells were similar in peak amplitude (measured as F/F(0)), width at half-maximal amplitude, and duration compared with wild-type cell Ca(2 +) sparks. However, the frequency of STOCs (between - 60 mV and - 20 mV) was significantly higher in RyR 3 -deficient cells than in wild-type cells. Ca(2 +) sparks and STOCs in both RyR 3 -deficient and wild-type cells were inhibited by ryanodine (10 micromol/L), external Ca(2 +) removal, and depletion of SR Ca(2 +) stores by caffeine (1 mmol/L). Isolated, pressurized cerebral arteries of RyR 3 -deficient mice developed reduced myogenic tone.
