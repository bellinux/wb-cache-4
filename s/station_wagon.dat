5|$|Despite {{the arrival}} of serious competitors—namely, the Ford Falcon, Chrysler Valiant, and Japanese cars—in the 1960s, Holden's locally {{produced}} large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Sales were boosted by exporting the Kingswood sedan, <b>station</b> <b>wagon,</b> and utility body styles to Indonesia, Trinidad and Tobago, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa in complete knock down form.|$|E
5|$|Marketed largely {{towards the}} fleet industry, the {{entry-level}} Falcon XT {{sold in the}} most numbers. Featuring the base Barra 182 six-cylinder engine, air conditioning, front power windows, and five-speed manual transmission, with {{the choice of a}} four-speed automatic, the XT was sold in sedan and <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> body types. The Barra 220 V8 engine was available as an option. Judges of the Australia's Best Cars awards crowned the XT Best Family Car in 2002, and again in 2004, with the Futura receiving the award in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Official {{manufacture}} of the sedan began at Holden's Elizabeth, South Australia production facility on 13 July 2006. Three days later, Holden publicly revealed {{the car at}} the Melbourne Convention Centre, broadcast simultaneously via the Internet. The launch occurred alongside that of the flagship WM Statesman/Caprice. Previous to this, Holden announced that VE <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> and utility variants would be postponed and the VZ equivalents would remain in production. Sales of the VE Ute commenced on 22 August 2007. This was shortly followed by the unveiling of a Sportwagon concept, the production version of which was released in July 2008.|$|E

5|$|One {{ordinary}} day, 19-year-old Mercer White (Lou Taylor Pucci) steals a Volvo <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> {{from a car}} wash, {{and leaves}} Eugene, Oregon to find his estranged half-brother Arlen, who is unaware that their mother has recently died. Soon after leaving, a cell phone in the car rings, and Mercer finds himself talking to {{the owner of the}} car, Kate (Zooey Deschanel), who lends him her car on the condition that he calls regularly to describe his trip to her.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{implemented}} a staged roll-out of the VE variants, releasing the sedan first in July 2006. Prior to this, Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores {{until the new}} <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> and utility body styles were launched. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV), were released soon after the sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by the previewing of a Sportwagon concept. The Sportwagon itself was subsequently introduced in July 2008 with the standard Commodore wheelbase instead of the extended wheelbase of previous Commodore wagons.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a <b>station</b> <b>wagon.</b> From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E
5000|$|The 4.3 L V6 engine {{received}} a [...] boost, rated at [...] The 305 cu in engine was unchanged and remained standard on <b>station</b> <b>wagons.</b> <b>Station</b> <b>wagons</b> built after approximately November 1, 1985 came {{equipped with the}} Oldsmobile-built 307 cu in engine. After this point, the 305 cu in was no longer available in <b>station</b> <b>wagons.</b> This engine was used in all GM B-body <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> {{from this point on}} to simplify production. The 307 cu in was equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and was rated at [...] and 255 lbft Nm. The 350 cu in diesel engine was discontinued.|$|R
50|$|Another change {{involved}} the branding of <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> both Ford and Mercury divisions. Split {{away from the}} Monterey model line, Mercury introduced three new <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> as a1separate model line for 1957. The base-trim Mercury Commuter was sold along the mid-price Mercury Voyager in two-door and four-door configurations, with the woodgrained Mercury Colony Park sold only as a four-door. In contrast to Ford (and later Edsel), all Mercury <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> were sold as pillarless hardtops.|$|R
5000|$|Early <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> {{evolved from}} trucks and {{were viewed as}} {{commercial}} vehicles (along with vans and pickup trucks), not consumer automobiles—with the framing of the early <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> left unsheathed because of the commercial nature of the vehicles. This would be reflected on those vehicles registrations--Pennsylvania, for instance, issued special [...] "Suburban" [...] license plates well into the 1960s, long after <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> became car-based. Early <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> were fixed roof vehicles, but lacked the glass that would normally enclose the passenger compartment, and had only bench seats. In lieu of glass, side curtains of canvas could be unrolled. More rigid curtains could be snapped in place to protect passengers from the elements outside.|$|R
5|$|The model jet {{used for}} wide shots of Goldfinger's Lockheed JetStar was painted {{differently}} {{on the right}} side to be used as the presidential plane that crashes at the film's end. Several cars were provided by the Ford Motor Company including a Mustang that Tilly Masterson drives, a Ford Country Squire <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> used to transport Bond from the airport to the stud ranch, a Ford Thunderbird driven by Felix Leiter, and a Lincoln Continental in which Oddjob kills Solo. The Continental had its engine removed before being placed in a car crusher, and the destroyed car had to be partially cut so that the bed of the Ford Falcon Ranchero in which it was deposited could support the weight.|$|E
5|$|Under an {{unsuccessful}} model sharing arrangement {{that was part}} of the Hawke Labor government reforms in 1989, which saw the formation of the United Australian Automobile Industries alliance between Holden and Toyota Australia, the latter began selling badge engineered versions of the VN Commodore manufactured by Holden. The rebadged Commodores were sold as the Toyota Lexcen, named after Ben Lexcen who was the designer of Australia II yacht that won the 1983 America's Cup. The original T1 Lexcen offered sedan and <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> body forms in three levels of trim: base, GL and GLX. Moreover, they were only available with 3.8-litre V6 engine and automatic transmission combination.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at {{the back seat of}} a <b>station</b> <b>wagon.</b> Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E
50|$|Open {{compartments}} {{are those}} found in <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> and SUVs, while closed compartments have a trunk lid and are typically found in saloon (sedan) or coupé bodies. Closed compartments are separated from the passenger compartment by rigid body elements or seats, and are generally trimmed in simple materials, whereas many <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> are trimmed with better looking materials as the space {{is an extension of}} the passenger compartment. In order to hide the compartment content of <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> or hatchbacks from thieves or sunlight, a cover may be fitted. On hatchbacks this often has the form of a rigid parcel shelf or a flexible sheet with hooks on the corners, while <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> and many SUVs have a roller blind in a removable cassette.|$|R

All <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> and other standard models had small hubcaps. Standard coupes, sedans, and wagons were characterized by an absence of beltline trim along with use of rubber gravel guards and painted headlight rims. Deluxes had beltline moldings, chrome gravel guards and bright plated headlight doors. Silver Streak styling was seen again. Silver Streak lettering was placed above front fender spears on Deluxes and high on the fenders of standards. Eights had the number [...] "8" [...] between the two words. Most standard models had gray striped pattern cloth upholstery. Most Deluxes used dark gray broadcloth trims. Wagons were trimmed as before except imitation leather was only used on standard wagons. 1949 was the last year for wood-bodied <b>station</b> <b>wagons,</b> as production shifted to all-metal <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> with woodgrain trim during the model year. Streamliner <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> continued to be the most expensive Pontiac model, ranging in price from $2543 for a standard Six to $2690 for a Deluxe Eight.|$|R
