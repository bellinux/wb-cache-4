5|$|The {{resignation}} in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who {{had been}} elected governor of New Hampshire, left a brief interim opening to be filled by the state legislature. With Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose John Page to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce {{was elected to the}} full term, to commence in March 1837, becoming at age 32 one of the youngest members in Senate history to that point. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> <b>brother</b> were all seriously ill, while Jane continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring a sinecure as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.|$|E
