5|$|German {{astronomer}} Johann Bode {{defined the}} constellation Lochium Funis, the Log and Line—a nautical device once used for measuring speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 <b>star</b> <b>atlas,</b> but the depiction did not survive. In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{stars that}} make up the constellation's {{distinctive}} crown-shaped pattern are all 4th-magnitude stars except for the brightest of them, Alpha Coronae Borealis. The other six stars are Theta, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Iota Coronae Borealis. The German cartographer Johann Bayer gave twenty stars in Corona Borealis Bayer designations from Alpha to Upsilon in his 1603 <b>star</b> <b>atlas</b> Uranometria. Zeta Coronae Borealis was noted to be a double star by later astronomers and its components designated Zeta1 and Zeta2. John Flamsteed did likewise with Nu Coronae Borealis; classed by Bayer as a single star, it was noted to be two close stars by Flamsteed. He named them 20 and 21 Coronae Borealis in his catalogue, alongside the designations Nu1 and Nu2 respectively. Chinese astronomers deemed nine stars to make up the asterism, adding Pi and Rho Coronae Borealis. Within the constellation's borders, there are 37 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E

25|$|Officina Typographica (Latin for {{printing}} office) was a constellation located east of Sirius and Canis Major, north of Puppis, {{and south of}} Monoceros. It was drawn up by Johann Bode and Joseph Jérôme de Lalande in 1798, and included in the former's <b>star</b> <b>atlas</b> Uranographia in 1801, honouring the printing press of Johannes Gutenberg. Lalande reported wanting to honour French and German discoveries {{in the same manner}} that Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille had done for his new constellations. It was called Buchdrucker-Werkstatt by Bode initially, and later Atelier Typographique in the 1825 work Urania's Mirror, Atelier de l’Imprimeur by Preyssinger in 1862 and Antlia Typographiae in 1888.|$|E

500|$|Pleione, {{designated}} 28 Tauri and BU Tauri (abbreviated 28 Tau or BU Tau), is {{a binary}} star and the seventh-brightest {{star in the}} Pleiades star cluster (Messier 45). It is located approximately [...] from the Sun, appearing in the constellation of Taurus. Pleione is located close on the sky to the brighter <b>star</b> <b>Atlas,</b> so is difficult for stargazers to distinguish {{with the naked eye}} despite being a fifth magnitude star.|$|E
500|$|Apus {{is a small}} {{constellation}} in {{the southern}} sky. It represents a bird-of-paradise, and its name means [...] "without feet" [...] in Greek because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by Petrus Plancius in 1598, it was charted on a <b>star</b> <b>atlas</b> by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756.|$|E
500|$|Pavo is a {{constellation}} {{in the southern}} sky with the Latin name for peacock. [...] Pavo first appeared on a 35-cm (14in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's <b>star</b> <b>atlas</b> Uranometria of 1603, and was likely conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756. The constellations Pavo, Grus, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the [...] "Southern Birds".|$|E
5000|$|The cluster was {{probably}} first catalogued by Giovanni Batista Hodierna in 1654, and it subsequently appeared in many <b>star</b> <b>atlases</b> of the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] However, Charles Messier {{did not include}} the Hyades in his 1781 catalog of deep sky objects. It therefore lacks a Messier number, unlike many other, more distant open clusters - e.g., M44 (Praesepe), M45 (Pleiades), and M67.|$|R

2500|$|The {{constellation}} {{appeared in}} later <b>star</b> <b>atlases</b> through the 19th century but was rarely {{used by the}} end of the century; Richard Hinckley Allen noted its most recent use had been in 1878 in Father Angelo Secchi's planisphere, but stated [...] "it is seldom found in the maps of our day.". The stars were later absorbed into northern Puppis, and remained permanently there after the setting of the constellation boundaries in 1928.|$|R
500|$|Tucana is a {{constellation}} of stars in the southern sky, named after the toucan, a South American bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived in the late sixteenth century by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Tucana first appeared on a [...] celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's <b>star</b> <b>atlas</b> Uranometria of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756.

500|$|Johannes Hevelius first {{depicted}} Leo Minor in 1687 when he outlined ten new constellations in his <b>star</b> <b>atlas</b> Firmamentum Sobiescianum, {{and included}} 18 of its {{objects in the}} accompanying Catalogus Stellarum Fixarum. Hevelius decided upon Leo Minor or Leo Junior as a depiction that would align with its beastly neighbours the Lion and the Great Bear. In 1845, English astronomer Francis Baily revised the catalogue of Hevelius's new constellations, and assigned a Greek letter known as Bayer designation to stars brighter than apparent magnitude 4.5. Richard A. Proctor gave the constellation the name Leaena [...] "the Lioness" [...] in 1870, explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names {{to make them more}} manageable on celestial charts.|$|E
500|$|Sirius is the {{brightest}} star in the night sky at apparent magnitude −1.46 and one of the closest stars to Earth at a distance of 8.6 light-years. Its name comes from the Greek word for [...] "scorching" [...] or [...] "searing". Sirius is also a binary star; its companion Sirius B is a white dwarf with a magnitude of 8.4—10,000 times fainter than Sirius A to observers on Earth. The two orbit each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the basis for the ancient Egyptian calendar. The star marked the Great Dog's mouth on Bayer's <b>star</b> <b>atlas.</b>|$|E
50|$|The De Astronomica was not {{formally}} published until 1482, by Erhard Ratdolt in Venice, Italy.

It {{is one of the}} 48 listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and among the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is located near several other constellations named after ancient Greek legends surrounding Perseus, including Andromeda to the west and Cassiopeia to the north. Perseus is also bordered by Aries and Taurus to the south, Auriga to the east, Camelopardalis to the north, and Triangulum to the west. Some <b>star</b> <b>atlases</b> during the early 19th century also depicted Perseus holding onto the head of the Medusa, whose asterism was named together as Perseus et Caput Medusae, however, this never came into popular usage.|$|R
50|$|Columba {{was created}} by Dutch {{astronomer}} Petrus Plancius in 1592 in order to differentiate the 'unformed stars' of the large constellation Canis Major.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{observers}} with point patterns based on 30 major star constellations {{and ask them}} to connect the points to show the structure they perceive.
