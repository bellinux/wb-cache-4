50|$|Born in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1948, Gekoff {{has worked}} {{extensively}} in the film industry since 1971. He has a Master's degree in cinematography from the National Academy of Arts. Before emigrating to Canada, Gekoff worked as a camera operator using a self-designed camera <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mount,</b> much like a Steadicam, on Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker that allowed for the film's acclaimed smooth shots over uneven surfaces. He has taught cinematography at Concordia University in Montreal, and at the Department of Media Production and Studies, University of Regina. In 2005, Gekoff became part of a research team of consultants for Kodak film company, and has collaborated {{on a number of}} projects, preparing the industry for the transition to digital.|$|E
50|$|Some types, {{such as the}} Northrop Flying Wing (NX-216H), {{still have}} a tail <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounted</b> on tail booms, {{although}} they lack a fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} <b>stabilizer</b> is <b>mounted</b> exactly vertically, and {{the horizontal}} <b>stabilizer</b> is directly <b>mounted</b> to the empennage (the rear fuselage). This {{is the most}} common vertical stabilizer configuration.|$|R
50|$|A T-tail has the {{horizontal}} <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the top}} of the vertical stabilizer. It is commonly seen on rear-engine aircraft, such as the Bombardier CRJ200, the Fokker 70, the Boeing 727, the Vickers VC10 and Douglas DC-9, and most high-performance gliders.|$|R
50|$|Steadicam is a {{brand of}} camera <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounts</b> for motion picture cameras invented by Garrett Brown and {{introduced}} in 1975 by Cinema Products Corporation. It mechanically isolates the operator's movement, allowing for a smooth shot, even when the camera moves over an irregular surface.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stabilizers</b> are <b>mounted</b> {{at various}} points on the bow. Common with {{competitive}} archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple <b>stabilizers</b> to be <b>mounted</b> at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.|$|R
50|$|The {{experimental}} Nelson Bumblebee was a strut-braced, high wing, Bowlus Baby Albatross glider design {{which was}} altered by widening {{the cockpit and}} adding a plexiglass bubble to improve visibility. The Nelson Dragonfly version added vertical <b>stabilizers</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the ends of}} the horizontal stabilizer. The motorglider had side-by-side seating with flight controls for each occupant.|$|R
25|$|The La-15 had a barrel-like fuselage, shoulder-mounted swept wings with 6 degrees anhedral, and <b>stabilizers</b> <b>mounted</b> {{high on the}} fin, {{almost a}} T-tail. It was popular with pilots because of its easy {{handling}} and reliability, and its pressurized cockpit was an advantage at high altitude. Nevertheless, official enthusiasm for the La-15 was mild, largely {{because it was a}} complex design that required complicated and expensive production tooling. Only 235 La-15s were built, serving with the Soviet Air Force until 1953.|$|R
25|$|Like the M-130, the M-156/PS-30 was a four-engined, high-wing {{design with}} the wing mounted atop a pylon {{extension}} of the fuselage (hull). While the M-156/PS-30 retained the same length as its predecessor, its wingspan was {{increased by more than}} 27ft (8.2m) with the addition of flaps for increased control. The M-156/PS-30 also differed from the M-130 by having a horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounted</b> atop a pylon {{at the rear of the}} hull, with twin vertical stabilizers and twin rudders located atop the horizontal stabilizer.|$|R
50|$|Developed in {{the early}} 1950s, the basic {{airframe}} is characterized by 35-degree aft swept wings and tail, four underwing-mounted engine pods, a horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage {{near the bottom of}} the vertical stabilizer with positive dihedral on the two horizontal planes and a hi-frequency radio antenna which protrudes forward from the top of the vertical fin or stabilizer. These basic features make it strongly resemble the commercial Boeing 707 and 720 aircraft, although it is actually a different aircraft.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{installation of the}} new PHALANX Surface Mode (PSUM) upgrade will enable the PHALANX to handle {{a wider range of}} threats, such as a small boat approaching the ship. The objective of the research described in this thesis was to measure the vibration of a prototype forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera stabilizer system during live-fire tests to evaluate its performance. Uniaxial, triaxial, and angular accelerometers were mounted at 19 different locations on the stabilizer and on the camera. Acceleration data were collected during eight live fire tests conducted at a Navy range, and the results analyzed. The power spectral densities (PSD) of the input linear accelerations at the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounting</b> points and the resulting linear accelerations at key locations on the stabilizer were calculated. The azimuth and elevation angular displacements of the FLIR camera mount were also calculated. The azimuth and elevation angular displacement of the plane of the <b>stabilizer</b> pedestal <b>mounting</b> points were also calculated. Recommendations are made for follow-on studies.

50|$|The short {{fuselage}} {{carried a}} piston engine in the rear, driving {{a pair of}} contra-rotating propellers in a pusher configuration. The wings were swept back at an angle of 20 degrees, with a horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the propeller on twin booms running back from the wings. The fuselage was unusually streamlined, being round and barrel-shaped, with the forward-located pilot's cockpit fully faired-in to its lines and the nose ending in a round air intake which was ducted back internally to the engine. The undercarriage was a tricycle arrangement, with the main wheels retracting into the tailbooms. Propulsion was to be provided by the experimental Continental XIV-1430-3 inverted V-12 engine.|$|R
50|$|The Ta 400 had a shoulder-mounted wing with 4° dihedral, {{with a long}} {{straight}} {{center section}} extending to the middle engine on each wing, and highly tapered outer wing panels. It had twin vertical <b>stabilizers</b> <b>mounted</b> at {{the tips of the}} tailplane. Like the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the Ta 400 was to have a pressurized crew compartment and tail turret, connected by pressurized tunnel, as well as multiple remote-controlled turrets. The crew of nine was to be protected by a heavy defensive armament, including ten 20 mm MG 151 cannons. Fuel supply was to have distributed across 32 fuel tanks. Another design feature was tricycle landing gear.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of conventional}} post-World War II design, with a low-mounted delta wing, tricycle undercarriage, {{and a single}} turbojet engine in the rear fuselage, with two air intakes on the fuselage sides. The tail is of cruciform design, with the horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounted</b> above the fuselage. Armament consisted of two 20 mm (.79 in caliber) Colt Mk 12 cannons, one in each wing root, with 100 rounds per gun (the A-4M Skyhawk II and types based on the A-4M have 200 rounds per gun), plus a large variety of bombs, rockets, and missiles carried on a hardpoint under the fuselage centerline and hardpoints under each wing (originally one per wing, later two).|$|R
5000|$|II-250 series UAV is {{a family}} of jet powered UAVs that {{resemble}} cruise missiles, which {{they are designed to}} simulate. II-250 series UAVs have a cylindrical fuselage with inverted v-tail and a pair of swept wing of high wing configuration mounted in the midsection. A pair of swept tailplanes are mounted in high wing configuration at the empennage and there is also a small swept vertical <b>stabilizer</b> <b>mounted</b> perpendicularly to the tailplanes. Instead of being turbojet powered like the II-150 series UAV, II-250 series UAVs utilizes rocket motor instead. Like II-150 series, there are also three models of II-250 series UAV, with the basic II-150 for PLAGF, II-250K for PLAAF, and II-250H for PLAN. Specification: ...|$|R
2500|$|The second prototype, SM-2/2 {{introduced}} horizontal <b>stabilizers</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the upper}} rear fuselage and guns with shorter barrels. However the AM-5F engine was still not considered powerful enough, and both prototypes received yet more powerful [...] (dry - wet) Mikulin AM-5B engines. Production versions of the AM-5 (Tumansky RD-9) were re-designated RD-9B and the SM-2B was re-designated SM-9/1 when these engines were fitted, effectively becoming the prototype of the MiG-19 series, flying {{for the first time}} on 5 January 1954, piloted by G. A. Sedov, making a total of 132 flights. Final changes included a modified air intake, new [...] Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 guns with 340 rpg, RSIU-3M [...] "Klen" [...] radio, [...] "Uzel-1" [...] transponder, and SRDM-1M [...] "Konus" [...] radio-rangefinder.|$|R
50|$|The {{tail plane}} {{featured}} two large oval vertical <b>stabilizers</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the ends}} of a rectangular horizontal stabilizer. As early as 1942, it was recognized that the Liberator's handling and stability could be improved by the use of a single vertical fin. The single fin was tested by Ford on the single B-24ST and an experimental XB-24K, and was found to improve handling. All Liberators were produced with twin oval fins, with the exception of eight preproduction B-24N aircraft. The B-24N was intended as a major production variant featuring a single tail. Over 5000 orders for this version were placed in 1945, but were cancelled due {{to the end of the}} war. The single fin did appear in production on the PB4Y Privateer derivative.|$|R

25|$|A {{design feature}} of the {{aircraft}} {{was the use of}} a straight duct air intake design for the vertical <b>stabilizer</b> (tail) <b>mounted</b> engine, similar in engineering design concept to a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, rather than the s-duct arrangement of most trijet aircraft designs such as the Dassault Falcon 900.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} had an oval cross-section and {{was made}} of welded steel tubes, covered with fabric. The double wings provided very high lift, even at low speeds. Both wings had the same span and an 8° sweep. Construction consisted of a double pine wing spar structure, with lime tree ribs, and fabric covering. There were ailerons in both {{the upper and lower}} wings. The tail had a conventional design, with the horizontal <b>stabilizers</b> <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage upper edge. The rudder was placed behind the elevators. Both the rudder and the elevators were of steel tube covered in fabric, and had a bigger surface than the first version to correct balance problems. The steel tube undercarriage was attached to the fuselage in a [...] "V" [...] shape and used high-pressure rubber suspension.|$|R

25|$|The N-24, {{designed}} by Jack Northrop, was a slim-bodied swept-wing aircraft with a two-man pressurized cockpit and conventional landing gear. To reduce drag, the two Allison J35 turbojet engines {{were buried in}} the lower fuselage, directly behind their air intakes, and they exhausted underneath the rear fuselage. The horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> was <b>mounted</b> just above the junction of the vertical stabilizer with the fuselage and had some dihedral.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: High {{pressure}} descaling nozzles {{are used}} mainly for removing oxides from hot steel products. The homogeneity {{and intensity of}} water pressure distribution on the oxidised surface are very important characteristics for a description of nozzle characteristics. The higher the water impact is the more scales are removed and the surface is cleaner. The results of water impact depend {{not only on the}} used nozzle but also on the used water stabilizer and geometry of water chamber in which the nozzle with the <b>stabilizer</b> is <b>mounted.</b> To analyse the real water pressure distribution a special measuring device was used that enables us to scan pressure distribution of the spraying nozzle. Two different nozzles were used, each with a different construction of a stabilizer. The nozzles with the <b>stabilizers</b> were <b>mounted</b> in the water chambers with different geometries. It was confirmed that water chamber geometry has a slight effect on water pressure distribution. It was also found that for some geometry of the stabilizer the water chamber geometry has a bigger effect and for some smaller. The measured values are also compared with numerical simulations in the water chamber and the stabilizer. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The S.19 was a single-seat biplane {{flying boat}} with its engine mounted on struts above its hull and below its upper wing.

2500|$|In early 1957, studies {{began on}} how the Arrow Mk.2 might be {{developed}} into a [...] "Long Range Arrow" [...] {{to meet the requirements}} for the USAF's Long Range Interceptor Experimental (LRIX) program. This was thought to be suitable as under the terms of various agreements, statements, and promises to Allied and in particular Commonwealth nations, the U.S. would buy weapons from an ally if they were the best available and the Arrow seemed to fit this description. Shortly in advance of the USAF visiting Avro in 1955 to review the Arrow's development, a contract was granted to North American Aviation for design studies for the LRIX, designated the North American XF-108 Rapier. [...] Performance requirements were for a range of 1,000 miles, Mach 3, and combat altitude of 60,000 feet. In September 1957, Avro's Project Studies PS-1 and PS-2 were released. PS-1 included addition of wingtip-mounted ramjets to supplement the main engines and a canard mounted above and behind the cockpit. PS-2 included wing extensions, an extended nose with retractable canard, two additional vertical <b>stabilizers</b> <b>mounted</b> on the wings, and four large ramjets. Estimated performance included sustained speeds of Mach 3 at 95,000 feet and vertical climb rate above 40,000 feet of Mach 2.5. The thrust-to-weight ratio would have been double the F-108 and over double the SR-71.|$|R
2500|$|Sometimes, {{mechanical}} {{methods are}} used to improve the stability of systems. For example, ship <b>stabilizers</b> are fins <b>mounted</b> beneath the waterline and emerging laterally. [...] In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which {{have the capacity to}} change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.|$|R
5000|$|The S.21 was a single-seat {{inverted}} sesquiplane (its {{upper wing}} being of shorter span that its lower wing) flying boat, with its engine mounted on struts above its hull and below its upper wing.

50|$|Wind Cloud (Feng-Yun or Fengyun, 风云) UAV is a VTOL UAV {{developed}} by NUAA, {{and it made}} its public debut at the AVIC Cup UAV Innovation Competition held in Beijing in September 2009. Wind Cloud is a tail-sitter, but unlike most propeller driven tail-sitter where the engine is mounted in the nose, Wind Cloud is similar to SNECMA Coléoptère in that the ducted fan of Wind Cloud is mounted at the rear section of the fuselage. However, Wind Cloud differs from SNECMA Coléoptère in that the {{it does not have}} closed wing, but instead, a pair of conventional wings. The vertical <b>stabilizer</b> is <b>mounted</b> after the ducted fan. Wind Cloud is mainly intended for research on tail-sitter aircraft technology.|$|R
50|$|The P-16 was {{designed}} to be especially well-suited to the close-support role, and short-field performance was also emphasized. The resulting aircraft was a single-seat, single-engine design with intakes on the fuselage sides and a low wing. The horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> was <b>mounted</b> halfway up the fin. To ensure good performance from unprepared fields, heavy undercarriage and dual wheels and tires were fitted. The straight, low aspect ratio wing was of multi-spar construction with various high-lift devices including full-span Krueger flaps on the leading edge, large Fowler-type flaps on the inboard trailing edge, and ailerons which also operated as flaps. These devices allowed the aircraft to take off and land within 1,000 ft (330 m) at high altitude, allowing it to operate from the Alpine valleys characteristic of Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|On aircraft, {{vertical}} stabilizers generally point upwards. These {{are also}} known as the vertical tail, and are part of an aircraft's empennage. This upright mounting position has two major benefits: The drag of the stabilizer increases at speed, which creates a nose-up moment that help to slow down the aircraft that prevent dangerous overspeed, and when the aircraft banks the stabilizer produces lift which counters the banking moment and keeps the aircraft upright at the absence of control input. If the vertical <b>stabilizer</b> was <b>mounted</b> on the underside, it would produce a positive feedback whenever the aircraft dove or banked, which is inherently unstable. The trailing end of the stabilizer is typically movable, and called the rudder; this allows the aircraft pilot to control yaw.|$|R
25|$|Built {{mostly from}} aluminum, the XV-1 {{fuselage}} {{consisted of a}} streamlined tube mounted on skid landing gear, with a rear-mounted engine and a pusher propeller. It also had tapered stub wings mounted high on the fuselage. In turn, twin tailbooms and twin vertical surfaces, interconnected by a horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> elevator, were <b>mounted</b> to the wings. A three-bladed main rotor powered by blade tip pressure jets was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, above the wing roots.|$|R
