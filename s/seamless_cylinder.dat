Finally, the Ni 95 Ti 5 catalyzed multi wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are grown on silicon substrate using low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method and the electrical transport properties of this MWNTs film are studied over a temperature range (284 – 4 K) to explain the conduction mechanism.

40|$|Single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) are remarkable molecules {{composed of}} a graphite sheet rolled into a <b>seamless</b> <b>cylinder.</b> With nanometer diameter, and micrometer length, their physical properties are due to a mixture of quantum and classical effects. This work investigates the electrical transport properties of these molecules, and demonstrates their application as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) tips. SWNTs were grown by catalysed chemical vapour deposition (cCVD), and characterized using AFM, electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Electronic devices were fabricated from SWNTs grown by cCVD on Si 02. Electronic transport through the SWNT devices was studied using electric force microscopy (EFM) and scanned gate microscopy (SGM). SGM was used to {{study the effects of}} defects on transport through the devices. A novel form of SGM, based on the modulation of the tip-gating potential by the oscillating tip in dynamic mode AFM, was demonstrated and shown to massively enhance the signal to noise ratio. Using EFM we directly demonstrated the transition from ballistic transport in metallic SWNT at low source-drain voltages, to diffusive transport at high-source drain voltages. EFM was also used to image the charge injection induced around a SWNT at high gate voltages, and correlate it with the observed hysteresis in the transconductance of SWNT devices. Both of these results are of fundamental importance to the future applications of SWNT electronic devices. The high bias behaviour of metallic SWNT is crucial to their proposed use as interconnects in nanoscale devices. Hysteresis in the transconductance of semiconducting SWNT devices is limiting their application as chemical and biological sensors, where environmental effects are monitored by the change in conductance of the devices. SWNTs were mounted at the apex of AFM tips, and used as high resolution scanning probe tips. Electrical transport through the SWNT-AFM tips was investigated using both liquid (Hg) and solid contacts. An efficient technique for fabricating nanowire AFM tips, using SWNT-AFM tips as templates, was also invented. The resultant nanowire tips were shown to be robust, high aspect ratio, electrical probes. Using calibration samples fabricated from SWNTs, SWNT-AFM tips were quantitatively demonstrated to increase the resolution of EFM.

However, their extended structure and repetitive block co-polymer character of HRGPs may mediate their self-assembly as wall scaffolds by like-with-like alignment of their hydrophobic peptide and hydrophilic glycopeptide modules. Intermolecular crosslinking further stabilizes the scaffold. Thus the design of HRGP-based scaffolds may have practical applications in bionanotechnology and medicine. As a first step, we have used single-molecule or single-aggregate atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize the structure of YK 20, an amphiphilic HRGP comprised entirely of 20 tandem repeats of: Ser-Hyp 4 -Ser-Hyp-Ser-Hyp 4 -Tyr-Tyr-Tyr-Lys. YK 20 formed tightly aggregated coils at low ionic strength, but networks of entangled chains with a porosity of ~ 0.5 – 3 μm at higher ionic strength.

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) {{can be considered as}} <b>seamless</b> <b>cylinders</b> rolled up from graphene sheets. These unique all-carbon structures have extraordinary aromatic and hydrophobic properties and form aggregated bundles due to strong inter-tube van der Waals interactions.

This may allow YK 20 to form extended structures that could potentially be used as scaffolds for site-directed assembly of nanomaterials.|$|R

SWNTs are <b>seamless</b> <b>cylinder</b> graphite sheets. They have a diameter of 2  nm and a length of several micrometres, while MWNTs consist of multiple layers of graphene rolled in on themselves and separated from one another by 0.34  nm. Their diameter varied between 2 and 20  nm. A growing number of researchers worldwide have shown {{an interest in the}} combination of CNT with PANI. Recently, review articles have been published on the progress in the different synthesis methods of CNT/PANI nanocomposites. The identifications methods, the properties of the final product, and the progress towards technological applications have been investigated [72, 73]. CNT/PANI composites can be synthesized by electrochemical or chemical processing. CNT functionality is the key to improve dispersion of the nanotubes in the liquid (aniline, solvent) and consequently in the CNT/PANI composite. It also helps to direct formation of PANI chains at the surface of CNT instead of bulk PANI. Due to their easy synthesis, processability and possibility to combine the properties of CNT and the properties of PANI with synergic effects, CNT/PANI composites present great interest for various applications as chemical sensors, capacitors, fuel cells, and electronic devices. Recently, MWCNT-conducting polymer nanocomposites for gas-sensing applications were investigated. Mangu et al. demonstrated that the use of conducting polymers like polyaniline (PANI) and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene)–polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) enhances the gas-sensing capabilities. The MWCNT–PANI composite sensor synthesized was observed to show superior sensitivities and excellent reversibility to 100  ppm of NO 2 gas [62]. Later, Sharma et al. studied the thermal properties of the MWCNT-conducting polymer composite. They utilized MWCNT with PEDOT:PSS and PANI to develop high-temperature tolerant ammonia gas sensor. MWCNT–PEDOT:PSS composite was found to show better thermal stability than MWCNT–PANI composite. The MWCNT–PEDOT:PSS composite sensor was found to exhibit excellent response for trace level sensing (1 – 50  ppm) of ammonia gas than MWCNT–PANI composite [74]. Pure carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were also used to prepare PEDOT conducting polymer nanocomposite. Electrochemical polymerization of PEDOT/CNT nanocomposite was performed in EDOT aqueous solution containing only CNTs as the dopant. The solution was stirred and ultrasonicated for 10  min before polymerization at 1.2  V for 30  s. Due to the excellent stability of the PEDOT/CNT nanocomposite and its catalytic property towards dopamine (DA), a highly stable and sensitive DA sensor was developed that performs favorably {{in the presence of a}} high concentration of the common interferant ascorbic acid [66].|$|E
30|$|Nanotechnology as an {{emerging}} technology {{may be a}} reasonable choice and an effective strategy for solving the above problem. According to the report from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in USA, nanotechnology seeks to exploit distinct technological advances towards cancer prevention and treatment [12]. Electrospinning is a versatile technique to fabricate two-dimensional nanofibers. Electrospun nanofibers have recently received significant attentions in biomedical applications because they possess large surface area-to-volume ratio, high interfiber porosity with tunable pore size, low hindrance for mass transfer, flexible handling, adjustable morphology, and well mechanical strength, which would make nanofibers use as therapeutic patch for drug delivery [13, 14]. The controlled drug release from drug-loaded nanofibrous mat at a rate according to the need could be realized by properly designed architecture, porosity, fiber diameter, drug incorporation manner, and composition of nanofibers [15]. In addition, the medicated nanofibrous products can be easily set to the targeted site by adjusting their morphology [15]. Thus, the drug-loaded nanofibers can be targeted delivery to the desired target tissues with controlled release where drug is released {{in a certain way}} for preventing local tumor recurrence after surgery. Aliphatic biodegradable polyester, such as poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), is widely used to form electrospun nanofibers in various clinic and xsimplebiomedical research applications because it has excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability [10, 16]. However, the simple introduction of drug into polymer matrix always leads to inevitable burst drug release, since the drug molecules might migrate on or near the fiber surfaces because of the high ionic strength in drug/polymer solution and the rapid evaporation of the solvent during electrospinning. To address this limitation, it is highly desirable to develop efficient nanocarrier-mediated nanofibrous delivery systems which may serve as barrier for improving the safety of anticancer drugs and avoid drug premature burst release under physiological conditions [7, 17 – 21]. In fact, several nanoscale carriers such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles [22], hydroxyapatite [10], and liposome [23] have recently been incorporated into electrospun nanofibers for potential anticancer therapy, from which the prolonged drug release with tunable drug release kinetics could be achieved. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are rolled-up <b>seamless</b> <b>cylinder</b> of graphene sheets, have gained extensive attention in the past decade [24]. CNTs are classified as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), which depend on the number of graphene layer which a single nanotubes is composed [24]. In recent years, efforts have also been devoted to explore the potential biomedical application of CNTs. Benefitting from their superior heir distinct properties, especially, the biocompatibility in the physiological condition, CNTs {{have been one of the}} most promising inorganic nano-sized vectors for anticancer drugs, proteins, genetic therapeutics, and biological imaging agent delivery [8, 24, 25]. Up to now, the development of CNTs-doped PLGA nanofibers for cancer therapy has not been reported to the best of our knowledge. The objective of this work, therefore, was to examine the hypothesis of preparing a sustained anticancer drug release system by doping drug-loaded CNTs into PLGA nanofibers.|$|E

The individual SWNTs are joined each other and assembled into bundles by Van der Waals forces. Guest molecules can potentially interact with SWNTs via the outer surfaces of bundles, the inside of the tubes and /or the interstitial channels between the tubes in a bundle. These different situations are expected {{to play an important role}} in tuning the guest molecule/SWNT interaction during gas adsorption and/or desorption, and have been investigated theoretically and experimentally using different approaches. In particular, the interaction between gaseous molecules and SWNTs has been investigated from different point of view, including gas storage and gas detection through modification of electronic and thermal properties or through modification of the field emission properties. Compared with conventional solid-state sensors, that typically operate at temperatures over 200 °C, and conducting polymers-based sensors, that provide only limited sensitivity, sensing devices assembled with single-wall nanotubes can exhibit high sensitivity and fast response time at room temperature. Due to the high surface area of nanotubes, a little amount of nanotube material can provide many sites for gas interaction. The accessibility of these sites depends on the status of aggregation of the nanotubes. Our preliminary studies suggested that the sensitivity of a nanotube-based device can be optimized controlling the organization of the SWNTs. Ordered bundles of SWNTs exhibit indeed a sensitivity double with respect to that of a disordered deposit. This is likely due to the enhancement of surface area for organized SWNT systems with respect to randomly placed SWNT bundles. Hence, aligned nanotubes can serve as a very efficient material for use in gas detection. Directionality of SWNT can be obtained directly during the synthesis process, or after manipulation of dispersed nanotubes, by mean of several methods, such as filtration/deposition from suspension in strong magnetic fields, field emission, electrophoresis or dielectrophoretical processes. In particular the use of electric fields to move, position and align SWNTs has been reported in recent papers and the results indicate that both the electrophoresis (EP) and dielectrophoresis (DEP) routes have potential advantages for arranging nanotubes in controlled systems. Beyond the sensitivity, another severe constraint for gas detection is the time either for the reset of the sensor after exposure to the gas, either for the acceleration of the response itself. Since practical applications can be severely limited by slow absorption/desorption processes, we felt it worthwhile to investigate in a systematic way some physical parameters affecting the sensor response. In this thesis we present a study of NH 3,NOx and H 2 detection using organized SWNTs as sensing material and an innovative procedure to improve the time response of the sensor by applying a back gate voltage. Moreover study on gas detection and gas storage were done using QCM sensor...|$|E
30|$|Since their {{discovery}} {{in the early}} 1990 s, carbon nanotubes have commanded significant attention in terms of growth, characterization of their interesting properties and application development [1]. The CNTs are <b>seamless</b> <b>cylinders</b> arising from the roll-up of graphene sheets. In the case of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), a chiral vector (n, m) defines their intrinsic properties. When (n-m)/ 3 is an integer, the resulting structure is metallic; otherwise, it is semiconducting. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are concentric cylinders with a hollow core, resembling rolled-up graphite sheets. Both SWCNTs and MWCNTs are grown by techniques such as arc synthesis, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). While all of these approaches can produce CNTs in bulk quantities, CVD and PECVD are suited to grow CNTs on substrates with controlled thickness and even vertical orientation, suitable for device fabrication. The properties of CNTs can be modified by functionalizing them with other atomic or molecular groups. For example, fluorination makes SWCNTs insulating [20]. Attaching bio probes of DNA, RNA, aptamers, antibodies etc. enables development of biosensors for selective capturing of biotargets of interest [1, 5]. CNTs have been investigated {{for a wide variety}} of applications including transistors, memory devices, chem, bio and radiation sensors, nanoelectromechanical devices, high strength light weight composites, batteries, supercapacitors, filters and membranes, thermal interface materials, electrical interconnects in integrated circuits, electrical cables, transparent electrodes, shielding of electromagnetic interference, field emission devices, catalyst support and many others [1].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP) {{comprise}} a super-family of extracellular structural glycoproteins whose precise roles in plant cell wall assembly and functioning {{remain to be}} elucidated. However, their extended structure and repetitive block co-polymer character of HRGPs may mediate their self-assembly as wall scaffolds by like-with-like alignment of their hydrophobic peptide and hydrophilic glycopeptide modules. Intermolecular crosslinking further stabilizes the scaffold. Thus the design of HRGP-based scaffolds may have practical applications in bionanotechnology and medicine. As a first step, we have used single-molecule or single-aggregate atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize the structure of YK 20, an amphiphilic HRGP comprised entirely of 20 tandem repeats of: Ser-Hyp 4 -Ser-Hyp-Ser-Hyp 4 -Tyr-Tyr-Tyr-Lys. YK 20 formed tightly aggregated coils at low ionic strength, but networks of entangled chains with a porosity of ~ 0. 5 &# 8211; 3 &# 956;m at higher ionic strength. As a second step we have begun to design HRGP-carbon nanotube composites. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) {{can be considered as}} <b>seamless</b> <b>cylinders</b> rolled up from graphene sheets. These unique all-carbon structures have extraordinary aromatic and hydrophobic properties and form aggregated bundles due to strong inter-tube van der Waals interactions. Sonicating aggregated SWNT bundles with aqueous YK 20 solubilized them presumably by interaction with the repetitive, hydrophobic, Tyr-rich peptide modules of YK 20 with retention of the extended polyproline-II character. This may allow YK 20 to form extended structures that could potentially be used as scaffolds for site-directed assembly of nanomaterials. </p...|$|R

[...] They were buried without them. An investigation found that the accident was caused by the use of steel cylinders with nickel linings instead of <b>seamless</b> nickel <b>cylinders</b> because the army had pre-empted nickel production. The Navy Hospital did not have procedures for the treatment of people exposed to uranium hexafluoride, so Warren's Medical Section developed them.
