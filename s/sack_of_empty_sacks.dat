60|$|Half a {{dozen men}} {{provided}} with well greased saws first landed under Dick Balderson's command, and cleared a passage six feet wide to the path; then the landing began in earnest. The guns were first put on shore, and carried bodily to the path; {{the rest of the}} marines and the bluejackets then landed, each carrying, in addition to his arms and ammunition, a gun cartridge, or a box of rifle ammunition, and a couple <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>sacks.</b> As fast as they landed they proceeded up the path. Dick Balderson led the way, and the men were directed to step as closely as they could to each other. As they arrived near the pool, each deposited his burden, and then went back to assist to drag up the guns and carriages.|$|R
60|$|They {{therefore}} {{carried to}} the place a quantity of food and drink, and a number <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>sacks,</b> with which they constructed an impromptu couch near the blazing wood fire. Notwithstanding the seductive influence of the liquor, they were not troubled with much company, for {{the few people who}} resided in the vicinity did not care to remain out of doors late after what Father Ambrose had said as to the proceeding having been a joke of Satan's. The priest, however, came to see the men, and after giving them his blessing, and a few words of advice, he left them to whatever the night might bring forth. No sooner had he gone than the watchers put up some boards to shield them from the wind, and, drawing near to the cheerful fire, they began to partake of a homely but plentiful supper. Considering how requisite it was that they should be in possession of all their wits, perhaps {{it would have been better}} had not a large bottle been in such frequent requisition, for, soon after the meal was ended, what with the effects of the by-no-means weak potion, the warmth and odour sent forth by the crackling logs, and the musical moaning of the wind in the branches overhead, they began to feel drowsy, to mutter complaints against the hardship of their lot, and to look longingly upon the heap <b>of</b> <b>sacks.</b>|$|R
60|$|Almost {{opposite}} his berth, {{across the}} narrow passage under the bridge, there was, {{in the iron}} deck-structure covering the stokehold fiddle and the boiler-space, a storeroom with iron sides, iron roof, iron-plated floor, too, {{on account of the}} heat below. All sorts of rubbish was shot there: it had a mound of scrap-iron in a corner; rows <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> oil-cans; <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> cotton-waste, with a heap of charcoal, a deck-forge, fragments of an old hencoop, winch-covers all in rags, remnants of lamps, and a brown felt hat, discarded by a man dead now (of a fever on the Brazil coast), who had been once mate of the Sofala, had remained for years jammed forcibly behind a length of burst copper pipe, flung at some time or other out of the engine-room. A complete and imperious blackness pervaded that Capharnaum of forgotten things. A small shaft of light from Mr. Massy's bull's-eye fell slanting right through it.|$|R

40|$|Cod roe {{landings}} {{are subject}} to great variability regarding their quality and subsequent price for the food industry. A scheme was developed for the classification of cod roe into four quality grades (A, B, C and D) based on appearance and texture attributes as described by cod roe traders. Evaluation of the maturity stage of 80 commercial cod ovaries through the frequency distribution of oocyte diameter and the percentage presence <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> follicular <b>sacks</b> revealed that cod ovaries with commercial value are at stage 4 (ripe or vitellogenic), stage 5 (spawning) and stage 6 (spent) of development. The designated maturity stages {{were found to be}} closely related to the described quality grades. This relationship implied that vitellogenic ovaries (stages 4 a, 4 b and 4 c) were of A quality, early spawning ovaries (stage 5 a) were most often classed as B quality, advanced and late spawning ovaries (stage 5 b and 5 c) were of C quality, whilst spent ovaries (stage 6) were of the lowest quality grade (D). Several physicochemical characteristics recorded (eg pH, membrane features) were also found {{to be related to the}} quality and the maturity stage of the ovaries. There is a significant relationship between roe quality and moisture content, with roes of higher quality having a lower moisture content...|$|R

60|$|Borckman, as {{unaware of}} this, his last second of life, {{as he had}} been of his first second of birth, lowered the bottle and {{straightened}} forward his head. The keen edge sank home. What, in that flash of instant when his brain was severed from the rest of his body, Borckman may have felt or thought, if he felt or thought at all, is a mystery unsolvable to living man. No man, his spinal cord so severed, has ever given one word or whisper of testimony as to what were his sensations and impressions. No less swift than the hatchet stroke was the limp placidity into which Borckman's body melted to the deck. He did not reel or pitch. He melted, as a <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> wind suddenly <b>emptied,</b> as a bladder of air suddenly punctured. The bottle fell from his dead hand upon the yams without breaking, although the remnant of its contents gurgled gently out upon the deck.|$|R
60|$|Captain Arnault, {{commanding}} on the French side, {{sat alone}} {{in one of the}} cottages of the village, inhabited by the miller of the district. The Captain was reading, by the light of a solitary tallow-candle, some intercepted dispatches taken from the Germans. He had suffered the wood fire, scattered over the large open grate, to burn low; the red embers only faintly illuminated a part of the room. On the floor behind him lay some <b>of</b> the miller's <b>empty</b> <b>sacks.</b> In a corner opposite to him was the miller's solid walnut-wood bed. On the walls all around him were the miller's colored prints, representing a happy mixture of devotional and domestic subjects. A door of communication leading into the kitchen of the cottage had been torn from its hinges, and used to carry the men wounded in the skirmish from the field. They were now comfortably laid at rest in the kitchen, under the care of the French surgeon and the English nurse attached to the ambulance. A piece of coarse canvas screened the opening between the two rooms in place of the door. A second door, leading from the bed-chamber into the yard, was locked; and the wooden shutter protecting the one window of the room was carefully barred. Sentinels, doubled in number, were placed at all the outposts. The French commander had neglected no precaution which could reasonably insure for himself and for his men a quiet and comfortable night.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the houses}} on the square still have their {{original}} coal holes and ornate cast iron covers.

These elegantly solved {{the problem of how}} to quickly and cleanly deliver coal to the house, allowing the coal men to simply pull the hole open and <b>empty</b> their <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> coal down through it hole. The basement of the house then had a doorway into the coal house, under the street.|$|R
50|$|Together with Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray and Salvador Dalí, Paalen {{was among}} those {{responsible}} for the design of the 1938 International Exhibition of Surrealism at the Palais des Beaux Arts in Paris, where he produced a floor, with dead leaves and mud from the Montparnasse Cemetery, and an installation named Avant La Mare, consisting of an artificial pond with water, real water-lilies and reeds, beneath Duchamp's ceiling <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> coal <b>sacks.</b> The doll Paalen decorated came with a silk scarf, a giant bat on her head and an eerie, mushroom-covered leaf-dress. It anticipated the barely-visible, floating, gliding totemic fairy creatures from his oil paintings with fumage that Pierre Colle would show the following June in his surrealist gallery. He also participated in the editorial of the catalogue, published as Dictionnaire abrégé du Surrealisme to the show, in which his most famous object, Nuage articulé, was discreetly announced as a drawing. Recent research suggests that Paalen had a huge influence on the design of the exhibition's Great Hall. Other critics suggest that the entire installation was meant to imply the minatorial situation of the Surrealist group itself, reflected by the approaching war, as well as a huge mother´s womb as vade mecum to fight the causes of the crisis, which were located in the paternalistic fixations of the whole epoch. Paalen´s biographer Andreas Neufert, in particular, suggests the latter reading and sees the installation as a symptom of an ideological shift within Surrealism, away from Freud´s rigid theory of the Oedipus complex to ideas centred on Otto Rank´s theory The Trauma of Birth, with its recognition of the emotional nature of the child and its ties to the mother. This latter theory was represented and defended exclusively by Paalen and his wife Alice Rahon in this period.|$|R

40|$|Chylomicrons {{isolated}} from rat lymph were complexed with lipoprotein lipase of postheparin plasma (chylomicrons-LPL) {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} lipolysis on the structure of chylomicrons. Triglyceride in the chylomicron core was readily hydrolyzed to free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol when chylomicrons-LPL were incubated at pH 8. 3 in medium containing albumin. Although most of the FFA were immediately released to the medium, some were retained within chylomicrons when FFA-binding sites on albumin were not available. These observations suggest that albumin may have a specific role in the transfer of FFA across the chylomicron surface film. Chylomicrons-LPL assumed many different shapes as they were depleted of triglyceride by the lipolytic action of the enzyme, and total removal of core triglyceride resulted in <b>empty</b> <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> surface film. The surface film was visualized in sections of Os 04 -fixed chylomicrons-LPL as a thin electron-opaque line, 25 - 30 A wide, in areas where the underlying electron-opaque core had been replaced by zones of decreased electron opacity, and in folds of surface film extending outward from chylomicrons partially depleted of core lipid. The findings demonstrate that chylomicrons consist of a core of liquid triglyceride enveloped by a pliable and durable monolayer surface film, and that lipoprotein lipase reduces the triglyceride core without disrupting the surface film...|$|R
