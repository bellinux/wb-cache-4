The second one, along the time axis, consists of modeling the trajectory of the envelope DCM coefficients by another similar DCM model. An iterative algorithm is proposed to optimally fit this 2 D-model to the data according to a perceptual criterion based on frequency masking.

Our approach (first introduced in [6]) differs from [4] in use of frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP) [7 – 10], that allows for the approximation of temporal (Hilbert) envelopes of sub-band energies by an autoregressive (AR) model. Unlike temporal noise shaping (TNS) [7], which also uses FDLP and forms a part of the MPEG- 2 / 4 AAC codec, where FDLP is applied to solve problems with transient attacks (impulses), the proposed codec employs FDLP to approximate relatively long (hundreds of milliseconds) segments of Hilbert envelopes in individual frequency sub-bands.

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{commercial}} and consumer demand {{have led to}} the increasing use of multimedia applications in mobile and Internet telephony. Although audio, video and data communications are becoming more prevalent, a major application is and will remain the transmission of speech. Speech coding techniques suited to these new trends must be developed, not only to provide high quality speech communication but also to minimise the required bandwidth for speech, so as to maximise that available for the new audio, video and data services. The majority of current speech coders employed in mobile and Internet applications employ a Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) model. These coders attempt to reproduce the input speech signal and can produce high quality synthetic speech at bit rates above 8 kbps. Sinusoidal speech coders tend to dominate at rates below 6 kbps but due to limitations in the <b>sinusoidal</b> speech <b>coding</b> model, their synthetic speech quality cannot be significantly improved even if their bit rate is increased. Recent developments have seen the emergence and application of Pitch Synchronous (PS) speech coding techniques to these coders in order to remove the limitations of the <b>sinusoidal</b> speech <b>coding</b> model. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to investigate and eliminate the factors that limit the quality of the synthetic speech produced by PS sinusoidal coders. In order to achieve this innovative signal processing techniques have been developed. New parameter analysis and quantisation techniques have been produced which overcome many of the problems associated with applying PS techniques to sinusoidal coders. In sinusoidal based coders, two of the most important elements are the correct formulation of pitch and voicing values from the' input speech. The techniques introduced here have greatly improved these calculations resulting in a higher quality PS sinusoidal speech coder than was previously available. A new quantisation method which is able to reduce the distortion from quantising speech spectral information has also been developed. When these new techniques are utilised they effectively raise the synthetic speech quality of sinusoidal coders to a level comparable to that produced by CELP based schemes, making PS sinusoidal coders a promising alternative at low to medium bit rates.
