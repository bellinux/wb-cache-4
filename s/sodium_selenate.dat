Subsequently, the surface area of the treated sample was significantly increased by 8. 16 % compared with the control sample. The control and treated FT-IR spectra exhibited the sharp and strong vibration bands at 889 cm- 1 and 888 cm- 1, respectively for Se=O stretching. The control and treated samples displayed the maximum absorbance at 204. 9 nm and 204. 5 nm, respectively. A significant reduction of total weight loss by 6. 11 % in the treated sample indicated the improvement of the thermal stability of the treated sample compared with the control sample. The vaporization temperature of the treated sample (95. 68 °C) was higher with a significant reduced latent heat of vaporization by 60. 80 % compared to the control sample (95. 29 °C). Thus, The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment might produce a new polymorphic form of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenate</b> which would be more soluble, dissolution rate, bioavailable, and thermally stable compared with the untreated sample. The Trivedi Effect® treated <b>sodium</b> <b>selenate</b> would be very suitable to design improved nutraceutical and pharmaceutical formulations that might provide better therapeutic response against several diseases such as stress, aging, inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, infectious diseases, cancer, etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if serum glutathione peroxidase activity reflects short-term changes in the selenium status of goats. Angora goat kids (n= 14) were fed pelleted luceme containing 20 microg/kg of selenium, and treated orally with either selenium (0. 1 mg/kg of liveweight weekly, as <b>sodium</b> <b>selenate)</b> or de-ionised water. Serum activity of glutathione peroxidase was increased in response to supplementation and differed from that of controls within 24 hours of supplementation. The change in serum glutathione peroxidase activity during the 21 days after the start of weekly supplementation closely followed changes in serum selenium concentration. The results of this study suggest that serum glutathione peroxidase activity reflects the short-term improvement in the selenium status of Angora goat kids following oral supplementation with <b>sodium</b> <b>selenate.</b> PUBM: Print; JID: 0021406; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{selenium}} accumulation in carrot and onion plants using foliar application by sodium selenite and <b>sodium</b> <b>selenate.</b> Furthermore, we aimed at identifying the Se species biosynthesised by onion and carrot plants. The results were used to prepare for production of 77 Se enriched plants for an ongoing human absorption study. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of {{operation}} of black chrome electrolyte, current densities {{of the order of}} 2000 - 6000 A/m 2 are required. This is associated with the difficulties of the higher heating effect of the electrolyte and current transmission problems for full size collectors. This prompted the authors to develop suitable additives for operation at low current density. The plating solution produces black deposits at a current density of 400 A/m 2 with optical properties alpha= 0. 94 and e= 0. 07 by the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenate</b> and acetic acid as additives. The influences of variables such as plating time, current density and temperature on optical properties (alpha, e) are studied. Polarization characteristics of the solution are compared with the conventional tetrachromate solution. The use of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenate</b> and acetic acid helps to attain the deposition of black chrome at low current densitie...|$|E
