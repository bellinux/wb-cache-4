25|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} the Sages said that {{inspiration}} {{does not come}} to a prophet when the prophet is <b>sad</b> <b>or</b> languid. Thus Moses did not receive any revelation {{when he was in}} a state of depression that lasted from the murmurings of the Israelites upon the evil report of the spies until the death of the warriors of that generation.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{disorders}} {{are difficult to}} study in animal models because {{it is difficult to}} know what animals are thinking and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition. Can a monkey effectively communicate that he is <b>sad</b> <b>or</b> that he feels overwhelmed? Lacking the ability to use language to study behavioral disorders like depression and stress questions the validity of those studies conducted. It can be difficult to attribute human afflictions to non-human animals.|$|E

25|$|The Megillah is {{read with}} a cantillation (a {{traditional}} chant) differing from that {{used in the}} customary reading of the Torah. Besides the traditional cantillation, there are several verses or short phrases in the Megillah that are chanted in a different chant, the chant that is traditional for {{the reading of the}} book of Lamentations. These verses are particularly <b>sad,</b> <b>or</b> they refer to Jews being in exile. When the Megillah reader jumps to the melody of the book of Lamentations for these phrases, it heightens the feeling of sadness in the listener.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was <b>sad</b> <b>or</b> fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{sought to}} reflect the Rhino's simplistic {{thinking}} style in his voice. He believes [...] "the quintessential 'thug' was played by William Bendix in The Glass Key.

He's mad or happy or angry or <b>sad</b> <b>or</b> hungry or whatever. And it never gets beyond his appetites or ego."

500|$|Even {{though the}} mask covers an actor's facial expressions, {{the use of}} the mask in Noh is not an {{abandonment}} of facial expressions altogether. Rather, its intent is to stylize and codify the facial expressions through {{the use of the}} mask and to stimulate the imagination of the audience. By using masks, actors are able to convey emotions in a more controlled manner through movements and body language. Some masks utilize lighting effect to convey different emotions through slight tilting of the head. Facing slightly upward, or [...] "brightening" [...] the mask, will let the mask to capture more light, revealing more features that appear laughing or smiling.

500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how <b>sad</b> <b>or</b> lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Monique Steele, Kim Possible is [...] "all {{about how}} girls kick butt"; Kim {{constantly}} rescues Ron, saving him from peril {{on numerous occasions}} throughout the series. Writing for Wewomen.com, Carla Cain Walther observed that the series [...] "scoffed at the 'damsel in distress' trope used in action films" [...] by having Kim save Ron [...] "using her ingenuity and strength", reinforcing the idea that girls are capable of helping themselves. Identifying Kim as a postfeminist heroine because she is intelligent {{in addition to being}} [...] "shaped like Barbie" [...] and having a male assistant similar to female executives, The New York Times Julie Salamon joked that [...] "Kim's job seems to be making the world safe for cheerleaders again, following the path forged by Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde on behalf of sorority girls." [...] Tor.com's Sarah Gailey observed that while Shego proudly spends much of her time lounging poolside and deciding what she does and does not want to do, Kim is forced [...] "to leap into action regardless of whether she's tired or <b>sad</b> <b>or</b> sick or, heaven forbid, too busy". Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show that you could be traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can do anything they choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance. Inness also felt that show's feminist potential is compromised by the fact that Kim mostly surrounds herself with male companions as opposed to female, [...] "contradict the messages of female solidarity".|$|E
