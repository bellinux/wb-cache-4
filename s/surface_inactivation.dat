40|$|Veneer {{drying process}} is an {{important}} stage {{in the production of}} wood based composites such as plywood and LVL panels. Because veneer drying becomes a bottleneck in the production process due to the inefficient equipment and methods. Although drying temperatures between 90 - 160 °C may be considered normal, increased temperatures are being used to reduce the overall drying time and increase capacity. However, the reduction in drying time often results in an increase in drying related defects such as checks, splits and warp and decrease in wettability. <b>Surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> is one of these defects which occur on wood surfaces with heat effect and results in the loss of bonding ability. <b>Surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> is defined as physical and chemical modifications on the wood surfaces that results in reduced ability of the adhesive to properly wet, flow, penetrate and cure. Many investigations have been conducted to improve adhesion of inactivated wood surfaces, but no comprehensive solution has been revealed so far...|$|E
40|$|Semliki Forest {{virus was}} studied, exposing the viruses {{to a large}} air/water {{interface}} by aeration or by rotating the fluid in a spherical flask. EMC virus in I M-NaC 1 was not sensitive to this treatment, phage T 3 and Ts were only little affected, but the phages T 1 and MS 2 and Semliki Forest virus were rapidly inactivated by bubbling air or nitrogen gas through the suspension. In salt solutions at rest no inactivation of these viruses was observed. Inactivation by aeration was prevented by addition of peptone, by apolar carboxylic acids and by the surface active agent OED. If a large solution/glass interface is present, some loss of virus occurs by adsorption to the glass surface. Phenylalanine protected against adsorption to the glass surface, but protected less effectively against inactivation by aeration. The rate of <b>surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> was strongly dependent on the salt concentration in the medium. At low NaCl concentration (o. oI M) nearly no inactivation was found for phage T ~ and MS 2 and phage Ta was not sensitive to aeration i I M-NaC 1 but was rapidly inactivated in 2 - 6 M-NaC 1. The rate of inactivation decreased with time of shaking {{and in the case}} of phage T ~ a nearly completely resistant fraction of Io- 4 of the original particles remained. The resistance against <b>surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> was a non-heritable property. Resistance against hermal inactivation was not correlated with resistance to <b>surface</b> <b>inactivation,</b> suggesting that the mechanism of inactivation differs in these processes...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{growth as}} a biofilm on solid {{surfaces}} is {{strongly associated with}} the development of human infections. Biofilms on native heart valves (infective endocarditis) is a life-threatening disease as a consequence of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in such a state. Enterococci have emerged as a cause of endocarditis and nosocomial infections despite being normal commensals of the gastrointestinal and female genital tracts. We examined the role of two-component signal transduction systems in biofilm formation by the Enterococcus faecalis V 583 clinical isolate and identified the fsr regulatory locus as the sole two-component system affecting this unique mode of bacterial growth. Insertion mutations in the fsr operon affected biofilm formation on two distinct abiotic <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Inactivation</b> of the fsr-controlled gene gelE encoding the zinc-metalloprotease gelatinase was found to prevent biofilm formation, suggesting that this enzyme may present a unique target for therapeutic intervention in enterococcal endocarditis...|$|R

The best antibacterial effect with Petri dishes was observed at 180, 60, 30 and 20 min of exposure for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas putida and Listeria innocua, respectively. The ceramic tiles demonstrated a photoactivated bactericidal effect at the same exposure time. In general, no differences were observed between the antibacterial effect obtained with Petri dishes and tiles.

40|$|A wood surface, {{which is}} exposed to a high {{temperature}} condition, can experience inactivation. <b>Surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> results in reduced ability of an adhesive to properly wet, flow, penetrate, and cure. Thus, an inactivated wood surface does not bond well with adhesives. The changes in surface chemistry, wettability, and adhesion of inactivated wood surfaces, including heartwood of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and southern pine (Pinus taeda), were studied. Wood samples were dried from the green moisture content condition in a convection oven at five different temperature levels ranging from 50 to 200 °C. The comparative characterization of the surface was done by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), sessile drop wettability, and fracture testing of adhesive bonds. The oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) decreasedand the C 1 /C 2 ratio increased with drying temperature. The C 1 component is related to carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds, and the C 2 component represents single carbon-oxygen bond. A low O/C ratio and a high C 1 /C 2 ratio reflected {{a high concentration of}} non-polar wood components (extractives/VOCs) on the wood surface, which modified the wood surface from hydrophilic to more hydrophobic. Wettability was directly related to the O/C ratio and inversely related to the C 1 /C 2 ratio. Contact angle decreased with time and increased with the temperature of exposure. Southern pine had a lower wettability than yellow-poplar, which was due to a greater concentration of non-polar hydrocarbon-type extractives and heat-generated volatiles on the surface. Solvent extraction prior to drying did not improved wettability, whereas, extraction after drying improved wettability. A contribution of extractives migration and VOCs generation {{played a significant role in}} the heat-induced inactivation process of southern pine. The maximum strain energy release rate (Gmax) showed that <b>surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> was insignificant for was most susceptible to inactivation at drying temperatures > 156 °C, particularly when bonded with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesive. Chemical treatments improved the wettability of inactivated wood surfaces, but an improvement in adhesion was not evident for specimens bonded with polyvinyl-acetate (PVA) adhesive.

40|$|Microelectrophoresis is {{a common}} {{technique}} for probing the surface chemistry of the Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst. Results of previous studies of the electrophoretic mobility of C. parvum oocysts in which microelectrophoresis was used are incongruent. In this work we demonstrated that capillary electrophoresis may {{also be used to}} probe the surface characteristics of C. parvum oocysts, and we related the surface chemistry of C. parvum oocysts to their stability in water. Capillary electrophoresis results indicated that oocysts which were washed in a phosphate buffer solution had neutrally charged <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Inactivation</b> of oocysts with formalin did not influence their electrophoretic mobility, while oocyst populations that were washed in distilled water consisted of cells with both neutral and negative surface charges. These results indicate that washing oocysts in low-ionic-strength distilled water can impart a negative charge to a fraction of the oocysts in the sample. Rapid coagulation experiments indicated that oocysts did not aggregate in a 0. 5 M NaCl solution; oocyst stability in the salt solution may have been the result of Lewis acid-base forces, steric stabilization, or some other factor. The presence of sucrose and Percoll could not be readily identified on the surface of C. parvum oocysts by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, suggesting that these purification reagents may not be responsible for the stability of the uncharged oocysts. These findings imply that precipitate enmeshment may be the optimal mechanism of coagulation for removal of oocysts in water treatment systems. The results of this work may help elucidate the causes of variation in oocyst surface characteristics, may ultimately lead to improved removal efficiencies in full-scale water treatment systems, and may improve fate and transport predictions for oocysts in natural systems...|$|R

The model involves {{solution of the}} advection–dispersion equation, which additionally considers virus inactivation in the solution, as well as virus removal at the solid matrix surface due to attachment (deposition), release, and inactivation. Two <b>surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> models for the fate of attached inactive viruses and their subsequent role on virus attachment and release were considered. Geochemical heterogeneity, portrayed as patches of positively charged metal oxyhydroxide coatings on collector grain surfaces, and physical heterogeneity, portrayed as spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, were incorporated in the model. Both layered and randomly (log-normally) distributed physical and geochemical heterogeneities were considered. The upstream weighted multiple cell balance method was employed to numerically solve the governing equations of groundwater flow and virus transport. Model predictions show {{that the presence of}} subsurface layered geochemical and physical heterogeneity results in preferential flow paths and thus significantly affect virus mobility.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} involving inactivation of bacteriophage MS 2 in aerosols and {{the effect}} of protective substances in the spray-medium were studied after spraying from various NaCl solutions. Results with aerosols generated from the salt solutions showed that with higher salt concentration in the spray-medium higher concentrations of protective substances were needed to protect phage MS 2 against aerosol inactivation. Phenylalanine, which has a protective action at low concentration, produced less protection in aerosol droplets that were supersaturated solutions of this substance or in which crystals of phenylalanine can be expected to form. Our results suggested that protection by peptone and phenylalanine was related to the concentration in the aerosol droplet after evaporation to equilibrium, whereas protection by the surface active agent OED (a commercial mixture of oxyethylene docosylether and oxyethelene octadecylether) was related to the concentration at which a monolayer is formed around the aerosol particle. Inactivation of phage MS 2 was maximal in the aerosol particle in fluid phase and became less at lower relative humidity where aerosol particles are expected to be in the solid state. It is suggested that inactivation of bacteriophage MS 2 in aerosols could be explained by <b>surface</b> <b>inactivation</b> at the air-water interface...|$|E

We find that Smo is ubiquitinated at multiple Lysine residues including those in its autoinhibitory domain (SAID), leading to endocytosis and degradation of Smo by both lysosome- and proteasome-dependent mechanisms. Hh inhibits Smo ubiquitination via PKA/CK 1 -mediated phosphorylation of SAID, leading to Smo cell <b>surface</b> accumulation. <b>Inactivation</b> of the ubiquitin activating enzyme Uba 1 or perturbation of multiple components of the endocytic machinery leads to Smo accumulation and Hh pathway activation.

Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that all four predicted N 2 N 3 -like regions are composed mainly of beta-sheets with only a minor proportion of alpha-helices, which is characteristic of Ig-like folded domains. Three of the four identified enterococcal N 2 N 3 -like regions showed potent dose-dependent binding to Fg. However, the specificity of the Fg-binding MSCRAMMs differs, as indicated by far-Western blots, which showed that recombinant segments of the MSCRAMMs bound different Fg polypeptide chains. Enterococci grown in serum-supplemented broth adhere to Fg-coated <b>surfaces,</b> and <b>inactivation</b> in strain OG 1 RF of the gene encoding Fss 2 resulted in reduced adherence, whilst complementation of the mutant restored full Fg adherence. Thus, E. faecalis contains a family of MSCRAMMs that structurally and functionally resemble the Fg-binding MSCRAMMs of staphylococci...|$|R
40|$|Niemann-Pick C 1 -like 1 (NPC 1 L 1) plays a {{critical}} role in the enterohepatic absorption of free cholesterol. Cellular cholesterol depletion induces the transport of NPC 1 L 1 from the endocytic recycling compartment to the plasma membrane (PM), and cholesterol replenishment causes the internalization of NPC 1 L 1 together with cholesterol via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Although NPC 1 L 1 has been characterized, the other proteins involved in cholesterol absorption and the endocytic recycling of NPC 1 L 1 are largely unknown. Most of the vesicular trafficking events are dependent on the cytoskeleton and motor proteins. Here, we investigated the roles of the microfilament and microfilament-associated triple complex composed of myosin Vb, Rab 11 a, and Rab 11 -FIP 2 in the transport of NPC 1 L 1 from the endocytic recycling compartment to the PM. Interfering with the dynamics of the microfilament by pharmacological treatment delayed the transport of NPC 1 L 1 to the cell <b>surface.</b> Meanwhile, <b>inactivation</b> of any component of the myosin Vb·Rab 11 a·Rab 11 -FIP 2 triple complex inhibited the export of NPC 1 L 1. Expression of the dominant-negative mutants of myosin Vb, Rab 11 a, or Rab 11 -FIP 2 decreased the cellular cholesterol uptake by blocking the transport of NPC 1 L 1 to the PM. These results suggest that the efficient transport of NPC 1 L 1 to the PM is dependent on the microfilament-associated myosin Vb·Rab 11 a·Rab 11 -FIP 2 triple complex...|$|R
40|$|Adaptation of cell {{shape and}} {{polarization}} through {{the formation and}} retraction of cellular protrusions requires balancing of endocytosis and exocytosis combined with fine-tuning of the local activity of small GTPases like Rab 8. Here, we show that endocytic turnover of the plasma membrane at protrusions is directly coupled to <b>surface</b> removal and <b>inactivation</b> of Rab 8. Removal is induced by reduced membrane tension and mediated by the GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase- 1 (GRAF 1, also known as ARHGAP 26), a regulator of clathrin-independent endocytosis. GRAF 1 -depleted cells were deficient in multi-directional spreading and displayed elevated levels of GTP-loaded Rab 8, which was accumulated at the tips of static protrusions. Furthermore, GRAF 1 depletion impaired lumen formation and spindle orientation in a 3 D cell culture system, indicating that GRAF 1 activity regulates polarity establishment. Our data suggest that GRAF 1 -mediated removal of Rab 8 from the cell surface restricts its activity during protrusion formation, thereby facilitating dynamic adjustment of the polarity axis...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated {{potassium}} (Kv) channels {{from the}} Kv 4, or Shal-related, gene family underlie {{a major component}} of the A-type potassium current in mammalian central neurons. We recently identified a family of calcium-binding proteins, termed KChIPs (Kv channel interacting proteins), that bind to the cytoplasmic N termini of Kv 4 family�subunits and modulate their <b>surface</b> density, <b>inactivation</b> kinetics, and rate of recovery from inactivation (An et al., 2000). Here, we used single and double-label immunohistochemistry, together with circumscribed lesions and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, to examine the regional and subcellular distribution of KChIPs 1 – 4 and Kv 4 family�subunits in adult rat brain. Immunohistochemical staining using KChIP-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that the KChIP polypeptides are concentrated in neuronal somata and dendrites where their cellular and subcellular distribution overlaps, in an isoformspecific manner, with that of Kv 4. 2 and Kv 4. 3. For example, immunoreactivity for KChIP 1 and Kv 4. 3 is concentrated in the somata and dendrites of hippocampal, striatal, and neocortical interneurons. Immunoreactivity for KChIP 2, KChIP 4, and Kv 4. 2 is concentrated in the apical and basal dendrites of hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal cells. Double-label immunofluorescence labeling revealed that throughout the forebrain, KChIP 2 and KChIP 4 are frequently colocalized with Kv 4. 2, whereas in cortical, hippocampal, and striatal interneurons, KChIP 1 is frequently colocalized with Kv 4. 3. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses confirmed that all KChIPs coassociate with Kv 4 � subunits in brain membranes, indicating that KChIPs 1 – 4 are integral components of native A-type Kv channel complexes and ar...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} biofilms from microstructured {{titanium}} used for dental implants is a still unresolved challenge. This experimental study investigated disinfection and removal of in situ formed biofilms from microstructured titanium using cold atmospheric plasma {{in combination with}} air/water spray. Titanium discs (roughness (Ra) : 1. 96 µm) were exposed to human oral cavities for 24 and 72 hours (n =  149 each) to produce biofilms. Biofilm thickness was determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy (n =  5 each). Plasma treatment of biofilms was carried out ex vivo using a microwave-driven pulsed plasma source working at temperatures from 39 to 43 °C. Following plasma treatment, one group was air/water spray treated before re-treatment by second plasma pulses. Vital microorganisms on the titanium surfaces were identified by contact culture (Rodac agar plates). Biofilm presence and bacterial viability were quantified by fluorescence microscopy. Morphology of titanium surfaces and attached biofilms was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Total protein amounts of biofilms were colorimetrically quantified. Untreated and air/water treated biofilms served as controls. Cold plasma treatment of native biofilms with a mean thickness of 19 µm (24 h) to 91 µm (72 h) covering the microstructure of the titanium <b>surface</b> caused <b>inactivation</b> of biofilm bacteria and significant reduction of protein amounts. Total removal of biofilms, however, required additional application of air/water spray, and a second series of plasma treatment. Importantly, the microstructure of the titanium discs was not altered by plasma treatment. The combination of atmospheric plasma and non-abrasive air/water spray is applicable for complete elimination of oral biofilms from microstructured titanium used for dental implants and may enable new routes for the therapy of periimplant disease...|$|R
40|$|Two glucosyltransferase {{genes from}} Streptococcus mutans GS- 5, gtfB and gtfC, have been {{previously}} isolated and sequenced in this laboratory. In the present communication a third gtf gene, gtfD, was isolated and characterized. Isolation {{of the gene}} involved a novel procedure utilizing the integration plasmid pVA 891. A peptide expressed by the 1. 7 -kilobase DNA fragment from strain NHS 1 (containing deletions in both the gtfB and gtfC genes) was initially identified in a pUC 18 clone bank with antiglucosyltransferase antibodies. This fragment was integrated into the GS- 5 chromosome following ligation into pVA 891 and transformation, yielding strain DP 2. The vector together with one complete and one incomplete copy of the gtfD gene {{was removed from the}} chromosome of strain DP 2 following EcoRI digestion, religation, and transformation of E. coli HB 101. The resultant plasmid, pNH 4, expressed glucosyltransferase S (GTF-S) activity. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity and was shown to synthesize water-soluble glucan exclusively in a primer-dependent manner. The molecular mass (155 kilodaltons) and the kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme were similar to those observed for the GTF-S enzyme previously purified from culture fluids of strain GS- 5. Insertional inactivation of the gtfD gene indicated that this gene is not required for in vitro sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth <b>surfaces.</b> Furthermore, <b>inactivation</b> of the gtfD gene in a gtfC gtfB mutant indicated that three distinct gtf genes involved in glucan formation are present on the S. mutans GS- 5 chromosome. Southern blot analysis further suggested that the gtfD gene does not share demonstrable homology with the gtf genes from Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus sobrinus...|$|R
40|$|Candida apicola and Aspergillus niger strains were {{isolated}} and identified from Deglet-Nour dates, and their loads were determined on the fruit <b>surface.</b> The thermal <b>inactivation</b> of their spores was evaluated between 42 and 70 C. The estimated D values for C. apicola and A. niger were D 50 = 2. 3 ± 0. 4 min and D 50 = 22. 1 ± 2. 1 min, respectively. The zT values obtained were 9. 4 ± 2. 6 and 9. 6 ± 1. 0 C for C. apicola and A. niger, respectively. The experimental survival spores obtained {{on the date}} surface during non-isothermal treatment were compared with the simulated data based on the Bigelow method and on pasteurization value calculations. C. apicola and A. niger spores can be inactivated by relatively low temperatures. Validation shows that this model and its parameters {{can be used to}} optimize pasteurization of these fungal spores on the surface of fruits using the temperature–time profile data. These thermal treatments can pasteurized date surface while minimizing the color date degradation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The Flaviviridae family {{includes}} several virus pathogens associated with human diseases worldwide. Within this family, Dengue virus {{is the most}} serious threat to public health, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Currently, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs against Dengue virus or against most of the viruses of this family. Therefore, the development of vaccines and the discovery of therapeutic compounds against the medically most important flaviviruses remain a global public health priority. We previously showed that phospholipase A 2 isolated from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus was able to inhibit Dengue virus and Yellow fever virus infection in Vero cells. Here, we present evidence that phospholipase A 2 has a direct effect on Dengue virus particles, inducing a partial exposure of genomic RNA, which strongly suggests inhibition via the cleavage of glycerophospholipids at the virus lipid bilayer envelope. This cleavage might induce a disruption of the lipid bilayer that causes a destabilization of the E proteins on the virus <b>surface,</b> resulting in <b>inactivation.</b> We show by computational analysis that phospholipase A 2 might gain access to the Dengue virus lipid bilaye...|$|R
