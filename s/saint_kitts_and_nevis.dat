5000|$|The French {{invasion}} of <b>Saint</b> <b>Kitts</b> {{also known as}} the Siege of Brimstone Hill (19 January - 13 February 1782) was a siege of the Anglo-French War.

The Comte de Grasse, who delivered de Bouillé's troops and supported the siege, was outmanoeuvred and deprived of his anchorage by Admiral Hood. Even though Hood's force was inferior by one-third, de Grasse was beaten off when he attempted to dislodge Hood.
