The purpose of the study is to describe what conductors (i. e., instructors) of college-based ensembles know about hearing health and the generation of <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>levels.</b> The study aimed to describe the 1) current state of conductors’ awareness and knowledge of <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>levels,</b> 2) current attitudes of conductors toward learning and sharing knowledge of <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>levels,</b> and 3) current teaching practices of conductors in regard to equipment usage (e. g. sound level meter, noise dosimeter, hearing protection devices) relating to sound measurement and exposure. Findings indicate 80. 2 % of conductors (N = 162, 66 % employed by NASM-accredited institutions) agree that sounds generated during ensemble-based instructional activities (EBIAs) in college-level schools of music are capable of harming human hearing, but 24. 1 % “do not know” if EBIAs they conduct ever exceed <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> capable of harming human hearing, 54. 9 % do not know “what services or resources” their home institutions offer/refer to students, 93 % are never using a noise dosimeter, 40 % have never had an audiology exam, and 70 % have never used hearing protection during an EBIA. Conductors have a strong openness to change current teaching practices and inform themselves about hearing health, but few are personally informing and educating their students during the EBIA. The study serves to assist conductors and foster a new dialogue among their students, colleagues, staff, and administrators to revise current curriculum, explore sound measurement technologies, and evaluate current hearing health and safety issues inherent in the practice, performance, and teaching of <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> generated during EBIAs in college-level schools of music...|$|R

Since sound pressure level decreases as the inverse of the distance from the source (it is <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>level</b> that drops as the inverse of the distance squared, for those familiar with the inverse square law), the amplitude of the sound will be slightly less at the rear of the diaphragm as compared to the front of the diaphragm.

40|$|Vacuum {{cleaners}} {{are widely}} used household appliances and they usually generate quite unpleasant sound. The four most common sources of vacuum cleaner noise are the motor, the fan, the airflow and the surface vibrations. Connections between the motor and such vibrating surfaces of a vacuum cleaner allow very efficient transmission of the force and the motion, which are then transformed to sound. The surface velocity, the sound pressure and the acoustic power of the vibrating surfaces are very important parameters in the noise control and source location problems. The {{purpose of this study}} is to asses the vibro-acoustical characteristics of a sample wet and dry type vacuum cleaner and to determine the acoustic power radiated from this type of vacuum cleaner. For this purpose, the near-field sound pressure, the surface velocity and the <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> are measured. By using these measurements, the <b>sound</b> <b>intensity,</b> the near-field <b>sound</b> pressure and the surface velocity mappings are generated and using these measurements, the <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> compares the results compared to find the effects of the vibrating surfaces on the total vacuum cleaner sound power level...|$|R

40|$|Although {{ultrasonic}} {{energy has}} been used widely for general medical diagnostic purposes and {{as a tool for}} the nondestructive inspection of engineering components, a lack of understanding of the fundamental wave propagation phenomena in teeth has largely precluded its application to dentistry. This paper studies the physics of ultrasound/teeth interactions. Based on the authors’ experience with the detection of defec engineering materials using ultrasound and the development of finite element computer code to study the wave propagation, initial studies have already been made on a tooth phantom. Results indicate that this numerical model can indeed be used to study the complex ultrasound interactions with dental anomalies, such as pulpitis and abscesses, and that such results could be used to optimize the design of appropriate transducers and equipment for dentistry applications. The primary reason why this technique is important and should take place is that ultrasonography has a great advantage over the presently available X-ray technology in that it does put any strain on the patient nor does it cause any pain.

40|$|The {{construction}} of sound walls along highways {{has been the}} primary noise mitigation strategy in California and in many other western States. Sound walls cost approximately $ 1. 5 million per mile and are effective only {{in close proximity to}} the highway, on the “far ” side of the sound wall, so to speak. In its efforts to explore other noise mitigation strategies, the California Department of Trans-portation (Caltrans) recently conducted a study to determine the effect of diamond grinding on the noise characteristics of existing concrete pavements. Since the noise generated at the tire– pavement interface is the greatest contributor to highway noise, quieter pavement surfaces can reduce overall noise levels for both road users and neighborhoods—whether sound walls are used or not. On-board <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> (OBSI) measurements were conducted on six routes in California, for a total of 42 evaluation sections; each evaluation section was 440 ft (136. 8 m) long. OBSI measurements before and after diamond grinding were recorded. Following are the overall con-clusions that were reached after the pre- and post-grinding OBSI levels were measured: • There is a significant and readily audible reduction in OBSI levels (and hence in tire– pavement noise) after grinding. • An average 2. 7 dBA reduction in OBSI levels was observed for all test sites. • Among the six routes, the highest average reduction of 4. 4 dBA was observed on I- 5 near Richards Boulevard in Sacramento County, and the lowest reduction of 1. 2 dBA was observed on State Route 60 (on a single test section) in San Bernardino County. • The highest reductions in <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> on a 1 / 3 -octave band basis occurred in the 1600 Hz band, while the lowest reductions occurred in the 1000 Hz bandwidth...|$|R
