40|$|A simple, {{economic}} and time-efficient stability-indicating, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method {{has been developed}} for analysis of <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> {{in the presence of}} degradation products generated by decomposition. When <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> was subjected to acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, oxidative, photolytic, humidity and thermal stress, degradation was observed during base hydrolysis, oxidation, humidity and thermal stress. The drug was found to be stable to other stress conditions. Successful chromatographic condition of the drug from the degradation products formed under stress conditions was achieved on a phenomenex Gemini column with potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer, pH adjusted to 2. 2 with orthophosphoric acid, as mobile phase. The method was validated for linearity, precision, specificity and robustness and can be used for quality-control during manufacture and assessment of the stability of samples of <b>silver</b> <b>lactate.</b> To the best of our knowledge, a validated stability-indicating LC assay method for <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> based on lactic acid is reported for the first time...|$|E
40|$|A new silver {{impregnation}} {{technique for}} frozen and paraffin sections of formalin-fixed nervous tissue has been devised by modifying the Fink-Heimer and De Olmos-Ingram methods. The modified versions have been combined {{into a single}} staining procedure. Cobalt or lead nitrate are substituted for uranyl nitrate. Silver nitrate in the impregnating solution is replaced by <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> or protargol. This procedure results in a preferential impregnation of degenerating perikarya, dendrites, axons and synaptic endings. It affords a more complete impregnation of 'preterminal' axonal arborizations than previous methods. The method is effective for the demonstration of degenerating terminals in the rat cerebellar cortex. Emphasis has been laid on {{the usefulness of the}} method for the study of drug-induced CNS lesions. © 1975. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim: {{to conduct}} {{analysis}} of the accumulation and biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in the structural and functional areas of mesenteric lymph nodes of white rats conducted {{with regard to the}} size and duration of the oral administration. The methods of dark field microscopy with Leica DM 2500 microscope were used to assess biodistribution of gold nanoparticle. The histochemical reaction of silver amplification with <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> by Danscher was used to confirm its identification. Results: It was found that the gold nanoparticles of 1 - 3 nm were not detected by these methods in any of the areas of the lymph nodes regardless of the duration of administration, gold nanoparticles of sizes 15 and 50 nm were detected in the form of clusters in the cytoplasm of macrophages and lymphocytes mainly in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles and brain strands. Conclusion: It was established that the gold nanoparticles of sizes 15 and 50 nm were detected in the form of clusters in the cytoplasm of macrophages and lymphocyte...|$|E
40|$|Background & Objective: The silver {{nanoparticles}} {{are important}} in many applications of nanoparticles on human health. The toxicity of silver nanoparticles are not well documented yet. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of <b>silver</b> nanoparticles on <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenase activity and histological changes in heart tissue.   Materials &Methods: In this study, 40 adult male wistar rats of 220 ± 20 gr were divided in to five groups including control and four experimental groups. The latter groups were injected intraperitoneally spherical nano silver particles of 50, 100, 200 and 400 ppm respectively for five consecutive days. Then three, eight and twelve days after the last injection, blood samples were collected and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was assayed. Also, tissue samples from the heart muscle were prepared and studied after staining with Hematoxiline-Eosine. Data of LDH activity was analyzed by One way- ANOVA- test and P-value of ≤ 0. 05 were considered as significant.   Results : The result showed that different concentrations of silver nanoparticles have no significant effect on the lactate dehydrogenase (p= 0. 192). T he histological study of the tissue after exposure to 400 ppm concentration of silver nanoparticles showed the start of primary apoptosis in heart tissue.   Conclusion: The LDH activity was not changed significantly after exposure to different concentration of silver nanoparticles, which shows the safety of these particles on LDH activity...|$|R
40|$|Sulfated glycoconjugates in {{epithelial}} cells and mesenchymal cells were investigated after staining with high iron diamine-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate. One {{purpose of the}} experiment was to apply a new physical developer to the staining. Instead of silver nitrate, <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> or silver bromide, we used silver acetate as an ion donor. This new method allowed physical development under normal lighting conditions, and resulted in the reduction of background staining even after amplification. As the developer did not contain gum arabic, troublesome treatment was not necessary. The time required for staining was very short and the electron density of the final reaction product was high and easily identifiable under the electron microscope. Fixing was not necessary. Very small amounts of reactive substance were detectable after physical development. This developmental procedure {{has been applied to}} both the preembedding staining and postembedding staining of sulfated glyococonjugates. The results obtained using this method are presented.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} and characterization of amino acid ester based chiral ionic liquids, derived from L- and D-alanine tert butyl ester chloride. The synthesis was accomplished via an anion metathesis reaction between commercially available L- and D-alanine tert butyl ester chloride {{using a variety}} of counterions such as lithium bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonimide, silver nitrate, <b>silver</b> <b>lactate,</b> and silver tetrafluoroborate. Both enantiomeric forms were obtained as confirmed by bands of opposite sign in the circular dichroism spectra. The L- and D-alanine tert butyl ester bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonimide were obtained as liquids at room temperature and intriguingly exhibited the highest thermal stability (up to 263 degrees C). In addition, the ionic liquids demonstrated enantiomeric recognition ability as evidenced by splitting of racemic Mosher 2 ̆ 7 s sodium salt signal using a liquid state (19) F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The L- and D-alanine tert butyl ester chloride resulted in solid salts with nitrate, lactate, and tetrafluoroborate anions. This illustrates the previously observed tunability of ionic liquid synthesis, resulting in ionic liquids of varying properties as a function of varying the anion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Silver-particle-incorporated {{polyurethane}} {{films were}} evaluated for antimicrobial activity towards two different bacteria: Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Distributed silver particles sourced from silver nitrate, <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> and preformed silver nanoparticles were mixed with polyurethane (PU) and variously characterized by field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FESEM), fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and contact angle measurement. Antibacterial activity against E. coli was confirmed for films loaded with 10 % (w/w) AgNO 3, 1 % and 10 % (w/w) Ag lactate and preformed Ag nanoparticles. All were active against S. aureus, but Ag nanoparticles loaded with PU had a minor effect. The apparent antibacterial performance of Ag lactate-loaded PU is better than other Ag ion-loaded films, revealed from the zone of inhibition study. The better performance of silver lactate-loaded PU was the likely result of a porous PU structure. FESEM and FTIR indicated direct interaction of silver with the PU backbone, and XRD patterns confirmed that face-centred cubic-type silver, representative of Ag metal, was present. Young’s modulus, tensile strength and the hardness of silver containing PU films were not adversely affected an...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of <b>silver</b> <b>lactate</b> (SL) -holloysite nanotube clay (HNTs) nano-filler embedded into the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix as an antibacterial separator. Three different nanocomposite membranes were fabricated via phase inversion technique aimed to enhance the permeation flux and fouling resistance with complete bacterial rejection. HNT has been modified by N-β-(aminoethyl) -É£-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane (AEAPTMS) aiming for immobilization of SL on the surface HNT during dope preparation. Salmonella and Enterobacter aerogenes (E. aerogenes) were considered as two types of bacteria {{to be removed from}} contaminated water in this experimental work. Nanocomposite membranes were characterized and analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle, molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) and tensile strength. Potential silver ion loss was assessed by measuring the silver content in the coagulation bath and in the UF permeate using inductive-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Moreover, antibacterial effect of the membrane was examined in terms of removal of microorganisms by filtration, Log Reduction Value (LRV) and thickness of inhibition zone. From the experimental results, the prepared nanocomposite membranes have shown more than 99 % bacterial rejection, LRV of more than 3 and broad inhibition zones in the agar plate. In particular, the nanocomposite membrane consisting M-HNTs/SL/PVDF showed significant improvement in permeation flux and flux declination among all the tested membranes. It was also found that modification of HNTs resulted in reduction of silver leaching by uniform distributing of SL, which contributed to significant inhibition for both types of growth bacteria within 24 h of incubation...|$|E
