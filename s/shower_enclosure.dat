50|$|The vacuum {{water system}} fed to a {{centrifugal}} separator, filter, and collection bag {{to allow the}} system to vacuum up the fluids. Waste water would be injected into a disposal bag which would in turn {{be put in the}} waste tank. The fabric material for the <b>shower</b> <b>enclosure</b> was fire-proof beta cloth. The fabric was wrapped around hoops of 109 cm diameter, the top hoop was connected to the ceiling. One of the suggestions was for the nozzle of the suction head to be more flexible, increasing its utitlity. The hose for the spray head connected {{at the top of the}} shower. The shower could be collapsed down to the ground when not in use.|$|E
50|$|On 10 August, Digital Spy {{published}} {{its first}} look at the new Celebrity Big Brother house for the new Channel 5 series in readiness for the first intake of celebrity housemates. It revealed a colourful, opulent look with a return to the luxury feel of the early Channel 4 series. It featured a bar, gym, sauna, an open-plan bathroom, the UK series' largest swimming pool thus far. In the celebrity series, the <b>shower</b> <b>enclosure</b> was screened off from public view but this was changed to a clear view for the main series. There was also a large outdoor area and a sophisticated range of designer furnishings and fittings. This made a radical contrast with the shift to an austere, claustrophobic house seen in the later Channel 4 series.|$|E

50|$|Twin-wall {{polycarbonate}} sheeting is {{used primarily}} {{as an alternative}} to glass. Weight, flexibility, and impact strength are all benefits of using polycarbonate as a glass substitute. Applications include those in which thermal insulation is necessary while still allowing light transmittance. Green houses, window replacements, <b>shower</b> <b>enclosures,</b> partitions, light covers, patio covers, carports, and windbreaks are all modern applications for twin-wall. Specifically in greenhouse construction, the flexibility, transparency, and insulative properties contribute to industrywide success in horticulture. Twin-wall polycarbonate is able to flex in the demanding conditions of four-season greenhouses and allows for consistent temperature management because of the insulative properties.|$|R
50|$|Shower {{curtains}} are curtains used in bathtubs with a <b>shower</b> or <b>shower</b> <b>enclosures.</b> They {{are usually}} made from vinyl, cloth or plastic. The shower curtain has two main purposes: to provide privacy {{and to prevent}} water from flooding or spraying outside the shower area. Shower curtains usually surround the bath inside the tub or shower area and are held up with railings or curtain rods high on the wall or ceiling. To accommodate {{the different types of}} bathtub shapes, railings can come in different sizes and are flexible in their design. Some people use two shower curtains: one that is inside the tub, which is mainly functional or decorative as well, and an outer shower curtain, which is purely decorative. The bottom portion of the inner curtain often comes with magnetic discs or suction cups which adhere to the bathtub itself.|$|R

5000|$|Heavy-gauge forming {{utilizes}} {{the same}} basic process as continuous thin-gauge sheet forming, typically draping the heated plastic sheet over a mold. Many heavy-gauge forming applications use vacuum only in the form process, although some use two halves of mating form tooling and include air pressure to help form. Aircraft windscreens and machine gun turret windows spurred the advance of heavy-gauge forming technology during World War II. Heavy-gauge parts are used as cosmetic surfaces on permanent structures such as kiosks, automobiles, trucks, medical equipment, material handling equipment, refrigerators, spas, and <b>shower</b> <b>enclosures,</b> and electrical and electronic equipment. Unlike most thin-gauge thermoformed parts, heavy-gauge parts are often hand-worked after forming for trimming to final shape or for additional drilling, cutting, or finishing, depending on the product. Heavy-gauge products typically are of a [...] "permanent" [...] end use nature, while thin-gauge parts are more often designed to be disposable or recyclable and are primarily used to package or contain a food item or product. Heavy-gauge thermoforming is typically used for production quantities of 250 to 3000 annually, with lower tooling costs and faster product development than competing plastic technologies like injection molding.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{collaborative}} project between Duscholux and UPC. Through it Duscholux, one {{pioneer in the}} manufacture <b>shower</b> <b>enclosures</b> in Spain with over 40 years of experience, aims to gain presence {{in the market and}} enhance sales and marketing sections. For that, we thought about development of applications that help to show the product and to generate customer's curiosity, and two games to try to help improving brand's image in the consumer. This project is based on our study of Duscholux's market, and about its products and services offered to this market. Once we knew the company's products and how other companies promote themselves we proceed to make a proposal with a set of applications that enhances image of the mark and expands the number of potential customers. Proposed applications are based on augmented reality on mobile devices with 3 D designs. Using this technology we can cause more impact on the consumer increasing his curiosity on Duscholux products. Along this report we introduce in the behaviour, history and current state of augmented reality on mobile devices. We describe the steps and requirements needed to get a development environment for augmented reality applications on Android OS. After explaining the development environment applied to this project will proceed to explain the steps taken and the changes undergone by the company accepted applications during development. Continues with possible future lines and improvements for this project. We end with the conclusions obtained throughout development of this project...|$|R
5000|$|P was {{severely}} injured {{when he fell}} through the glass door enclosing his tub in his apartment he was renting. It was not possible for P or his wife {{to determine if the}} glass was tempered or just ordinary glass. After the accident, the glass was found to be just ordinary glass. P sued Klein (D), his landlord, for the injuries. At trial, P introduced expert evidence about the custom and usage of tempered glass from 1956 to 1976. Since at least the early 1950s, a practice of using shatterproof glazing materials for bathroom enclosures had come into common use, so that by 1976 the glass door here no longer conformed to accepted safety standards. P also showed that over this period bulletins of nationally recognized safety and consumer organizations along with official Federal publications had joined in warning of the dangers that lurked when plain glass was utilized in [...] "hazardous locations", including [...] "bathtub enclosures". Over objection, the trial court also allowed in sections of New York's General Business Law, which, as of July 1, 1973, required, on pain of criminal sanctions, that only [...] "safety glazing material" [...] be used in all bathroom enclosures. D's managing agent admitted that, since at least 1965, it was customary for landlords who had occasion to install glass for <b>shower</b> <b>enclosures,</b> to replace the glass with [...] "some material such as plastic or safety glass". P was given the verdict by the jury. The appellate division reversed the decision awarding P damages; D was under no common law duty to replace the glass unless he had prior notice of the danger. P appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed and ordered a new trial.|$|R
2500|$|The {{underground}} travel of the waters, {{from the}} opposite shore of the lake (more than thirty years at [...] deep), explains its temperature of 46°. Many sources provide calcium, sulphated, silica-rich waters which are very slightly radioactive at 45° or cold, and finally with bicarbonatees. They, according to their origin and their temperature, are used either for showers or baths, in a swimming-pool, or to drink. These warm waters are especially indicated for degenerative rheumatism such as lumbar or cervical arthritis, osteoarthritis, sciatica, acute lumbago, recurrent arthritis of the hands, knee osteoarthritis, and for inflammatory rheumatism and spontylarthrite rheumatism. The use of sources is also beneficial for the algodystrophy, tendonitis, and phlebological problems (chronic venous insufficiency, suites and sequelae of thrombosis, lymphatic insufficiency, Raynaud's disease), on the other hand, these waters are contraindicated for the varicose ulcer, stroke or recent cardiac events. The cure techniques are the use of <b>showers,</b> individual <b>enclosure</b> (Berthollet), physiotherapy, mud application, underwater showers, and rehabilitation in a swimming pool. By their calming of the nervous system, the waters can cause euphoric relaxation.|$|R
