5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and <b>siderite</b> (FeCO3).

40|$|High {{resolution}} swath bathymetry and backscatter data, seismic CHIRP profiles, multibeam {{water column}} acoustic measurements and sediment {{samples were collected}} on a cold seep province in the southeastern Tyrrhenian Sea, at a water depth of 500 - 1000. m. The mud volcanoes, characterized by a high backscatter signature, are the site of gas venting at the seafloor that formed a 630 -m-high plume in the water column. The mud volcanoes feature a precipitation of iron-oxy-hydroxide crusts and pyritized and Sulfur burrows in the sub-surface and authigenic <b>siderites,</b> also cementing burrows, further down, showing a sharp transition from the oxic zone toward the sulfate-methanogenic zone. The mud flows are characterized by an intermediate backscatter seafloor and {{by the presence of}} gas in the sediment only 2. m below the seafloor. The mud flows consist of 1 -m-thick drapes of water-rich mud extending downslope from the mud volcanoes. They act as sealing layers that prevent large fluxes of gas venting at the seafloor (low venting) and favor oxic conditions close to the sediment-water interface and the abundant precipitation of post-oxic <b>siderites</b> a few meters below the seafloor. The mud diapirs are characterized by a low backscatter seafloor and large fields of pockmarks. In coincidence with the normal faults, organogenic carbonate crusts form at or very close to the seafloor and are associated with chemosymbiontic bivalves (lucinids). The youngest shells are AMS radiocarbon dated 640 - 440. BP, suggesting that the seepage activity may have been clogged by the carbonates, only very recently.

25|$|The ammonites {{that form}} ammolite {{inhabited}} a prehistoric, inland subtropical sea that bordered the Rocky Mountains—this area is {{known today as}} the Cretaceous or Western Interior Seaway.

The d 13 C values of DIC become heavier with increasing subbottom depth, and vary between - 9. 5 and + 21. 4 ‰ PDB. Enrichment of DIC in 13 C indicates active methane generation in anaerobic environments near the lake bottom.

The {{carbonate}} {{phase of}} impure sideritic oncretions from {{a sequence of}} argillaceous sediments from the Westphalian of Yorkshire has been analysed using an acid-dissolution technique and corrections allowing for the decomposition f non-carbonate minerals applied to obtain accurate compositional formulae.

A PRECISE method of analysis for the carbonate phase is a prerequisite to any geo-chemical study of carbonate-bearing sediments. Complete physical separation of fine-grained carbonate-clay mixtures is impracticable, and whilst partial extraction in heavy liquids is often possible this can lead to an unrepresentative composition if more than one carbonate phase is present. Acid extraction, on the other hand, is always subject o uncertainty in the contribution of cations derived from non-carbonate phases.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{emergence}} of Life on Earth it has been showed that in suitable environments, components typical of both extraterrestrial (iperstenic chondrites and <b>siderites)</b> and terrestrial minerals and rocks containing iron (magnetite and olivine), in spite of extreme sterilization procedures, may catalyze inorganic and organic reactions leading to self-assembly metallorganic entities having a complex and composite chemical structure able to perform several catalytic activities typical of modern biology. In light of evidence accumulated during several years on viable microorganisms - including bacteria, archaea and fungi - found in mineral-associated environments, such as different kind of sediments and rocks (among which evaporites) as well as deep drillings and space vacuum exposure experiments, the aim of this work is to present and discuss the results of past, recent and ongoing (molecular and catalytic) studies supporting the multiple root genesis hypothesis (MuRoGe) already proposed [4] in order to approach the problem of the origin of life. According to this hyphothesis, taking into account energetic, evolutionary, pre-biometabolic and environmental aspects, emergence of life on Earth accomplished through multiple origins, in different times, environments and selective contexts in which using terrestrial and extraterrestrial material cooperative/ competitive, synergistic, interactive processes, life may be appeared or will emerge and survived or will survive to possible ???mass extintion??? due to cosmic impacts...|$|R
25|$|The {{process that}} created the septaria that {{characterize}} septarian concretions remains unclear. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including the dehydration of clay-rich, gel-rich, or organic-rich cores; shrinkage of the concretion's center; expansion of gases produced by the decay of organic matter; or brittle fracturing or shrinkage of the concretion interior by either earthquakes or compaction (Pratt 2001; McBride et al. 2003). Septaria usually contain crystals, often calcite, that precipitated from circulating solutions. <b>Siderite</b> or pyrite coatings are also occasionally observed {{on the wall of}} the cavities present in the septaria, giving rise respectively to a panoply of bright reddish and golden colors.|$|E

They typically form when a mineral precipitates and cements sediment around a nucleus, which is often organic, such as a leaf, tooth, piece of shell or fossil. For this reason, fossil collectors commonly break open concretions {{in their search for}} fossil animal and plant specimens.

40|$|The bulk {{magnetic}} mineral {{record from}} Lake Ohrid, spanning the past 637  kyr, reflects large-scale shifts in hydrological conditions, and, superimposed, a strong signal of environmental conditions on glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales. A {{shift in the}} formation of early diagenetic ferrimagnetic iron sulfides to <b>siderites</b> is observed around 320  ka. This change is probably associated with variable availability of sulfide in the pore water. We propose that sulfate concentrations were significantly higher before [*]∼[*]  320  ka, due to either a higher sulfate flux or lower dilution of lake sulfate due to a smaller water volume. Diagenetic iron minerals appear more abundant during glacials, which are generally characterized by higher Fe / Ca ratios in the sediments. While in {{the lower part of the}} core the ferrimagnetic sulfide signal overprints the primary detrital magnetic signal, the upper part of the core is dominated by variable proportions of high- to low-coercivity iron oxides. Glacial sediments are characterized by high concentration of high-coercivity magnetic minerals (hematite, goethite), which relate to enhanced erosion of soils that had formed during preceding interglacials. Superimposed on the glacial-interglacial behavior are millennial-scale oscillations in the magnetic mineral composition that parallel variations in summer insolation. Like the processes on glacial-interglacial timescales, low summer insolation and a retreat in vegetation resulted in enhanced erosion of soil material. Our study highlights that rock-magnetic studies, in concert with geochemical and sedimentological investigations, provide a multi-level contribution to environmental reconstructions, since the magnetic properties can mirror both environmental conditions on land and intra-lake processes...|$|R
30|$|Mand-Raigarh {{coalfield}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} coalfields in the Mahanadi basin. The Geological Survey of India carried out initial study primarily on exploration. However, detailed petrographic and geochemical characters of the coals have not been done so far. This investigation is an attempt for petrographic and geochemical appraisal of the coals. Moreover, effort is also made for possible interpretation on development of coal facies. The results drawn from 30 composite coal samples suggest coals are rich in vitrinite, with collotelinite as the dominant maceral while liptinite macerals register low concentration. Dominant mineral assemblages found were clay minerals, pyrite was recorded as disseminated, framboidal and euhedral forms, carbonates recorded were mainly <b>siderites.</b> The vitrinite reflectance random (VRo) mean values range from 0.44  % to 0.56  %, and the rank of coal is suggested as high volatile ‘B’ to ‘A’ sub-bituminous in rank. The rock–eval pyrolysis reveal TOC content varying from 37  % to 68.83  %, while low hydrocarbon generating potential is evident from low S 2 and T max values. The Hydrogen Index (HI) versus Oxygen Index (OI) plot reveal that the samples belong to Kerogen type—II–III with input dominantly from terrestrial source, some samples also fall in Kerogen type—II domain indicating lacustrine input. Vitrinite reflectance result indicate that the samples are immature and approaching oil window, which is in agreement with data of the Rock–Eval parameters. The gelification index (GI) and tissue preservation index (TPI) indicate that the coal developed in a telematic set up with high tree density. The ground water index (GWI) and vegetation index (VI) demonstrate that the peat developed as an ombrogenous bog.|$|R

During the opening season the cave is frequented. In the last period, an increased amount of CO 2 has been detected in air of the Ochtinska aragonite cave. The cave environment is created by caverns - relicts after mouldered ankerites and <b>siderites</b> in surroundings of Palaeozoic slates, limestones and dolomites. The residual ochre loams were created by weathering of carbonates. Probably, these processes held up till now and this fact may also result in the liberation of CO 2. From the viewpoint of the enhanced CO 2 content, the earths and waters occurred in the cave were found as its possible source. An enhanced CO 2 content was also measured in old air-proof closed mine workings, with a possibility of rot processes of old organic mine working components. Probably, has the rich attendance of the cave during the season the highest influence on the enhanced CO 2 content. The measurements of CO 2 content have pointed to its different values in various periods. In the period without visits, the CO 2 content in the cave exceeds that in the external surrounding air by 3 - 4 times, i. e. 310  330 ppm. In the period of visits, it is 8  10 times.

All of these instruments detected CO 2 released during sample analysis at abundances of approx. 0. 1 to 5 wt% assuming a carbonate source. The {{source of the}} CO 2 can be constrained by evaluating {{the temperature of the}} gas release, a capability of both the TEGA and SAM instruments. The samples analyzed by SAM show {{that the majority of the}} CO 2 is released below 400 C, much lower than traditional carbonate decomposition temperatures which can be as low as 400 C for some <b>siderites,</b> with magnesites and calcites decomposing at even higher temperatures. In addition to mineralogy, decomposition temperature can depend on particle size (among other factors). If carbonates formed on Mars under low temperature and relative humidity conditions, the resulting small particle size (nanophase) carbonates could have low decomposition temperatures. We have found that calcite can be synthesized by exposing CaO to water vapor and CO 2 and that the resulting mineral has an EGA peak of approx. 550 C for CO 2, which is about 200 C lower than for other calcites. Work is ongoing to produce Fe and Mg-bearing carbonates using the same process. Current results suggest that nanophase calcium carbonates cannot explain the CO 2 released from martian samples. If the decomposition temperatures of Mg and Fe-bearing nanophase carbonates are not significantly lower than 400 C, other candidate sources include oxalates and carboxylated organic molecules. If present, the abundance of organic carbon in these samples could be greater than 0. 1 wt % (1000 s of ppm), a signficant departure from the paradigm of the organic-poor Mars based on Viking results...|$|R

The {{bulk of the}} formation comprises trough cross-bedded sandstones interpreted as braided river deposits. The rivers flowed from largely felsic igneous provenance areas in the west, toward {{the region of the}} present-day Bay of Fundy. Paleocurrents indicate a dominant northeast-directed drainage system, which deviated toward the southeast in the vicinity of Cape Maringouin, about a paleogeographic high related to the penecontemporaneous Harvey-Hopewell Fault.;Intercalated with the sand-dominated fluvial rocks, are fine-grained sandstones, ostracod-bearing limestones and coaly shales deposited in a variety of fluvio-lacustrine settings, including distributary channel, crevasse-splay, deltaic and open lacustrine environments. Rootlet horizons, pedogenic features and rills associated with many of the interbedded sandstones indicate that lake depths were probably shallow, and that lake levels fluctuated frequently.;Paleosols occur widely and formed in areas that were starved of sediment for appreciable periods of time. Paleosol geochemistry indicates a high Al content in all pedogenic materials, consistent with extensive in situ weathering. The abundance of calcrete nodules, suggests a semi-arid climate during the time of sedimentation. Calcrete morphologies include ferroan calcite, crystic plasmic ped material, siltstone aggregates, fragmentary nodules and Mn-rich spherulitic <b>siderites.</b> The paleosols are considered to represent ancient aridisols and vertisols.;At least 8 repetitions of sandstones and mudrocks are recognised through the formation, these defining megacycles as much as 170 m thick. Although faulting may account for the megacycles, it is considered more likely that eustasy was the principal cause for their development. Sandstones were largely deposited during periods of relative eustatic fall, whereas the mudrocks formed during transgressive or high stand periods. Observed stratal relationships are counter to existing published models for fluvial deposition in response to relative sea level change, and modifications are presented based on the Boss Point Formation.

Nowhere else in the world was an ore of this grade in commercial use. In the early months of 1939, a pilot process seemed to indicate success, but in order to be ascertained it would require full production. [...] Dunn carried the investment through to the end and a positive result was his reward. The next innovation which Dunn developed into production at Algoma was then known as the [...] "Sink-Float process". The need for innovation was due to the exhaustion of ore supplies at the Helen mine. [...] The process, which had been established at Broken Hill Proprietary by Guillaume Daniel Delprat {{at the turn of the}} century because of a similar exhaustion, had been tried once or twice in the US but on ore quite different from that at the Victoria. No Canadian mines had developed this technique; no large-scale equipment was available for experimentation and so the pilot plant would be uncertain and expensive. The gamble was a success, and Dunn pioneered again. The Victoria mine was able for a time from 1945 to supplant the Helen mine, while the latter changed from an open-pit to, in 1949, an underground operation.|$|E

30|$|Coal is {{the largest}} fossil fuel abundantly {{distributed}} {{in many parts of}} the world. The demand of energy and the depletion of high-quality coal, so more attention is focused on utilization of the low- grade coal. The low-grade coal has a serious deficiency to utilization because it associated with high mineral matter content and moisture content. The origin of Indian coal is heterogeneous in nature and consists of the complex mixture of organic (carbon) and inorganic (minerals) constituents (Georgakopoulos et al. 2003). The use of low-grade coal in large-scale unit leads to environmental pollution due to generation of the solid wastes and gaseous pollutants. It causes the increase cost of the power plants, reduce the efficiency and produces technical difficulties during processes and production steps (Meshram et al. 2015). It is necessary to demineralize and desulphurize such coal before using in thermal power station, steel plants, or cement industries, etc. The major minerals commonly found in coal are quartz and other forms of silica, clay mineral, pyrites and carbonates such as <b>siderites</b> and ankerites (Mukherjee and Borthakur 2001). The coal ash formed from mineral matter is both organic and inorganic in nature. High ash (>[*] 20 % weight) coal is rich with mineral content such as quartz, illite, calcite, pyrite, gypsum, and elements like H, N, S and oxygen. The high ash coal is always enriched with oxides of SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, and K 2 O (Ciu et al. 2015). The cleaning of coal can be achieved by both physical and chemical method (Gulen et al. 2005). The degree of demineralization of coal by various method mostly depends on the percentage and composition of mineral matter, their types, and association within the raw coal. The physical methods are based on the difference in their physical properties (specific gravity and surface properties) of the minerals and the carbonaceous part of the coal (Behera et al. 2017 a, b). The chemical method involve treatment with different chemical solvent are used for removing mineral matter, like the finely distributed mineral and those bound strongly to the coal matrix (Ma et al. 2014). The purpose of beneficiation of a low-grade coal is to reduce inert content for easy transportation, minimize abrasive materials and to improve the combustion qualities. The combustion properties of coal like heating value, volatile matter content that govern the performance of coal have a clear dependence on ash, maceral composition. Therefore, more emphasis is given for the cleaning method of coal so that it may minimize the mineral matter and improve the quality of coal. However, chemical cleaning processes are more expensive than physical cleaning steps in terms of total cost (Dash et al. 2015 a, b). The chemical beneficiation methods are include acid leaching, alkali leaching, acid leaching followed by alkali leaching or alkali leaching followed by acid leaching and leaching by molten caustic treatment. The coal cleaning by the chemical method is a simple process when it is operates under mild condition. Chemical leaching process usually achieved remove all types of minerals from the coal compared to physical treatment method. Although, chemical cleaning method has not been widely employed on a commercial scale due to huge cost related to the requirement of chemical and need for dewatering and regeneration of reagents from spent solution (Wu and Steel 2007; Waugh and Bowling 1984; Ryberg et al. 2015; Sriramoju et al. 2017).|$|R
2500|$|Banded-iron {{formations}} are iron formations which formed about 2,000 {{million years}} ago and were first described in the Lake Superior region. Sediments associated with the last stage of the Great Lakes tectonic zone contain banded-iron formations. These sediments were deposited for two hundred million years and extend intermittently along roughly the same trend as the Great Lakes tectonic zone, from Minnesota into eastern Ontario, Canada, and through upper Wisconsin and Michigan. They are characterized by bands of iron compounds and chert. Enough oxygen had accumulated in seawater so that dissolved iron was oxidized; iron reacts with oxygen to form compounds that precipitate out [...] including hematite, limonite and <b>siderite.</b> These iron compounds precipitated from the seawater in varying proportions with chert, producing banded-iron formations. These iron formations are abundant in the Lake Superior region. The Sudbury Impact event occurred 1,850 {{million years ago}}; it is theorized that this caused {{the end of the}} banded-iron deposits. The results of the impact affected concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the sea; the accumulation of banded-iron formations suddenly ended [...]|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War, {{the company}} {{benefited from the}} huge demand for steel by the military, however {{financial}} calls from his associates, who needed or wanted to liquidate positions {{as a result of}} the French collapse, bedeviled Dunn, who retained in the end his Algoma shares and nothing else. Even then, he mortgaged them to his stockbroker friends. The benefit from a subsidized price for sinter, granted at the corporate nadir of 1935 by the provincial government of Mitchell Hepburn, was cancelled in 1942 by the Conant government. [...] At times Dunn's relationship with the federal government minister in charge of the war effort, C. D. Howe was difficult; Beaverbrook relates a story in which he had to calm Winston Churchill because Howe or Mackenzie King, in the dark days of October 1940, had shredded Dunn's reputation. Howe threatened Dunn on 26 October 1940 with effective expropriation under the War Measures Act and the National Resources Mobilization Act: the government might obtain control of [...] "trading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture" [...] works, and require him [...] "to place , [...] services and [...] property at the disposal of His Majesty in right of Canada, as may be deemed necessary or expedient for securing the public safety, the defence of Canada, the maintenance of public order, or the efficient prosecution of the war, or for maintaining supplies or services essential to the life of the community." [...] A letter to Churchill from Beaverbrook, who at the time was in the former's Ministry, was enough to secure the person and property of Dunn, but his health suffered ill effects, as presently will be related. The week after Dunn had a major surgery, Howe struck again. This time, Howe telephoned on 12 April 1943 to Wilson at the Royal Bank: if Howe's steel experts (likely the same experts Dunn had wrongfooted in the <b>siderite</b> development) were right, either Dunn must stand down from his Chairmanship of Algoma, or he would be forced to expropriate. Many precedents had accumulated over three years, both in the UK and Canada. But Wilson and his Royal Bank stood firm and refused to countenance this extreme. Wilson instead asked for disclosure of the government file, and Howe's bluff was shot. [...] By August 1943, a vice-president at Algoma was removed and the way forward was clear.|$|E
