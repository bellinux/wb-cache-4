The tour was however marred by cancellations, {{mainly because of}} vocalist Gary Lightbody's throat problems and bassist Paul Wilson's shoulder injury. Additionally, other events happened with all other band members but no dates were affected. Drummer Jonny Quinn broke his arm, but no shows were cancelled as friend Graham Hopkins pitched in to take up drumming duties.

The Dodgers called up minor league pitcher Red Patterson to start the second game of the doubleheader. Solo homers by Scott Van Slyke and Drew Butera in the 12th inning led to a 4–3 win and a sweep of the inter-league series. The Dodgers {{traveled}} to Miami for a series against the Marlins at Marlins Park. The tired team fell behind 6–0 in the opener, staged a late rally but lost 6–3. On May 3, Dee Gordon had five hits and three steals and Carl Crawford hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning to give the Dodgers a 9–7 win.

A photo gallery was also included as well as backstage footage showing Gaga meeting with actress Liza Minnelli. According to Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com, the audio tracks were commendable for their crisp sound.

[...] Reviews for the production were mediocre, but Hepburn herself was praised and Coco was popular with the public—with its run twice extended. She later said Coco marked the first time she accepted that the public was not against her, but actually seemed to love her. Her work earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E

Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu said, [...] "My interest in Karnan (apart from the critic's mandate that I see everything) was primarily the songs", and noted that Sirkazhi Govindarajan's [...] "liquid diction and brass-throated conviction makes today's male singers sound like tentative little boys in a parent's day recital". Meera Srinivasan, another critic from The Hindu praised the film for the [...] "music score and songs by the inimitable Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy duo with Kannadasan's striking lyrics". Malathi Rangarajan said, [...] "The illustrious composing duo of Viswanathan and Ramamurthy has worked magic with music". M.

Another reviewer of the same publication called the song [...] "epic" [...] noting that Beyoncé [...] "unfurls the true range of her magnificent voice". Comparing the song to Andrew Lloyd Webber's [...] "piano weepie", a writer of The Observer stated that [...] "Listen" [...] is a [...] "bangers-to-ballads ratio to die for". Calling the song a [...] "showstopper", Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote: [...] " [...] is a big, soppy ballad that will move some to tears and irk others as a stunning example of art imitating life imitating art without a shred of irony." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "Listen" [...] will undoubtedly be [...] "the payoff for fans of Beyoncé's voice who <b>sat</b> <b>through</b> the first [...] minutes of [...] waiting for the cum shot." [...] By contrast, Jody Rosen's review for Entertainment Weekly was less impressed, describing [...] "Listen" [...] as [...] "gloopy" [...] and [...] "an inspirational ballad about 'the song in my heart', which builds to an enormous schlock-opera climax".|$|E

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had <b>sat</b> <b>through</b> the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{published}} {{a review of the}} show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card.

[...] He gave the bout 2 stars. [...] "That was an epic match", said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match. However, he felt the bout had a [...] "silly pin-and-count-'em stipulation" [...] and that the [...] "all-too-real neck injury angle, followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles's win." [...] Caldwell felt the match made Styles look [...] "like a star when he won, then he came across like a punk attacking Angle, then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out" [...] but that he had a [...] "memorable, star-making victory over Angle." [...] He disapproved of Styles being [...] "used a means to the end of explaining Sting's purpose-driven TNA life." [...] Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars. As for the Street Fight, {{he said it was a}} [...] "fun brawl for the audience" [...] and gave it 2 1/2 stars. Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had [...] "good heat" [...] that [...] "over-rode the stream of outside interference, referee incompetence, and overall over-booking" [...] and that it was [...] "refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match." [...] He gave the match 3 stars. The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars and he said it would have been [...] "great" [...] if it had avoided involving [...] "outside interference." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a hybrid method for {{deciding}} problems involving integer and Boolean variables {{which is based on}} generic SAT solving techniques augmented with a) a polynomial-time ILP solver for the special class of Unit-Two-Variable-Per-Inequality (unit TVPI or UTVPI) constraints and b) an independent solver for general integer linear constraints. In our approach, {{we present a}} novel method for encoding linear constraints into the <b>SAT</b> solver <b>through</b> binary “indicator” variables. The hybrid SAT problem is subsequently solved using a SAT search procedure in close collaboration with the UTVPI solver. The UTVPI solver interacts closely with the Boolean SAT solver by passing implications and conflicting assignments. The non-UTV-PI constraints are handled separately and participate in the learning scheme of the <b>SAT</b> solver <b>through</b> an innovative method based on the theory of cutting planes. Empirical evidence on software verification benchmarks is presented that demonstrates the advantages of ou...|$|R

2500|$|Upon {{taking control}} of the {{battered}} Eighth Army, one of Ridgway's first acts was to restore soldiers' confidence in themselves. To accomplish this, he reorganized the command structure. During one of his first briefings in Korea at I Corps, Ridgway <b>sat</b> <b>through</b> an extensive discussion of various defensive plans and contingencies. At the end, he asked the staff about the status of their attack plans; the corps G–3 (operations officer) responded that he had no such plans. Within days, I Corps had a new G-3. He also replaced officers who did not send out patrols to fix enemy locations, and removed [...] "enemy positions" [...] from commanders' planning maps if local units had not been in recent contact to verify that the enemy was still there. Ridgway established a plan to rotate out those division commanders who had been in action for six months and replace them with fresh leaders. He sent out guidance to commanders at all levels that they were to spend more time at the front lines and less in their command posts in the rear. These steps had an immediate impact on morale.|$|E
