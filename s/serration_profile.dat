Experiments are performed on a flat plate in an open jet wind tunnel. Grids are used to generate isotropic homogeneous turbulence. The leading edge serrations are in the form of sinusoidal profiles of wavelengths, λ, and amplitudes, 2 h. The frequency and amplitude characteristics are studied in detail {{in order to understand the}} effect of LE serrations on noise reduction characteristics and are compared with straight edge baseline flat plates. Noise reductions are found to be insignificant at low frequencies but significant in the mid frequency range (500 Hz– 8 kHz) for all the cases studied. The flat plate results are also compared to the noise reductions obtained on a serrated NACA- 65 aerofoil with the same <b>serration</b> <b>profile.</b> Noise reductions are found to be significantly higher for the flat plates with a maximum noise reduction of around 9 dB compared with about 7 dB for the aerofoil. In general, it is observed that the sound power reduction level (ΔPWL) is sensitive to the amplitude, 2 h of the LE serrations but less sensitive to the serration wavelength, λ. Thus, this paper sufficiently demonstrates that the LE amplitude acts as a key parameter for enhancing the noise reduction levels in flat plates and aerofoils...|$|E
40|$|Fan {{broadband}} {{is one of}} {{the dominant}} noise sources on an aircraft engine, particularly at approach. The dominant noise generation mechanism is due to turbulent- aerofoil interaction noise (TAI). This thesis investigates the effect of changes in 2 D aerofoil geometry on TAI noise. The main focus of this thesis is to attempt to reduce it through the development of innovative leading edge geometries. The ﬁrst two chapters of the thesis deals with an experimental and numerical investigation into the effect of aerofoil geometry on interaction noise on single aerofoils and on cascades. Consistent with previous work, they show that variations in aerofoil parameters, such as aerofoil thickness, leading edge nose radius and camber, produce only a small changes in broadband interaction noise at approach conditions. Subsequent chapters deal with the development of innovative leading edge <b>serration</b> <b>proﬁles</b> aimed at reducing interaction noise. Chapter 4 is a detailed study into the limitations of single-wavelength serrations in reducing interaction noise. The optimum proﬁle is identiﬁed. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 all deal with the development of innovative proﬁles that can provide up to 10 dB of additional noise reductions compared to single-wavelength serrations. For each of the proﬁles investigated a simple model is developed to aid the understanding of their interaction mechanism...|$|R

A key {{feature of the}} Hirth joint is that, unlike simple splines, the load-bearing faces of the joint are tapered. This allows the joint to be tightened {{so that there is}} no backlash by simply applying an axial load. This is done by either bolting the shafts together or by applying spring pressure from an external housing. This lack of backlash also reduces wear due to fretting.|$|R

For example, the teeth on a saw or other serrated blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to cut cloth with a serrated edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing {{the average length of}} a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show <b>serration</b> in <b>profile,</b> although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made with serrated edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The step clamp and step block assembly in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.|$|R
