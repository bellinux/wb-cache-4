5000|$|A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is {{a notice}} filed with an {{aviation}} authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or {{at a location}} that could affect {{the safety of the}} flight. [...] NOTAMs are unclassified notices or advisories distributed by means of telecommunication that contain information concerning the establishment, conditions or change in any aeronautical facility, <b>service,</b> <b>procedure</b> or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel and systems concerned with flight operations. NOTAMs are created and transmitted by government agencies and airport operators under guidelines specified by Annex 15: Aeronautical Information Services of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (CICA). The term NOTAM came into common use rather than the more formal Notice to Airmen following the ratification of the CICA, which came into effect on 4 April 1947. Notices to Airmen were normally published in a regular publication by each country's air authorities (e.g., in Flight Magazine in the UK). A number of developments and amendments to the CICA have resulted in the more automated system available today.|$|E
50|$|An {{outpatient}} (or out-patient) is {{a patient}} who is hospitalized for less than 24 hours. Even if the patient will not be formally admitted with a note as an outpatient, they are still registered, and the provider will usually give a note explaining {{the reason for the}} <b>service,</b> <b>procedure,</b> scan, or surgery, which should include the names and titles and IDs of the participating personnel, the patient's name and date of birth and ID and signature of informed consent, estimated pre- and post-service time for a history and exam (before and after), any anesthesia or medications needed, and estimated time of discharge absent any (further) complications. Treatment provided in this fashion is called ambulatory care. Sometimes surgery is performed without the need for a formal hospital admission or an overnight stay. This is called outpatient surgery. Outpatient surgery has many benefits, including reducing the amount of medication prescribed and using the physician's or surgeon's time more efficiently. More procedures are now being performed in a surgeon's office, termed office-based surgery, rather than in a hospital-based operating room. Outpatient surgery is suited best for healthy patients undergoing minor or intermediate procedures (limited urologic, ophthalmologic, or ear, nose, and throat procedures and procedures involving the extremities).|$|E

5000|$|Head alignment. This was {{an issue}} for two reasons: a) Azimuth {{misalignment}} results in reduced high frequencies, and b) Head height misalignment allows sounds from adjacent tracks to bleed over, an effect sometimes known as [...] "double-tracking". This {{is due to the}} resultant time delay between the left and right channels resulting in a degradation of phase correlation. This effect is enhanced in an 8-track system, as compared to either reel-to-reel or cassette, due to the larger physical distance, on the tape, between the left and right channel tracks. Resetting head height and azimuth is a primary <b>service</b> <b>procedure</b> required, when refurbishing any vintage tape deck. Once set the player will perform accurately. This format, unlike other tape formats, features a movable head with four positions. Among audio service technicians, {{there used to be a}} joke that [...] "the eight-track is the only audio device which knocks itself out of alignment four times during each album." [...] When tracking/azimuth is set using a high quality (ex: Columbia) or alignment tape, correct operation will be restored. Some brands of 8-track decks had adjustable tape head thumbwheel knobs on the front panel, so the listener could adjust the tracking, much like a VHS or Beta tape was adjusted for picture quality. The listener could then adjust the tape head individually for each tape, avoiding double tracking.|$|E

When the system is detected non-empty (upon monitoring), a <b>service</b> <b>procedure</b> is initiated — clearing the system off particles. Once the <b>service</b> <b>procedure</b> is concluded, the system’s evolution regenerates. Particles may represent customers or jobs in a queueing system, contaminants in a physical system, hazardous chemical or biological agents in an environmental system, standing buy/sell orders at a brokerage center, etc. This class of stochastic systems is modeled and analyzed. We (i) derive the joint transform of the time-to-first-detection {{and the number of}} particles present in the system at that epoch, and compute their statistics; (ii) define and calculate various path-functionals and performance measures of the system; and, (iii) study the issue of optimal monitoring schemes...|$|E
40|$|A {{queueing}} {{system with}} a single server providing n-phases of service in succession is considered. Every customer receives service in all phases. Arriving customers join a single ordinary queue, waiting to start the <b>service</b> <b>procedure.</b> When a customer completes his service in the ith phase he decides either to proceed to the next phase or to join the Ki retrial box (i= 1, 2, [...] .,n- 1), from where he repeats the demand for the (i+ 1) th phase of service after a random {{amount of time and}} independently to the other customers in the system. Every customer can join during his <b>service</b> <b>procedure</b> a number of retrial boxes before departs from the system. When at the moment that a customer, either departs from the system or joins a retrial box and so releases the server, there are no other customers waiting in the ordinary queue, then the server departs for a single vacation of an arbitrarily distributed length. The arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and all service times are arbitrarily distributed. For such a system, the mean number of customers in the ordinary queue and in each retrial box separately are obtained, and used to investigate numerically system performance.
