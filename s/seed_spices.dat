40|$|Abstract: To {{assess the}} {{economic}} impact of watershed development programmes in a traditional semi arid subtropical rainfed agro ecosystem of Bhilwara district in Rajasthan, 40 farmers each in watershed and Non- watershed areas were interviewed five years after the watershed works were completed. Balesariya watershed development programme increased ground water availability by 1. 5 m to 1. 8 m above the previous water level. Horticultural crops including <b>seed</b> <b>spices</b> like cumin, coriander and chilli (dry) and vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower and tomato and perennial tree fruit like aonla were compared for their performance along with traditional dryland crops like mustard, taramira, chickpea (gram), green gram, black gram, horse gram and sorghum + red gram (3 : 1 ratio) under watershed and non watershed conditions for their yields and economic returns. Crop yields and net profits increased in all the commodities when they were raised in a watershed. Inclusion of horticultural crops in the system yielded more returns than traditional crops in a watershed area on a sustainable basis.

40|$|Cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) is an industrially {{important}} <b>seed</b> <b>spices</b> crop {{of family}} Apiaceae. Because of its diverse usage {{in food and}} pharma industries, {{it is essential to}} document and characterize the cumin genotypes to assess genetic diversity which is prerequisite for its genetic improvement. With this aim, a set of 10 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers were deployed to examine the genetic diversity among 16 cumin genotypes including five released varieties. Out of 65 amplified bands, a total of 60 polymorphic bands were detected which demonstrated with polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0. 34 with a range from 0. 14 to 0. 51. The bands size ranged from 120 to 500 bp. The distinctive value of MI (marker index) for studied markers was 2. 43 while average resolving power for all markers was 8. 49. The UPGMA based grouping showed three distinct clusters at a cut-off value of 0. 62. In the present study, the average Jaccard similarity coefficient was 0. 59 which indicated a moderate level of genetic diversity in studied cumin genotypes. The result of current investigation suggested that there is need to increase the genetic base of cumin germplasm using different breeding approach viz mutagenesis, germplasm introduction, wide hybridization or somaclonal variation.

40|$|Abstract: A spice is a dried seed, fruit, root, bark or {{vegetative}} material used in nutritionally insignificant amount as a {{food supplement}} for the reason of flavoring. Spices are defined as "a strongly flavored or aromatic substance of vegetable origin, obtained from tropical plants, commonly used as a condiment". In ancient times, spices were as valuable as metal gold; and as noteworthy as medicines and perfumes. No {{country in the world}} cultivates as a lot of kinds of spices as India with quality spices come from Kerala, an Indian state. Because of the varying climates in India-from tropical to sub-tropical, temperate-almost all spices are grown in this country. In almost all of the 28 states and seven union territories of India, at least one spice is grown in profusion. Spices and herbs are good not only for our taste buds but also for our health. They supply calcium, iron, vitamin B, vitamin C, carotene and other antioxidants. Besides herbs and spices have very low fat, so you can eat them to your hearts pleased.

A field experiment was conducted at CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar to study the effect of foliage cuttings on seed yield and quality of Coriander. The Research material comprised of four genotypes viz. DH- 5, DH- 36, DH- 228 and DH- 246 was grown with three replications in factorial RBD. The foliage cutting was taken to make different treatments i. e. C 0 (without cutting), C 1 (one cutting at 45 days after sowing) and C 2 (two cuttings at 45 days and 60 days after sowing). The investigation resulted that number of foliage cuttings reduced the plant growth, seed yield and quality of coriander. The crop without cutting of foliage gave the maximum plant growth along with highest seed yield which was followed by one cutting and lowest performance was observed after two cuttings. The increase in number of foliage cuttings of coriander significantly reduced the growth parameters of plant such as plant height, number of branches per plant, number of umbels per plant, number of seeds per umbel, number of seeds per umbellate, foliage and seed yield. The increase in number of foliage cutting also influenced the seed quality of coriander seed. The best quality seed with highest value of seed quality parameters such as test weight, standard germination, seedling length, seedling dry weight, vigour index-I, vigour index-II, field emergence index and seedling establishment, seed was harvested from without foliage cutting followed by one cutting at 45 days and two cuttings at 45 and 60 days after sowing. The genotype Hisar Anand (DH- 5) was found best seed producing genotype. Whereas, Hisar Bhoomit (DH- 228) was found best genotype both for foliage yield and seed yield...|$|E
