5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several methods in {{treating}} patients who display Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome. However, which method <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the most is within argument. Patients with intracranial lesions have been treated with surgical intervention and in some cases, this procedure has been successful. Other treatments include embolization, radiation therapy, and continued observation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{studies show}} no {{benefit from the}} {{addition}} of chemotherapy. However, a large clinical trial of 575 participants randomized to standard radiation versus radiation plus temozolomide chemotherapy showed that the group receiving temozolomide survived a median of 14.6 months as opposed to 12.1 months for the group receiving radiation alone. This treatment regime is now standard for most cases of glioblastoma where the person is not enrolled in a clinical trial. Temozolomide <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> by sensitizing the tumor cells to radiation.|$|E
25|$|Motivations {{direct and}} {{energize}} behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative. In the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began {{a line of}} research which suggests that many emotions are universal. He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust. Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the EEA. For example, spite <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.|$|E

25|$|Some {{authorities}} also {{equate the}} town named Menapia (or Manapia) as Wexford town – others place it further {{north along the}} east coast, roughly near Wicklow town. A river called the Modonnu(s), whose estuary is near Menapia, is often {{said to be the}} Slaney – others think it is the Avoka river. It is because the Slaney is the only major river in the south-east that many as a result think that it is the Modonnu(s) river, thereby making Menapia equal to Wexford town (this theory only <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> if Hook Head is made the Sacred Cape). Most authorities seem to agree that Menapia is not Wexford, but is a town located further north along the coast. However, this is not certain.|$|E
500|$|The {{project had}} a mixed {{response}} from public officials. Margarita López, {{a former member}} of New York City Council, endorsed the program and helped it to win public funding. Subsequently, she received nearly $115,000 in campaign contributions from Scientologists. Another councillor, Joseph Addabbo, Jr., also supported the project, telling reporters, [...] "The project <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> I've seen it firsthand."

Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated over {{a lot of things}} and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Lori has {{a lot of things going}} on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again.

500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's storyline, themes, graphics, and {{artificial}} intelligence were praised by critics. A reviewer from Game Informer stated {{that despite the}} game did not [...] "hold back" [...] the decadent experience from being an [...] "unhinged flaming rollercoaster ride". A reviewer from the Official Xbox Magazine concluded stated that the game was an accomplished shooter [...] "on the whole", and a fittingly [...] "thunderous" [...] send-off for Resident Evil, while also praising the length and variety of the game. GameTrailers noted the shift away from the style and tone of past games in the series, yet still praised the overall direction, stating that despite the [...] "old identity stripped away", the game presented itself as a [...] "massive" [...] action game. Richard George of IGN was favourable toward the technical and artistic design of the game, stating that the game was among Capcom’s greatest successes with an [...] "incredibly strong" [...] world, lighting, and creature designs. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN also noted the new enemies as [...] "some of the best" [...] designs and concepts {{in the history of}} the franchise. Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar praised the improvements to the controls over its predecessor, stating that the game had an emphasis placed on fluidity and movement, although noted that the cover system [...] "never <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> right". The Escapist also praised the improved AI companion that [...] "does a decent job of backing you up and taking the fight to the enemy rather than just standing by", however also disliked the cover system, calling it [...] "the most forgettable new feature of the game".|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} two men {{watching}} a rush in the screening rooms of a Hollywood studio. On the screen, an actress played by Madonna sings and dances to [...] "Material Girl", dressed like Monroe from [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". One of the men, played by Carradine, is a director or a producer and is immensely rich. He {{falls in love with}} the actress and wants to express his passion for her. He tells his employee, played by Wuhl: [...] "She's [...] fantastic. She could become a star." [...] The employee answered: [...] "She could be. She could be great. She could be a major star." [...] The former then concludes by saying: [...] "She is a star, George." [...] Madonna is in a pink strapless gown and has her hair in blond locks ala Monroe. The background is a reconstruction of the Monroe video, complete with staircase, chandeliers and a number of tuxedo clad chorus boys. Madonna dances and sings the song, while she is showered with cash, expensive jewellery, furs and is carried by the men over the stairs. At one time, she alludes herself from the men, by dismissing them with her fan. As the producer tries to impress Madonna, he comes to know that she does not like material things, but rather prefers simple romance. He pretends to be penniless, and brings her hand-cut flowers while paying a poor man a large amount to borrow (or possibly buy) his dirty truck to take her on a date. His plan <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> because the final scene shows him and Madonna kissing in the truck in an intimate position.|$|E

500|$|In Le Guin's fictional universe, to {{know the}} true name of an object or a person is to have power over it. Each child is given a true name when they reach puberty, a name which they share only with close friends. Several of the dragons in the later Earthsea novels, like Orm Embar and Kalessin, are shown as living openly with their names, which do not give anybody power over them. In A Wizard of Earthsea, however, Ged is shown to have power over Yevaud. Cadden writes that this is because Yevaud still has {{attachment}} to riches and material possessions, and is thus bound {{by the power of}} his name. Wizards exert their influence over the equilibrium through the use of names, thus linking this theme to Le Guin's depiction of a cosmic balance. According to Cummins, this is Le Guin's way of demonstrating the power of language in shaping reality. Since language is the tool we use for communicating about the environment, she argues that it also allows humans to affect the environment, and the wizards' power to use names symbolizes this. Cummins went on to draw an analogy between the a wizard's use of names to change things with the creative use of words in fictional writing. Shippey wrote that Earthsea magic <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> through what he called the [...] "Rumpelstiltskin theory", in which names have power. He argued that this portrayal was part of Le Guin's effort to emphasize the power of words over objects, which, according to Shippey, was in contrast to the ideology of other fantasy writers, such as James Frazer in The Golden Bough. Esmonde argued that each of the first three Earthsea books hinged on an act of trust. In A Wizard of Earthsea, Vetch trusts Ged with his true name when the latter is at his lowest ebb emotionally, thus giving Ged complete power over himself. Ged later offers Tenar the same gift in The Tombs of Atuan, thereby allowing her to learn trust.|$|E
