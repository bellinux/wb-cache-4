50|$|The PDP-11 was {{designed}} for ease of manufacture by <b>semiskilled</b> <b>labor.</b> The dimensions of its pieces were relatively non-critical. It used a wire-wrapped backplane. That is, the printed circuit boards plugged into a backplane connector. The backplane connectors had square pins that could be connected to by wrapping wires around them. The corners of the pins would bite into the wire to form a gas-tight (i.e. corrosion-proof, therefore reliable) connection.|$|E
50|$|Thirdly, also in 1830, Richard Roberts {{patented}} {{the first}} self-acting mule. Stalybridge mule spinners strike was in 1824; this stimulated {{research into the}} problem of applying power to the winding stroke of the mule. The draw while spinning had been assisted by power, but the push of the wind had been done manually by the spinner, the mule could be operated by <b>semiskilled</b> <b>labor.</b> Before 1830, the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles; after, self-acting mules with up to 1300 spindles could be built.|$|E
30|$|According to Porter (1990), the {{domestic}} Factor Conditions include both basic and advanced factors. Basic factors refer to natural resources, climate conditions, location, unskilled labor, and <b>semiskilled</b> <b>labor</b> that are inherited and require little investment to be utilized {{in the production}} process. Advanced factors such as highly skilled workers, highly educated personnel, and Research & Development (R&D), on the other hand, are created and upgraded through reinvestment and innovation.|$|E
50|$|Between {{fiscal year}} 1964 and FY 1978, Iran’s gross {{national}} product grew {{at an annual rate}} of 13.2 percent at constant prices. The oil, gas, and construction industries expanded by almost 500 percent during this period, while the share of value-added manufacturing increased by 4 percent. Women’s participation in the labor force in urban areas increased. Large numbers of urban Iranian women, from varying social strata, joined the <b>semiskilled</b> and skilled <b>labor</b> forces. In addition, the number of women enrolling in higher education increased from 5,000 in FY 1967 to more than 74,000 in FY 1978.|$|R
40|$|Construction {{industry}} is labor-intensive based {{and in the}} demand of unskilled, <b>semiskilled</b> and skilled <b>labors.</b> Presently, the nation is relying mainly on foreign labor as they are inexpensive, easier to recruit, hardworking and willing to work extra hours. Poor participation of the local labors due to unattractive salary scale and working environment (3 D’s - Dirty, Difficult and Dangerous) have encourage the employment of foreign labours [...] The statistics shows that many graduates from Akademi Binaan Malaysia (ABM), whom trained to work at site failed {{to return to their}} intended work place. As a result the foreign labors are preferable and Malaysia has been both a laborimporting and labor-exporting country. This research aims at investigating skills acquisition and skill drain in the construction industry in Malaysia. The objectives of the research include to study employment issues in construction industry in Malaysia, to analyze the history and current employment of the selected foreign construction workers, to analyze the skills gained during the employment period of the selected foreign construction workers and to develop a sample of employment profile for foreign workers based on respondents’ feedbacks. A survey on 300 foreign labor using structured questionnaire and informal interview carried out to gather information related to the research. The research shows that most of the respondents are Indonesian and they are unskilled when arrived in Malaysia. Most of the respondents have worked in at least in 1 to 3 projects. The analysis shows the longer these foreign labors stays in the country, the better skills they will acquire due to the exposure on projects they involved; subsequently they will earn higher income hence limiting the opportunities for the local to participate in the industry. The research also reveals that no formal training from employers and skills were gained through hands-on experience and practices at site and learning the skills through their head of group (Kepala). These skills accumulated proportionately with their years of service in the country. Once their employment contract or working permit is expired, they will bring along these skills or knowledge hence create the skill drain in the industry. Construction industry in Malaysia has become a training ground for these foreign labors. An Employment Profile developed for Foreign Workers Based on Respondents’ Feedbacks. The profile shows that both increment and decrement of the number of respondents vs. years of service. In the Increment line where skills have developed and respondents became skilled after several years working in the country. The decrement line of 5 year and above indicate that they will either leave the country (working permit expire) and to seek better opportunities or develop into different trades or works. Although there have been less concern over the skill drain, the research proposes that strategic plan and control measures need to be taken because skill drain issues will give an impact to the industry and country. This can be done by empowering the existing training centers, offering a better or competitive salary scale and benefits to the locals. This will consequently improve the image of the industry by promoting better working conditions to the youth. The efforts will promote better working environment and hopefully the {{industry is}} able to attract local workforce especially the ILP, GIATMARA and ABM graduates to join the construction workforc...|$|R
40|$|More {{than once}} the American black {{man has been}} said to {{constitute}} a &dquo;nation within a nation. &dquo; The May 1957 issue of Premium Practice adopted this theme to highlight differences {{between black and white}} consumers and to explore the marketing significance of these differences. It is argued that social and economic discrimination have resulted in blacks having patterns of market behavior different from that of whites with equal incomes. Some writers argue that the differences persist even after adjust-ments have been made for differences in assets, occupation, and family responsibilities. EMPLOYMENT The history of black employment in the United States is one of limited job opportunities and low pay. Even govern-ment agencies have been guilty of systematic job discrimi-nation and of fostering segregation of black and white workers. Historically, black employment has been concentrated in the service, unskilled, and <b>semiskilled</b> <b>labor</b> categories...|$|E
40|$|This data study {{includes}} disaggregated {{social accounting}} matrix (SAM) for the Egyptian economy for year 2010 / 11. This new SAM {{builds on the}} previous SAM 2010 / 11 built and published by Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) {{with the support of}} the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). This SAM was constructed with a special focus on the agriculture sector and on income distribution amongst households. It is composed of 52 activity sectors, 49 commodity sectors, three types of factors of production: labor (unskilled labor, <b>semiskilled</b> <b>labor,</b> and skilled labor), land, and capital; a government account, as well as, enterprises, households, savings and investment, and the rest of the world (ROW). The household sector is divided spatially into urban and rural households, with each disaggregated into 10 deciles according to expenditure. The disaggregated SAM allows for analyzing agricultural issues at the detailed crop level and to better understand the potential impacts of policy changes for both better off and more vulnerable households.

40|$|The {{populations of}} major cities in Australia are {{increasing}} rapidly and facing an acute housing shortage. Traditional apartment procurement techniques involve lengthy lead times, and therefore, factory-based, or off site-constructed (OSC), multistory apartment buildings may offer {{the opportunity to}} help fulﬁll the need by signiﬁcantly reducing build times and potentially offer good economic value. Other advantages of OSC may include superior quality, low weight ratios, economies of scale achieved through repetition of prefabricated units, use on inﬁll sites, sustainable design standards, and better occupational health and safety. There are also positive labor and training implications, which may help to alleviate an industrywide shortage of skills through use of <b>semiskilled</b> <b>labor.</b> Previous uncertainties about the adoption of OSC {{because of the high}} capital costs and perception issues were generally based on precast concrete structures, which are a quite different building type in terms of ﬂexibility, construction methodology, ﬁnishes, and delivery. Identiﬁcation of drivers and constraints assists in the determination of current industry status allows for a benchmark to be established and future opportunities and directions for OSC to be determined. This paper, {{with the help of a}} case study of a residential building built recently in the central business district of Melbourne, will discuss the drivers and constraints of OSC and offer solutions to existing issues relative to the traditional construction development and procurement processes through OSC...|$|E
