The <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played {{a large role}} in the {{transformation}} of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe. Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics {{into a coherent}} structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E

5|$|Just {{over one}} gram of {{berkelium}} has been {{produced in the}} United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element tennessine {{for the first time}} in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heaviest elements on the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle. After the general engagement {{had been in}} progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched {{a hole in the}} Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E

5|$|The modern <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s and 1940s, {{in which}} the genetic {{mechanisms}} of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good.

Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the methodological naturalism of the sciences.|$|E

Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.|$|E
