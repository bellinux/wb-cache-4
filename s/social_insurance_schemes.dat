40|$|The {{introduction}} of mandatory health insurance {{in developing countries}} is often questioned because of the difficulties in enrolling self-employed workers, who represent {{a segment of the}} labor force that is increasing in size. Partial population coverage, coupled with adverse selection effects, raises serious concerns about the financial viability of <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Despite these difficulties, an increasing number of developing countries have implemented <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> with the aim of attaining universal health coverage and improving access to health services. In Colombia, major health sector reform was launched in 1993 with the extension of mandatory <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> as its cornerstone.

We identify several factors that may explain the change in these enrollment patterns, and we discuss measures to combat adverse selection. Health Care...|$|R

50|$|In the {{national}} accounts, {{in accordance with}} the System of National Accounts, wages and salaries are the sum of remuneration paid to employees, including the values of any social contributions, income taxes, etc., payable to employees. For administrative convenience, or due to a legal requirement or some other reason all or a part of such payments may actually be withheld by the employer and paid directly to tax authorities, etc., on behalf of the employee. However, labour-related expenses of a business, such as payroll taxes, pension fund contributions, <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> workers compensation insurance, etc., are not counted as wages and salaries for national accounts purposes. Similar concepts apply to general accounting treatment of labour expenses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> are {{contributory}} {{programs that}} protect beneficiaries from catastrophic expenses {{in exchange for}} regular payments of premiums. Health costs can be very high, so health insurance schemes are a popular way reducing risk {{in the event of}} shock. However, an individual with low income {{may not be able to}} afford insurance. Some argue that insurance schemes should be complemented with social assistance. Community-based health insurance allows pooling in settings where institutional capacity is too weak to organize nationwide risk-pooling, especially in low-income countries, making insurance more affordable. In risk-sharing schemes, the insurance premium is unrelated to the likelihood that the beneficiary will fall ill and benefits are provided on the basis of need.|$|E
50|$|Many {{forms of}} <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> control their costs {{by using the}} {{bargaining}} power of their community they represent to control costs {{in the health care}} delivery system.

Social schemes sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a scheme to deliver universal health care, {{which may or may not}} also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the more wealthy pay proportionately more into the scheme to cover the needs of the relatively poor who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).|$|E

50|$|The ideal Social-Democratic {{welfare state}} {{is based on}} the {{principle}} of universalism granting access to benefits and services based on citizenship. Such a welfare state is said to provide a relatively high degree of autonomy, limiting the reliance of family and market (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011). In this context, social policies are perceived as 'politics against the market' (Esping-Andersen 1985).

Official government reports monitoring health expenditure showed that over the years the share of government health budget allocation as a total government budget during the PASDEP period has shown some sign of improvement. For example, health budget allocation as a proportion of received regional public block grant from federal government accounted for 10.1% in 2008/09. However, health care funding still remain a continued challenge for the health care system of Ethiopia prompting to an inward and outward looking for the mobilization of additional health resources such as community and <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> enhancing in the user fees revenues and increased mobilization of funding from external sources-global and health development partners.

Yet, there is Lack of appropriate health service delivery package to address the health care needs of the communities in the Pastoralist regions. This has prompted to establish two core objectives under HSDP-II regarding the Pastoralist health services and systems. These were to establish an appropriate health service delivery for the pastoralist population and to increase coverage and utilization of health services in pastoralist population. In this regard, a concept paper, [...] "Health Service Delivery to Pastoralists", was developed by FMOH and the 16 HEP packages were tailored to pastoralists needs and have been translated into local languages. In addition, as part of government’s effort to give technical assistance to the emerging regions, a board composed of members form six ministries was established under the Ministry of Federal Affairs including a technical committee for the integration of support to the Newly Emerging Regions.|$|E

40|$|A {{question}} {{of great interest}} to China watchers is whether or not central mandates are successfully implemented, and how. The issues surrounding this question {{are at the heart of}} the analysis in this thesis about China's attempts to institute <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in rural areas from 1949 to 2007. The thesis looks at central government attempts to institute <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> between 1949 and 2007 and tries to explain the significant variation in enrolment in <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> across this experience. The study shows that implementation of <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in rural China, measured in terms of their widespread uptake, succeeded on two occasions. There also have been a number of failures and collapses of <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in rural China. To explain the variation, the thesis first constructs a framework of how rank and authority of decrees work in the Chinese Communist Party. This framework allows an evaluation of how implementation decrees are transmitted down from the centre to local areas (who implement policy). The thesis argues that the issuing of a central decree holding the local Party secretary to account for high enrolment is the necessary and sufficient condition for the central government to ensure high enrolment in <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> The issuing of a central decree is shown only to be a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition. And the holding of the local Party secretary to account must occur through the Party governance system rather than through the health governance system. The thesis shows that the rise, fall, failure to rise, and then unexpected rise of <b>social</b> health <b>insurance</b> can be explained by the systems of coordination and control used to hold the local Party secretary responsible for ensuring high levels of enrolment in health insurance. It shows that only the local Party secretary can mobilise the local state sufficiently to meet central decree. And only certain central decrees can motivate the local Party secretary sufficiently to mobilise the local state. The thesis concludes by applying this framework to broader questions of health system reform in modern-day China. It draws tentative conclusions as to how wider health system reform can be understood through the thesis' analytical framework and suggests testing this framework in other policy contexts. </p...|$|R
