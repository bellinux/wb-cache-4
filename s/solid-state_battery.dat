2500|$|On 28 February 2017, The University of Texas at Austin {{issued a}} press release about {{a new type of}} <b>solid-state</b> <b>battery,</b> {{developed}} by a team led by Lithium-ion (Li-Ion) inventor John Goodenough, [...] "that could lead to safer, faster-charging, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries for handheld mobile devices, electric cars and stationary energy storage".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2017 Dyson {{announced}} plans to produce an electric vehicle, aiming to be launched in 2020, investing £2bn of his own money. [...] He has assembled a team of more than 400 people for the project while still seeking more recruits. The vehicle will reportedly be powered by a <b>solid-state</b> <b>battery,</b> possibly provided by Sakti3.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the microfabrica-tion and materials characterization of thin-film <b>solid-state</b> rechargeable lithium <b>batteries.</b> Film <b>solid-state</b> <b>batteries</b> are ideal power sources for stand-alone microsystems where a high-level of integration is required. <b>Solid-state</b> thin-film <b>batteries</b> are intrin-sically safe, {{have a larger}} life cycle, a faster charge/discharge cycling and a bigger capacity by cm 3 then the conventional ones. The fabrication materials used are LiCoO 2, LIPON and metal li-thium in cathode, electrolyte and anode respectively. The LiCoO 2 and LIPON films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique and the metal lithium by thermal-evaporation technique...|$|R
50|$|While no <b>solid-state</b> <b>batteries</b> {{have reached}} the market, {{multiple}} groups are researching this alternative. The notion is that solid-state designs are safer because they prevent dendrites from causing short circuits. They may have other benefits ranging from lower temperature operation to increased energy density.|$|R
2500|$|Independent {{reviews of}} the {{technology}} discuss the risk of fire and explosion from Lithium-ion batteries under certain conditions because they use liquid electrolytes. The newly developed battery should be safer since it uses glass electrolytes, that should eliminate short circuits. The <b>solid-state</b> <b>battery</b> is also said to have [...] "three times the energy density" [...] increasing its useful life in electric vehicles, for example. It should also be more ecologically sound since the technology uses less expensive, earth-friendly materials such as sodium extracted from seawater. They also have much longer life; ("the cells have demonstrated more than 1,200 cycles with low cell resistance"). The research and prototypes {{are not expected to}} lead to a commercially viable product in the near future, if ever, according to Chris Robinson of LUX Research. [...] "This will have no tangible effect on electric vehicle adoption in the next 15 years, if it does at all. A key hurdle that many solid-state electrolytes face is lack of a scalable and cost-effective manufacturing process," [...] he told The American Energy News in an e-mail.|$|E
50|$|Toyota Motors Corporation {{is trying}} to replace the current lithium ion battery with <b>solid-state</b> <b>battery</b> {{technology}} by 2020. The <b>solid-state</b> <b>battery</b> replaces the liquid electrolyte with a solid electrolyte.|$|E
50|$|A <b>solid-state</b> <b>battery</b> {{design is}} {{attractive}} for its safety, eliminating {{the chance of}} ignition from rupture. Current solid-state Li-air batteries use a lithium anode, a ceramic, glass, or glass-ceramic electrolyte, and a porous carbon cathode. The anode and cathode are typically separated from the electrolyte by polymer-ceramic composites that enhance charge transfer at the anode, and electrochemically couple the cathode to the electrolyte. The polymer-ceramic composites reduce overall impedance. The main drawback of the <b>solid-state</b> <b>battery</b> design is the low conductivity of most glass-ceramic electrolytes. The ionic conductivity of current lithium fast ion conductors is still lower than liquid electrolyte alternatives.|$|E
40|$|All <b>solid-state</b> Li-ion <b>batteries</b> offer {{unprecedented}} {{improvements in}} energy density and safety compared to contemporary Li-ion batteries. As {{one of the}} most common oxide cathode materials for traditional Li-ion batteries, LiCoO 2 (LCO) is also under consideration for use in all <b>solid-state</b> <b>batteries.</b> However, differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between LCO and the solid electrolyte during composite electrode fabrication, and the differential expansion and contraction during electrochemical cycling resulting from Li insertion and de-insertion, will cause stresses resulting in battery capacity fade. To characterize the thermo-mechanical properties, this study utilized hot pressing to prepare high relative density (95 %) LCO polycrystalline pellets. The elastic modulus (E), shear modulus (G), hardness (H), and Poisson’s ratio (υ) of LCO were determined to be ∼ 191  GPa, ∼ 80  GPa, ∼ 8. 2  GPa (at peak indentation loads ≤ 5  mN), and 0. 24, respectively. The CTE was determined to be ∼ 1. 3  ×  10 − 5 /°C over the temperature range 50 – 400  °C. We believe these data are important to predict or increase the cycle life of commercially available LCO as a cathode material for state-of-the-art Li-ion and advanced <b>solid-state</b> <b>batteries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Batteries {{belong to}} the most {{efficient}} storage media for electrical energy. Among the battery types commonly used today, lithium batteries have the highest energy density with regard to weight {{as well as with}} regard to volume. Up to now, they are mainly used for small-scale applications like cell phones, but future use may also include lithium batteries in electric cars or for large-scale storage of renewable wind and solar energy. Major problems arise from the liquid organic electrolyte of today’s lithium batteries, which is corrosive, sensitive to air and water, and particularly highly flammable. A scale-up of the battery size also amplifies the risk of accidental over-heating and subsequent explosion. <b>Solid-state</b> <b>batteries</b> circumvent the problems of organic electrolytes by using inorganic lithium ion conductors as electrolytes. In the oxide class of lithium ion conductive materials Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZ) has the highest reported Li ion conductivity. Especially their inherent safety, easy handling and compatibility with metallic Lithium make them most promising candidates for <b>solid-state</b> <b>batteries.</b> Since LLZ exhibits considerably lower ion conductivity than liquid electrolytes, a thin-film electrolyte approach was chosen to reduce the overall ohmic resistance of the electrolyte. Focal points of this work are manufacturing of <b>solid-state</b> <b>batteries</b> by means of thin-film technologies that are qualified for large-scale production, analysis of the composition and phases of the electrochemically active layers of the battery, and electrochemical performance analyses of the materials used...|$|R

40|$|An all <b>solid-state</b> {{lithium-ion}} <b>battery</b> {{with high}} energy density and high safety is a promising solution for a next-generation energy storage system.

50|$|<b>Solid-state</b> <b>batteries</b> {{generally}} {{fall into}} the low-power density and high-energy density category.

They tend to have very long shelf lives, and usually do not have any abrupt changes in performance with temperature, such as might be associated with electrolyte freezing or boiling.|$|R

40|$|<b>Solid-state</b> <b>batteries</b> with {{inorganic}} solid electrolytes {{are expected}} to be an efficient solutionto the issues of current lithium-ion batteries that are originated from their organic-solventelectrolytes. Although <b>solid-state</b> <b>batteries</b> had been suffering from low rate capability due tolow ionic conductivities of solid electrolytes, some sulfide solid electrolytes exhibiting high ionicconductivity of the order of 10 − 2 S cm− 1 have been recently developed. Since the conductivity iscomparable to or even higher than that of liquid electrolytes, when taking the transport number ofunity into account, ion transport in solid electrolytes has ceased from rate-determining; however,it has been replaced by that across interfaces. The sulfide electrolytes show high interfacialresistance to the high-voltage cathodes. Our previous studies have demonstrated that oxidesolid electrolytes interposed at the interface reduces the resistance, and they also suggestthat the high resistance is attributable to a lithium-depleted layer formed at the interface. Thisstudy employs the first-principles calculation in order to gain insight into the interface. Theinterface structure between an oxide cathode/sulfide electrolyte simulated by the first-principlesmolecular dynamics has disclosed the presence of lithium-depleted layer at the interface, andthe electronic structure calculated on the basis of density functional theory strongly suggeststhat the charge current preferentially removes lithium ions from the sulfide electrolyte side ofthe interface to deplete the lithium ion there. These calculation results are consistent with thetransport mechanism proposed from the experimental results...|$|R
