25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left <b>side</b> <b>you</b> can see the meta-process model and {{on the right side}} the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E
500|$|The National Legion of Decency {{pressured}} Hollywood to keep bikinis {{from being}} featured in Hollywood movies. The Hays production code for US movies, introduced in 1930 but not strictly enforced till 1934, allowed two-piece gowns but prohibited navels on screen. But between the introduction {{and enforcement of}} the code two Tarzan movies, Tarzan, the Ape Man (1932) and Tarzan and His Mate (1934), were released in which actress Maureen O'Sullivan wore skimpy bikini-like leather outfits. Film historian Bruce Goldstein described her clothes in the first film as [...] "It's a loincloth open up the <b>side.</b> <b>You</b> can see loin." [...] All at sea was allowed in the USA in 1957 after all bikini-type clothes {{were removed from the}} film. The girl in the bikini was allowed in Kansas after all the bikini close ups were removed from the film in 1959.|$|E

500|$|Although Speed {{would play}} several gigs at the Green Man pub in Plumstead, the band {{did not last}} long, but it {{encouraged}} Dickinson {{to continue to work}} towards being a musician. Dickinson spotted an advertisement in Melody Maker with the caption [...] "Singer wanted for recording project" [...] and replied immediately. He recorded a demo tape and sent it with a note which read: [...] "By the way, if you think the singing's crap, there's some John Cleese stuff recorded on the other <b>side</b> <b>you</b> might find amusing." [...] They liked what they heard and invited Dickinson down to the studio to make [...] "Dracula", the first song he would ever record, with a band called [...] "Shots", formed by two brothers, Phil and Doug Siviter. The song would later appear on the second disc of The Best of Bruce Dickinson compilation. [...] The brothers were impressed with Dickinson's vocal abilities and asked him to join their group.|$|E

2500|$|Spectroscopic {{binaries}} can be also detected due {{to their}} radial velocity; as they orbit around each other one star may be moving towards the Earth whilst the other moves away, causing a Doppler shift in the composite spectrum. The orbital plane of the system determines {{the magnitude of the}} observed shift: if the observer is looking perpendicular to the orbital plane there will be no observed radial velocity. [...] For example, {{if you look at a}} carousel from the <b>side,</b> <b>you</b> will see the animals moving toward and away from you, whereas if you look from directly above they will only be moving in the horizontal plane.|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton {{was a large}} man, {{standing}} [...] {{and weighing}} around [...] His girth {{gave rise to a}} famous anecdote.

[...] On another occasion he remarked to his friend George Bernard Shaw, [...] "To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England." [...] Shaw retorted, [...] "To look at you, anyone would think you have caused it." [...] P. G. Wodehouse once described a very loud crash as [...] "a sound like G. K. Chesterton falling onto a sheet of tin".|$|E

2500|$|But a whole {{generation}} of journalists and activists were influenced greatly by Seldes. Long-time Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy said, [...] "He was a reporter who didn't worry about being objective. He worried about what he would choose to write. I'm always amused when they call somebody 'one-sided'. Seldes offered one side – the <b>side</b> <b>you</b> weren't getting elsewhere". Nader said of Seldes, [...] "He was like a doctor. He reported about disease in the political economy, and the gross inequities of power, and the abuses and the exploitation. I {{always wanted to be a}} crusading lawyer, and he gave me some materials to contemplate crusading about." [...] Journalist Nat Hentoff said, [...] "He took what should be the most honorable term in journalism – muckraking – and made it work again. A lot of journalists of his generation and the generation or two that followed, did more, took risks, because [...] was the model. And the fact that he was there made them feel like whores if they didn't do more." ...|$|E
