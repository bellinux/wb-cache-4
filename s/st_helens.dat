5|$|Several {{other tribes}} have legends {{involving}} battles and disagreements between the great peaks. The Cowlitz and Chehalis have a legend where Rainier and <b>St.</b> <b>Helens</b> were female mountains and quarreled over Adams, the male mountain. In a different legend from the Cowlitz, <b>St.</b> <b>Helens</b> {{was the man}} and Pahto (Adams) and Takhoma (Rainier) were his wives and the two wives quarreled with each other. A thunderbird legend from the Yakamas has a terrific battle between the thunderbird, Enumklah, and his five wives, Tahoma (Rainier), Pahto (Adams), Ah-kee-kun (Hood), Low-we-lat-Klah (<b>St.</b> <b>Helens),</b> and Simcoe. Pahto and Tahoma were badly beaten, Ah-kee-kun and Low-we-lat-Klah escaped without injury, and Simcoe suffered the greatest injury for starting the battle.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–08 {{volcanic}} activity of Mount <b>St.</b> <b>Helens</b> {{has been documented}} as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount <b>St.</b> <b>Helens</b> volcano.

During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.|$|E

5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the Mount <b>St.</b> <b>Helens</b> volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when <b>St.</b> <b>Helens</b> erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at <b>St.</b> <b>Helens</b> brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E
