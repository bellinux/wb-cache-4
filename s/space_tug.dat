40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} efficiency of electrodynamic bare tethers acting as thrusters in low Earth orbit, as gauged by {{the ratio of}} the system mass dedicated to thrust over mission impulse, is analyzed and compared to the {{performance efficiency}} of electrical thrusters. Tether systems are much lighter for times beyond six months in space-tug operations, where there is a dedicated solar array, and beyond one month for reboost of the International Space Station, where the solar array is already in place. Bare-tether propulsive efficiency itself, with the tether considered as part of the power plant, is higher for <b>space</b> <b>tugs.</b> Tether optimization shows that thin tapes have greater propulsive efficiency and are less sensitive to plasma density variations in orbit than cylindrical tethers. The efficiency increases with tape length if some segment next to the power supply at the top is insulated to make the tether potential bias vanish at the lower end; multitape tethers must be used to keep the efficiency high at high thrust levels. The efficiency has a maximum for tether-hardware mass equal to the fraction of power-subsystem mass going into ohmic power, though the maximum is very flat. For <b>space</b> <b>tugs,</b> effects of induced-bias changes in orbit might need to be reduced by choosing a moderately large power-subsystem to tether-hardware mass ratio or by tracking the current-voltage characteristic of the solar array...|$|R

The flight frequency of these vehicles indicates that large quantities of propellants will have to be delivered to them in orbit.

50|$|An {{upper stage}} is {{designed}} to operate at high altitude, {{with little or no}} atmospheric pressure. This allows the use of lower pressure combustion chambers and engine nozzles with optimal vacuum expansion ratios. Some upper stages, especially those using hypergolic propellants like Delta-K or Ariane 5 ES second stage, are pressure fed which eliminates the need for complex turbomachinery. Other upper stages, such as the Centaur or DCSS, use liquid hydrogen expander cycle engines, or gas generator cycle engines like the Ariane 5 ECA's HM7B or the S-IVB's J-2. These stages are usually tasked with completing orbital injection and accelerating payloads into higher energy orbits such as GTO or onto escape velocity. Upper stages such as Fregat used primarily to bring payloads from low Earth orbit to GTO or beyond are sometimes referred to as <b>space</b> <b>tugs.</b>|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} three years, our team has been developing, refining, and {{maturing}} a unique solar array technology known as Stretched Lens Array SquareRigger (SLASR). SLASR offers an unprecedented portfolio of state-of-the-art performance metrics, including areal power density, specific power, stowed power density, high-voltage capability, radiation hardness, modularity, scalability, mass-producibility, and cost-effectiveness. SLASR is particularly well suited to high-power space missions, including solar electric propulsion (SEP) <b>space</b> <b>tugs,</b> major exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, and power-intensive military spacecraft.

40|$|As {{the world}} looks {{ahead to the}} next {{generation}} of space exploration programs, we must focus on designing architectures for both sustainability and affordability. By viewing exploration programs as a “system-of-systems, ” we can focus on reducing costs through the use of flexible, reusable infrastructures to support various aspects of manned and unmanned spaceflight. This paper addresses one key aspect of affordable exploration programs by tackling the issue of high costs for access to space. While launch vehicle trades for exploration programs are relatively well understood, on-orbit assembly has been given much less attention, but is an equally important component of the infrastructure enabling human access to space. This paper explores a number of on-orbit assembly methods for modular spacecraft, {{in order to understand the}} potential value of a reusable assembly support infrastructure. Four separate assembly strategies involving module self-assembly, tug-based assembly, and in-space refueling are modeled and compared in terms of mass-to-orbit requirements for various on-orbit assembly tasks. Results show that the assembly strategy has a significant impact on overall launch mass, and reusable <b>space</b> <b>tugs</b> with in-space refueling can significantly reduce the required launch mass for on-orbit assembly. ...|$|R

40|$|In-Situ Resource Utilization will be Ground Breaking {{technology}} for sustained exploration of space. Volatiles {{are present in}} planetary regolith, but water by far has the most potential for effective utilization. The presence of water at the lunar poles and Mars opens {{the possibility of using}} the hydrogen for propellant on missions beyond Earth orbit. Likewise, the oxygen could be used for in-space propulsion for lunar ascent/descent and for <b>space</b> <b>tugs</b> from low lunar orbit to low Earth orbit. Water is also an effective radiation shielding material as well as a valuable expendable (water and oxygen) required for habitation in space. Because of the strong function of water vapor pressure with temperature, heating regolith effectively liberates water vapor by sublimation. Microwave energy will penetrate soil and heat from within, much more efficiently than heating from the surface with radiant heat. This is especially true under vacuum conditions since the heat transfer rate is very low. The depth of microwave penetration is a strong function of the microwave frequency {{and to a lesser extent}} on regolith dielectric properties. New methods for delivery of microwaves into lunar and planetary surfaces is being prototyped with laboratory experiments and modeled with COMSOL MultiPhysics. Recent results are discussed...|$|R

Such missions as the development of human-tended operations nodes at the L 1 or L 2 Lagrange points, very large telescope assemblies, and planetary missions developed and operated from such points, will all require highly capable space transportation systems to transfer cargo and humans crews from low Earth orbit (LEO) to these locations. Such missions could involve a complex transportation infrastructure, containing a few elements or many “independent agents”, i. e., <b>space</b> <b>tugs,</b> refueling stations, and an overall control and communication system. New information technologies, which take advantage of knowledge-based software, model-based reasoning, and high performance computer systems, will enable the development of new generations of planner/schedulers, and autonomous control systems with diagnosis and recovery capabilities. Integrated system health management (ISHM) frameworks use these technologies to increase the reliability and robustness of vehicles. This paper will describe design considerations for implementing the ISHM concept on reusable, in-space transportation systems. Topics to be presented will include a mission description and needs assessment, brief description of key ISHM concepts, potential architectures for ISHM as applied to in-space transportation systems, and how ISHM concepts will be implemented for the system-ofsystems of “independent agents ” mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|Nearly 50 % of {{the lunar}} surface is oxygen, present as oxides in {{silicate}} rocks and soil. Methods for reduction of these oxides could liberate the oxygen. Remote sensing has provided evidence of significant quantities of hydrogen possibly indicating {{hundreds of millions of}} metric tons, MT, of water at the lunar poles. If the presence of lunar water is verified, water {{is likely to be the}} first in situ resource exploited for human exploration and for LOX-H 2 rocket fuel. In-Situ lunar resources offer unique advantages for space operations. Each unit of product produced on the lunar surface represents 6 units that need not to be launched into LEO. Previous studies have indicated the economic advantage of LOX for <b>space</b> <b>tugs</b> from LEO to GEO. Use of lunar derived LOX in a reusable lunar lander would greatly reduce the LEO mass required for a given payload to the moon. And Lunar LOX transported to L 2 has unique advantages for a Mars mission. Several methods exist for extraction of oxygen from the soil. But, extraction of lunar water has several significant advantages. Microwave heating of lunar permafrost has additional important advantages for water extraction. Microwaves penetrate and heat from within not just at the surface and excavation is not required. Proof of concept experiments using a moon in a bottle concept have demonstrated that microwave processing of cryogenic lunar permafrost simulant in a vacuum rapidly and efficiently extracts water by sublimation. A prototype lunar water extraction rover was built and tested for heating of simulant. Microwave power was very efficiently delivered into a simulated lunar soil. Microwave dielectric properties (complex electric permittivity and magnetic permeability) of lunar regolith simulant, JSC- 1 A, were measured down to cryogenic temperatures and above room temperature. The microwave penetration has been correlated with the measured dielectric properties. Since the microwave penetration depth is a function of temperature and frequency, an extraction system can be designed for water removal from different depths...|$|R
