25|$|MD 765R, {{which is}} known as Solomons Island Road South, begins at the ramp that MD 2 follows to join MD 4 northbound. MD 2 {{continues}} south a short distance to its terminus at Lore Road in Solomons. MD 765R passes a ramp from southbound MD 2-4 to MD 765R and passes by several shopping centers. Shortly before reaching its northern terminus, the state highway intersects Patuxent Point Parkway, which provides the only full <b>service</b> <b>connection</b> between the divided highway and the service road. MD 765R and MD 765Q have their northern and southern termini, respectively, at Dowell Road. Dowell Road heads east as a county highway and west as unsigned MD 2V, which provides access to the northbound direction of MD 2-4.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, a short northerly {{elevated}} {{extension of}} the Brighton Line (since reorganized as the Brooklyn & Brighton Beach Railroad) {{to the corner of}} Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street allowed rapid transit trains of the Fulton Street Line of the Kings County Elevated Railroad to operate from the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge to Brighton Beach, where a walking or cable car <b>service</b> <b>connection</b> over the bridge allowed access to New York City Hall at Park Row. In 1900, elevated trains were through-routed to Park Row without need to change trains. By 1903, a surface {{extension of the}} Brighton Beach Line on what is now Brighton Beach Avenue permitted through service from Park Row, Manhattan west to Culver Depot at Surf Avenue near West 8th Street, much nearer to the growing amusement center known then as West Brighton and now simply as Coney Island.|$|E
500|$|The VA {{denied the}} {{applications}} of post-Vietnam C-123 aircrew veterans because as veterans without [...] "boots on the ground" [...] service in Vietnam, {{they were not}} covered under VA's interpretation of [...] "exposed". At {{the request of the}} VA, the Institute Of Medicine evaluated whether or not service in these C-123 aircraft could have plausibly exposed soldiers and been detrimental to their health. Their report [...] "Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange-Contaminated C-123 Aircraft" [...] confirmed it. In June 2015 the Secretary of Veterans Affairs issued an Interim final rule providing presumptive <b>service</b> <b>connection</b> for post-Vietnam C-123 aircrews, maintenance staff and aeromedical evacuation crews. VA now provides medical care and disability compensation for the recognized list of Agent Orange illnesses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{volatility}} of network environments requires <b>service</b> <b>connections</b> {{to adapt to}} changes of service resources and user requirements. In this paper, we treat <b>service</b> <b>connections</b> as individual components called service connectors and present an adaptable service connector model that adopts a role mechanism to adjust <b>connections</b> between <b>services.</b> A role is an abstraction of services with common functionalities. It offers a changeable connector structure, enables reconfiguration of service interaction and encapsulates changes in interacting participants, making <b>service</b> <b>connections</b> more adaptable. ...|$|R

[...] The Court noted that pain often warrants separate and even additional consideration when rating an already service connected disability.

50|$|Brammer vs. Derwinski is a United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims {{case that}} dealt with the {{requirement}} for a current diagnosis as a general element for <b>service</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|James W. Brammer appealed a September 13, 1990, Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) {{decision}} which denied reopening {{his claim}} for <b>service</b> <b>connection</b> for spinal meningitis. BVA also {{determined that the}} Veteran was not entitled to <b>service</b> <b>connection</b> for residuals of frozen feet. Mr. Brammer was a combat Veteran of World War II and served in Normandy, Northern France, the Ardennes, the Rhineland, and Central Europe. He originally filed a claim for spinal meningitis in 1980 and was denied by the VA Regional Office (VARO). The VARO noted that the Veteran's records were destroyed in the 1973 National Personnel Records Center fire. A Morning report (United States military) was obtained that showed that the Veteran was in fact hospitalized, but no diagnosis was given. Affidavits from four separate service members, written {{in the fall of}} 1980, attested that the Veteran was in fact treated for spinal meningitis. The VARO determined that the affidavits were not sufficient to justify a grant of <b>service</b> <b>connection</b> for spinal meningitis. Afterwards, the Veteran attempted to reopen his claim on numerous occasions, including the last denial on October 19, 1988, in which the VARO denied <b>service</b> <b>connection</b> for spinal meningitis. He appealed this decision to BVA, which held that there was no [...] "new and material" [...] evidence of record that would reopen the previous denial.|$|E

Philadelphia Water currently maintains 3,200 miles of water mains that can be classified into three distinct sections of mains: transmission mains, distribution mains, and service mains.Transmission mains are larger water mains that move vast amounts of water across Philadelphia between pump stations and reservoirs. They are typically more than 16 inches in diameter. Distribution mains, by comparison, are smaller than 16 inches in diameter and are used to carry water from transmission mains to customer <b>service</b> <b>connections.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>connections</b> are the individual connections owned by the property owner that connect to distribution mains and channel water into a building or house.|$|R
