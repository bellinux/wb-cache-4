25|$|The {{source of}} L. salmonis infections when salmon return from {{freshwater}} {{has always been}} a mystery. Sea lice die and fall off anadromous fish such as salmonids when they return to freshwater. Atlantic salmon return and travel upstream in the fall to reproduce, while the <b>smolts</b> do not return to saltwater until the next spring.

25|$|Salmon {{eggs are}} laid in {{freshwater}} streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes.

The underyearling and yearling <b>smolt</b> were transferred to seawater in October 2002 and May 2003, respectively. The underyearling <b>smolt</b> were reared under continuous light and the yearling <b>smolt</b> under natural light during the first twelve weeks in seawater, at ambient temperatures. Thus, the underyearling <b>smolt</b> hit seawater at 13 [no-break space][deg]C and were reared at 10 - 13 [no-break space][deg]C during the early seawater phase, whereas the yearling <b>smolt</b> hit seawater at 7 [no-break space][deg]C and were reared at 7 - 10 [no-break space][deg]C during the early seawater phase.

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way.

They are a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on <b>smolts.</b> [...] Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which allows more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.|$|E
2500|$|Salmon have {{a strong}} sense of smell. Speculation about whether odours provide homing cues go back to the 19th century.

In 1978, Hasler and his students convincingly showed that the way salmon locate their home rivers with such precision was indeed because they could recognise its characteristic smell. They further demonstrated that the smell of their river becomes imprinted in salmon when they transform into <b>smolts,</b> just before they migrate out to sea. Homecoming salmon can also recognise characteristic smells in tributary streams as they move up the main river.

40|$|Total {{dissolved}} gas supersaturation (TDGS) downstream of power plants may cause harmful {{effects on the}} fauna in many rivers. The harmful effects of TDGS are known as gas bubble disease (GBD). TDGS has been proposed as one possible cause of mortality of migrating Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) <b>smolt</b> in Evangervatnet, Norway. The present study investigated whether TDGS had negative effects on the survival of Atlantic salmon <b>smolt</b> downstream of the power plant in Evangervatnet. Four complementary sub-studies were conducted from April to June 2016 : (1) Atlantic salmon held in surface cages (0 - 1. 15 m depth) and submerged cages (1. 15 - 2. 5 m depth) upstream and downstream the power plant for 4 and 14 days. (2) Electrofishing and snorkeling observations of wild fish. (3) Capture of Atlantic salmon <b>smolt</b> in traps. (4) Towing of Atlantic salmon <b>smolt</b> across Evangervatnet. The fish were examined for GBD by visual observations by use of a stereo microscope. The surface caged <b>smolt</b> were also examined for histology pathology and blood cortisol. The <b>smolt</b> showed no mortality or signs of GBD during the field studies, suggesting that the <b>smolt</b> tolerated the TDGS levels in Evangervatnet. The TDGS levels at the cage locations ranged between 102. 7 to 112. 8 % and medians between 105. 6 to 107. 5 % (TDGS: lowest upstream the power plant and higher downstream the power plant). The density of salmon and trout (Salmo trutta) was similar at higher levels of TDGS close to the power plant as in the control area upstream, indicating that the fish distribution was not negatively affected by the power plant. The median cortisol levels in the <b>smolt</b> held in the cages were above the normal background levels at all sampling sites after both 4 days and 14 days of TDGS exposure, which indicates that the <b>smolt</b> were stressed. The high cortisol levels were found both at low and at higher levels of TDGS, suggesting that handling prior to blood sampling was the main contributor to the high cortisol levels. As a conclusion, TDGS values in Evangervatnet appeared to have no negative effects on the survival of Atlantic salmon <b>smolt</b> downstream of the power plant...|$|R

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} myth, most beaver dams do not pose {{barriers}} to trout and salmon migration, {{although they may}} be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. In a meta-review of studies claiming that beaver dams act as fish passage barriers, Kemp et al. found that 78% of these claims were not supported by any data. In a 2013 study of radiotelemetry-tagged Bonneville cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki utah) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Utah, both of these fish species crossed beaver dams in both directions, including dams up to [...] high. Rainbow, brown, and brook trout {{have been shown to}} cross as many as 14 consecutive beaver dams. Both adults and juveniles of coho salmon, steelhead trout, sea run cutthroat (Oncorhyncus clarki clarki), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma malma), and sockeye salmon are able to cross beaver dams. In southeast Alaska, coho jumped dams as high as two meters, were found above all beaver dams and had their highest densities in streams with beaver. In Oregon coastal streams, beaver dams are ephemeral and almost all wash out in high winter flows only to be rebuilt every summer. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) may be limited by beaver dams, but the presence of juveniles upstream from the dams suggests that the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon <b>smolts</b> was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows. Two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond.|$|E

In this study, downstream passage of Atlantic salmon <b>smolt</b> was documented at the power plant Unkelmühle (River Sieg, Germany). Here, a novel approach is used, combining a 10 mm vertical trashrack with surface bypasses and a vertical slot pass for fish protection. Fish migrating through surface bypasses can be diverted into a concrete basin for monitoring purposes. A complex radio telemetry system was used to cover all potential migration corridors. In spring 2014, 78 salmon <b>smolt</b> were tagged with radio transmitters and released about 9 km upstream the power station. Additionally, another 800 <b>smolt</b> were dye marked and released at the same site. An intense monitoring program during the following weeks provided, amongst others, migration time, routes and speed. Catches in the monitoring basin showed that salmon was the dominant species migrating through the surface bypass (more than 60 %), followed by nase, barbel and brown trout. <b>Smolt</b> were mainly caught after dusk and migration {{could be related to}} water discharge and temperature with wild <b>smolt</b> migrating slightly later than the stocked ones.

In conditional <b>smolting,</b> juveniles transform only if growth exceeds a threshold body size prior to migration season, and subsequent marine survival correlates with size at ocean entry. Conditional <b>smolting</b> suggests that efforts to improve freshwater survival of juveniles may reduce <b>smolt</b> success if they increase competition and reduce growth.
