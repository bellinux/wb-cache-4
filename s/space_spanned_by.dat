Some modifications {{are made to}} the original definitions of the three Curvelet Transform cases (continuous, semi-discrete, discrete), which improves and simplifies the expressions of the related Parseval-Plancherel formula and Calderón resolution of the identity. The results presented in this dissertation cast {{new light on the}} structure and further properties of curvelets, and offer means to extend such construction to higher dimensions. ^ The obtained discrete curvelet transform gives rise to a tight frame for the space of square-integrable functions on the plane. Analysis based on manipulation of the corresponding curvelet coefficients (with respect to this frame) helps measure the regularity of functions in different smoothness spaces. This information is used to offer characterizations of Lipschitz and Besov spaces, as well as approximation spaces for sequences of finite-dimensional linear <b>spaces</b> <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> curvelets. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of four papers that address likelihood-based unit root tests for panel data with cross-sectional dependence arising from common factors. In the first three papers, we derive Lagrange multiplier (LM) -type tests for common and idiosyncratic unit roots in the exact factor models based on the likelihood function of the differenced data. Also derived are the asymptotic distributions of these test statistics. The finite sample properties of these tests are compared by simulation with other commonly used unit root tests. The results show that our LM-type tests have better size and local power properties. In the fourth paper, we estimate the <b>spaces</b> <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> the common factors and the <b>spaces</b> <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> the idiosyncratic components of the static factor model by using the quasi-maximum likelihood (ML) method and compare it with the widely used method of principal components (PC).

Simulation {{results show that the}} idiosyncratic unit root tests based on the likelihood-based residuals generally have better size and higher size-adjusted power, especially when the cross-sectional dimension is small and the time series dimension is large...|$|R
