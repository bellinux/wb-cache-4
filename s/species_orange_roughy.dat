This revolutionized the understanding of the age of the important fishery <b>species,</b> <b>orange</b> <b>roughy.</b> Her work revealed that this species is extremely slow-growing, not maturing until between 20 and 25 years of age, with significant implications for sustainable management of catch limits for the species.|$|E

50|$|Wax esters per se are {{a normal}} part of the diet of humans as a lipid {{component}} of certain foods, including unrefined whole grain cereals, seeds, and nuts. Wax esters are also consumed in considerable amounts by certain populations that regularly eat fish roe or certain fish <b>species,</b> such as <b>orange</b> <b>roughy.</b> That said, wax esters are not typically consumed in appreciable quantities in diets containing many processed foods.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{ecological}} interactions between bycatch <b>species</b> and <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus) within exploited slope and seamount communities off Tasmania. The diet of Etmopterus baxteri and E. unicolor, two important bycatch species of these fisheries, is described using four indices [percentage frequency of occurrence, percentage by number, percentage by weight, and percentage by the index of relative importance (%IRI) ] calculated for broad prey categories, individual prey taxa, and functional prey groups. The identifiable diet of E. unicolor was dominated by benthic cephalopods (96 %IRI), whereas benthic teleost prey, notably <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (43 %IRI), dominated the diet of E. baxteri. Similar trophic mechanisms appear to support aggregations of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> and Etmopterus spp. off Tasmania; they feed on demersal species and mesopelagic or vertically migrating nekton advected laterally onto the mid-slope. The importance of teleost prey in the diet of E. baxteri apparently increases with shark length, whereas crustaceans become less important, which is a similar diet shift to that of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy.</b> Etmopterus baxteri is both a potential competitor and predator of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> in these ecosystems. Fishery managers need to understand and consider the complex trophic interactions between <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> sharks, and other exploited species in managing recently reopened deep-water fisheries off southeastern Australia...|$|R
50|$|Slimeheads {{range from}} a bright brick red with identically shaded fins, to dusky grey or silver, to black with dusky grey to {{transparent}} fins. The reds quickly fade to orange following death. Some species (e.g., Aulotrachichthys latus) are reported to be bioluminescent, probably by symbiotic bacteria as is found in other beryciform fish. The largest <b>species</b> is the <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> at a maximum standard length (SL; a measurement excluding the caudal fin) of 75 cm and a weight of 7 kg; however, most slimeheads are well under 30 cm SL.|$|R
50|$|Living marine {{resources}} covered by SEAFO including fish (such as <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> Hoplostethus atlanticus, alfonsino Beryx splendens, Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, hake Merluccius paradoxus, horse mackerel Trachurus capensis, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, cardinalfishes Epigonus species, oreo dories and armourhead Pseudopentaceros species, some shark species and rays), molluscs (such as octopus and squid) and crustaceans (such as {{deep sea red crab}} Chaceon maritae). Some {{of the most}} notable commercially important <b>species</b> are <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> alfonsino - harvested by bottom trawling, and deep sea red crab - capture by pots or traps and Patagonian toothfish caught by longlining. Highly migratory fish stocks such as tuna, swordfish, marlin and sharks in the region are covered by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Most of SEAFO fish resources are found in deep waters (greater than 500 m depth) and tend to be slow grower, long-lived, late-matured and therefore could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. Their biological and ecological dynamics are not well known and there are no good historic time series.|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of video}} {{recordings}} {{performed by the}} submersible “Nautile” in the Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic indicated that demersal fish species are associated to different types of deep-sea habitats. Four different dive transects were analysed with respect to environmental characteristics. A total of 19 fish groups were ordinated by means of canonical correspondence analysis, and the investigation was performed at the individual fish level. Microhabitat fauna was dominated by a diversity of suspension feeders indicating different gradients of bottom hydrology, particularly vertical and horizontal current flow. Physical, geological and biological factors revealed different strategies of habitat selection in fish. The most represented <b>species,</b> the <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus) showed a clear association with complex bottoms, including coral reefs. Others, such as Coryphaenoides rupestris and Synaphobranchus kaupi, showed higher flexibility of adjustment to changing environments. These traits can be utilised {{in the study of}} the environmental impact of deep-sea fishing. Based on the same dives, the locomotory behaviour of 13 fish species was studied with basis on a qualitative analysis of selected individuals. The main swimming modes used in shallow waters were also detected in the demersal environment. Clear differences in locomotory behaviour were found among fish species, reflecting both convergence and diversity of strategies of utilization of the demersal niche space...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> stocks live outside the {{jurisdiction}} of any particular nation, making it more challenging to limit overall catches.

This accounts for 95% of the total estimated global catch of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy.</b> Exports of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> provided an estimated revenue to New Zealand of NZ$53 million (US$ 37M) in 2015.|$|R
40|$|The {{trophic ecology}} and food web {{dynamics}} of the mid-slope demersal fish community (700 - 1200 m) off southern Tasmania were investigated. The top predators in the community were <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> the oreos and squalids. <b>Orange</b> <b>roughy</b> Hoplostethus atlanticus is dominant on the flat ground but even more so on the seamounts, and consequently fishing has been intense on these seamounts. Oreos are also fished on the seamounts. During 10 research cruises around south-eastern Australia, more than 9000 stomachs from <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> and 23 other species were collected and examined. <b>Orange</b> <b>roughy</b> ate predominantly mesopelagic and benthopelagic fish, crustaceans and squid as adults, and mainly crustaceans as juveniles suggesting resource partitioning between juveniles and adults. <b>Orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> warty dory Allocyttus verrucosus, squalids and macrourids are benthopelagic omnivores.

40|$|Restriction enzyme {{analysis}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{was used to}} test for genetic homogeneity of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus) in the southern hemisphere. Two hundred and eighty-six <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> specimens were collected from seven general localities: the Great Australian Bight; South Australia (off southeastern Kangaroo Island); the west coast of Tasmania; the east coast of Tasmania; New South Wales; New Zealand and South Africa. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from developing ovary tissue and analysed with 10 six-base enzymes and 3 four-base enzymes. Both forms of analysis revealed a low level of genetic diversity in this species. The six-base enzyme study found no evidence of reproductively isolated populations of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> in southeastern Australian waters. However, an {{analysis of}} 107 fish with 3 four-base enzymes identified at least partial genetic separation of the New South Wales (NSW) sample of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> from South Australian (off southeastern Kangaroo Island) and Tasmanian samples. This finding supports biological evidence for the presence of a distinct subpopulation of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> in NSW waters. The four-base study also provided evidence of the presence of genetically distinct samples of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> occurring in the same localities off southeastern Kangaroo Island from consecutive years. Additional sampling and the use of a greater number of four-base enzymes may be needed to determine if any genetic structuring exists among <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> south of New South Wales...|$|R
40|$|The first {{estimates}} of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus) target strength at 38 and 120 kHz with visual verification {{were obtained from}} a self-contained echosounder and video camera system affixed to a demersal trawl towed through dense aggregations of spawn-ing <b>orange</b> <b>roughy.</b> Mean target strength estimates were obtained from 24 tracks of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> containing 83 echoes. The mean target strength at 38 kHz was – 52. 0 dB with a 95 % confidence interval of – 53. 3 to – 50. 9 dB for fish with a mean length of 33. 9 cm. At 120 kHz the mean target strength was – 47. 9 dB (confidence interval of – 48. 8 to – 46. 4 dB). This work makes two significant advances: in situ TS measurements have been made that can be confidently attributed to <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> and using a trawl to herd <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> past the system resolved the previously intractable problem of fish avoidance...|$|R

The Marine Stewardship Council and Forest and Bird have contradictory opinions {{when it comes to}} <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus) sustainability. The controversy ultimately comes down to the fact that <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> is a deep sea species and while management may have been successful for inshore species, the vast number of unknowns relating to deep sea stocks and the ecosystem effects of deep sea fishing mean that what initially seemed like sustainable management repeatedly resulted in disastrous consequences. The collapse of some of the early <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> stocks is proof of this. The question is, have we learnt enough from those early failures to avoid repeating those mistakes, or is it {{only a matter of time}} before the next crash of one of our deep sea fisheries? Fitting a selection of linear models to catch per unit effort (CPUE) data, corresponding to <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> catch from the Priceless region in the Sub-Antarctic, led to the discovery of significant seasonal patterns and an annual linear trend in CPUE with a breakpoint in 2004.

40|$|With {{slow growth}} rates, late {{maturity}} {{and a high}} maximum age of 100 years or more, <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> can be classified as a vulnerable deepwater fish species that can only sustain low rates of exploitation. Historical patterns of exploitation associated with this species {{suggest that it is}} currently not possible to manage its fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic sustainably, and the total allowable catch for <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> has been gradually reduced to zero for European fisheries since 2010. <b>Orange</b> <b>roughy</b> to the west of Ireland and Britain occurs on distinct bathymetric features (seamounts, hills and canyons) as well as on flat ground along the continental slope.
