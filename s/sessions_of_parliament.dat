5|$|The Sejm, until 1573 {{summoned by}} the king at his {{discretion}} (for example when he needed funds to wage a war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became {{in the course of}} the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament,</b> within the next decade or so, the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. Some of the changes were too modest, other had never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped Crown land), but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious.|$|E

25|$|In 1657 the {{reconstruction}} of the castle started, under the Italian architect Izydor Affait's guidance. Because of the lack of money the following Polish king, Michael I Korybut did not decide on radical rebuilding, just limiting himself to rebuilding destroyed buildings. Because of bad conditions of the residence he had to move to Ujazdów Castle in 1669. Until 1696 when the next Polish king, John III Sobieski died, no serious works were done. They only limited work to current inspections of the building's condition. <b>Sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> continued to be held in the castle, as well as various State occasions, such as when the Hohenzollern Dukes of Prussia paid homage to the Kings of Poland and occasions when the king received the ambassadors of foreign countries.|$|E

25|$|Though the city's growth continued, it {{suffered}} financially {{from the}} loss of parliament and more directly {{from the loss}} of the income that would come with the arrival of hundreds of peers and MPs and thousands of servants to the capital for <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> and the social season of the viceregal court in Dublin Castle. Within a short few years, many of the finest mansions, including Leinster House, Powerscourt House and Aldborough House, once owned by peers who spent much of their year in the capital, were for sale. Many of the city's once elegant Georgian neighbourhoods rapidly became slums. In 1803, Robert Emmet, the brother of one of the United Irish leaders launched another one-day rebellion in the city, however, it was put down easily and Emmet himself was hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E
25|$|The General Assembly House {{was also}} used for {{meetings}} of the Auckland Provincial Council. This arrangement generally worked well, as many members of parliament were also members {{of one of the}} Provincial Councils of New Zealand, and the provincial council sessions were thus generally scheduled to not clash with <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament.</b> Only when sessions had to be called at short notice did clashes occur. The first such clash occurred in mid-August 1855, when parliament was still in session and the Superintendent of Auckland Province, William Brown, called the fourth session of the Auckland Provincial Council, which was held at the Mechanics' Institute instead. The second clash occurred in April 1856, when the fifth session of the Auckland Provincial Council had not finished when the first session of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament began; the provincial councillors once again moved to the Mechanics' Institute. The third and last clash occurred in late 1863, when the provincial council had not finished its session in time for the general assembly session that was to begin on 19 October 1863. On Friday, 16 October, the provincial council adjourned until Saturday, 28 November. Parliament had not finished its session by then, but took a rest day for the provincial council {{to be able to use}} the chamber. Rather than again adjourn its business, the provincial council decided to meet, from the following week, in the library room attached to the General Assembly House.|$|E

It is his duty to appoint the Prime minister of the Republic of Belarus with the consent of the House of Representatives, and to decide the structure of the Government of the Republic of Belarus. The President signs bills, and has the right to return it, fully or in parts, with objections to the House of Representatives. He also appoints– and can dismiss– the deputy Prime ministers, the ministers and {{the other members of the}} Government, and he decides in cases of resignation of the Government, or any of its members.

The president is supposed to deliver annual messages to the Parliament, and has the right to participate in the <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> and its bodies. In instances of strike, the president has the right, in instances specified in the law, to defer or suspend a strike for a period not exceeding three months.

Thomas Cromwell has been described, by Neale, as [...] "the model type of parliamentarian, deeply versed in the history and procedure of the institution, though lacking in historical perspective; eminently responsible, but fearless in defence of liberty." [...] He was a puritan but his zeal did not cloud his judgment which, with his knowledge of procedure, rendered him one of the most experienced committeemen of his time.

2500|$|However, {{the crisis}} over the Budget had {{highlighted}} a long-standing constitutional question: should the House of Lords {{be able to}} overturn bills passed by the House of Commons? The Liberal government introduced a bill in February 1910 which would prevent the House of Lords vetoing finance bills, and would force them to pass any bill which had been passed by the Commons in three <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament.</b> This was immediately opposed by the Unionists, and both parties spent {{the next several months}} in a running battle over the bill. The Conservatives were led by Arthur Balfour and Lord Lansdowne, who headed the Conservatives in the House of Lords, while Bonar Law spent the time concentrating on the continuing problem of tariff reform. The lack of progress had convinced some senior Conservatives {{that it would be a}} good idea to scrap tariff reform altogether. Bonar Law disagreed, successfully arguing that tariff reform [...] "was the first constructive work of the [...] " [...] and that to scrap it would [...] "split the Party from top to bottom".|$|E
2500|$|Stephen was in 1879 {{appointed}} a {{judge of the}} High Court. He had transient hopes of an Evidence Act being brought before Parliament, and in 1878 the Digest of Criminal Law became a Ministerial Bill with the co-operation of Sir John Holker, who was Attorney-General in the second government of Benjamin Disraeli. The Bill was referred to a judicial commission, which included Stephen, but ultimately failed, and was revised and reintroduced in 1879 and again in 1880. [...] It dealt with procedure as well as substantive law, and provided for a court of criminal appeal, though {{after several years of}} judicial experience Stephen changed his mind as to the wisdom of this course. However, no substantial progress was made during any <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament.</b> In 1883 the part relating to procedure was brought in separately by Gladstone's law officer Sir Henry James, and went to the grand committee on law, which found that there was insufficient time to deal with it satisfactorily {{in the course of the}} session.|$|E
2500|$|The Government reintroduced the Bill in 1999. [...] With the {{prospect}} of it being passed by the Commons in two successive <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 were available to enact the Bill should the Lords have rejected it a third time. The Lords passed the Bill at second reading, but made an amendment during committee stage to maintain the age of consent for buggery at 18 for both sexes. However, as the Bill had not completed its passage through the Lords {{at the end of}} the Parliamentary session on 30 November 2000, the then Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin certified that the procedure specified by the Parliament Acts had been complied with. The Bill received Royal Assent a few hours later, and was enacted as the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000. The provisions of the Act came into force throughout the UK on 8 January 2001, lowering the age of consent to 16. This Act also introduced, for the first time, an age of consent for lesbian sexual acts, as previously there had been no legislation concerning this.|$|E
