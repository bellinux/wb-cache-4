Besides Sunpowers interdigitated back contact cells, metal wrap through (MWT) solar cells are currently the back contact cells closest to large scale market integration. One of the major challenges is to isolate the different electrodes since both emitter and base contacts are on the rear side of the cell. In this work we examine the use of screen printed <b>solder</b> <b>resists</b> as isolation layer. Therefore eight different epoxy based <b>solder</b> <b>resists,</b> which are cured either thermally or via illumination with ultraviolet radiation, are evaluated {{in terms of the}} suitability for MWT modules. Our qualification procedure consists of investigations on thermal stability, electric breakdown, mechanical adhesion and printability of the <b>solder</b> <b>resists.</b> We find six out of eight <b>solder</b> <b>resists</b> to meet our requirements. The failure of two <b>solder</b> <b>resists</b> is caused by insufficient isolation properties or poor resistance to temperature and to scratching.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} one of {{the common}} modes of structural failure in multichip ball grid arrays (BGAs), determines its locations within the package structure, relates it to the stresses generated in the reliability tests under which it occurs, and by finite element simulations, determines an explanation for the failure, and finally proposes a method to avoid this failure mechanism. Several designs of multichipBGAsubstrates were manufactured and production silicon assembled into them. These were all 14 mm 22 mm 119 ball PBGA. These were subjected to a set of package reliability tests, until some units failed electrical test. The failed units were analyzed and the physical location and shape of the failure was determined in many cases. From this information, the mechanical mode of failure for each unit was determined. In addition there was sufficient information in some of the analyses to provide definite suggestions as to the mechanism of failure. Meanwhile, finite element analysis was performed using simplified representations of the multichip BGAs, in order to find the locations of highest stress, and the expected modes of failure. This data was matched to the failure modes found in the physical analysis. Some novel failure analysis techniques were used to expose the damage in the failed units. A particular failure mode occurred frequently in temperature cycle, and the sites of failure were located by failure analysis. The failure was due to open circuit in the copper tracks in the top layer of the substrate caused by cracking in the <b>solder</b> <b>resist</b> directly underneath the edge of the die attach fillet.

50|$|Solder mask or solder stop mask or <b>solder</b> <b>resist</b> {{is a thin}} lacquer-like {{layer of}} polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads. A solder bridge is an unintended electrical connection between two conductors by means of a small blob of solder. PCBs use solder masks to prevent this from happening. Solder mask is not always used for hand soldered assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are soldered automatically using reflow or solder bath techniques. Once applied, openings must be made in the solder mask wherever components are soldered, which is accomplished using photolithography. Solder mask is traditionally green but is now available in many colors.|$|R

However, consistent {{inspection of}} patterns on these PCBs is very difficult due to pattern complexity. Most of the previously developed techniques are not sensitive enough to detect defects in complex patterns. To solve this problem, we propose a new optical system that discriminates pattern types existing on a PCB, such as copper, <b>solder</b> <b>resist</b> and silk-screen printing. We also developed the hybrid defect detection technique to inspect discriminated patterns. This technique is based on shape measurement and features extraction methods. We used the proposed techniques in an actual automated inspection system, realizing real time transactions {{with a combination of}} hardware equipped with image processing LSls, and PC sofrware.

40|$|Organic {{substrate}} is {{a composite}} panel consists of several materials such as BT core, copper, dielectric, <b>solder</b> <b>resist</b> and plugging material. As different material has different material property, when the organic substrate is exposed to thermal excursion in the manufacturing process, the substrate warps. In this project, both experimental and simulation study were carried out {{in order to have}} a better understanding on the substrate warpage behaviour during the solder reflow process. In the experimental analysis, substrate warpage throughout the solder reflow process was measured by using shadow moirÃ©. Besides that, the thermally induced warpage due to the temperature rise was obtained by subtracting the measured warpage from the initial warpage. Finite element analysis was performed to predict the thermally induced warpage during the solder reflow process. Both results from the experiment and simulation were compared in order to validate the finite element models. A parametric study of the impact of design parameters and material properties on substrate warpage during the solder reflow process was performed. A total of 6 parameters have been investigated including material properties, copper volume, copper distribution, plated through hole (PTH) number, PTH array and substrate thickness. The results of these analyses have produced general guidelines which can be refer when designing the substrate and also selecting the substrate materials. ...|$|R

The multi-layer PCB model was simplified based on the unit Cu/PSR patterns and the warpage simulation during the reflow process was performed by using ABAQUS combined with a user-defined subroutine. From these results, it was demonstrated that the proposed anisotropic viscoelastic composite shell simulation technique can be successfully used to predict warpage of multi-layer PCBs during the reflow process.

40|$|BGA {{packages}} {{have become}} increasingly popular for microprocessor device packaging and MCM assembly. This {{is due to the}} advantages the ball grid array offers with regard to high lead count combined with large pitches, processable with standard SMT equipment. For BGA package encapsulation, epoxy resins are mostly used, either as glob top or molding compound. For cost effective encapsulation of large numbers of BGA packages, the transfer mold process offers various advantages. The process is fully automated with short process times and the molding compound glass transition temperature (Tg) is very high (> 200 degrees C) compared to glob top encapsulants (160 degrees C) offering higher reliability at elevated temperatures. However, BGA packages challenge both material suppliers and packagers as this package type is asymmetric and is thus very sensitive to encapsulant material properties. Properties to consider are reduced encapsulation material shrinkage after molding to provide low warpage, and optimized molding compound adhesion to the materials present in a BGA to avoid delaminations that might cause electrical failures. Fraunhofer IZM and Toshiba Chemical have designed test vehicles to investigate different BGA molding compounds with regard to substrate adhesion with various types of <b>solder</b> <b>resist</b> after molding and after package reliability testing.

40|$|Woven glass fabric/BT (bismaleimide triazine) {{composite}} laminate (BT core), copper (Cu), and photoimageable <b>solder</b> <b>resist</b> (PSR) {{are the most}} widely used materials for semiconductors in electronic devices. Among these materials, BT core and PSR contain polymeric materials that exhibit viscoelastic behavior. For this reason, these materials are considered to have time-and temperature-dependent moduli during warpage analysis. However, the thin geometry of multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) film makes it difficult to identify viscoelastic characteristics. In this work, a vibration test method was proposed for measuring the viscoelastic properties of a multilayer PCB film at different temperatures. The beam-shaped specimens, composed of a BT core, Cu laminated on a BT core, and PSR and Cu laminated on a BT core, were used in the vibration test. The frequency-dependent variation of the complex bending stiffness was determined using a transfer function method. The storage modulus (E&# 39;) of the BT core, Cu, and PSR as a function of temperature and frequency were obtained, and their temperature-dependent variation was identified. The obtained properties were fitted using a viscoelastic model for the BT core and the PSR, and a linear elastic model for the Cu. Warpage of a line pattern specimen due to temperature variation was measured using a shadow Moire analysis and compared to predictions using a finite element model. The results provide information on the mechanism of warpage, especially warpage due to temperature-dependent variation in viscoelastic properties.

40|$|With the {{continued}} miniaturization and increasing performance of electronic devices, new technical challenges have arisen. One such issue is delamination occurring at critical interfaces inside the device. This major reliability issue can occur during {{the manufacturing process}} or during normal use of the device. Proper evaluation of the adhesion strength of critical interfaces early in the product development cycle can help reduce reliability issues and time-to-market of the product. However, conventional adhesion strength testing is inherently limited {{in the face of}} package miniaturization, which brings about further technical challenges to quantify design integrity and reliability. Although there are many different interfaces in today's advanced electronic packages, they can be generalized into two main categories: 1) rigid to rigid connections with a thin flexible polymeric layer in between, or 2) a thin film membrane on a rigid structure. Knowing that every technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, multiple testing methods must be enhanced and developed to be able to accommodate all the interfaces encountered for emerging electronic packaging technologies. For evaluating the adhesion strength of high adhesion strength interfaces in thin multilayer structures a novel adhesion test configuration called “single cantilever adhesion test (SCAT) ” is proposed and implemented for an epoxy molding compound (EMC) and photo <b>solder</b> <b>resist</b> (PSR) interface. The test method is then shown to be capable of comparing and selecting the stronger of two potential EMC/PSR material sets. Additionally, a theoretical approach for establishing the applicable testing domain for a four-point bending test method was presented. For evaluating polymeric films on rigid substrates, major testing challenges are encountered for reducing testing scatter and for factoring in the potentially degrading effect of environmental conditioning on the material properties of the film. An advanced blister test with predefined area test method was developed that considers an elasto-plastic analytical solution and implemented for a conformal coating used to prevent tin whisker growth. The advanced blister testing with predefined area test method was then extended by employing a numerical method for evaluating the adhesion strength when the polymer’s film properties are unknown...|$|R

The substrate is used as boards in electronics, microelectronics, micro-mechanics and/or micro-optics, is a semiconductor wafer, a semiconductor chip or a single-layered or multi-layered circuit board and is provided with electrically conducting structured metallizations. The nanoporous gold layer is applied on an already existing layer made of gold. The nanoporous gold layer is deposited on the wafer with microelectronic circuits or micromechanical elements or on organic laminates, ceramics or glass, is deposited on semiconductor materials for producing a rewiring structure or on a circuit board for producing a multilayer circuit and serves for producing a stacked arrangement from microelectronic circuits or micromechanical or micro-optical elements {{on the basis of}} semiconductor. A plating base (2) or an adhesion layer is applied on the substrate with adhesive reinforcement before the deposition step and is lithographically structured. A lacquer mask used for structuring the layer to be deposited is removed before or after removing the silver. A galvanic starting layer is removed before applying the gold-silver layer (3) and removing the lacquer mask. The silver is alloyed and the adhesive layer is removed without masking the nanoporous gold by a further lacquer mask in a suitable aqueous solution. The nanoporous gold layer is tempered for adjusting the pore size, is structured and is pre-treated by reactive ion etching or hydrophilizing for wetting. The polymer is vapor-deposited and is set in a liquid condition for penetrating into the nanoporous gold layer under vacuum. The polymer layer (5) is structured and is polymerized and cross-linked after applying and penetrating into the sponge-like gold layer.

40|$|Abstract. The {{nuclear matrix}} is {{concealed}} by {{a much larger}} mass of chromatin, which can be removed selectively by digesting nuclei with DNase I followed by elution of chromatin with 0. 25 M ammonium sulfate. This mild procedure removes chromatin almost completely and preserves nuclear matrix morphology. The complete nuclear matrix consists of a nuclear lamina with an interior matrix composed of thick, polymorphic fibers and large masses that resemble remnant nucleoli. Further extraction of the nuclear matrices of HeLa or MCF- 7 cells with 2 M sodium chloride uncovered a network of core filaments. A few dark masses remained enmeshed in the filament network and may be remnants of the nuclear matrix thick fibers and nucleoli. The highly branched core filaments had diameters of 9 and 13 nm measured relative to the intermediate filaments. They may serve as the core structure around which the matrix is constructed. The core filaments retained 70 % of nuclear RNA. This RNA consisted both of ribosomal RNA precursors and of very high molecular weight hnRNA with a modal size of 20 kb. Treatment with RNase A removed the core filaments. When 2 M sodium chloride was used directly to remove chromatin after DNase I digestion without a preceding 0. 25 M ammonium sulfate extraction, the core filaments were not revealed. Instead, the nuclear interior was filled with amorphous masses that may cover the filaments. This reflected a requirement for a stepwise increase in ionic strength because gradual addition of sodium chloride to a final concentration of 2 M without an 0. 25 M ammonium sulfate extraction uncovered core filaments.

Here we provide a mechanical analysis, based on the Eshelby inclusion problem, of the 3 -D strain and stress {{inside and outside the}} single myocyte during contraction in an elastic matrix. (1) The fractional shortening of the myocyte depends on the cell's geometric dimensions and the relative stiffness of the cell to the gel. A slender or softer cell has less fractional shortening. A myocyte of typical dimensions embedded in a gel of similar elastic stiffness can contract only 20 % of its load-free value. (2) The longitudinal stress inside the cell is about 15 times the transverse stress level. (3) The traction on the cell surface is highly non-uniform, with a maximum near its ends, showing 'hot spots' at the location of intercalated disks. (4) The mechanical energy expenditure of the myocyte increases with the matrix stiffness in a monotonic and nonlinear manner. Our mechanical analyses provide analytic solutions that readily lend themselves to parametric studies. The resulting 3 -D mapping of the strain and stress states serve to analyze and interpret ongoing cell-in-gel experiments, and the mathematical model provides an essential tool to decipher and quantify mechanotransduction mechanisms in cardiac myocytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{formability}} of Mg {{alloy sheet}} in the as-hot rolled condition {{depends on the}} microstructure developed during hot rolling. In general, the formability of Mg alloys is improved by finer grain sizes. 'Microalloying' levels of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and cerium (Ce) {{have been found to}} refine the as-cast structure, but there is no information as to whether this effect will be reflected in the as-hot worked structure and formability. Thus, in this work, the effects of microalloying levels of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and cerium (Ce) on the microstructures (from as-cast to as-hot rolled) and subsequent hot deformation behavior of AZ 31, nominally 3 % Al, 1 % Zn, and 0. 3 %Mn, were systematically investigated. To include the effect of solidification rate these alloys were cast in different moulds (preheated steel mould, Cu-mould, and water cooled Cu-mould). One-hit compression testing at temperatures between 250 °C ∼ 400 °C, strain rates of 0. 001, 0. 01, 0. 1 s- 1 and strains from 0. 2 up to 1. 0, was performed to investigate the basic hot compression behavior, while two-hit compression testing was conducted to determine the static softening behavior. Hot rolling of the microalloyed AZ 31 alloys was then carried out to study the effects of microalloying on as-hot rolled structure under two sets of rolling schedules. To investigate the formability of these microalloyed sheets, tensile tests were completed over a temperature range between ambient and 450 °C, at strain rates between 0. 1 and 0. 0003 s- 1. Results show that Ca and Sr act to refine the as cast grain size and the second phases, consistently promoting fine and uniform as-hot rolled grain structure. With regard to grain refinement, calcium has the strongest effect, whereas Ce is most effective for second phase refinement. In addition, microalloying retards grain growth during hot tensile testing. Multiple alloying presents a combined and complementary effect. A refined and uniform grain structure combined with well dispersed and thermally stable second phases significantly improves the hot formability of AZ 31 sheets by promoting dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in the <b>matrix,</b> <b>resisting</b> grain coarsening, and retarding the development of cavitation and necking. Under the superplastic condition of 450 °C and 0. 0003 s - 1, the elongation was improved by 17 % with Ca only, 26 % with Ca and Ce, 51 % with Ca and Sr, and 59 % with Ca, Sr and Ce...|$|R
