500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 28 March 1942, Nedić {{indicated}} to Turner that, {{in the event}} of his departure, Ljotić was the only person who could be considered his successor as leader of the Government of National Salvation. Turner remarked that [...] " [...] could not [...] <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> because Ljotić was a prophet and visionary, not a leader and statesman." [...] In December, the SDO was renamed the Serbian Volunteer Corps ( [...] , SDK) and placed under the command of General der Artillerie (lieutenant general) Paul Bader. Although it was not formally part of the Wehrmacht, the SDK received arms, ammunition, food and clothing from the Germans. Like the Serbian State Guard ( [...] , SDS), the SDK was under the direct command of the Higher SS and Police Leader August Meyszner and the Commanding General in Serbia. During operations its units were put under the tactical command of German divisions. It was the only group of armed Serbs that the Germans ever trusted during the war, its units often being praised for valour in action by German commanders. The SDK often helped the Gestapo track down and round up Jewish civilians who had managed to evade capture by the Germans and was involved in sending Jewish prisoners to the Banjica concentration camp. SDK units were not allowed to move from their assigned territory without German authorization. Members took an oath in which they pledged to fight to the death against both Communist forces and the Chetniks, to stay in the SDK for at least six months and to [...] "serve the cause of the Serbian people." [...] Ljotić himself had no control over the SDK, which was directly commanded by Mušicki. Most officers in the SDK came either from the ranks of the disbanded Royal Yugoslav Army or the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Morale was high amongst the volunteers, with education officers similar to those employed by the Soviets and the Yugoslav Partisans being assigned to each company, battalion and regiment to teach and indoctrinate soldiers and help maintain high levels of morale. According to SDK ideology, Ljotić was a [...] "guiding spirit" [...] in his [...] "political and philosophical pronouncements". In his instructions to unit commanders, Ljotić stressed the importance of volunteers believing in and having respect for God. He urged them to pray regularly and warned that poor battlefield results and failure to gain the support of the Serbian public came {{as a result of the}} [...] "wavering religiosity and faith" [...] of commanders and their frequent cursing of God's name. Ljotić criticized the widespread practice of alcoholism, gambling and sexual decadence found amongst volunteers. He also condemned acts of unnecessary violence committed by them when they were reported.|$|E

50|$|For a {{producer}} {{to put on}} a Broadway production, he or she must acquire an option, which involves paying a fee. The option {{is to make sure that}} the producer is <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> producing <b>this</b> show, and puts the money forth to prove it. For a typical Broadway play, {{a producer}} pays $5,000, therefore getting the rights for the first six months. He or she can then pay $2,500 to renew the option for the next six months, and then $5,500 for anywhere up to twelve months after. Sometimes the third renewal requires that the producer has a director, star, or theatre attached to the production. This is all to make sure that the producer is <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> producing <b>this</b> play or musical.|$|R

Professor, I beseech thee be thou <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> thing {{because it will be}} found, when God comes to judge, that those that profess Christ, and yet abide with their iniquity, are but wooden, earthy professors, and none of the silver or golden ones: and so, consequently, such as shall be vessels, not to honour, but to dishonour; not to glory, but to shame.|$|E

The 125 'Regolarita' was a 6 speed enduro model based on an ISDT factory prototype from 1975. While the bike proved viable enough overall, gearbox problems plagued it during development and the project was terminated in 1978. Ducati were sufficiently <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> project to explore MX versions.

Furthermore, the proposed law would incriminate anyone holding opinions other than those supporting PRC policy on the question of reunification. Under the law dissidents would be prosecuted under charges of treason, retroactively effective up to 100 years, raising <b>serious</b> questions <b>about</b> freedom of speech and civil liberties. Chen stated that the law would only serve to increase the feelings of animosity of the Taiwanese people towards the PRC and increase tensions.|$|R

For example, the power cables, when facing the severe conditions encountered in the wells, show lack of resistance or the deterioration of the rubber insulation, posing <b>serious</b> concerns <b>about</b> <b>this</b> method. Furthermore, there are records of mechanical failures during the operation (Guerreiro et al. 2012). Electrical heaters frequently burn out, so it is prudent to use an automatic switch to shut off the current when the heater becomes overheated.|$|R

50|$|Company founder Jessica Alba was {{inspired}} by the 2008 birth of her first child Honor and her own history of childhood illnesses to create a company that provided an alternative to the prevalent baby products with ingredients such as petrochemicals and synthetic fragrances. She was compelled to become <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> venture when one of her mother's baby laundry recommendations caused her baby to have a welt outbreak. It took Alba three years to find her business partners Brian Lee, Sean Kane, and Christopher Gavigan. Despite advice that she should start small with a singular focus, Alba launched the company in 2012 with 17 products. While building her company, Alba has lobbied the United States Congress to make testing of consumer products in the marketplace for chemical inputs more stringent. The company has a strong charitable mission that has been likened to Toms Shoes, Warby Parker, and Etsy. It donates products, revenues and labor.|$|E

The Earl is more <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> affair {{than any of his}} earlier dalliances, and wants Diana to marry him. She is reluctant to leave what she thinks is the financial security of her marriage to formalise her relationship with Erroll (who has no funds or prospects), unaware that Delves Broughton is deep in debt. Privately humiliated but appearing to honour their agreement, Delves Broughton publicly toasts the couple's affair at the club in Nairobi, asking Erroll to bring Diana home at a specified time. Delves Broughton appears to be extremely intoxicated {{for the rest of the}} evening; once he is alone it is clear he was feigning drunkenness. After dropping off Diana, Erroll is shot to death in his car not far from the home of Delves Broughton who is soon charged with Errol's murder.|$|E
