40|$|The {{feathers}} of Amazon parrots are brightly coloured. They contain a unique class of pigments, the psittacofulvins, deposited in both barbs and barbules, causing yellow or red coloured feathers. In specific feather areas, spongy nanostructured barb cells exist, reflecting {{either in the}} blue or blue-green wavelength range. The blue-green <b>spongy</b> <b>structures</b> are partly enveloped by a blue-absorbing, yellow-colouring pigment acting as a spectral filter, thus yielding a green coloured barb. Applying reflection and transmission spectroscopy, we characterized the Amazons' pigments and <b>spongy</b> <b>structures,</b> and investigated how they contribute to the feather coloration. The reflectance spectra of Amazon feathers are presumably tuned to the sensitivity spectra of the visual photoreceptors. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{terms of}} texture, and mouth-feel, gelatin makes marshmallows chewy by forming a tangled 3-D network of polymer chains. Once gelatin is {{dissolved}} {{in warm water}} (dubbed the [...] "blooming stage"), it forms a dispersion, which results in a cross-linking of its helix-shaped chains. The linkages in the gelatin protein network, trap air in the marshmallow mixture, and immobilize the water molecules in the network.

It can range in color from slightly yellowish to white. At the stalk's base there is usually a white to pink volva (a sac-like cup). When immature, the fruit body is encapsulated within the volva present as a peridium (skin-like tissue layer), which ruptures as the mushroom emerges. The volva attaches to the substrate with whitish or pinkish rhizomorphs (thick, cord-like strands of mycelia). Rhizomorphs and mycelia that are exposed to air eventually turn whitish in color; those freshly exposed from their substrate usually quickly turn bluish purple. The fungus produces watery and fleshy sclerotia that range in thickness from 1 to 10 mm with a length of up to 30 mm. The sclerotia are irregularly convoluted and lobed, and become hard and horny upon drying. Sclerotia have a color reaction similar to that noted for rhizomorphs, and, after long exposure to air, will gradually turn a uniform dark reddish brown.

Long-term outcome data of the <b>spongy</b> metal <b>structured</b> implant {{used in the present}} study in patients younger than 65 years are still lacking. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review and functional investigation (Merle d’Aubigné score, SF- 12) of patients younger than 65 years at implantation treated with a <b>spongy</b> metal <b>structured</b> THA (n = 79) from one orthopedic university center from 1985 to 1989. Results: At a 19 -year mean follow-up (range: 15. 3 - 21. 3 years), the overall stem survival rate was 93. 7 %, and the overall cup survival rate was 82. 3 %. Revision surgeries of the stem were performed in all cases for aseptic loosening at an average of 15. 3 ± 3. 5 years after implantation. Acetabular components were revised for aseptic loosening and recurrent dislocation after inlay revision on an average of 11. 8 ± 4. 7 years after implantation. No other device related complications occurred within the 19 -year follow-up period. No correlation was found between time of revision and gender or age.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of green}} and blue feathers of the Rose-faced Lovebird (Agapomis roseicollis) is described from light-, fluorescence-, and electron microscopical findings and discussed in relation to earlier works. The description is intended to {{provide a basis for}} future comparative studies. Special attention is given to the colour-producing elements (pigments and the short-wave reflecting <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> ('Blaustruktur', 'cloudy medium') of specialized medullary barb cells (spongy cells, box cells)), and the findings are correlated with macro- and microspectrophotometric measurements. Green barbs differ from those of blue ba rbs in having their cortex yellow pigmented, but are further distinguished by their <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> which is denser (wider keratin rods and correspondingly narrower air-filled channels) than that of blue barbs. This difference corresponds to the wave-length of maximum reflectance being shifted c. 30 nm towards longer wave-lengths compared to that of blue barbs. Thus green barbs {{are not the same as}} blue barbs only with a yellow pigmented instead of an unpigmented cortex, as usually stated. Dark green hack feathers reflect approximately half as much light throughout the visible spectrum as do green belly feathers. This difference is due to variations in yellow and black pigmentation of the barbules. These variations are described quantitatively and the importance of barbules for the resulting feather colour is stressed. Variation in size and shape of barbs and barbules are discussed, principally in relation to their optical efIects and the presumed functions of the colours. The colour produced by the <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> cannot be explained by Tyndall (Rayleigh) scattering as is usually done. This follows from the shapes of the barb reflectance spectra which are not in agreement with the Rayleigh equation (scattering inversely proportional to lambda 4). A new model for colour production is forwarded. It is based on a model of the <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> in which this is considered to consist of short hollow keratin cylinders (diameter 0. 3 - 0. 35 ft) with air-filled cores. Backscattering from these cylinders is considered responsible for colour production and good agreement is obtained between values of lambda max calculated from the model and those measured spectrophotometrically. The backscattering from the Individual cylinders can be regarded as an Interference phenomenon. The colour of the <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> thus is an interference colour. That it appears diffuse and not iridescent, as is generally the case for interference colours in feathers, is due to the presence of many hollow cylinders oriented in all directions in the <b>spongy</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{aggregate}} {{development and}} stability of soils is influenced by root systems, fungal filaments and soil fauna excrement (Daynes et al. 2013; Oades 1993; Ritz and Young 2004; Tisdall and Oades 1982). According to the soil thin sections, the percentage of organic components (root residues and hyphae) and excrement pedofeatures was higher in UFs than in CFs (Table  7). Thus, we propose that {{the formation of the}} well-developed granular microstructure of surface soil and spongy microstructure of subsoil was affected by plant roots, soil fauna and soil microorganisms, particularly fungal hyphae. We also detected differences between the upper and lower layers of UFs with respect to the structures observed. A granular structure is common in surface horizons with a very fine silt to clayey texture (such as in vertisols) (Fitzpatrick 1984; Kovda and Mermut 2010) or in mollic subsurface horizons with many grass roots (Gerasimova and Lebedeva-Verba 2010; Oades 1993). Shrink–swell processes in clay with a dry–wet cycle and the presence of root systems lead to the development of granular aggregates in these soils (Oades 1993). In the present study, the granular microstructures of the A 1 and A 2 horizons of E-UF and the A 1 horizon of N-UF contained many root residues and tissues (Table  7), and thus, the development of the granular microstructure was affected by root systems. In general, volcanic ash soils have a small granular microstructure (Sedov et al. 2010). In both Eniwa farms, the buried horizons were dominated by spongy microstructures composed of moderately or strongly developed granules, suggesting that this structure was influenced by volcanic ash. However, on the Narita farms, the <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> was found only in the A 1 horizon of N-UF and not that of N-CF. The aggregate hierarchy concept, different binding agents act at different hierarchical stages in soil aggregates (Tisdall and Oades 1982). Macro-aggregates (0.25 – 5  mm in diameter) comprise many micro-aggregates (2 – 250  µm), which are bound together mainly by a sticky network formed from fungal hyphae and fine roots. The micro-aggregates comprise mainly fine sand grains and small clumps of silt grains, clay and organic debris, which are bound together by root hairs, fungal hyphae and microbial gums (Brady and Weil 2008; Six et al. 2004; Tisdall and Oades 1982). In the soil thin sections, the granules in the A 1 horizon of N-UF measured 0.3 – 5.0  mm in diameter, whereas the small granules in the crumbs in the A 2 horizon of N-UF measured approximately 100 – 300  µm in diameter. These results show that the granular structure was dominated by macro-aggregates, whereas the <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> was dominated by micro-aggregates. The difference of aggregate size between the granular and spongy structures suggested that different organic matter act as binding agents with the granular structure affected by comparatively large roots and hyphae and the <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> affected by root hairs, fine fungal hyphae and microbial debris.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{theoretical}} {{study is}} based on a nano-technological evaluation of the effect of pressure on the composite bone fine structure. It turned out, that the well known macroscopic mechano-elastic performance of bones in combination with muscles and tendons is just one functional aspect which is critically supported by additional micro- and nano- shock damping technology aimed at minimising local bone material damage within the joints and supporting spongy bone material. The identified mechanisms comprise essentially three phenomena localised within the three–dimensional <b>spongy</b> <b>structure</b> with channels and so called perforated flexible tensulae membranes of different dimensions intersecting and linking them. Kinetic energy of a mechanical shock may be dissipated within the solid-liquid composite bone structure into heat via the generation of quasi-chaotic hydromechanic micro-turbulence. It may generate electro-kinetic energy in terms of electric currents and potentials. And the resulting specific structural and surface electrochemical changes may induce the compressible intra-osseal liquid to build up pressure dependent free chemical energy. Innovative bone joint prostheses will have to consider and to be adapted to the nano-material aspects of shock absorption in the operated bones...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber membranes {{has been studied}} using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) as weak nonsolvent and water as strong nonsolvent. When PEG 400 is used as polymeric additive to the spinning dope the viscosity of the PES solution is strongly enhanced. Furthermore, {{it was observed that}} PEG 400 could be added to the solution in large amounts without causing phase separation (NMP/PEG ratio 1 : 9, PES concentration approximately 11 wt. %). Membranes prepared from a solution containing a NMP/PEG ratio of 1 : 1 results in higher fluxes than when a ratio of 1 : 4 is used. Similar fluxes were obtained for PES concentrations of 16 and 20 wt. %. Looking at the fiber cross-section it became clear that macrovoid formation could not be suppressed by the addition of PEG 400 alone, not even at concentrations as high as 38 wt. %. Only when relatively large amounts of water were added to the dope solution macrovoids disappeared and nice <b>spongy</b> <b>structures</b> were obtained. Variation of the bore liquid composition using the components NMP, PEG 400 and water showed to be a powerful method to control the pore size of the bore surface. Pores of 5 – 28 nm were obtained in combination with high pure water fluxes; e. g. a membrane with pores of 7 nm had a pure water flux of 940 l/(m 2 h bar) and showed 100 % BSA retention. When an air gap larger than 10 mm was applied the shell surface contained relatively large pores. Spinning directly in water (airgap= 0) resulted in shell side pores of 8 – 10 nm, while an air gap of 10 mm resulted in pore sizes of 40 – 54 nm...|$|R
40|$|The colours of {{the common}} kingfisher, Alcedo atthis, reside in the barbs of the three main types of feather: the orange breast {{feathers}}, the cyan back feathers and the blue tail feathers. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the orange barbs contain small pigment granules. The cyan and blue barbs contain spongy nanostructures with slightly different dimensions, causing different reflectance spectra. Imaging scatterometry showed that the pigmented barbs create a diffuse orange scattering and the <b>spongy</b> barb <b>structures</b> create iridescence. The extent of the angle-dependent light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength. All barbs have a cortical envelope with a thickness of a few micrometres. The reflectance spectra of the cortex of the barbs show oscillations when measured from small areas, but when measured from larger areas the spectra become wavelength independent. This can be directly understood with thin film modelling, assuming a somewhat variable cortex thickness. The cortex reflectance appears to be small but not negligible {{with respect to the}} pigmentary and structural barb reflectance. ...|$|R
40|$|Publicado em "Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine", vol. 7, supp. 1 (2013) Proper {{in vitro}} models to {{evaluate}} the performance of relevant tissue engineered constructs are still a major demand of the field. The use of in vitro platforms in research presents obvious ethical and cost advantages over in vivo models. In vitro models can also offer important scientific advantages, as for example, the study of biological mechanisms of action because {{it is easier to}} isolate an experimental variable and measure its impact on a simple, well controlled system. The aim of this project is to create an osteochondral in vitro model. As proof-of-concept, two different bilayered sponge-like scaffolds were developed to act as a template for co-culturing rabbit adipose stem cells (rASCs) -derived osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Bilayered low acyl gellan gum (LAGG) - LAGG/hydroxyapatite (HAp) <b>spongy</b> <b>structures</b> with and without Gelatin were produced respectively integrating cartilage- and bone-like layers. The freeze-dried bilayered scaffolds composed by LAGG 2 %(w/v) - LAGG 2 %/HAp 30 % (w/w) and LAGG/Gelatin 1 : 1 2 %(w/v) -LAGG/Gelatin 1 : 1 2 %/HAp 30 % (w/w) have a gradient of HAp in the bone-like layer that, unlike cartilage-like layer, present a bioactive behavior. The bilayered structures possess about 90 % porosity, 500 lm of pore size and 85 % interconnectivity as determined by Micro-CT analysis. Swelling and degradation tests revealed that the structures can absorb about 120 % of their weight and lost 10 % of their mass after 30 days in phosphate buffered saline solution. In vitro studies with rASCS from Fat Pad (knee) are being performed to study cell adhesion and proliferation. A rotational dual chamber bioreactor was fabricated in-house to improve medium diffusion into the structures, to allow the use of two different culture mediums for each layer, to homogenize the cell distribution in the scaffolds, as well as to introduce mechanical stimuli by 180 º stirring and compression of the top layer. So far, the results have shown that the developed bilayered scaffolds have a great potential for finding application as a screening platform of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of osteochondral tissue disorders...|$|R
