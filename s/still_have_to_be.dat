Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice would <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> studied by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game at GM Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E
5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E

25|$|The Swiss {{producer}} of both onboard clocktypes SpectraTime declined to comment.

25|$|As {{with all}} arch-based constructions, {{there is an}} outward thrust {{generated}} against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is, of course, to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted naves ran parallel {{down the length of}} the building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault would <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite strong or reinforced by buttressing. The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a groin vault.|$|E
25|$|There {{were even}} Verdingkinder auctions where {{children}} were {{handed over to}} the farmer asking the least amount of money from the authorities, thus securing cheap labour for his farm and relieving the authority from the financial burden of looking after the children. In the 1930s 20% of all agricultural labourers in the Canton of Bern were children below the age of 15. Swiss municipality guardianship authorities acted so, commonly tolerated by federal authorities, to the 1960s, not all of them of course, but usually communities affected of low taxes in some Swiss cantons Swiss historian Marco Leuenberger investigated, that in 1930 there were some 35,000 indentured children, and between 1920 and 1970 more than 100,000 are believed to have been placed with families or homes. 10,000 Verdingkinder are still alive.

25|$|Self-replicating probes could exhaustively {{explore a}} galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way in as little as a million years. If even a single civilization in the Milky Way {{attempted}} this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien Bracewell probe. Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to Von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe would <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time.|$|E

25|$|When the European Union {{introduced}} {{new security}} rules for airports from 1 January 2005, Brekstad Airport was exempt, {{because of the}} small size of the aircraft. By April, the airport had received notice that 100% security control would <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> introduced, costing the municipality NOK465,000 per year. At the same time, Air Norway was still losing money, and applied to the municipality to not be charged landing fees at the airport. On 3 September 2007, the terminal was renovated for NOK1.8 million. It received a segregation of arriving and departing passengers, 100% security control and a general renovation of the building, although the capacity was not increased. In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 passengers after the Norwegian Air Force decided to not permit their employees to travel from Brekstad, but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about two hours drive away. The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone in relation to the Norwegian, caused Air Norway to have lost NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a public service obligation.|$|E
25|$|External {{financing}} {{institutions were}} concerned with the insufficient capacity to operate and maintain the infrastructure they were financing in Lebanon. Until 2000 there were 21 water authorities in Lebanon who were financially and technically weak. The limited sewer networks, if they existed at all, were managed by the respective municipalities, which had often even less technical and financial capacity than the water authorities. In {{the absence of a}} sanitation tariff, municipalities lacked the financial resources to operate and maintain sanitation infrastructure. The experience with wastewater treatment plants is illustrative of the difficulties encountered. For example, the operating costs for the first wastewater treatment plant in Lebanon, the Al-Ghadir plant in Beirut completed in 1997, <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subsidized by the government because the municipal governments in the service area (the Beirut and Baabda districts) lack the resources to do so. Furthermore, incomplete infrastructure considerably reduces the development impact of the plant. Because the construction of sewers was delayed, most of the sewage of Southern Beirut still flowed into the Mediterranean without any treatment via both the Al Ghadir River and sea outlets. The Al Ghadir plant provides only preliminary treatment, followed by discharge through a 2.6km marine outfall. The second wastewater treatment plant built in Lebanon, intended for the city of Baalbek and completed in 2001, could not be put into operation, because both the sewer system and the outfall main were not completed. Wastewater treatment plants in Tripoli and Sidon were inaugurated in 2009 and 2010 respectively, both long after they were due to be completed.|$|E

500|$|In situ {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} on Mars by the Viking landers, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Phoenix lander, and Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life, {{has suggested that the}} Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form. Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.
