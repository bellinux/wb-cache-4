5|$|Gameplay itself {{requires}} Jetman {{to locate}} and destroy a series of alien bases {{on the surface of}} the moon. Each new base appears with the destruction of the previous one. To accomplish this task, Jetman must take the bomb to the alien base—either in his space suit or using the rover—and then fly over the base and drop the bomb. After several bases have been destroyed in succession, new and increasingly hazardous varieties of flying aliens assault the player. Each base must be destroyed within a <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> If this limit expires before the base is destroyed, two missiles are launched from the base—one for Earth, the other for Jetman's rover. The player will be given a limited time to intercept and destroy the missiles whilst still in flight, thus preventing a game over.|$|E

There is no <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> but Rome will run a caller if they start rambling too long. The winning criteria is subjective, as there are no set rules or criteria. However, the winning call is typically the person who comes up with some original smack for the other top callers, mixes in some sports takes, and brings something new to the event.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{industries}} {{where it is}} critical to make a correct decision within a <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> based on the decision-maker’s knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or surgeons. In these situations it is common that the key decision maker is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These ‘points of fracture’ are likely to cause additional workload on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and the time to make the decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA that is coming in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013) In other words, if everything is going OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when something unusual happens or something goes wrong.|$|E

50|$|Although {{this edition}} of the Nokia Game necessitated more skill than logic, it was well-received for not forcing players to play within very <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> but also criticised for its {{frequent}} bugs and players who would often disconnect while losing.

During a challenge, everyone in the group must buy a drink for the holder of the highest-ranking coin. A coin presented to a low rank, by a high rank, (i.e.: Admiral) trumps all low rank coins in a challenge. Traditionally, the presentation of a coin is passed during a handshake. Some units provide <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> to respond to a challenge.|$|R
50|$|Players {{must also}} face a <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> that governs how {{powerful}} the ultimate enemy {{is when the}} player must confront it.

25|$|The {{station is}} famous for {{pioneering}} the Action News format, which was used by many stations throughout the United States. When WFIL-TV premiered it on April 6, 1970, the format allowed the news program to feature more stories than KYW-TV's Eyewitness News due to <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on story packages. Within a few months, the station surged to first place {{for the first time}} in its history. It had previously been an also-ran behind KYW-TV and WCAU-TV, as was the case with most ABC affiliates. Despite Channel 6's newspaper roots, it was hampered by the fact that ABC was not on par with CBS and NBC until the early 1970s.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, none {{of these}} countries, nor Australia, has been {{successful}} to date at moving existing longer-term beneficiaries back into the labor market, although the process of re-screening and seeking to activate existing longer-term beneficiaries in Great Britain has only recently begun. Across all countries, once enrolled on disability benefits {{for more than a}} few months, only a small fraction of recipients return to work. Even when <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> are put in place, as in the case of Sweden, movement off the disability system for longer-duration beneficiaries is difficult. Even when it is done, most frequently it results in a shift to another public program rather than into employment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In highly dynamic systems {{resources}} {{may have}} to be accessed in real-time, within the <b>strict</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> of un-derlying physical processes, with availability becoming critical. Current access control models such as RBAC and ABAC do not address real-time availability in a scalable way for such scenarios. In this paper we propose a real-time attribute-based access control model that extends the functionality of ABAC by using real-time attributes that reflect the requirements of critical applications. We describe two applications of our model: (a) a substation automation system, and (b) a medical cyber-physical system.
