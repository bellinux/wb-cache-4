60|$|At last {{there was}} an urgent cry from Lisle and he backed his paddle. The canoe swerved, a foaming wave broke into her, and in another moment Nasmyth was in the water. He was dragged down by the {{swirling}} stream, and when he rose he dimly saw the canoe a few yards in front of him. He failed to reach her--she was traveling faster than he was--and, though he could swim well, he grew horribly afraid. It struck him {{that there was a}} strong probability of his being driven against a boulder with force enough to break his bones or of being drawn down and battered against the <b>stony</b> <b>bottom.</b> Still, he struck out for a line of leaping froth between him and the bank and was nearing it when Lisle grasped his shoulder and thrust him straight down-stream. Scarcely able to see amid the turmoil, confused and bewildered, he nevertheless realized that it was not desirable to attempt a landing where he had intended. Yielding to the guiding impulse, he floundered down-stream, until Lisle again seized him and drove him shoreward, and a few moments later he stood up, breathless, in a few feet of slacker water. He waded to the bank, and then turned to Lisle, who was close behind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{trophic ecology}} of the aquatic insect fauna has been widely studied for the Northern {{temperate}} zone. However, the taxa originally classified within a given particular trophic group in temperate ecosystems, do not necessarily exhibit the same dietary profile beyond its geographic limits. Since, the trophic ecology of caddisfly larvae is largely incomplete in the Neotropical Region, the present work aims to describe feed-ing habits inferred from quantitative analysis of data taxonomically resolved at the species level. For this, the feeding habits of three Trichoptera species Marilia cinerea, M. elongata and M. flexuosa were recorded in the Yungas forests of Argentina and Bolivia. A total of 15 larvae of each species were sampled from 13 different streams were selected for gut content analysis. The ingested material was extracted from the foregut and midgut by using ventral dissection of thorax. For each species, mandibles were dissected, mounted in glycerin and illustrated in order to highlight morphological differences between these mouth pieces purportedly associated to the dietary behavior of individuals, and their habitats. The niche overlap was estimated through Schoener’s method. The diet analysis revealed that M. cinerea, M. elongata and M. flexuosa feed on the same food items, but through different patterns of preferences. Larvae of M. cinerea were collected on both emerging surfaces of rocks on which {{a thin layer of}} running water flows and streams sliding areas with <b>stony</b> <b>bottoms</b> attached to the rock surfaces.

50|$|Food {{was largely}} imported. A limited supply of fish was {{obtained}} from the Sun River, which at that time was a clear, swift-running stream with a <b>stony</b> <b>bottom.</b> Wild game (bighorn sheep, black-tailed deer, elk, pronghorn, and white-tailed deer), ducks, geese, prairie chicken, rabbits, and sage-grouse were often hunted for food, but were scarce in the area and not relied on heavily for food. Nearby ranches supplied the post with vegetables, albeit at very high prices. Flour was usually shipped in from the east, as the Montana-grown summer wheat produced bread which was dark and heavy.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} notable species in the stream is the rare stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) {{attracted}} by the strong current and <b>stony</b> <b>bottom</b> of the stream.

While its presence in the stream is still considered as threatened, the numbers of individuals increased during the period 1999-2001. Other fishes in the stream include perch, northern pike, roach, tench, crucian carp, and, more rarely, trout. European crayfish were observed in 1989 and signal crayfish, illegally introduced during the 1990s, is feared to threaten the population of stone loach and to bring crayfish plague into the stream.|$|E

40|$|The herbivorous mayfly Heptagenia sulphurea is {{characteristic}} of rivers with <b>stony</b> <b>bottoms.</b> Records from the 20 th century showed that this species had disappeared from the Common Meuse in the Netherlands, probably due to river regulation or changes in water quality. A field survey in 2003 showed that H. sulphurea was present in the Geul tributary, approximately 300 m upstream of its confluence with the Common Meuse. H. sulphurea has not recolonized the Common Meuse despite improvements in water quality over the last decades. Concentration of suspended sediments in the River Meuse, however, is still high, much {{higher than in the}} beginning of the 20 th century. The presence of a silt layer may limit the return of H. sulphurea in this river by reducing availability and quality of its food. The prime objective of this study was to investigate the impact of silt on survival and growth of H. sulphurea in a laboratory experiment. Furthermore, the impact of water and periphyton quality from the Common Meuse on survival and growth of this mayfly was also investigated. Results showed that neither water quality nor cultured periphyton from the Common Meuse reduced survival and growth of H. sulphurea. The presence of a silt layer resulted in a significantly lower growth rate of the mayfly larvae. It is concluded that the silt layer reduces the accessibility of the food. Covering of food is possibly one of the main factors limiting the recolonization of H. sulphurea and probably other benthic grazers in the Common Meuse...|$|R

5000|$|Dobsonfly {{eggs are}} usually laid {{close to the}} water's edge on a rock or {{overhanging}} foliage and hatch at night one to two weeks later. The newly emerged larvae fall or crawl into the stream and {{make their way to}} a fast-flowing section with a <b>stony</b> <b>bottom.</b> They are called hellgrammites and they hide under stones, catching and eating soft-bodied invertebrates. They grow slowly, shedding their skins ten to twelve times and reaching a length of up to ninety millimeters. The larger hellgrammites are fearsome predators with well-developed jaws. After one to three years and when ready to pupate, they emerge from the water and travel up to fifteen metres looking for a suitable location under a rock, log or leaf litter. There may be a mass emergence of hellgrammites within a few days of each other. Each one digs a hole in moist soil and prepares a small, smooth walled chamber, and after a prepupal stage of a few days, sheds their skin and pupates. In some areas the adults emerge in seven to fourteen days [...] but in other areas they overwinter as pupae. On emerging, they dig their way to the surface. They are not thought to feed as adults but spend their time in dense vegetation near streams. They are most active at night and are attracted by lights.

40|$|Commercial {{harvesting}} of Laminaria hyperborea {{from the}} bottom {{has been carried out}} on the west coast of Norway since 1964. This alga, together with L. digitata and Ascophyllum nodosum, is used for alginate production. The harvesting apparatus is a seaweed dregde equipped with knives fixed at the front end and a trawl net to collect the plants. Two different models of the dredge have been designed for use by conventional fishing boats of 25 feet and 60 — 70 feet respectively. A boat of 57 feet, especially designed for the harvesting of L. hyperborea, has been in operation since 1969. The dredges are used at 1 — maximum 20 m depth, and the daily catch is normally about 6 tons of seaweed for smaller boats and 20 — 25 tons for large ones. Even larger catches are obtained with the 57 feet boat. L. hyperborea is currently being harvested on the west coast at about 59 º N and near 63 º N. This study was made in the southern area during short visits in the Kvitsøy district in 1968, 1969 and 1970. Some results from similar investigations at Hustadvika near 63 º N are included. The harvesting technique on rocky and <b>stony</b> <b>bottoms</b> and the effects on the vegetation were observed by diving. The dredge works very efficiently on even, rocky bottoms and cuts off the stipe 5 — 20 cm above the holdfast; few plants are lost when the dredge is properly operated. The results are less satisfactory on loose bottoms where plants are easily overturned and missed by the dredge. The substrate can also be disturbed, and even large boulders may be turned over. The stumps soon decompose and have almost completely disappeared within a year. Subsequent observations and sampling at 4 — 10 m depth were made in areas harvested 2, 18, 24 and 36 months previously to study the repopulation. Harvested areas are soon reinvaded by new plants of L. hyperborea. Other species which occur in the area, may also develop {{at the same time and}} become locally dominant during the first three years after harvesting. The most important species are Desmarestia aculeata, D. viridis, Laminaria saccharina and Halidrys siliquosa. In general, these species were more common on stony than on rocky bottoms. L. hyperborea grows fast in cleared areas, and within a year a dense vegetation has developed. The number of plants per unit area is very high in young populations; in one case up to 153 plants of L. hyperborea per square meter were found at 5 m depth on a rocky bottom harvested 18 months previously. Stipe length had reached as much as 55 cm, and a maximum density of 6. 0 kg per m(2 was recorded from the few samples obtained. The growth rate increases during the second and especially the third year after harvesting. The main stipe length of 13 tagged plants at 4 m depth in an area which had been harvested at Hustadvika, was 40 cm after two years and 95 cm after three years. The mean fresh weight of stipe and frond of the same plants were 304 g and 350 g respectively. These may be maximum values for L. hyperborea on the Norwegian coast. Three years old populations at Kvitsøy are very well developed and have been regularly harvested. On the basis of the harvested material it would appear that the density of L. hyperborea was aproximately 9 kg per m(2 after 3 years regrowth as compared to 10 kg per m(2 originally. The yield is surprisingly high: the plants are small at this stage compared with the size they can ultimately attain, but the number of plants per unit area is high. Observations on older populations indicate that a further year's growth, by which time the frond weight seems to have reached a maximum, would significantly increase the yield. Full grown plants at Kvitsøy may be at least 9 years old and have a stipe length of almost 200 cm. A density of up to 30 kg per m(2 of L. hyperborea has been recorded at 5 m depth in an old forest. Young plants have relatively smooth stipes with few epiphytes and provide better raw material than older ones...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} an index (MESH – Macroinvertebrates in Estonia: Score of Hydromorphology) to assess hydromorphological quality of Estonian surface waters based on macroinvertebrate taxonomic composition. The MESH is an average score {{based on the}} affinities of selected indicator taxa to flow velocity and bottom type. As both parameters were highly correlated (r= 0. 65) indicator response to both parameters were combined. The list of MESH indicators includes 394 freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa derived from 3282 samples collected from rivers and lakes during 1985 – 2009. The indicators were selected out of 690 taxa, by applying the information-theoretical Kullback–Leibler divergence. The individual scores of macroinvertebrates range from 0 to 3, the higher scores indicating faster flow and/or solid bottom substrate. For standing waters, flow velocity was always considered zero. Among the reference waterbodies, mean MESH was the highest for small streams followed by middle streams, large streams, and lakes. In lakes with medium water hardness (the prevailing type in Estonia), the MESH decreased gradually from <b>stony</b> to muddy <b>bottom.</b> The highest MESH values for standing waters were observed in the stony surf zone of very large lakes (area> 100 km 2). The lowest values occurred for small lakes with exceptional hydrochemical characteristics (soft- and darkwater, and calcareous types). Similarly, MESH indicated stream degradation by damming. Mean MESH in reservoirs with a muddy bottom was significantly lower than in reservoirs with a hard bottom, or in unregulated stream sections...|$|R
