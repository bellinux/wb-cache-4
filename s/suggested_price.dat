500|$|MEP was not {{intended}} to be a production design, and would be able to export only small amounts of electricity. It would, however, {{serve as the basis for}} the first production model, LIFE.2. LIFE.2 would produce 2.2GW of fusion energy and convert that to 1GW of electrical at 48% efficiency. Over a year, LIFE would produce 365 days x 24 hours x 0.9 capacity factor x 1,000,000kW nameplate rating = 8billion kWh. In order to generate that power, the system will have to burn 365 x 24 x 60 minutes x 60 seconds x 15 pellets per second x 0.9 capacity = 425million fuel pellets. If the pellets cost the <b>suggested</b> <b>price</b> of 50 cents each, that is over $200million a year to fuel the plant. The average rate for wholesale electricity in the US [...] is around 5 cents/kWh, so this power has a commercial value of about $212million, suggesting that LIFE.2 would just barely cover, on average, its own fuel costs.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} <b>suggested</b> <b>prices</b> in the Dutch retail market for gasoline. <b>Suggested</b> <b>prices</b> are announced by large oil companies with the suggestion that retailers follow them. There {{are at least two}} competing rationales for the existence of suggested prices: they may either help retailers translate changes in international gasoline spot market prices into retail prices, or they may coordinate retail prices. We show that there is, next to the international spot market prices, additional information in <b>suggested</b> <b>prices</b> that explains retail prices. Therefore, we conclude that <b>suggested</b> <b>prices</b> help to coordinate retail prices. gasoline markets, collusion, <b>price</b> setting, <b>suggested</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{asymmetric}} price {{responses of}} individual firms, via daily retail prices {{of almost all}} gasoline stations in the Netherlands and <b>suggested</b> <b>prices</b> of the five largest oil companies over more than two years. I find that 38 % of the stations respond asymmetrically {{to changes in the}} spot market price. Hence, asymmetric pricing is not a feature of the market as a whole, but of individual firms. For asymmetrically pricing stations, the asymmetry is substantial directly after a change but disappears after one or two days. I study station-specific characteristics and conclude that asymmetric pricing seems to be a phenomenon that is randomly distributed across stations. I also find that none of the five largest oil companies adjust their <b>suggested</b> <b>prices</b> asymmetrically. price setting, asymmetric price responses, gasoline markets...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} simple {{behavioral}} {{explanation of why}} manufacturers frequently announce non-binding <b>suggested</b> retail <b>prices</b> for their products. Our model {{is based on the}} assumption that once the actual price for a product exceeds its <b>suggested</b> retail <b>price,</b> the marginal propensity to consume suddenly jumps downward. This property of individual demand corresponds to Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of loss aversion. We show that it may induce a monopolistic retailer to set the price equal to the <b>suggested</b> retail <b>price</b> in equilibrium, although the latter price is nonbinding. This, in turn, leads to a shift of profits from the retailer to the manufacturer...|$|R
