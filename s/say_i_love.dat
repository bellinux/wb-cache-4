500|$|Poitier and Wilder became friends, {{with the}} pair working {{together}} on a script called Traces—which became 1982's Hanky Panky, the film where Wilder met comedian Gilda Radner. Through {{the remainder of the}} decade, Wilder and Radner worked on several projects together. After Hanky Panky, Wilder directed his third film, 1984's The Woman in Red, which starred Wilder, Radner, and Kelly Le Brock. The Woman in Red was not well received by the critics, nor was their next project, 1986's Haunted Honeymoon, which failed to attract audiences. The Woman in Red did win an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Stevie Wonder's song [...] "I Just Called to <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> You".|$|E
500|$|Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, John Mayer, Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Jermaine Jackson, and Shaheen Jafargholi {{performed}} at the event. Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies, while Queen Latifah read [...] "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by Maya Angelou. The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." [...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ... I just wanted to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> him ... so much." [...] Reverend Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.|$|E
500|$|The 30 March 1967 photo {{session with}} Cooper also {{produced}} {{the back cover}} and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying [...] "an obvious and immediate warmth... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images". McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into in those days was eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, {{if you look at it}} you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Schuur {{appeared}} as a guest performer on Sesame Street. In an interview by Elmo, she answered questions about how a blind person can learn to use other senses to get along in the world. In 1998, she was a special guest on [...] "Ray Charles in Concert", {{a benefit for the}} Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. [...] She performed at Carnegie Hall in a tribute to Irving Berlin in 1988, and again in 1996 in a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. Schuur gave a performance in 1999 to honor Stevie Wonder at The Kennedy Center Honors. She sang [...] "I Just Called to <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> You" [...] arranged and accompanied by Herbie Hancock. Entertainment writer Jake Elyachar rated this {{as one of the top}} 20 best performances ever given on the Kennedy Honors series. Wonder was visibly emotionally moved by the performance. She was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the Blind in 2000. Late in 2003, Schuur released Midnight, featuring original songs written by Barry Manilow for the album. Manilow's long-time songwriting team, which included co-producer Eddie Arkin, and lyricists Marty Panzer, Bruce Susan, and Adrienne Anderson, contributed to the project.

500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy {{but it sounds like}} it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
