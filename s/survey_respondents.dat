5|$|Ownby {{confirms}} {{estimates that}} Falun Gong is practiced {{by hundreds of}} thousands of people outside China, with the largest communities found in Taiwan and in North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, and Toronto. Demographic surveys by sociologist Susan Palmer and David Ownby in North American communities found that 90% of practitioners were ethnic Chinese (in Europe, there are proportionally more Caucasians). The average age was approximately 42. Among <b>survey</b> <b>respondents,</b> 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master's degrees, and 24% had a bachelor's degree.|$|E

25|$|A 1989 {{survey found}} that 75.8 percent of its {{respondents}} believed that abortion should be legally permitted if the mother's life is in danger or the child would be born deformed.

25|$|In addition, {{the police}} were widely seen as often corrupt and {{involved}} in crimes, and crime rates had been rising since the 1980s. Trust in most police is generally low (particularly in Caracas, with some exceptions for municipal police of wealthier municipalities in Caracas), and only around a third of violent crimes are reported to the police, with half of <b>survey</b> <b>respondents</b> citing a lack of belief that the police would do anything.|$|E
25|$|The government's {{popularity}} {{continued to}} decline into July, when <b>survey</b> <b>respondents</b> in Bangkok and outlying areas gave the government an average score of 4.32 out of 10. The average score had been 4.53 in March 2007 and 5.27 in January 2007. Fewer than 15% of {{respondents in the}} survey felt that the nation's overall situation had improved during the government's nine-month tenure, while 31.6% said the situation remained unchanged and the majority, 34.9% said it had worsened.|$|E
25|$|However, neither {{group of}} {{countries}} was pro-gender {{equality in the}} sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of <b>survey</b> <b>respondents</b> believe that a man has more right to a job than a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way. These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{each year}} an {{estimated}} 30 million people ride horses, resulting in 50,000 emergency room visits (1 visit per 600 riders per year). A survey of 679 equestrians in Oregon, Washington and Idaho estimated {{that at some}} time in their equestrian career one in five will be seriously injured, resulting in hospitalization, surgery or long-term disability. Among <b>survey</b> <b>respondents,</b> novice equestrians had an incidence of any injury that was threefold over intermediates, fivefold over advanced equestrians, and nearly eightfold over professionals. Approximately 100 hours of experience are required to achieve a substantial decline in the risk of injury. The survey authors conclude that efforts to prevent equestrian injury should focus on novice equestrians.|$|E
25|$|The Western U.S. is {{the largest}} region of the country, {{covering}} {{more than half the}} land area of the United States. It is also the most geographically diverse, incorporating geographic regions such as the temperate rainforests of the Northwest, the highest mountain ranges (including the Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada, the Great Plains, and all of the desert areas located in the United States (the Mojave, Sonoran, Great Basin, and Chihuahua deserts). Given this expansive and diverse geography it is no wonder the region is difficult to specifically define. Sensing a possible shift in the popular understanding of the West as a region in the early 1990s, historian Walter Nugent conducted a survey of three groups of professionals with ties to the region: a large group of Western historians (187 respondents), and two smaller groups, 25 journalists and publishers and 39 Western authors. A majority of the historian respondents placed the eastern boundary of the West east of the Census definition out on {{the eastern edge of the}} Great Plains or on the Mississippi River. The <b>survey</b> <b>respondents</b> as a whole showed just how little agreement there was on the boundaries of the West.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} method to standard opinion polls {{was used by}} the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino. A survey was conducted of 400 individuals, with 98 individuals positively identified as Native Americans. Surveyors verified Native American status of respondents claiming Native affiliation. Most Native American <b>survey</b> <b>respondents</b> were collected at pow-wows, a form of non-probabilistic convenience sampling. 67% of the Native Americans (n=66) polled agreed with the statement that [...] "Redskins" [...] is racial or racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.|$|E
500|$|Several {{historians and}} {{commentators}} hold {{the view that}} Bush {{was one of the}} most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a [...] "transformative" [...] one, and said that [...] "some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as [...] "the most noteworthy president since FDR" [...] and said that the Patriot Act [...] "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" [...] as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration, and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The <b>survey</b> <b>respondents</b> gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.|$|E
