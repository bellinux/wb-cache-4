40|$|Abstract. A focused {{ion beam}} (FIB) coupled with high {{resolution}} electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) {{has emerged as a}} useful tool for generating crystallographic information in reasonably large volumes of microstructure. In principle, data generation is reasonably straightforward whereby the FIB is used as a high precision serial <b>sectioning</b> <b>device</b> for generating consecutive milled surfaces suitable for mapping by EBSD. However, there are several challenges facing the technique including the need for accurate reconstruction of the EBSD slice data and the development of methods for representing the myriad microstructural features of interest including, for example, orientation gradients arising from plastic deformation through to the structure of grains and their interfaces in both single-phase and multi-phase materials. This paper provides an overview of the use of 3 D-EBSD in the study of texture development in alloys during deformation and annealing and includes an update on current research on the crystallographic nature of microbands in some body centred and face centred cubic alloys and the nucleation and growth of grains in an extra low carbon steel...|$|E
40|$|Within water {{distribution}} networks sectioning valves {{are widely used}} in order to regulate the flow and to operate on the pipelines. The most of the sectioning valves are quite old {{and have to be}} operated manually. Because {{of the cost of the}} measuring devices, flow and pressure meters are only marginally used within the network. Finally, fisical and chemical parameters of the water are generally measured only at the network intake. As a consequence, the knowledge of the networks’ status is rather poor and, in many cases, the response of the technical management to anomalies is very slow. Another problem coming form the lack of knowledge is connected to leak detection. In order to asses the amount of leaching, the balance between the volume of water supplied to the network and the total volume distributed to the users has to be performed over large areas. Therefore, the exact location of leaching is possible only whenever large volumes of water are lost. The new device is designed to attain different goals: transform a traditional gate valve in a monitoring and sectioning valve; obtain an easy access to the pipeline without necessity of flow shut down; perform real time remote control in several point of the network. The proposed machine differs from the already known system for measuring and sectioning pipelines within networks for fluid transportation because of its unique configuration, allowing a low cost and easy solution for using different measuring and sectionig devices in the same point of a the pipe. Patents are pending on the machinary and on most application thereof. The new monitoring and <b>sectioning</b> <b>device</b> can be used in almost all cases where flow, pressure or chemical parameters of fluid have to be measurered, or flow regulation is required. The new valve can handle, alternatively, the following situations: -flow regulation along water supply pipelines. Flow regulation can be operated manually or automatically by remote control. -automatic closure of the pipeline in presence of anomaluous water quality parameters; -automatic closure of the pipeline in presence of pipeline failure; -flow rate measurement. A large size flow meter can be inserted in the pipeline without flow shut down. -pressure measurement. A pressure tranducer can be inserted in the pipeline without flow shut down. -water quality measurement. A water quality probe can be inserted in the pipeline without flow shut down. -in deteriorated distribution networks. A leak detection probe, like an hydrophone, can be inserted in the pipeline and/or recovered. The new valve is suited for the following industries: -Municipal water supplies; -Industrial water supplies; -Irrigation water supplies; -Oil industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{generate}} three dimensional (3 D) microstructures in solids is of great importance in understanding their true nature, as it eliminates speculation about the spatial distribution of features associated with conventional two dimensional (2 D) imaging techniques. There are several recently-developed 3 D techniques for determining the spatial distribution of microstructural features, each with a given resolution. There is considerable interest {{in the development of}} a specific serial sectioning methodology, termed 3 D electron backscatter diffraction (3 D-EBSD), which combines a focused ion beam (FIB) with EBSD interfaced to a field emission gun scanning electron microscope. Here, FIB is used as a serial <b>sectioning</b> <b>device</b> for cutting parallel slices of single- and multi-phase materials with a site-specific accuracy of up to 50 nm. Each consecutive slice is mapped by EBSD and the complete dataset combined using advanced computer algorithms to generate a volume of a material whereby the true crystallographic features can be analyzed at submicron resolution. The aims of the thesis was to develop 3 D-EBSD into a powerful materials analysis tool and use it to resolve several issues concerning the nature of the deformed state and the nucleation and the growth behaviour of recrystallizing grains. The study commenced with an investigation into the effect of material type (restricted to face centred cubic AI, Cu and Au metallic crystals), FIB milling conditions and EBSD software variables on the quality of EBSD patterns generated on ion-milled surfaces of these materials. The effect of material type on EBSD pattern quality following FIB milling was found to be significant with relatively poor quality EBSD patterns obtained for metals of low atomic number. It was demonstrated, particularly for the high atomic number metals, that moderate FIB milling currents (~ 1 - 5 nA) generated good quality EBSD maps from a given ion-milled surface. This preliminary work was necessary for balancing the time required for serial sectioning during 3 D-EBSD and the generation of sufficient quality EBSD maps from each ion-milled surface. The outcomes of this investigation were applied to two major 3 D-EBSD investigations on the microstructural and crystallographic characteristics of: (i) deformation features generated in a cold rolled interstitial free (IF) steel, with particular emphasis on the formation of microbands; and (ii) recrystallization of a cold rolled nickel alloy containing coarse (> 1 µm) silica particles, with particular attention given to the generation of particle deformation zones and their influence on nucleation and growth of recrystallizing grains including particle stimulated nucleation (PSN), twin formation during PSN and the growth behaviour of various types of grain boundary into the deformation microstructure. The foregoing 3 D-EBSD studies were significant as they revealed various microstructural and crystallographic features not usually clearly evident in conventional 2 D micrographs obtained by either EBSD or optical metallography. For example, the technique demonstrated that microbands in cold rolled IF steel consist of irregular curved surfaces that reconcile findings that microbands straight and aligned parallel to slip planes when viewed in normal direction-rolling direction sections but are wavy in transverse direction-rolling direction sections. Three slip planes were found within the angular range of the curved surface of the microband, which indicates that multiple slip planes are operative during deformation. The work also showed the influence of particle diameter on the misorientations generated within particle deformation zones and clearly showed that particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) occurred at particles greater than 1. 5 - 2 µm. It was observed that PSN in the nickel sample also generates contiguous grains separated by both coherent and incoherent twin boundaries and, on further growth of these grains into the matrix, the coherent boundary dominates and remains parallel to the primary growth direction of the grains...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{simplified}} one-dimensional {{steady-state analysis}} of thermoelectric phenomena and on analogies between thermal and electrical domains, we propose both lumped and distributed parameter electrical models for thermoelectric devices.

For {{the case of}} distributed parameter models, material properties are calculated according to the mean temperature at each segment of a <b>sectioned</b> <b>device.</b> A couple of important advantages of the presented models are that temperature dependence of material properties is considered {{and that they can}} be easily simulated using an electronic simulation tool such as SPICE.

40|$|Abstract Background Laser {{surgery is}} an {{attractive}} alternative to other means of <b>section</b> <b>device</b> in terms of tissue inflammation and interaction, which has been extensively used in human and veterinary medicine. Although accidental ignition during laser surgeries is sporadically reported in human medical literature, to the authors’ knowledge {{this is the first}} report regarding laser-dependent fire ignition during surgery in veterinary medicine. Case presentation Two rodents, a 13 -month old, 27 -gram, male pet mouse (Mus musculus) and a 1 -year old, female Russian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), underwent surgical removal of masses with diode laser. During the surgical procedures fires ignited from the face masks. The mouse presented severe burns on the head and both forelimbs, it was hospitalized and approximately 2 [*]months after surgery burns were resolved. The hamster presented severe burns on the face and the proximal regions of the body. At 72 [*]hours from the accident the hamster was euthanized. Conclusion The present report suggests that fire ignition is a potential life-threatening complication of laser surgery in non-intubated rodents maintained under volatile anesthesia. High oxygen concentrations, the presence of combustible, and the narrowness of the surgical field with the face mask during laser surgery on rodents are risk factors for fire ignition. </p...|$|R
