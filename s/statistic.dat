5|$|Before 2000, {{there was}} no award for leading the league in save percentage. The NHL started {{counting}} the <b>statistic</b> in 1982, and this lists all the leaders from {{the inception of the}} <b>statistic</b> to the inception of the award.|$|E
5|$|Bold denotes league-leading <b>statistic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Un{{official}} <b>statistic</b> (sacks did {{not become}} an official <b>statistic</b> until 1982); however, this number is stated on Taylor's Pro Football Hall of Fame bio and {{is considered to be}} accurate.|$|E
5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each <b>statistic</b> has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, the effectiveness of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP <b>statistic</b> and a maximum HP <b>statistic,</b> ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana <b>statistic.</b> Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E
5|$|In ice hockey, a {{combination}} of a player's goals and assists are collectively called points. Penalty minutes are the total number of minutes assigned to a player for infractions assessed during the season. Plus-minus is a <b>statistic</b> that tracks when a player was on the ice while goals were scored, both for and against their team, though some in game situations will not effect the <b>statistic.</b> Below is a listing of all player statistics for the Blue Jackets during the season.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that there}} is no {{limitations}} in breed-profession combinations, although some breeds will encounter maximum <b>statistic</b> possible for certain traits earlier than others.|$|E
5|$|Save {{percentage}} did {{not become}} an official NHL <b>statistic</b> until the 1982–1983 season. Therefore, goaltenders who played before 1982 do not have official save percentages.|$|E
5|$|The below tables {{list the}} top five (including ties) {{performers}} by yardage in the indicated <b>statistic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before 1983, {{there was}} no award for leading the League in plus-minus. The NHL started {{counting}} the statistics in 1967, and this lists all the leaders from {{the inception of the}} <b>statistic</b> to the inception of the award.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970-2004, inland {{flooding}} from tropical cyclones {{caused a}} majority of the fatalities in the United States. This <b>statistic</b> changed in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina's impact alone shifted the most deadly aspect of tropical cyclones back to storm surge, which has historically been the most deadly aspect of strong tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Men's: Kyle Collinsworth (BYU) with 12 — six in 2014–15 and six {{again as}} a senior in 2015–16. Prior to the triple-double being tracked as an NCAA <b>statistic,</b> Oscar Robertson (Cincinnati) had 10—five in 1958–59 and five in 1959–60.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 2014, Cody was re-signed by the Ravens. He only {{appeared}} {{in one game}} in the 2014 season and did not record a single <b>statistic</b> that year.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{ended his}} career with 1,089 tackles, 132.5 sacks (not {{counting}} the 9.5 sacks he recorded as a rookie because sacks did not become an official <b>statistic</b> until 1982), nine interceptions, 134 return yards, two touchdowns, 33 forced fumbles, 11 fumble recoveries, and 34 fumble return yards.|$|E
5|$|Although {{combat in}} the game follows a {{strictly}} turn-based formula, the turn sequence of the characters you have are calculated based on the speed <b>statistic</b> of the character, {{and in some cases}} characters are allowed to strike before enemies can act if they possess sufficient speed. Different attacks can take varied periods of time to execute.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Halo titles, 343 Industries provides a <b>statistic</b> tracking service for players of Halo 4. Player data such as game history, character progression, and various statistics {{can be accessed}} in game or via the Halo Waypoint website. The web services team at 343 Industries utilized the Windows Azure Service Bus messaging infrastructure to relay data from the Xbox Live network to back-end databases, where player data and information is stored. Halo 4 player data can also be accessed via the Xbox SmartGlass application.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists often support {{use of the}} Human Development Index as a {{composite}} <b>statistic</b> {{in order to assess}} countries by their overall level of human development, as opposed to other measures. The HDI takes into account a broad array of measures beyond monetary considerations including life expectancy, literacy, education, and standards of living for all countries worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, 3% of {{the parish}} {{population}} were unemployed and 25% were retired. The retirement figure increased in the Pinelands and Ravenswing areas, with a <b>statistic</b> of 42%. Most residents' places of work are in surrounding towns, with their location in the parish largely dictating {{where to look for}} work. The 2005 survey identified that residents in the south {{of the parish}} (Falcon Fields and Ravenswing/Pinelands) travel towards Tadley and Basingstoke whereas those further north in the parish tend to find work in Reading, Newbury and London.|$|E
5|$|Including the 20 seasons the League tracked plus-minus as a <b>statistic</b> {{without an}} award, the Boston Bruins {{have led the}} League 11 times (six by Bobby Orr and twice by David Krejci, the only other repeat leaders), Edmonton Oilers five times (four by Wayne Gretzky, {{including}} three official awards) and four times each by players on the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|Informes sobre educación, 1856. This {{report was}} the first {{official}} <b>statistic</b> report on education in Latin America includes information on gender and location distribution of pupils, salaries and wages, and comparative achievement. Informes sobre educación proposes new theories, plans, and methods of education as well as quality controls on schools and learning systems.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career {{home run}} record. Hit in Milwaukee like the {{previous}} one, {{this was a}} solo home run off Chris Capuano of the Brewers. This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest slugging percentage (a <b>statistic</b> that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|E
5|$|The 1952 Browns {{had eight}} regular-season wins {{and won the}} NFL's East Division, but lost to the Detroit Lions in the 1952 NFL Championship Game. Ford, meanwhile, {{extended}} his run of dominance against opposing offenses in an era before the quarterback sack was a recorded <b>statistic.</b> For the second consecutive year, he was named a first-team All-Pro by both the AP and UPI and was selected for the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The American kestrel is not long-lived, with a {{lifespan}} of <5 {{years for}} wild birds. The oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can {{live up to}} 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This <b>statistic</b> is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} stay-at-home dads began {{gradually}} increasing {{in the late}} 20th century, especially in developed Western nations. The recent <b>statistic</b> that Pew Research released, showed a report in June 2014 that found 2 million men to be stay-at-home dads in the US. However, in 2010, the number of stay-at-home dads had reached its highest point of 2.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson <b>statistic</b> for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E
5|$|After {{two seasons}} in the NBA, Grant decided to end his {{professional}} basketball career. He contacted the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL and agreed {{to play for the}} team during the 1951 NFL season. In his first season with the Eagles, Grant played as a defensive end and led the team in sacks (an unofficial <b>statistic</b> at the time). He switched to offense as a wide receiver for his second season with the club and ranked second in the NFL for receiving yardage, with 997yards on fifty-six catches, including seven touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Bahrain {{has been}} {{connected}} to the internet since 1995 with the country's domain suffix is '.bh'. The country's connectivity score (a <b>statistic</b> which measures both Internet access and fixed and mobile telephone lines) is 210.4 percent per person, while the regional average in Arab States of the Persian Gulf is 135.37 percent. The number of Bahraini internet users has risen from 40,000 in 2000 to 250,000 in 2008, or from 5.95 to 33 percent of the population. As of August 2013, the TRA has licensed 22 Internet Service Providers.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} <b>statistic.</b> There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|Conversations {{with the}} {{previous}} game's protagonists increased the Cadet's standing with them: if the player tapped a special button on-screen during timed sections of the conversation, the bond <b>statistic</b> with the chosen character would be increased. The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{retired as}} a player {{following}} the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 {{out of a possible}} 190 games, and recorded 78.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official <b>statistic</b> until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. His spot in the lineup was technically not replaced; the Steelers switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which has only one nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously in the years since Greene's retirement, and more recently have used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn. The Djinn are scattered in hiding throughout the game; once found, they can be allocated to each character. They {{form the basis of}} the game's <b>statistic</b> enhancement, as well as the system that dictates the character's Psynergy capabilities. Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's character class, subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform.|$|E
25|$|If {{there exists}} a minimal {{sufficient}} <b>statistic,</b> and this is usually the case, then every complete sufficient <b>statistic</b> is necessarily minimal sufficient(note that this statement does not exclude the option of a pathological {{case in which a}} complete sufficient exists while there is no minimal sufficient <b>statistic).</b> While it is hard to find cases in which a minimal sufficient <b>statistic</b> does not exist, it is not so hard to find cases {{in which there is no}} complete <b>statistic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Batting {{average is}} a <b>statistic</b> in cricket, baseball, and {{softball}} that measures {{the performance of}} batsmen in cricket and batters in baseball. The development of the baseball <b>statistic</b> {{was influenced by the}} cricket <b>statistic.</b>|$|E
25|$|In other words, a {{sufficient}} <b>statistic</b> T(X) for a parameter θ is a <b>statistic</b> {{such that the}} conditional distribution of the data X, given T(X), {{does not depend on}} the parameter θ.|$|E
25|$|A <b>statistic</b> is {{a random}} {{variable}} {{that is a}} function of the random sample, but not a function of unknown parameters. The probability distribution of the <b>statistic,</b> though, may have unknown parameters.|$|E
25|$|Derive the {{distribution}} of the test <b>statistic</b> under the null hypothesis from the assumptions. In standard cases this will be a well-known result. For example, the test <b>statistic</b> might follow a Student's t distribution or a normal distribution.|$|E
25|$|In statistics, when a p-value {{is used as}} a test <b>statistic</b> for {{a simple}} null hypothesis, and the {{distribution}} of the test <b>statistic</b> is continuous, then the p-value is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 if the null hypothesis is true.|$|E
