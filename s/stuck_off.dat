5000|$|He was {{appointed}} Lieutenant, Royal Artillery 25 Aug 1880 and took more military training in England. He {{was appointed}} Lieutenant in the Active Militia, Province of Ontario 16 July 1880. He resigned his commission in June 1881. On May 12, 1898 {{he was promoted}} Major, Sixth [...] "London" [...] Field Battery in London, Ontario. Before the war, he served with the Canadian Artillery, a Unit of the Active Militia. He had served previously with the Royal Artillery. He belonged to the 6th Battery Militia and Royal Rothesay. He was 5'61/2 inches and 124 pounds and 57 years of age when he enlisted for World War I, on December 3, 1915. He was an oil operator and Medical Doctor. The military were not exactly keen to send a 57 year-old to the frontline, particularly one who was an experienced soldier. So he spent time training new recruits first in Canada, then in England. Although {{he wanted to go}} overseas and fight, he was told that he couldn’t because he was too old.Eventually, Fairbank got his wish to fight on the front lines in France. He fought in the trenches at the battle of the Somme for the 70th Battalion, but the Canadian military had different plans for him. They sent Fairbank a letter asking him to return from the front, as they believed his skills would be better put to use training younger soldiers and supporting the war effort at home by giving speeches in support of the war effort, thus helping the army recruit new soldiers. He came back to Canada to give barnburner speeches around the region, including during a parade in Sarnia. He served in the Army in Canada, England and France during World War I with the 70th Battalion, 59th Battalion, 18th Battalion and Headquarters Staff M.D. #1. He initially served overseas as a Major with the 70th Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Forces from Aug 1915-September 1916. He embarked Halifax SS Lapland April 24, 1916 and disembarked in Liverpool on May 5/16. He transferred to the 39th Battalion on 11-7-16. He served with the 39th Battalion 2-8-16. He served in France with the 18th Battalion from 3 August 1916 to 10 October 1916. He served as Commanding Officer, Base Commandant in Boulogne 10/10/16. He left for England 10/10/16. He served in the War Office 2/10/16 where he was <b>stuck</b> <b>off</b> strength of 18th Battalion and returned for a post in Canada.

30|$|Digital systems {{should provide}} {{services}} {{according to the}} specifications reliably. Impairments of dependability {{are associated with a}} large class of faults, errors and failures. These impairments may be caused by design, produce or rarely operational imperfections and improper use. There are lots of possible circuit failures: single stuck at 0 or 1 faults, delay and synchronization faults, bridging and open faults, in Metal Oxide Semiconductor technique (MOS) these faults consist in transistor stuck on or <b>stuck</b> <b>off</b> in a logical gates [1]. Some faults cannot be logically represented. Other class of faults can be connected with operational timing frequency and they are related to change impedance parameters, but in that case the built-in testing {{is one of the most}} resistant technique because of common silicon space. Faults that are stimulated may manifest itself as an error. For do that the fault have to be stimulated and propagated to one of internal (to memory module of sequential circuit) or external (primary) circuit output. The error, that is accessible from circuit output, is an information on detected fault and indicates that functional specification of circuit is violated. There is therefore a need for hardware testing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{recursive}} training algorithm for {{the optimal}} interpolative (OI) classification network is extended to include distributed fault tolerance. The conventional OI Net learning algo-rithm leads to network weights that are nonoptimally distributed (in {{the sense of}} fault tolerance). Fault tolerance is becoming an increasingly important factor in hardware implementations of neural networks. But fault tolerance is often taken for granted in neural networks rather than being explicitly accounted for in the architecture or learning algorithm. In addition, when fault toler-ance is considered, it is often accounted for using an unrealistic fault model (e. g., neurons that are <b>stuck</b> on or <b>off</b> rather than small weight perturbations). Realistic fault tolerance can be achieved through a smooth distribution of weights, resulting in low weight salience and distributed computation. Results of trained OI Nets on the Iris classification problem show that fault tolerance can be increased with the algorithm presented in this paper.

5000|$|Around nightfall, a typhoon {{caused the}} Mongol ship captains {{to suggest that}} the land force reembark {{in order to avoid the}} risk of being marooned on Japanese soil. By daybreak, only a few ships had not set out to sea. Those that had were {{destroyed}} by the storm. Some accounts offer casualty reports that suggest 200 Mongol ships were lost. However, small Japanese boats were much more swift and maneuverable than Mongol ships, and the Japanese were able to board the remaining ships of the crippled Mongol army. The samurai approached and boarded the ships under cover of darkness and fell on the invaders ferociously. In the small confines of the ships, during the predawn darkness, the Mongols (trained as cavalrymen and horse archers) were unable to bring their bows to bear effectively. However, the long, thin Japanese swords got <b>stuck</b> and snapped <b>off</b> in the thick, boiled leather armor of the Mongols, causing Japanese blacksmiths to reevaluate their swords after the first invasion. This led to the beginning of the divergence of the katana from existing tachi swords in the 13th and 14th century.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} for robots {{to be able to}} decide whether they can go through a space or not, as they navigate through a dynamic environment. This capability can help them avoid injury or serious damage, e. g., as a result of running into people and obstacles, getting <b>stuck,</b> or falling <b>off</b> an edge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised and a near-unsupervised method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to classify scenarios as traversable or not based on visual data. Our method is inspired by the recent success of data-driven approaches on computer vision problems and anomaly detection, and reduces the need for vast amounts of negative examples at training time. Collecting negative data indicating that a robot should not go through a space is typically hard and dangerous because of collisions, whereas collecting positive data can be automated and done safely based on the robot's own traveling experience. We verify the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach on a test dataset collected in a previously unseen environment with a mobile robot. Furthermore, we show that our method can be used to build costmaps (we call as "GoNoGo" costmaps) for robot path planning using visual data only.

50|$|Deaths Ragged Army: (Vol. 7,2; June 1936) Beginning of The Purple Invasion story arc.

60|$|Certainly if any {{one wants}} solitude, the place is Lympne. It is in the clay part of Kent, and my {{bungalow}} stood {{on the edge of}} an old sea cliff and stared across the flats of Romney Marsh at the sea. In very wet weather the place is almost inaccessible, and I have heard that at times the postman used to traverse the more succulent portions of his route with boards upon his feet. I never saw him doing so, but I can quite imagine it. Outside the doors of the few cottages and houses that make up the present village big birch besoms are <b>stuck,</b> to wipe <b>off</b> the worst of the clay, which will give some idea of the texture of the district. I doubt if the place would be there at all, if it were not a fading memory of things gone for ever. It was the big port of England in Roman times, Portus Lemanis, and now the sea is four miles away. All down the steep hill are boulders and masses of Roman brickwork, and from it old Watling Street, still paved in places, starts like an arrow to the north. I used to stand on the hill and think of it all, the galleys and legions, the captives and officials, the women and traders, the speculators like myself, all the swarm and tumult that came clanking {{in and out of the}} harbour. And now just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slope, and a sheep or two--and I. And where the port had been were the levels of the marsh, sweeping round in a broad curve to distant Dungeness, and dotted here and there with tree clumps and the church towers of old medical towns that are following Lemanis now towards extinction.|$|R
40|$|The Yowlumne {{field is}} a giant field in the {{southern}} San Joaquin basin, Kern County, California. It is a deep (13, 000 ft) waterflood operation that produces from the Miocene- aged Stevens Sand. The reservoir is interpreted as a layered, fan-shaped, prograding turbidite complex containing several lobe-shaped sand bodies that represent distinct flow units. A high ultimate recovery factor is expected, yet significant quantities of undrained oil remain at the fan margins. The fan margins are not economic to develop using vertical wells because of thinning pay, deteriorating rock quality, and depth. This project attempts to demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting the northeast distal fan margin {{through the use of}} a high- angle well completed with multiple hydraulic- fracture treatments. A high-angle well offers greater pay exposure than can be achieved with a vertical well. Hydraulic-fracture treatments will establish vertical communication between thin interbedded layers and the wellbore. The equivalent production rate and reserves of three vertical wells are anticipated at a cost of approximately two vertical wells. The near-horizontal well penetrated the Yowlumne sand; a Stevens sand equivalent, in the distal fan margin in the northeast area of the field. The well was drilled in a predominately westerly direction towards the interior of the field, in the direction of improving rock quality. Drilling and completion operations proved to be very challenging, leading to a number of adjustments to original plans. Hole conditions resulted in obtaining less core material than desired and setting intermediate casing 1200 ft too high. The 7 in. production liner <b>stuck</b> 1000 ft <b>off</b> bottom, requiring a 5 in. liner to be run the rest of the way. The cement job on the 5 in. liner resulted in a very poor bond, which precluded one of three hydraulic fracture treatments originally planned for the well. Openhole logs confirmed most expectations going into the project about basic rock properties: the formation was shaly with low porosities, and water saturations were in line with expectations, including the presence of some intervals swept out by the waterflood. High water saturations at the bottom of the well eliminated one of the originally planned hydraulic fracture treatments. Although porosities proved to be low, they were more uniform across the formation than expected. Permeabilities of the various intervals continue to be evaluated, but appear to be better than expected from the porosity log model derived in Budget Period One. The well was perforated in all pay sections behind the 5 in. liner. Production rates and phases agree nicely with log calculations, fractional flow calculations, and an analytical technique used to predict the rate performance of the well...|$|R
