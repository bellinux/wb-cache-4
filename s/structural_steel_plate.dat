40|$|AbstractThin walled steel members, such as cold-formed steel (CFS) members, are {{susceptible}} for local buckling at low loads. However, initiation of local buckling of elements {{does not necessarily}} mean the ultimate limit state of the member, and thin-walled plate elements can exhibit substantial post-buckling strength. International cold-formed steel design specifications recognize the post-buckling strength of uniformly compressed stiffened and unstiffened elements, and the post-buckling strength of stiffened and unstiffened webs in flexure. However, potential post-buckling shear strength of webs is not considered in CFS design specifications, though post-buckling shear strength of stiffened webs is considered in <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> girder design. The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the post-buckling shear strength of thin-walled cold-formed steel members. This numerical investigation is based on finite element method. This paper presents the finite element modelling details associated with the thick/thin plates representing the web of a cold-formed steel member. The study considered simply-supported rectangular plates subjected to in-plane shear loadings experiencing buckling, post-buckling, and yielding until failure. The plate was modelled using geometrically non-linear quadrilateral shell elements, and non-linear steel stress-strain relationship derived from experiments. Total Langrangian with large displacement/small strain formulation was used for such analyses. The model also considered the initial geometric imperfections. The first part of the investigation established the ultimate shear strength of plates having different parametric dimensions. The next part compared such results with the strength values based on the current code provisions. For slender plates, the current code uses the shear buckling load as the strength, whereas the analyses indicated significant post-buckling strength.

Some states limit the maximum transportable length of a member to 120 ft and the weight to 70 tons. Others, including Nebraska, have permitted lengths up to 175 ft and weights up to 100 tons. ^ When span lengths exceed the maximum shippable length or weight, however, girder segments must be spliced at intermediate locations in the girder away from the piers. ^ There are several other ways to extend the span capacity limits of standard products. These include using high strength concrete, establishing moment continuity for superimposed deck and live loading, and utilizing pier geometry to allow longer spans. Each of these methods is discussed and examples are provided. ^ This dissertation discusses the design and construction of spliced-girder bridges. Design theory, post-tensioning analysis and details, segment-to-segment joint details and examples of recently constructed spliced-girder bridges are given. ^ In recent years the trend towards increased span capacity of girder bridges has continued due to the need for improved safety and fast bridge replacement. Precast concrete members must now span further while minimizing the superstructure depth in order to compete favorably with a new breed of high performance structural steel I-beams. This dissertation presents four systems for creating continuous spliced concrete I-girders. ^ For continuous large span precast prestressed concrete spliced I-girder bridges, the optimum solution is often a haunched girder system. Because of the need to use standard sizes as repetitively as possible and to clear overhead obstructions during shipping, a separate precast haunch block attached to the girder bottom flange is used to form a deeper section for the negative moment zone. ^ This dissertation summarizes an extensive theoretical and experimental research into the feasibility of splicing a haunch block onto a standard I-girder to form an efficient negative moment zone. ...|$|E

Roadways are also constructed for temporary use in the resource industry, for remote site construction, and for disaster relief. Although temporary roads have been used for almost as long as permanent ones, little research has been done to optimize their design in view of their relatively short service lives or to investigate the advantages of constructing them with reusable materials or employing structural systems that require minimal subgrade preparation. With this in mind, {{the purpose of this study}} is to conduct research to determine the feasibility of a reusable, modular road plate system requiring minimal preparation of the subgrade. This thesis presents a literature review, summarizing the currently available products that perform a similar function and the methods currently available to design such products, including terramechanics and foundation design. Alternative concept designs for a modular road plate system are then introduced. Following this, a simple <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> system is designed to resist vertical, traffic-induced loads using several methods. Specifically, an equivalent thickness method and finite element (FE) analysis are employed. Different loading conditions, soil conditions, and plate assemblies (i. e. boundary conditions) are compared. The different loading conditions include: single and multi-wheel loading, and centre versus edge loading of the plate. The different modelled plate assemblies include: single plates, four plates assembled with fixed connections, and four plates assembled with hinged connections. Structural steel plates are considered in the FE analysis study, in order to develop the design methodology, prior to applying it to the other materials or structural systems. Soil properties and panel thicknesses are studied covering a broad range of conditions under which temporary roadways may be built. Thirty scenarios are created from five soil types and six panel thicknesses. With the different loading and boundary conditions investigated, a total of 120 scenarios are analyzed in total, using several different FE models. The results from the FE analysis studies show that there is a significant difference between hinged and fixed connected panels, and that these different boundary conditions can be considered by modelling a single plate that is centre loaded (to represent a multi-plate system with fixed plate connections) or a single plate that is edge loaded (to represent a multi-plate system with hinged plate connections).

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of hollow and concrete filled steel columns fabricated from thin steel plates. The columns are investigated under axial, uniaxial and biaxial loading. The currently available international standards for composite structures {{are limited to}} the design of concrete filled steel columns with compact sections and yield stress of steel up to 460 N/mm 2. This thesis consists of both experimental and analytical studies and design recommendations for future use. Three comprehensive series of experimental tests are conducted on hollow and concrete filled steel columns. The principal parameters that have been considered in the test programmes are the slenderness of the component plates, the yield stress of the steel and the loading conditions. In the first test series, three slender hollow steel columns and three slender composite columns are tested under uniaxial loading. The steel utilised is mild steel. High strength steel is utilised in the second test programme. In this test series four stub columns, eight short columns and eight slender columns are tested, each set consists of four hollow and four composite columns. Short columns are tested under axial loading to investigate the confinement effect provided by the steel casing. Slender columns are tested under uniaxial loading to investigate the coupled instability of local and global buckling. The third test programme is quite novel and considers the behaviour of hollow and concrete filled steel columns fabricated with high strength <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> and subjected to biaxial bending. In this test eight short columns and ten slender columns each of them consisting of hollow and composite columns are investigated under biaxial loading. Analytical models are developed herein to elucidate the behaviour of the hollow and composite columns considering cross section slenderness, yield stress and loading conditions. An iterative model considering the coupled global and local buckling in the elastic and plastic range incorporating material nonlinearities is developed to investigate the behaviour of slender columns fabricated from mild steel. An improved deformation control model is developed to investigate the behaviour of slender high strength steel columns considering the confinement effect and local and post-local buckling in the elastic and plastic range. Then a numerical model for biaxial bending is developed to study the behaviour of short and slender concrete filled high strength steel columns under biaxial loading incorporating interaction buckling considering material and geometric nonlinearities. The scope of the thesis presents a wide range of experimental and theoretical studies of an extremely novel nature.

Because of {{its high}} quality and reliability, {{submerged}} arc welding (SAW) {{is one of the}} chief metal-joining processes employed in industry for the manufacture of steel pipes used for vari-ous applications. This paper highlights a study and analysis of various process-control variables and important weld bead quality parameters in SAW of pipes manufactured out of <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> (IS: 2062). Mathematical models were devel-oped for the submerged arc welding of 6 -mm-thick <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> using 3. 15 -mm-diameter steel electrodes. The models were developed using the five-level factorial technique to relate the important process-control variables — welding voltage, wire feed rate, welding speed and nozzle-to-plate distance — to a few important bead-quality parameters — penetration, reinforcement, bead width, total volume of the weld bead and dilution. The models developed were checked for their adequacy with the F test. Using the models, the main and in-teraction effects of the process-control variables on important bead geometry parameters were determined quantita-tively and presented graphically. The developed models and the graphs showing the direct and interaction effects of process variables on the bead geome-try are very useful in selecting the process parameters to achieve the desired weld-bead quality. Also, the precision of the re-sults obtained with the mathematical models were tested by using conformity test runs. The test runs were conducted nearly two years after the development of mathematical models with the same ex-perimental setup, and it was found the accuracy of the predicted results is about 98 %. Further, these mathematical mod-els help to optimize SAW to make it a more cost-effective process. Submerged arc welding {{is one of the major}} fabrication processes in industr...|$|R
40|$|December 2013. ""A Thesis {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Master of Science. "Thesis supervisor: Dr. Sarah Orton. Recent events, including the bombings of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 and the World Trade Center in New York in 2001, have drawn {{attention to the fact}} that explosive loads can cause extreme damage and loss of life through catastrophic damage to structural components. Reinforced concrete slabs are an extremely common structural component in transportation, military, commercial, and utility infrastructure. Often, reinforced concrete slabs are not designed for blast loads and a threat reassessment during the structure's service life suggests the need for improved resilience to blasts. This research identifies a promising retrofit system utilizing <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plating</b> and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. CFRP is used to lower dead loads and to permit the installation of the system in close quarters. A slab section is retrofitted with <b>steel</b> armor <b>plating</b> on the compression face and CFRP on the tension face, and a mechanical anchoring scheme is used to ensure the development of the full CFRP strength during flexure. A static three-point-bending test is performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of the anchoring system and to determine a static resistance function. Finally, nonlinear bending analysis is used to validate the test results, and the static test results are used in a single degree of freedom (SDOF) dynamic analysis to make predictions of dynamic behavior under blast loads.
