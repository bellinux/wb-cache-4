40|$|Briquetted {{charcoal}} was experimentally manufactured {{using the}} mixture of sawdust and woody slab wastes as the main materials. At first, sawdust wastes were carbonized in a <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>kiln</b> into the sawdust charcoal. Meanwhile, carbonized on woody slab wastes was conducted in a drum kiln yielding the slab charcoal. Further, the resulting sawdust charcoal and slab charcoal were mixed in varying respective portion, i. e. consecutively : (80 % and 20 %; 60 % and 40 %; 50 % and 50 %; 40 % and 60 %). The mixture was subsequently added with tapioca flour as binding agent at 5 percent, then molded, and compressed under 30 -ton hydraulic pressure into the briquetted charcoal. In addition, the briquetted charcoal was also correspondingly prepared from I 00 percent sawdust, and regarded as with 0 -percent woody slabs (i. e. 100 % and 0 %). Such mixture in varying portions was further asserted as treatment. The resulting briquette charcoal was subsequently examined of its {{physical and chemical properties}}, i. e. moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, density, compressive strenght, and caloric values. The result revealed that the recovery/yield sawdust charcoal was about 24. 57 - 29. 16 percent, while that of slab charcoal was 25. 26 - 39. 20 percent. Further, {{the mixture of}} sawdust charcoal and slabs charcoal at 40 % : 60 % portion brounght out the briquetted charcoal with the most satisfactory physical and chemical properties i. e. the moisture content of the briquette charcoal was in the range of 2. 50 - 4. 12 percent, ash content 13. 22 - 21. 41 percent, volatile matter 20. 22 - 21. 94 percent, fixed carbon content 56. 65 - 66. 36 percent, density 0. 412 - 0. 487 gram per cm 3, compressive strenght 16. 43 - 38. 13 kg per cm 2, and caloric value 4515 - 5834 cal per gram...|$|E
