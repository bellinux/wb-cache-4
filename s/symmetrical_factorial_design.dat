40|$|Introduction: Non-regular {{two-level}} fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs,</b> such as Plackett–Burman designs, {{are becoming}} popular choices {{in many areas}} of scientific investigation due to their run size economy and flexibility. The run size of non-regular two-level <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> is a multiple of 4. They fill the gaps left by the regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> whose run size is always a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, 32, …). In non-regular <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> each main effect is partially confounded with all the two-factor interactions not involving itself. Because of this complex aliasing structure, non-regular <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> had not received sufficient attention until recently. [...] . In practical applications of non-regular designs, it is often in the case that some of the two-factor interactions are important and need to be estimated in addition to the main effects. In this article, we consider how to select non-regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> when some of the two-factor interactions are presumably important. We propose and study a method to select the optimal non-regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> in the situation that some of the two-factor interactions are potentially important. We then discuss how to search for the best designs according to this method and present some results for the Plackett-Burman design of 12 runs...|$|R

40|$|Progresses {{in science}} and {{technology}} continuously raise new challenges to experimenters and statisticians, calling for innovation in methodological and theoretical development of experimental <b>design.</b> <b>Factorial</b> <b>designs</b> are popular experimental plans for identifying important factors. Motivated by real world applications, we construct efficient and optimal <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> with applications in the fields of, but not limited to, biomedical sciences, for drug combination determination, and marketing survey research. First, we provide a novel application of fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> to investigate a biological system with Herpes simplex virus type 1 and six antiviral drugs. We show how the sequential use of two- and three-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> can screen for important drugs and drug interactions, as well as determine potential optimal drug dosages. Second, we construct a new class of composite designs based on a two-level <b>factorial</b> <b>design</b> and a three-level orthogonal array. These new composite designs have many desirable features and are effective for factor screening and response surface modeling. Finally, motivated by the need for smaller optimal discrete choice experiments, we propose a novel application of blocked <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> for designing discrete choice experiments for estimating main effects, and main effects plus some two-factor interactions, with 100 % efficiency. These observations have major implications in the under- standing of <b>factorial</b> <b>designs,</b> ultimately leading to a better design practice and theory...|$|R
30|$|In full <b>factorial</b> <b>designs,</b> the {{experimental}} runs are performed at all combinations of factor levels. However, {{as the number}} of factors or factor levels in full <b>factorial</b> <b>design</b> increases, the number of realizations increases exponentially which requires more budget and time. If some higher-order interactions between primary factors (e.g., third-order and higher) are assumed unimportant, then information on the main effects (primary factors) and two-order interactions can be obtained by running {{only a fraction of the}} full <b>factorial</b> experiment. This <b>design</b> is the most widely and commonly used type of design in the industry that is called fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>design.</b> PB design is one of the most commonly used of fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs,</b> as a standard two-level screening design (NIST Information Technology Laboratory 2012) that will be used as the screening strategy in this article.|$|R

40|$|Two-level {{factorial}} and fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> {{have played}} {{a prominent role in}} the theory and practice of experimental design. Though commonly used in industrial experiments to identify the significant effects, it is often undesirable to perform the trials of a <b>factorial</b> <b>design</b> (or, fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>design)</b> in a completely random order. Instead, restrictions are imposed on the randomization of experimental runs. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to factorial and fractional factorial plans with different randomization restrictions (e. g., nested designs, split-plot designs, split-split-plot designs, strip-plot designs, split-lot designs, and combinations thereof). Bingham et al. (2006) proposed an approach to represent the randomization structure of <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> with randomization restrictions. This thesis introduces a related, but more general, representation referred to as randomization defining contrast subspaces (RDCSS). The RDCSS is a projective geometric formulation of randomization defining contrast subgroups (RDCSG) defined in Bingham et al. (2006) and allows for theoretical study. For <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> with different randomization structures, the mere existence of a design is not straightforward. Here, the theoretical results are developed for the existence of <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> with randomization restrictions within this unified framework. Our theory brings together results from finite projective geometry to establish the existence and construction of such designs. Specifically, for the existence of a set of disjoint RDCSSs, several results are proposed using (t- 1) -spreads and partial (t- 1) -spreads of PG(p- 1; 2). Furthermore, the theory developed here offers a systematic approach for the construction of two-level full <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> and regular fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> with randomization restrictions. Finally, when the conditions for the existence of a set of disjoint RDCSSs are violated, the data analysis is highly influenced from the overlapping pattern among the RDCSSs.
