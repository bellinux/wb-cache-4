25|$|Where trains have {{difficulty}} stopping during low adhesion conditions {{the greatest risk}} is of passing a <b>signal</b> <b>at</b> <b>danger</b> or 'over running' a station. At these times train drivers adopt 'defensive driving', which involves braking earlier and more gently than usual. Also less power is applied when starting trains.|$|E
25|$|However, {{unlike in}} the ladder, branch trains in {{opposite}} directions can collide head-on at 32 if either one passes a <b>signal</b> <b>at</b> <b>danger</b> (SPAD). This has contributed to fatal accidents, e.g. in the UK at: Glasgow Bellgrove on 6 March 1989 and Newton on 21 July 1991. These risks can be reduced by trap points, ATP or TPWS.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} disaster was identified as the Turbo train passing signal SN109 (located on an overhead gantry—gantry 8—with four other signals serving other tracks) at which {{it should have been}} held. It was established that the signal had been showing a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had been showing a single yellow which should have led the driver to be prepared for a red at SN109. Since the Thames Turbo driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, {{it was not possible to}} establish why he had passed the <b>signal</b> <b>at</b> <b>danger.</b> However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver only two weeks before the crash. His driver training was found to be defective, whilst the signalling in the Paddington area was known to have caused problems – SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years, but Hodder had no specific warning of this. Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight reflecting off yellow aspects. Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed. The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect. Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol HST drivers were re-routed as not to pass this signal.|$|E

500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, signals passed at danger (SPADs) were {{increasingly}} {{perceived as a}} significant danger to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each distant signal {{was accompanied by a}} ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted [...] "clear", an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby sounding a bell in the cab. With the <b>signal</b> <b>at</b> <b>danger,</b> the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a warning horn. In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.|$|E

2500|$|The written {{instructions}} for Railtrack signalling centre staff at Slough were {{that as soon}} as they realised that a train had passed a <b>signal</b> <b>at</b> <b>danger</b> they should set signals to danger and immediately send a radio [...] "emergency all stop" [...] signal to the driver of the train by Cab Secure Radio (CSR) as soon as they realised that it had done so. In the event, only when the Thames train was 200m past the signal did they start to send a radio [...] "emergency all stop" [...] signal (it is not clear whether the signal was actually sent before the crash). [...] Their understanding of the instructions was that they should wait to see if the driver stopped of his own accord before attempting to contact him; this interpretation was supported by their immediate manager. The signalmen had never been trained in the use of CSR, nor had they ever used it in response to a SPAD.|$|E
