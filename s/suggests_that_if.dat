5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{the name}} is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex <b>suggests</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E

She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Kiki has a surprise visit from Ursula, who determines that Kiki's crisis {{is a form of}} artist's block. Ursula <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Kiki can find a new purpose, she will regain her powers.|$|E
25|$|In some Western {{cultures}} shyness-inhibition {{plays an}} important role in psychological and social adjustment. It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection by peers, isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> social withdrawal is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.|$|E
25|$|Any ring R can {{be viewed}} as a preadditive {{category}} with a single object. With this understanding, a left R-module is nothing but a (covariant) additive functor from R to the category Ab of abelian groups. Right R-modules are contravariant additive functors. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> C is any preadditive category, a covariant additive functor from C to Ab should be considered a generalized left module over C; these functors form a functor category C-Mod which is the natural generalization of the module category R-Mod.|$|E

25|$|Nolte {{contends that}} the great decisive event of the 20th century was the Russian Revolution of 1917, which plunged all of Europe into a long-simmering civil war that lasted until 1945. To Nolte, fascism, communism's twin, arose as a desperate {{response}} by the threatened middle classes of Europe to what Nolte has often called the “Bolshevik peril”. He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> one wishes to understand the Holocaust, one should begin with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, and then understand {{the rule of the}} Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|The {{surfaces}} of copper and its alloys, such as brass and bronze, are antimicrobial. They have an inherent ability {{to kill a}} wide range of harmful microbes relatively rapidly – often within two hours or less – and {{with a high degree of}} efficiency. These antimicrobial properties have been demonstrated by an extensive body of research. The research also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> touch surfaces are made with copper alloys, the reduced transmission of disease-causing organisms can reduce patient infections in hospital intensive care units (ICU) by as much as 58%.|$|E
25|$|This form <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we {{can find}} a {{function}} ψ whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related {{to the study of the}} level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E

25|$|A related {{speculation}} by Sagan and Newman <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their {{signals and}} probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics {{have noted that}} this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is {{a tiny fraction of}} the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood that we are in the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.|$|E
25|$|Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) act as {{a carbon}} sink, {{absorbing}} atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases {{as a result of}} climate change, the SAMW will have less capacity to store dissolved carbon dioxide. Research using a computerized climate system model <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and transport capacity of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO2 in the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Mutation {{can result}} in many {{different}} types of change in sequences. Mutations in genes can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely. Mutations can also occur in nongenic regions. One study on genetic variations between different species of Drosophila <b>suggests</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, the result is likely to be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms that have damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or marginally beneficial. Due to the damaging effects that mutations can have on genes, organisms have mechanisms such as DNA repair to prevent or correct mutations by reverting the mutated sequence back to its original state.|$|E

25|$|Common intuition <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a fair coin is tossed many times, then {{roughly half}} {{of the time it}} will turn up heads, and the other half it will turn up tails. Furthermore, the more often the coin is tossed, the more likely it should be that the ratio of the number of heads to the number of tails will {{approach}} unity. Modern probability theory provides a formal version of this intuitive idea, known as the law of large numbers. This law is remarkable because it is not assumed in the foundations of probability theory, but instead emerges from these foundations as a theorem. Since it links theoretically derived probabilities to their actual frequency of occurrence in the real world, the law of large numbers is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory and has had widespread influence.|$|E
25|$|However, whilst the {{rationale}} behind the equation is sound, {{it is unlikely that}} the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, fp, stars with planets and fe, planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments. Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> intelligent life is common in the universe, then there should be obvious signs of it.|$|E
25|$|Changes in DNA {{caused by}} {{mutation}} can cause errors in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, {{in order to}} function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function {{in the right places}} at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of Drosophila <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a mutation does change a protein, this will probably be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.|$|E

25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics watertight doors. This theory <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> these doors {{had been}} opened, the Titanic would have settled {{on an even}} keel and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|E
25|$|Some colleges {{offer this}} type of admission, {{typically}} used by schools {{with large numbers of}} applicants, which means that colleges are continually receiving applications and making decisions, typically within four to six weeks after application. It allows prospective students to apply at any time between the fall and spring and to receive their result a few weeks later. One benefit is that if a student is accepted early in the school year, there is less anxiety about acceptance {{for the rest of the}} year. Rolling admission schools are also beneficial to students who are rejected from all the schools they applied regularly to, yet still wish to enroll without taking a gap year. Guidance counselors suggest that rolling admissions should not be used late in twelfth grade since financial aid money may have already been distributed, and few slots may be left for September. One advisor <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a college offers rolling admissions and is on a student's list, then it should be applied to as soon as rolling admissions becomes available for that year. Another report suggested that rolling admissions was more characteristic of noncompetitive colleges.|$|E
25|$|Conspiring {{with his}} mentor Gilliam and second-in-command Edgar, Curtis Everett plans {{to lead the}} tail {{passengers}} in a revolt that will take {{them all the way}} up to the engine. Mason and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E
