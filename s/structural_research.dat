2500|$|The {{resurgence}} of RNA structural biology {{in the mid-1990s}} has caused a veritable explosion {{in the field of}} nucleic acid <b>structural</b> <b>research.</b> [...] Since the publication of the hammerhead and P4-6 structures, numerous major contributions to the field have been made. [...] Some of the most noteworthy examples include the structures of the Group I and Group II introns, and the Ribosome. It {{should be noted that the}} first three structures were produced using in vitro transcription, and that NMR has played a role in investigating partial components of all four structures - testaments to the indispensability of both techniques for RNA research. [...] Most recently, the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ada Yonath, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, and Thomas Steitz for their structural work on the ribosome, demonstrating the prominent role RNA structural biology has taken in modern molecular biology.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} utilisation of {{the acoustic}} borehole imaging method within {{the frame of}} <b>structural</b> geology <b>research.</b> Acoustic borehole imaging is a useful tool describing borehole walls. The method allows an identification of various inhomogenieties along the borehole including fractures. Despite the more or less subjective nature of interpretation of the acoustic borehole imaging similar to other geophysical method interpretations, is a careful comparison of the interpreted fractures and the fractures observed on a core allows us to orient both core and fractures. Furthermore {{it is possible to}} determine direction of present kinematic indicators on the oriented core (and fracture planes). Identified fault planes and kinematic indicators are valuable information for <b>structural</b> geology <b>research,</b> particularly for paleostress analysis. The procedure described here was applied in the PDV- 1 borehole drilled in the immediate vicinity of the quarry near the Panské Dubenky village, Jihlava district, Czech Republic, Europe. The results are consistent with previous standard <b>structural</b> geology <b>research</b> conducted in the quarry.  </p...|$|R
