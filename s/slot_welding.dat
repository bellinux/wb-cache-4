40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 24 The {{efficiency}} of compressor impellers, {{apart from the}} design, depends on some features linked with their manufacture. These features are the accuracy of geometry, the surface quality obtained, and the blockages which are inevitable with covered impellers and are attributable to the joining method applied, e. g., greater blade thicknesses {{in the case of}} riveting, or narrowed cross sections, due to weld seams, in the case of welding. As a result of the ever increasing importance of efficiency, efforts have been made to further improve the manufacturing process. The advantages and disadvantages of the various forming methods for high-quality impellers, such as milling with a relatively high accuracy, and involving high manufacturing outlay, are discussed. The various casting processes with a variety of possibilities to fulfill the requirements made with regard to the dimensional tolerances, process-dependent blade thicknesses and manual work for achieving certain specified accuracies are described. The {{efficiency of}} impellers with closed passageways, that is, with a cover or shroud disc, is superior to that of impellers with open passageways. This means that when no cast impellers are used, suitable methods must be available for joining the blades and the cover. For maximum accuracy and minimum blockage, the high-vacuum brazing method has become more and more accepted during the past few years. However, the manufacture of impellers applying the brazing method becomes problematic for large diameters. In addition to vacuum brazing, manual and machine welding processes continue to be applied, including <b>slot</b> <b>welding</b> for two-dimensionally curved blades. Diffusion welding and electron-beam welding have not found acceptance since high costs, unfavorable crevices, and sharp edges, along with possible deformations, have a negative influence on the behavior of such impellers during operation. It is true that the sophisticated riveting process of some manufacturers for two-dimensionally curved blades requires great wall thicknesses; but, {{it is also true that}} high-accuracy impellers can be produced by this method. In addition, the vibratory behavior of such impellers is favorable due to system-inherent dampening. Moreover, riveted impellers will tolerate high stresses when the Bauschinger effect is taken into account. The manufacture of highly stressed impellers for turbocompressors is based on the availability of suitable materials and adequate test methods...|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{strength}} of laser beam welded thin sheet specimens {{made of steel}} was examined in a project several years ago. The focus of the present numerical investigation are the overlap welded joints with a sharp <b>slot</b> <b>weld</b> of various thickness, which were tested subjected to different modes of loading. The results are reconsidered using different local approaches. A structural stress concept, based on section forces, yields acceptable results, but it shows an influence of the sheet thickness. LEFM properly accounts for sheet thickness, but the different loading directions cannot be sufficiently correlated. A notch stress approach with a small dimension notch radius of r = 0. 05 mm overcomes these deficits.

The current work presents a finite element (FE) analysis of the residual stress distribution in an eight-pass <b>slot</b> <b>weld,</b> conducted using a 316 L austenitic stainless steel plate with 308 L stainless steel filler metal. A thermal FE model is used to calibrate the transient thermal profile applied during the welding process. Time-resolved body heat flux data from this model is then used in a mechanical FE analysis to predict the resultant post-weld residual stress field. The mechanical analysis made use of the Lemaitre-Chaboche mixed isotropic-kinematic work-hardening model to accurately capture the constitutive response of the 316 L weldment during the simulated multi-pass weld process, which results in an applied cyclic thermo-mechanical loading. The analysis is validated by contour method measurements performed on a representative weld specimen.

40|$|Application of {{the contour}} method for the {{measurement}} of weld residual stresses (WRS) is prone to inaccuracy due to plastic deformation resulting from the redistribution of typically high (close to yield) WRS during the cutting process. The current work, seeks ways to mitigate cutting-induced plasticity by controlling stress redistribution through optimisation of the contour cutting configuration. The idea of using a stress-informed fracture mechanics approach to find the optimal cutting configuration is introduced. The level of plasticity associated with different cutting configurations is then assessed, allowing control of the location and magnitude of cutting-induced plasticity to occur during the cutting process. A conventional edge-crack cutting configuration is compared with a proposed double-embedded cutting configuration by measuring the longitudinal WRS in two three-pass <b>slot</b> <b>weld</b> specimens (NeT TG 4) produced using identical weld procedures. The experimental results show that a novel double-embedded cutting configuration leads to greater accuracy in WRS measurements relative to conventional edge-crack cutting configurations {{at the expense of}} higher levels of plasticity being introduced local to small ligaments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current paper {{presents}} a finite element simulation {{of the residual}} stress field associated with a three pass <b>slot</b> <b>weld</b> in an AISI 316 LN austenitic stainless steel plate. The simulation is split into uncoupled thermal and mechanical analyses which enable a computationally less expensive solution.

40|$|The {{determination}} of residual stress in engineering materials with large grains {{is a challenge}} {{when it comes to}} using diffraction techniques. Not only are the accuracies of the residual stresses themselves important but also the accurate evaluation of their uncertainties. An austenitic steel three-pass <b>slot</b> <b>weld</b> (NeT- TG 4) with varying grain size high-lights the potential problems with the data evaluation when grain size is not taken into account whilst measuring strain. Neutron diffraction results are compared with each other (with combinations of slit and radial oscillating collimator beam defining optics) and with high energy synchrotron radiation results with a spiral slit gauge volume defining system. The impact of the grain size on the {{determination of}} residual stresses and their associated uncertainties when using diffraction techniques in engineering components is emphasized and discussed. A simple model to estimate the extra random uncertainty contribution due to the so-called grain size statistics is applied and verified. The benefit of continuous or stepwise oscillation {{to increase the number of}} detected grains on the detector is discussed together with how to optimize the time of a measurement.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} numerical {{analyses that}} elucidate {{the effects of}} post-weld residual stress and associated plastic damage on the ballistic performance of 316 L austenitic steel plate. Impact simulations of an 18 mm thick plate with a centreline three-pass <b>slot</b> <b>weld</b> by hemispherical-nosed and flat-nosed projectiles are performed, with initial velocities {{in the range of}} 300 - 800 m/s. The numerical framework consists of three interdependent stages: (i) a weld model was developed in Abaqus/Standard and validated using two independent experimental data sets; (ii) a Johnson-Cook material model is calibrated and validated along with the shear failure fracture criterion available in Abaqus/Explicit for impact models; and (iii) the weld modelling results were transferred to an impact model built in Abaqus/Explicit, which employs the validated material and fracture models to predict the ballistic performance of welded plate. It is shown that the associated plastic strain damage accumulated during the welding process - and its distribution - has an adverse effect on the ballistic performance. It has also been determined that a fracture criterion that accounts for pre-existing damage in the weldment must be used for accurate impact analyses of welded structures.

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{computational}} weld mechanics have revealed {{the importance of}} the material plasticity model when predicting weld residual stresses. The present work seeks to extend this level of understanding to include the effects of the assumed material annealing behaviour, particularly when modelling multi-pass welds that comprise several thermo-mechanical loading cycles. A series of numerical analyses are performed to examine the variability in predicted residual stress profiles for different material models, using a validated finite element model for a three-pass <b>slot</b> <b>weld</b> in AISI 316 LN austenitic steel. The material models consider both the work hardening and annealing assumptions for the chosen material. Model sensitivity is established not only from a weld residual stress perspective, but also from an assessment of the post-weld plastic strain accumulated in the weldment. Predictions are compared with indirect measurements acquired using cross-weld micro-hardness maps taken from benchmark specimens. Sensitivity studies reveal that the choice of annealing behaviour will {{have a significant impact on}} plastic flow predictions, which is dependent on the annealing temperature specified. Annealing assumptions will have a varying impact on the weld residual stress predictions, such that the extent of sensitivity is dependent on the plasticity model chosen. In contrast, the choice of plasticity model will have a significant effect on the predicted weld residual stresses, but relatively little effect on predictions of equivalent plastic strain...|$|R

Neutron diffraction {{has been applied}} at two different facilities, the High Flux Reactor in the Netherlands and the new research reactor FRM-II in Germany. Furthermore, measurements by surface hole drilling and by the contour method have been obtained by the Open University in the UK. The neutron measurements have been executed with different settings of the instruments and employing different crystallographic reflection planes of the bcc-lattice of the low-alloy steel. The results {{were found to be}} in remarkably good agreement in the base material, away from the fusion zone. Closer to and within the fusion zone, differences of significant magnitude between the measurements have been found. It has to be noted that the differences found were only in the absolute stress values, and not in the general trends of the stress distributions. The comparison between neutron diffraction and contour data is limited to common measurement locations and directions, e. g. through thickness measurements at the weld centre line and the start and stop ends, in the welding transverse direction, which is the direction of the contour measurements. A reasonable qualitative agreement has been obtained, but no exact quantitative agreement. The paper makes an attempt to explain the similarities and the differences between the measurements, and provides an outlook to additional work done in this context within the NeT European Network, also with a view to establishing methods to obtain better agreement of the stresses found in measurements at different facilities and/or by different methods.

40|$|Arc-welding {{involves}} the deposition of molten filler metal and the localised input of intense heat. The surrounding parent material and, {{in the case}} of multi-pass welds, previously deposited weld metal, undergoes complex thermo-mechanical cycles involving elastic, plastic, creep and viscous deformations. These processes result in the development of large residual stress gradients around the welded region, which can be particularly detrimental to the structural integrity of plant components. The present study examines aggregated weld bead start and stop stress concentration effects in a three pass <b>slot</b> <b>weld</b> specimen that was designed to represent a multi-pass weld repair (without any original weld). The specimen design comprised a Type 316 L stainless steel base-plate of nominal dimensions (300 × 200 × 25) mm 3 with a 100 mm long by 10 mm deep central slot filled with 3 stringer manual metal arc weld beads, laid one on top of another. Residual stresses in three orthogonal directions were measured by neutron diffraction on a plane cutting through the centre of the plate, parallel to the welding direction, to show concentrations of tensile stress at both the weld start and stop positions. The transverse component of residual stress on the same plane in a second, nominally identical, specimen was mapped using the contour method. By applying two independent measurement techniques the residual stress field within the specimen type was determined with an increased level of confidence. Maximum transverse stress values of about 200 MPa at the weld start position and 300 MPa at the weld stop position were found. Peak tensile stresses in the longitudinal direction of 370 and 460 MPa were measured using neutron diffraction at the weld start and stop positions, respectively. The stresses measured by the contour method and neutron diffraction were in reasonable overall agreement with each other. However, the comparisons pointed to the possible presence of cutting artefacts in the contour results...|$|R

The fully working vehicle demonstrated both the practicalities and drawbacks to the novel design. The replica used exactly the same engine and gearbox, and the necessities of building such a vehicle in a home workshop also pointed towards ways the Rover company would have built their vehicle without complex pressing and cutting machinery- such as the creation of curves on the bodywork by cutting slots in a straight sheet, applying pressure to the metal, allowing it to bend at an angle allowed by the expansion <b>slots,</b> then <b>welding</b> up the <b>slots</b> to form a solid, strong body panel. Many previously speculated on the feasibility of constructing a centrally-mounted steering system.

This was determined by using two different methods of stress measurement. These methods involved strain gauges and ultrasonic testing. Specifically, critically refracted longitudinal (L[CR]) waves have been used to evaluate residual stresses and their dissipation in sample plates. The material investigated in this experiment was A. S. T. M. 1008 / 1010 steel. Each test specimen was approximately 30. 5 cm by 40. 6 cm and 1. 3 cm thick (12 in by 16 in by 1 / 2 in). Each specimen was cut with T shaped slots cut from each edge of the plate. The geometry of the plate and the welds should provide for a uniaxial tension stress field in the area of investigation. After the plates were stress relieved by annealing, the transverse <b>slots</b> were then <b>welded</b> and allowed to cool. Strain gauges were then applied to the area of interest in the middle of the plate oriented parallel to the long side of the plate. Stress measurements would be made across the weld bead. Initial ultrasonic measurements were then performed. Both sides of the plates were investigated. At differing time intervals, a sample plate's welds were cut through. Strain gauge and ultrasonic measurements were then repeated. By comparing the before and after information, differential strain measurements and ultrasonic travel times were determined. A control plate determined zero stress travel-time data. The LCR travel-time and strain gauge measurements of the plates not only indicate that there is a measurable stress relaxation in the plates, but also that it occurs in a time dependent and predictable manner. Much of the stress relief occurred soon after the weld. The peak stress 375 minutes (6 1 / 4 hours) after the weld was approximately 250 MPa (35. 5 ksi). Within 20 hours the stress had decayed to approximately 220 MPa (31. 9 ksi). At 700 hours the stress was approximately 180 MPa (26 ksi) ...|$|R
