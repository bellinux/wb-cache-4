5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a <b>school</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf and blind West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf and blind in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a <b>school</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind.</b> Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the blind. He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 18, Chen began {{attending}} school as a grade one student at the Elementary <b>School</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blind</b> in Linyi city. In 1994, he enrolled at the Qingdao High <b>School</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blind,</b> where he studied until 1998. He had already begun developing an interest in law, and would often ask his brothers to read legal texts to him. He earned a position at the Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1998 but because his family was poor, they had to borrow $340 to cover tuition costs. They still fell short of the required $400 and university authorities reportedly had to be pleaded with before allowing Chen to enroll. He studied in Nanjing from 1998 to 2001, specializing in acupuncture and massage—the only programs available to the blind. Chen also audited legal courses, gaining a sufficient understanding of the law to allow him to aid his fellow villagers when they sought his assistance. After graduation he returned to his home region and found a job as a masseur in the hospital of Yinan County.|$|E

5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois <b>School</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blind</b> in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E

5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear.

One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt.

5|$|In 1848, Blaine {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} of mathematics and ancient languages at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky. Although he was only eighteen years old and younger than many of his students, Blaine adapted well to his new profession. Blaine grew to enjoy life in his adopted state and became an admirer of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. He also made the acquaintance of Harriet Stanwood, a teacher at the nearby Millersburg Female College and native of Maine. On June 30, 1850, the two were married. Blaine once again considered taking up the study of law, but instead took his new bride to visit his family in Pennsylvania. They next lived with Harriet Blaine’s family in Augusta, Maine for several months, where their first child, Stanwood Blaine, was born in 1851.
