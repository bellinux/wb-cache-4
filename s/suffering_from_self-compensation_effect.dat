40|$|Materials {{with zero}} thermal {{expansion}} (ZTE) or precisely tailored thermal expansion are in urgent demand of modern industries. However, {{the overwhelming majority}} of materials show positive thermal expansion. To develop ZTE or negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials as compensators has become an important challenge. Here, we present the evidence for the realization of ultra-low thermal expansion in Mn–Co–Ge–In particles. The bulk with the Ni 2 In-type hexagonal structure undergoes giant NTE owing to a martensitic magnetostructural transition. The major finding is that the thermal expansion behavior can be totally controlled by modulating the crystallinity degree and phase transition <b>from</b> atomic scale. <b>Self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> leads to ultra-low thermal expansion with a linear expansion coefficient as small as + 0. 68 × 10 − 6 /K over a wide temperature range around room temperature. The present study opens an avenue to reach ZTE particularly from the large class of giant NTE materials based on phase transition...|$|R

Both donor and acceptor levels, which originate from {{the amphoteric nature of}} Sn in II–VI semiconductors, are identified using low-temperature microphotoluminescence. This <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> was cross examined by gate modulation and temperature-dependent electrical transport measurement.

40|$|The {{effects of}} group-IV element dopants on the {{structural}} and electrical properties of Cu 2 O thin films were studied. Similar dopant-induced behavior {{was found in}} the observed variations of the growth orientation and electrical properties of Si- and Ge-doped Cu 2 O thin films. Ge doping was found to induce electrically active acceptors with an activation energy of 0. 18 eV, comparable to the 0. 19 eV value of Si-doped Cu 2 O. These results suggest that locally formed silicate and germanate have the same effect on the structural and electrical properties of Cu 2 O.

Since Si-donor is the most common defect in Si-doped GaAs, we study mainly several Si-donor based configurations, from the isolated impurity to extended defect configurations, up to the limit of an entire embedded donor interlayer. We consider also donor-acceptor configurations, stimulated by the experimental evidence of <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effects</b> in particular in highly doped samples. The systematic study of simulated cross-sectional STM images for all these and other configurations allows not only to identify the self-compensated donor-acceptor configurations as the simplest ones which are compatible with those experimental observations, but also to exclude most of the other candidates...|$|R

40|$|The {{compensation}} and <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effects</b> in Mg-doped GaN is studied by low-temperature photo-luminescence and Raman spectroscopy using {{a series of}} samples with different Mg concentrations. Strongly doped samples {{are found to be}} highly compensated in electrical measurement. The compensation mechanism {{is directly related to the}} incorporation of Mg leading to the additional formation of three dif-ferent deep donor levels. Furthermore, hydrogen forms defect complexes with Mg and compensates the acceptor states. These complexes were observed as local vibrational modes in Raman spectra in the range of 2200 cm– 1. The direct incorporation of Mg can be controlled by local vibrational modes in the region of GaN host phonons. Investigating the intensity dependence of the different Mg–H complexes and the LVM of activated Mg the Raman spectra give a clear direct evidence of the degree of {{compensation and}} p-conductivity. © 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The research purpose is to study the characteristics of osseous tissue mineralization, disorder of physical growth and sexual maturity of children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases. The researchers have examined 116 children, including 33 children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases; 26 children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> persistent colitis; 29 children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> gasatroduodenitis; and 28 children with no GI tract pathologies.

The lowest rates of mineral osseous tissue density were among girls. Calcium phosphoric metabolism did not change apart from calcium creatinine coefficient, if osteopenia was observed. Thus, reduction of mineral osseous tissue density is often observed among children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases, especially among adolescent girls.

The thesis has 4 defined goals. Goal 1 : To {{find out whether the}} patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are familiar with compensation aids. Goal 2 : To identify the areas of self-care where the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis need to use the compensation aids. Goal 3 : To determine the availability of compensation aids for the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis. Goal 4 : To find out whether the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis do have information about the compensation aids in hygienic care. All goals were met. Based on the goals, 4 hypotheses were defined. H 1 : Patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are familiar with compensation aids. This hypothesis has been confirmed. H 2 : Patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis use compensation aids most often in hygienic care. This hypothesis has not been confirmed. H 3 : Compensation aids for patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are easily available. This hypothesis has been confirmed. H 4 : Patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis have all the necessary information about compensation aids used in hygienic care. This hypothesis has been confirmed too. The survey was carried out at rheumatology clinics and at the League against Rheumatism. The data were collected in a quantitative research using the method of interview and the technique of questionnaire. All in all, 170 questionnaires were distributed among the patients. The research group contained 131 respondents. Analyzing the respondents answers, it was found out that the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are familiar with the compensation aids in hygienic care, defecating, catering, dressing, walking, and such aids are affordable and available to them. Most patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis do not need or do not use such aids.
