5|$|For the 2010–2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among {{the groups}} are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations {{run the gamut from}} sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and <b>service</b> <b>fee</b> fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E
5|$|The SGA {{was officially}} {{established}} in 1976 {{and consists of}} an executive, judicial, and legislative branch. The executive branch is headed by the Student Body President and Student Body Vice President. Within the executive branch are between 30–40 appointed and paid cabinet members that oversee everything from reviewing university policies to tracking state legislation. The Student Body President, by mandate of Florida law serves on the university's Board of Trustees {{for a period of}} one year. The Student Body President and Student Body Vice President are elected in annual elections held in the spring and both receive a paid salary that ranges from $18,000 to $21,000 per year. The legislative branch is composed of 59 senators elected each fall, who serve one-year terms representing their respective colleges. Student senators annually elect a Speaker of the Senate, who receives an annual salary between $17,000 and $20,000 per year, and a Senate President Pro Tempore. Under state law, the Student Senate has sole jurisdiction over the approval and allocation of the university's activity and <b>service</b> <b>fee</b> budget, which was $17.4 million in fiscal year 2014. The judicial branch consists of a paid Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices who preside over student conduct hearings and parking appeals.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the linkages between discretionary accruals, management ownership and remuneration and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees.</b> All {{findings of the}} study are based on an extensive analysis of 351 publicly listed firms of Singapore {{for the fiscal year}} 2001. Inferential statistics results, using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Two-Stage Least Square (2 SLS), reveal three key findings. First, there is a negative association between discretionary accruals and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees.</b> Second, managerial ownership positively affects the negative association between discretionary accruals and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees.</b> Third, this positive affect is weaker amongst firms with high accounting-based management remuneration. It is also documented that when single-equation estimates are used, audit committee effectiveness has a significant positive(negative) influence on audit coverage (purchase non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees).</b> Even after fee endogeneity is controlled, the evidence shows that audit committee effectiveness is not associated with the purchase of either audit or non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees.</b> Findings from single-equation models of audit and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees</b> confirm prior research showing a knowledge spillover effect. Consistent with emerging literature, it has been observed that when simultaneous-equations are used, the association between audit and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees</b> suffers from simultaneous-equation bias. Thus, consistent with Whisenant et al., (2003) the authors conclude that there is no knowledge spillover between the audit and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees.</b> Another key feature of this article is the expansion of very limited literature, investigating linkages between audit committee effectiveness and the audit and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees.</b> Finally, the authors infer that failure to control feedback relationship between the audit and non-audit <b>service</b> <b>fees</b> would probably produce spurious findings and inferences...|$|R

25|$|Battery {{swapping}} {{is common}} in warehouses using electric forklift trucks. The concept of an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896, in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks. It was first put into practice between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric, and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric {{through the use of}} an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly <b>service</b> <b>fee</b> to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. During the period of the service, the vehicles covered more than 6 million miles.|$|E

Each fall, a budget committee is created and {{is responsible for the}} creation for the next fiscal years budget, including the allocation of funding to the various SGA branches, departments, agencies, services, and buildings. The annual budget is completed in early spring and presented to the Senate for consideration {{before the end of the}} spring semester. The proposed budget must be approved by the Senate, Student Body President, Senior Student Affairs Officer, and the university president.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the limited operating range of electric vehicles, {{and the lack of}} recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896. The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly <b>service</b> <b>fee</b> to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Light Electric cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.|$|E

The results showed that formal education (demographic variable) had positive relationship and land size (economic of land variable) had negative relationship with the participation. Positive relationship between formal education and participation in payment of irrigation <b>service</b> <b>fees</b> meant that the participation increased as farmers’ education increased. Meanwhile, negative relationship between land size and the participation in payment of irrigation <b>service</b> <b>fees</b> showed that the farmers’ participation wouldincrease as the land size owned by farmers decreased.

[...] Following the vote, the Mayor of Washington indicated that one of the three nay votes had reneged on an agreement between the college and the council to accept the offer. [...] Instead of accepting the offer, the City Council wanted to levy a $100 annual municipal services fee on each student, a proposal that was nearly identical to the <b>service</b> <b>fee</b> that was ruled illegal in 1995.

500|$|In 1995, the City of Washington passed Ordinance 1460, which {{established}} a [...] "service fee" [...] for municipal services that was targeted at Washington & Jefferson College students.

[...] In an opinion written by Judge David L. Gilmore, {{the court ruled}} that the [...] "service fee" [...] was actually a [...] "tax masquerading as a fee" [...] and that the label was [...] "given to it merely to avoid the problem presented by enacting such a tax." [...] The court noted that there was no legal basis for calling this ordinance a tax rather than a <b>service</b> <b>fee,</b> since the city admitted that it was facing budgetary shortfalls and had passed the ordinance in search of new revenue. [...] According to the judge, the [...] "ordinance attempts to raise additional revenue thereby creating a tax," [...] which was not authorized by any statute.
