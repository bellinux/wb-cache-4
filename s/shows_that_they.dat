5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the special}} began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, moved to Brussels on October 12, and then to Paris later within the day, where it {{remained}} up to October 24. Around midnight of October 22, production filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the Eiffel Tower. Due to insufficient notices posted by the Paris City Hall, reportedly some Parisians were taken by surprise and mistook {{the sound of the}} fireworks for a terrorist attack. On October 25 production moved to Naples where it remained up to November 4. They donated €7,000 to the local community to thank them for the hospitality, and to fund the construction of a pedestrian plaza.

5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The good {{preservation}} of the texts in Unas' pyramid <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were arranged {{so as to be}} read by the Ba of Unas, as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings. The Ba would then leave the burial chamber, which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat, and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet. Included in the spells written {{on the walls of the}} antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn, which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods. At this point the Ba of Unas would face east, the direction of the sunrise, and beyond the pyramid masonry, the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally, turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} {{over the past decade}} or so <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E

5|$|S. validum {{is known}} from the late Late Cretaceous Belly River Group (the Canadian {{equivalent}} to the Judith River Group in the US), and specimens have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5 to 75 mya) in Dinosaur Provincial Park (including the lectotype specimen), and the Oldman Formation (middle Campanian, 77.5 to 76.5 mya) of Alberta, Canada. The pachycephalosaurs Hanssuesia and Foraminacephale are also known from both formations. S. novomexicanum is {{known from the}} Fruitland (late Campanian, about 75 mya) and lower Kirtland Formation (late Campanian, about 74 mya) of New Mexico, and if this species correctly belongs in Stegoceras, the genus {{would have had a}} broad geographic distribution. The presence of similar pachycephalosaurs in both the west and north of North America during the latest Cretaceous <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{an important part of the}} dinosaur faunas there. It has traditionally been suggested that pachycehalosaurs inhabited mountain environments; wear of their skulls was supposedly a result of them having been rolled by water from upland areas, and comparisons with bighorn sheep reinforced the theory. In 2014, Jordan C. Mallon and Evans disputed this idea, as the wear and original locations of the skulls is not consistent with having been transported in such a way, and they instead proposed that North American pachycephalosaurs inhabited alluvial (associated with water) and coastal plain environments.|$|E

25|$|The {{continental}} coastline features numerous inlets and fjords, {{from which}} the mountains seem to rise straight up to great elevations; this is, for example, {{the case with the}} Cerro Macá (2,300 meters) near Puerto Aisén.

The grouping of such islands <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are in part the summits of a submerged mountain chain, a continuation southward of the Chilean Coast Range. Three groups of these, called Chiloé, Guaitecas and Chonos archipelagoes, lie North of the Taitao Peninsula.|$|E

A study of the Jōmon people that lived on the Pacific coast of Honshu during the early Holocene <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were conducting individual dog burials and were probably using dogs as tools for hunting sika deer and wild boar, as hunters in Japan still do today.|$|E
