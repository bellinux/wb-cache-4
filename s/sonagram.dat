The results demonstrate that under certain conditions visible speech can be used successfully as a comprehensive substitutional medium. The technical and teaching method developed in this research group was improved {{for the needs of}} the school teaching practice. Proposals for using the system for a cirriculum have been made. A training programm developed in order to introduce teachers for the deaf to the computer-based speech device was tested in 6 schools by 18 teachers and was evaluated according to the requirements for school. The speech visualization device used up to now, showed a high degree of speaker dependance. Especially if adults and children are working at the same time with the system. For the quantitative registration of the differences of the formant positions between children, mean and women we estimated the formant positions of the long german vowels of 40 speakers. Based on the method of vocal tract length estimation by using higher formants, a speaker normalization was implemented in the visualization system.

40|$|Guanacos (Lama guanicoe) {{are highly}} social {{ungulates}} which exhibit subtle threat displays and aggressive vocalizations when feeding. Although studies have qualitatively described aggressive vocalizations, the causation and functional significance of aggressive vocalizations in feeding guanacos are poorly understood. In the General Introduction, I review game theory models for aggressive signals in animal conflicts. In Paper 1, I investigate the causation of aggressive vocalizations, namely, individual and contextual variations in a feeding group of guanacos. In Paper 2, I apply the optimal deceit {{model to the}} guanaco feeding group and discuss an alternative hypothesis to interpret the functional significance of aggressive vocalizations;Aggressive interactions were recorded in a captive group of guanacos (adult females, subadults, yearlings and juveniles) when feeding on hay from March to November 1989 at Ames, Iowa. Guanacos used 3 call types: squeak, grumble, and spit vocalization. Social rank {{had a significant effect}} on rates of aggression and rates of the 3 call types. Furthermore, analysis on <b>sonagram</b> measurements revealed positive correlations between social rank and durations of spit and grumble subtype 1 (G 1). The 3 aggressive vocalizations in feeding guanacos could reflect the combinations of aggressive intensity, social rank, and individual recognition;The functional significance of these diverse calls in feeding guanacos was investigated by logistic curves (the probability of winning against difference of fighting ability rank). Logistic curves of grumble and spit vocalizations were the flattest and steepest, respectively. According to the optimal deceit model, grumble was the most deceitful call, and spit vocalization was the most truthful. However, based on social living style and grumble sonagrams, an alternative hypothesis, optimal level of aggression, was suggested. The optimal level of aggression is a balance between effectiveness in thwarting receivers and tolerance by receivers. The higher usage of the grumble in signallers, when ranked higher than receivers, may have resulted from guanacos contesting the low valued resource (hay) and settling contests with cheaper cues. In the most subordinate and youngest guanacos, developmental limitation in learning and a lower risk in provoking challenge might have resulted in the higher usage of the spit vocalization...|$|E

Meanings were assigned to a number of the calls. Sounds of nestlings, juveniles, and vocalizations connected with parental care were not included in this study. The following advertising songs were noted in the male only: 1. Full song, one or two introductory notes followed by a fast trill. 2. Introductory note, often used alone or in pairs. 3. Fast trill. 4. Medium trill. 5. Slow trill. With the exception of the Thup note, heard only from the male, and the Kip note, heard only from the female, all call notes were heard from both sexes. The complete list of calls, with meanings assigned where possible, is as follows: 1. Chirp, primarily an attention getter. 2. Meow, usually indicative of the presence of a disturbing factor. 3. See, highly variable, presumably a contact call. 4. Chip, intense fear, alarm note. 5. Thup, contentment. 6. Tzip, frustration or impatience. 7. Tsk, frequent component of secondary song. 8. Chatter, sexual desire. 9. Kip, a post-copulatory note. 10. Slur note, important component of secondary song, also may indicate mild distress. 11. Twitter, used mainly in secondary song. Secondary songs are the softly whispered, usually complex, vocalizations by both sexes, heard only at very close range. Their extreme complexity and variability indicate that they serve some purpose other than to convey information. It is suggested that while advertising song, serving as an isolating mechanism, would diverge in form as part of the process of speciation, the call notes and the secondary songs are likely to remain unchanged. Thus sibling species should have unlike songs but similar call notes and secondary songs.

This thesis represents my contribution to the detailed understanding of the organization and use of complex song repertoires in the Northern Mockingbird. Not only does this allow a fuller understanding of the selection pressures producing complex singing behavior but it has major implications for areas such as neurophysiology, learning and perception. ^ From fall 1979 to spring 1983 I conducted intense year-round research at Tyler Arboretum, Lima, Pennsylvania.

This can alter significantly the estimate of repertoire size. ^ Considerable information is made available through the way a male Mockingbird presents its repertoire and the particular song types used. The manner in which a male presents its repertoire varies seasonally. Males sing {{in a way that}} produces the highest diversity of songs in a given time interval during the courtship period. The singing behavior becomes significantly less diverse when the female begins to assist in nest building. Other situations are also typified by distinct singing behavior. Additional information is made available by the transitions between certain song types. The song types used in these transitions differ among males and thus, could provide information about individual identity. Finally, at least some song types are correlated with a particular behavior or situation. Thus, the singing behavior of Mockingbirds provides much information. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} biology, territorial behaviour, {{movements of}} banded birds, nest sites and nests, feeding biology and vocalizations {{of a population}} of Yellow-breasted tits (Petroica macrocephala macrocephala) were studied in Mount Fitzgerald Scenic Reserve, Banks Peninsula, during 1977 - 1979. Pairs of Yellow-breasted tits remained on a territory throughout the year. Territorial advertisement and defence were at a peak during the late prebreeding season and breeding season. Boundaries were maintained through vocalizations, body-feather and wing displays, chases and, more rarely, fights. The territorial nature of, and the intolerance towards, other tits were seen developing while fledglings were still being fed by their parents. Shortly after independence, some juvenile males and females set up small subterritories on the peripheries of adult territories. A synchronous movement by some juveniles away from adult territories occurred five to six weeks after independence. Breeding activities commenced in early September in all pairs and continued to late February for some pairs. The cupular nests were built in four site-types in my study area. A maximum of three broods per pair was raised to independence per season, but one or two was more usua 1. Brood size varied between three and five. The female renested within {{two to three days}} of the previous brood fledging, while the male continued to feed the fledglings. Circumstantial evidence suggested that up to six eggs per clutch could be laid. The behaviour of tits of all ages throughout the breeding season is described. A wide range of invertebrate prey was taken. Berries may also have been eaten. Prey were captured using the "watch and wait" technique. No active foraging was observed. Four methods were employed to capture the prey. The song of the adult male was the most distinctive vocalization {{of a wide range of}} calls given by Yellow-breasted tits of all ages. <b>Sonagrams</b> were produced to show and compare the structures of different calls. The developmental stages of male song are also described. Neighbouring males tended to have very similar songs. A dialect may have evolved within Mount Fitzgerald Scenic Reserve. Possible factors causing the patchy distribution of tits within the Reserve are discussed. This habitat may be supporting the maximum number of tits possible...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} December 1993 – January 1995 {{research}} on the behavioural ecology, distribution and conservation of the Javan Hawk-eagle Spizaetus bartelsi {{was carried out by}} R. Sözer and V. Nijman, under supervision of BirdLife International / PHPA – Indonesia Programme. This research was part of the requirements for graduation in the study of Biology at the University of Amsterdam (UVA). During the seven-month of fieldwork many new data were collected on these subjects and recommendations for the conservation of the Javan Hawk-eagle were formulated. The main research aims were: 1) a study of the home range, habitat requirements and behaviour of the Javan Hawk-eagle, and 2) a study of the distribution of the hawk-eagle with special reference to the central part of Java. This area was as yet unknown to hold populations of the species. Some background information on the biodiversity of Java, its geology and climate, natural vegetation and characteristic mountain birds, is presented. An overview of all Spizaetus species, their taxonomy and systematics is given. Furthermore, accurate descriptions of S. bartelsi for positive identification in the field as well as in museum collections are made. <b>Sonagrams</b> of the species’ call are presented. A total of 16 areas was surveyed; S. bartelsi was found in nine areas, six of these being new localities for the species. Taking these new localities into account, the population size was estimated, resulting in an increase from 52 - 61 to 81 - 108 pairs. Most Javan Hawk-eagles were observed in primary forest and the ruggedness of the terrain was a common feature of all localities. The visable homerange was 12 km² but realistic estimates gave homerange sizes between 33 km² [Gn Slamet] and 155 km² [Alas Purwo N. P. ], varying with suitability of the habitat. During 114 contact hours with a breeding pair, and a pair together with their second year young, many new data were gathered on the behaviour and ecology of the species, e. g. the breeding period was determined at 47 +/- 1 days, the breeding season was calculated and copulation observed. Courtship displays, nest tree and nest maintenance are described. Sexual dimorphism was quantified by measuring 23 museum specimens. Even though the new population estimate is more positive than earlier estimates, the fact remains that less than 10 % of Java is covered with natural forest, not all of which is suitable habitat for the Javan Hawk-eagle. The combination of this lack of habitat and the its low reproductive rate (36 – 45 young per year for the entire population) make the species one of the world’s most endangered raptors. In addition, the species is not suitable for captive propagation, but nevertheless 10 specimens arrived in zoos in 1994 of which three died during the same year. Available habitat is the limiting factor for the wild population and destruction of its natural environment is the eagle’s main threat. Four areas are recommended as priority areas for conservation of S. bartelsi habitat; in order of significance: 1) The Dieng Mountains, 2) Gn Slamet, 3) Pegunungan Pembarisan and Gn Segara, 4) Gn Wilis-Liman. Further recommendations for the conservation of the Javan Hawk-eagle include: more effective law enforcement, confiscation of illegally kept specimens, prosecution of violators, restriction of numbers legally held in captivity, monitoring of birdmarkets, further conservation research. In conclusion, the Javan Hawk-eagle, the national symbol of Indonesia [Garuda], and symbol of all rare species, need not become extinct if its natural habitat is effectively preserved and other threats eliminated...|$|R
