500|$|The {{challenges}} {{created by}} private landlords {{came to an}} end in March 2002 when the islanders managed, with help from grants and loans from the National Lottery and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, to purchase the island for £4 million. They now own it through a development trust called [...] the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust.

Dennis now operates a flower essences importing business and a boat tours company from the house, which is also rented out as a bed and breakfast business. An additional £200,000 was raised by the islanders through various fundraising ventures, allowing the loan to be paid back to the Scottish Land Fund on 15 March 2004.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis is}} {{conducted on the}} pro-cyclicality of SME loans based on purpose, {{which has not been}} examined in previous research. In this study, the purpose of SME loans is divided into four types: total SME loans, long-term loans for investment in equipment, long-term loans for R&D investment, and <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> for working capital. The aim of the study is to determine whether pro-cyclicality exists in the four types of loans. In particular, it is expected that because of the high-risk weight considered in estimating credit risk, the number of long-term loans may have decreased in the economic distress experienced since 2006, when the Basel II accord came into eﬀect. At that time, most banks adopted the advanced internal rating approach to calculate borrowers' credit risks. This study {{is based on the assumption}} that the risk weight of long-term loans is diﬀerent from that of <b>short-term</b> <b>loans.</b> The GMM model is adopted to test the pro-cyclicality of long-term and <b>short-term</b> <b>loans.</b> The test results showed signifcant pro-cyclicality in long-term loans for investment in equipment and R&D. Second, there was no pro-cyclicality in <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> for purchasing raw materials. Third, the fnancial characteristics aﬀecting the lending behaviour of banks were indicators of proftability and fnancial soundness of credit. Based on the results, eﬀective policies are recommended, such as credit enhancement through credit guarantees, in order to alleviate the eﬀects of pro-cyclicality on long-term loan...|$|R
