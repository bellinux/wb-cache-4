40|$|The report {{evaluates the}} benefit of drug eluting stents (DES) in {{patients}} with peripheral artery disease. Only studies {{for the treatment of}} lower extremity-disease were identified. In femoropopliteal disease, for one (Zilver®-PTX®) out of two products a benefit in terms of revascularisation compared to angioplasty was demonstrated. However, the strength of evidence is low. In terms of amputation rate or walking scores no difference to other alternatives was shown. It is unclear whether the device is superior to bare metal stents (BMS). In infrapopliteal disease the DES (Cypher®) was not more efficacious than angioplasty. Probably, for <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> lesions, a sirolimus- or everolimus-eluting stent (Xience V®, Yukon®) is more efficacious than a BMS, however these types of lesions are uncommon in routine patients. The benefit compared to angioplasty is unknown. Safety risks cannot be ruled out for any of the products. Due to several ongoing studies we do not recommend the use of the products in routine care...|$|E

2500|$|Efficiently concentrating {{the light}} from a large {{omnidirectional}} light source requires a very large diameter lens. This would require a very thick and heavy lens if a conventional lens were used.

5000|$|The reflectors {{are located}} {{at the base of}} the system and {{converge}} the sun’s rays into the absorber. A key component that makes all LFR’s more advantageous than traditional parabolic trough mirror systems is the use of [...] "Fresnel reflectors". These reflectors make use of the Fresnel lens effect, which allows for a concentrating mirror with a large aperture <b>and</b> <b>short</b> <b>focal</b> length while simultaneously reducing the volume of material required for the reflector. This greatly reduces the system’s cost since sagged-glass parabolic reflectors are typically very expensive. However, in recent years thin-film nanotechnology has significantly reduced the cost of parabolic mirrors.|$|R
40|$|Light energy {{can create}} a plasma when high {{irradiance}} is focused. This proeess of opticical breakdown {{can be achieved by}} using a Q-switched laser. In this paper, we report the application of a high-power Nd:YAG laser to generate plasma. Two different techniques were conducted to generate optical breakdown and initiate the plasma. In the first technique the laser was diverged by a negative lens and brought to focus by a wide-angle camera lens of 28 mm focal length. Secondly, the same concave lens was employed to expand the beam but converged back by using a longer focal length of 50 mm. The plasma formation from both focusing systems are visualized and recorded via CCD video camera in conjunction with a high-speed photography system. The recorded images were analyzed using the Matrox Inspector version 2. 1 software. The maximum plasma length obtained from <b>short</b> <b>and</b> long <b>focal</b> length system are 1. 193 ± 0. 060 mm and 2. 815 ± 0. 141 mm respectively.

40|$|The {{application}} of consumer-grade cameras for photogrammetric measurement {{has traditionally been}} subject to the requirement that imagery is recorded at fixed zoom and focus settings. The camera is then metrically calibrated, usually via self-calibration, for the lens setting employed. This requirement arises since camera parameters, and especially principal distance and lens distortion coefficients, vary significantly with zoom/focus setting. A recently developed process, titled zoom-dependent (Z-D) calibration, removes the necessity for the zoom setting to be fixed during the image capture process. Implementation of Z-D calibration requires that the camera be pre-calibrated at four or more focal settings within the zoom range, nominally at <b>shortest</b> <b>and</b> longest <b>focal</b> lengths, <b>and</b> at two mid-zoom settings. This requirement, coupled with issues of data management in carrying different focal settings for potentially every image within a bundle adjustment, has largely accounted {{for the reason that}} Z-D calibration has not previously been implemented within COTS software for close-range photogrammetry. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the practical implementation of Z-D calibration within software, along with its associated workflow, and to discuss issues that impact upon the accuracy, reliability and appropriateness of the technique. Experimental testing is used to highlight the merits and shortcomings of ZD calibration...|$|R

40|$|Injection of high power, {{multi-mode}} laser profiles into a {{fiber optic}} delivery system requires controlling {{a number of}} injection parameters to maximize throughput and minimize concerns for optical damage both at the entrance and exit faces of the fiber optic.

Design criteria together with analytical and experimental results for the refractive lenslet array <b>and</b> <b>short</b> <b>focal</b> length injection lens are presented. This arrangement provides a uniform spatial intensity distribution at the fiber injection plane {{to a large degree}} independent of the source mode structure, spatial profile, divergence, size, and/or alignment to the injection system.

40|$|Electrodispensing is a {{technique}} {{that can be used}} to precisely fabricate tunable microspheroids, of various shapes and sizes. Recent investigations have demonstrated their use as solid immersion lenses (SIL’s), with large numerical apertures, <b>and</b> <b>short</b> <b>focal</b> lengths; this makes them perfect for coupling light into and out of semiconductor devices. Furthermore fabricating SIL’s from UV cure epoxy has significant advantages over conventional glass formed SIL’s, allowing their size, location and shape to be perfectly tuned to the individual requirements of the system, greatly increasing the extraction efficiency and resolution, a boon to many optoelectronic applications. GaSb Quantum rings (QR) provide strong zero-dimensional confinement, which may make them suitable as quantum light sources at telecoms wavelengths. However, when these nanostructures are embedded in a semiconductor structure most of the light emitted by them is lost to total internal reflection. Here we show that electrodispensed UV-cured SIL’s can be deterministically coupled to quantum rings to massively increase the output coupling efficiency of these structures. This promises a simple and cheap solution to the development of useful quantum light sources...|$|R
40|$|The Rho {{subfamily}} of the Rho small G protein family (Rho) regulates {{formation of}} stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions in {{many types of}} cultured cells. In moving cells, dynamic and coordinate disassembly and reassembly of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions are observed, but the precise mechanisms in the regulation of these processes are poorly understood. We previously showed that 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) first induced disassembly of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions followed by their reassembly in MDCK cells. The reassembled stress fibers showed radial-like morphology that was apparently different from the original. We analyzed here the mechanisms of these TPA-induced processes. Rho inactivation and activation were necessary for the TPA-induced disassembly and reassembly, respectively, of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions. Both inactivation and activation of the Rac subfamily of the Rho family (Rac) inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly. Moreover, microinjection or transient expression of Rab GDI, a regulator of all the Rab small G protein family members, inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly, indicating that, furthermore, activation of some Rab family members is necessary for their TPA-induced reassembly. Of the Rab family members, at least Rab 5 activation was necessary for the TPA-induced reassembly of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions. The TPA-induced, small G protein-mediated reorganization of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions was {{closely related to the}} TPA-induced cell motility.

We investigated here the actions of ROCK and mDia, both of which have been identified to be putative downstream target molecules of Rho, in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. The dominant active mutant of RhoA induced the formation of parallel stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions, whereas the dominant active mutant of ROCK induced the formation of stellate stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions, <b>and</b> the dominant active mutant of mDia induced the weak formation of parallel stress fibers without affecting the formation of focal adhesions. In the presence of C 3 ADP-ribosyltransferase for Rho, the dominant active mutant of ROCK induced the formation of stellate stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions, whereas the dominant active mutant of mDia induced only the diffuse localization of actin filaments. These results indicate that ROCK and mDia show distinct actions in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The dominant negative mutant of either ROCK or mDia inhibited the formation of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions, indicating that both ROCK and mDia are necessary for the formation of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions. Moreover, inactivation and reactivation of both ROCK and mDia were necessary for the 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate–induced disassembly and reassembly, respectively, of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions. The morphologies of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions in the cells expressing both the dominant active mutants of ROCK and mDia were not identical to those induced by the dominant active mutant of Rho.

40|$|Specific {{regulation}} <b>and</b> {{activation of}} <b>focal</b> adhesion kinase (FAK) {{are thought to}} be important for <b>focal</b> adhesion formation, <b>and</b> activation of Rho-kinase has been suggested {{to play a role in}} determining the effects of FAK on the formation of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions. To clarify the role of FAK in stress fiber formation <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesion organization, the author examined the formation of new stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions by activation of Rho-kinase in FAK knockout (FAK–/–) fibroblasts. FAK–/– cells were elliptical in shape, and showed reduced numbers of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions in the central part of the cells along with large focal adhesions in the peripheral regions. Activation of Rho-kinase in FAK–/– cells transiently increased the actin filaments in the cell center, but these did not form typical thick stress fibers. Moreover, only plaque-like structures as the origins of newly formed focal adhesions were observed in the center of the cell. Furthermore, introduction of an exogenous GFP-labeled FAK gene into FAK–/– cells resulted in increased numbers of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions in the center of the cells, which showed typical fibroblast morphology. These results indicated that FAK plays an important role in the formation of stress fibers <b>and</b> <b>focal</b> adhesions as well as in regulation of cell shape and morphology with the activation of Rho-kinase...|$|R
