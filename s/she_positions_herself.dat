50|$|Though the {{majority}} of fishes of this genus spawn in a conventional fashion among fine-leaved aquatic plants, C. arnoldi (and any undescribed relatives) is unique among fishes in that it lays its eggs on plants out of water. The male displays to passing females beneath overhanging vegetation growing beside its native waters, and when a receptive female accepts the invitation to spawn, <b>she</b> <b>positions</b> <b>herself</b> directly alongside the male, and the pair leaps {{out of the water}} together, attaching themselves by fin suction to the underside of a leaf. The pair then produces and fertilises 6-8 eggs, before falling back into the water. This procedure is repeated until as many as 200 eggs are attached to the leaf. Once the egg mass is complete, the male positions himself among fine-leaved vegetation, watching the egg mass, and intermittently emerges from cover to splash the eggs with water using his asymmetrical tail fin to keep the eggs moist. Once the eggs hatch, the fry fall into the water from the leaf and swim for cover.|$|E

50|$|Iowa darters spawn {{mainly in}} the spring. They migrate from deeper regions of lakes and streams to the shallow, vegetated reaches for spawning. Males {{typically}} migrate before females, and maintain and defend small territories near undercut banks with rooted vegetation. Smaller males, however, are promiscuous, do not defend territories, and move {{from place to place}} in search of females. When a female enters a male's territory, the male courts the female by swimming around her until <b>she</b> <b>positions</b> <b>herself</b> near algae or rooted vegetation. The male mounts the female and positions himself with his pelvic fins in front of her dorsal fin. The anal and caudal fins of the male are placed {{on the same side of}} the female. Most spawning occurs at depths of 10-40 cm on fibrous roots beneath slightly undercut banks, although some eggs are laid directly on sand or on roots or other plant materials on sand. During each spawning act, three to seven eggs are deposited. Following the completion of spawning, the eggs receive some protection in that by continuing to maintain his territory, the male indirectly guards the eggs. Females mate with several males, then return to deeper habitats following spawning.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of contemporary artist Mariko Mori's use of fashion in her work from 1993 to 2001. Contained within her sartorial phrasing is an involved relationship with the body, female and Japanese, as it exists within technological modernity. Tumult characterizes Mori's body as she images it early on in her career. This highly alienating space in which <b>she</b> <b>positions</b> <b>herself</b> gradually transitions to a space of respite for the performative body of another actor by 2001 's Wave UFO. Wave UFO creates a mediated space for healing the modern body plagued with isolation through transcendence provided by technological means. Minimalist fashion, {{as a kind of}} plastic mechanization of corporeal experience, helps to accomplish this healing. Mori’s Wave UFO attendant costumes present minimalist fashion as a location for reconciling spiritual identity in a postmodern age. The flat-panel costumes have the effect of disfiguring the bodies of the attendants into amorphous plasticized shells (much like th...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via the DOI in this record. As a New York writer, Maeve Brennan forges a relationship with Ireland as home that speaks to the separation and imaginative return so strongly associated with James Joyce {{while at the same}} time putting a careful distance between her work and Joyce’s formidable influence. Drawing on archival material at the University of Delaware and the New York Public Library, which amplifies our understanding of some of the intentions and motivations in Brennan’s work, this essay examines how Brennan transforms Joycean modes and motifs in her careful mapping and writing of New York in her essays for The New Yorker. Written under the pseudonym ‘The Long-Winded Lady’, Brennan’s essays for the magazine break imaginative ground in the city that she lived in for most of her life and expand outwards from the self-contained domestic world of Cherryfield Avenue so central to her Dublin stories. In taking her place in the Joycean tradition of writing the city and writing home, Brennan re-invents the image of the Irish writer bound to Ireland in spite of separation in time and distance; she achieves this by positioning herself in one significant chapter of her writing very emphatically as a New York writer. The main concern here is with Brennan’s adaptation of Joycean motifs and the different ways in which <b>she</b> <b>positions</b> <b>herself</b> in a direct line of inheritance to Joyce as she negotiates her position as a transatlantic writer in the middle of the twentieth century...|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} written on the respondent's {{perspective}} but fewer studies have recognized that "perspectives other than those drawn from the discipline come into play for the interviewer" (Warren in Handbook of interview research, Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA, 2002 : 84). In the article we show that the interviewer uses different strategies of identity management and different standpoints as resources to accomplish and account {{for one of the}} main interviewer's duties, namely to achieve an "understanding of the world from the subjects' points of view" (Kvale in Interviews: An introduction to qualitative research interviewing, Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA, 1996 : 1). We examine instances in which the interviewer displays a "neutral" posture, showing adherence to her institutional identity, and instances in which <b>she</b> <b>positions</b> <b>herself</b> as an "embodied subject," disclosing her personal involvement, stepping out of the role and displaying an identity and a standpoint in common with that of the interviewee. We show how such strategies of identity management (1) prompt either identification or divergence of viewpoints between the interviewer and the interviewees; (2) affect the degree of intimacy among participants and spontaneity in conversation. By means of these two strategies, we discuss, the interviewer accomplishes and accounts for her professional ability to understand the interviewees' standpoints. In particular such strategies are two ways of accounting for an ethical relationship with the interviewees, which, respectively, emphasize either the impartiality or the reciprocity in understanding. Our purpose {{is not to suggest that}} one strategy is to be preferred on the other, but, rather, to illustrate how both the "neutral" and the "embodied" posture are situated practices through which the interviewer attempts to preserve the respondents' viewpoint on the narrated events. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
30|$|The way women narrate {{being stuck}} in a vicious cycle have {{different}} aspects in common. We name this type of narrating narratives of non-directional distress. Zeynep’s story, a 49 -year old Turkish marriage migrant, forms a good example; “He [her ex-husband] went to other women. It was really hard.. I was depressed, going to a psychiatrist. Really not ok. Many problems. The children and me alone. I carry many things on my shoulders, huh? My parents are in Turkey, I am all alone here, my brother is also here, but.. You know, in that moment, then, uhh.. I just wanted to kill my ex-husband, really! My psychologist.. Uhh.. my head got a little weird. Yes in my brain, very busy brain. I went to the psychiatrist, he gave me medicine. I could’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I lost 10 kilos. Yes, he went to other women.. ehh, I forgot the word. You know, I forget many things […] I don’t know. When I go home I cry, when I go to social services I cry, ehh, when walking I cry, when people ask me, ‘are you married?’, I cry. […] Nobody knows tomorrow, I don’t know. Insha’Allah, I hope I’ve had it all, I can’t take any more. […] what can I do? There is nothing I can do but await what will come.” This excerpt {{is a good example}} of the unstructured and fragmented nature of a narrative of non-directional distress. Topics are switched, sentences not finished, and the temporal timeline switches. When asking her about her future, she indicates that no one knows what the future will bring, reflecting a lack of purpose or direction within her life story. Zeynep mentions how she carries a big load on her shoulders. This seems to reflect how <b>she</b> <b>positions</b> <b>herself</b> in her life narrative, as the bearer of a heavy load or the bearer of her story, not as the active author who influences the course of the story.|$|E

40|$|Tort {{law does}} not appear to have been a {{particular}} area of interest for Bertha Wilson during her years as a law student or in legal practice. But after she was appointed to the bench, some of her best-known judgments both at the Ontario Court of Appeal and at the Supreme Court of Canada were tort decisions (for example, Bhadauria v. Seneca College and Kamloops v. Neilsen), and the y, along with a number of other decisions authored by her, remain staples of the tort law curriculum. Clearly Justice Wilson made an impact on Canadian tort law. This paper focuses squarely on her tort decisions, analyzing the m as a body with a view to determining whether a coherent tort the ory or philosophy underpins the m. at first glance, a thread to connect this body of decisions is elusive; indeed, on the surface, a number of the m appear to contradict one another. For example, based on her Bhadauria judgment in which she boldly created a new tort of discrimination, we might regard Justice Wilson as a tort expansionist. Yet elsewhere, we see her protecting other areas of law from incursion by tort (contract law in Dominion Chain v. Eastern Construction and family law in Frame v. Smith). and in other decisions, <b>she</b> <b>positions</b> <b>herself</b> somewhere between these poles, championing an incremental expansion of tort law where precedent allows and justice demands (for example, in Kamloops and Crocker v. Sundance). But digging deeper into Justice Wilson’s tort decisions, common the mes emerge which link the m to one another and ground the m firmly in the broader context of her judicial work as a whole. In tort as in other areas of law, we find Justice Wilson striving to make decisions that are respectful of the constraints within which she operates as an appellate judge, true to her liberal principles, and responsive to the practical concerns of the parties appearing before her...|$|E
