6000|$|... "Now, Watson," [...] said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed {{up through}} the gloom, {{throwing}} out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its <b>side</b> <b>lanterns.</b> [...] "You'll come with me, won't you?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{second night}} of their journey, they {{replaced}} the <b>side</b> <b>lanterns,</b> having discovered {{on the first}} night that they were too dim, with a large spotlight mounted {{on the front of the}} Vermont. They stopped early in Sacramento to accomplish this. The duo was assisted in Sacramento by bicyclists who offered them road maps. Jackson was unable to buy a new tire, but purchased some used inner tubes.|$|R
60|$|The {{forest was}} very still. The water lapped incessantly against the <b>side.</b> About the <b>lantern</b> {{overhead}} there eddied a noiseless whirl of phantom moths.|$|R
5000|$|The towers: towers are {{flanking}} the façade {{and in the}} horizontal plan they are square. They are placed slightly forward {{from the face of}} the facility (risalit). They have 5 floors. On their ground floor, they are put forward with small portals and sloped roof. The portals décor is identical to the main portal. In the second and third floors there are mullions. On the west tower's window, there is a wooden openwork preserved in the whole opening. On the fourth floor there is a triforium. The fifth tier plan changes to an octagon. It is in a shape of a drum with oeil-de-boeuf (ox-eye) windows. The windows are placed in a square brick boxes on all eight <b>sides</b> (<b>lanterns).</b> A frieze cymatium, similar to the body of the synagogue connects the dome with the tower. Onion shaped octahedral dome is covered with gray half round tiles (arranged like fish scale). The whole is topped with a spire coming from the center.|$|R
6000|$|... [117] This word is {{from the}} same root as [...] "lamp." [...] The old form [...] "lanthorn" [...] crept in from the custom of making the <b>sides</b> of a <b>lantern</b> of horn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} near him," [...] half-whispered the eager captain; [...] "for, see, {{there is some}} design visible on the <b>sides</b> of the <b>lantern.</b> Hold!--Ah! 'tis {{the face of a}} woman, as I live!" ...|$|R
50|$|The forest. Bradford lies asleep; Plentiful {{has covered}} {{him with her}} cloak, and crouches in terror at his <b>side.</b> A <b>lantern</b> lies on the ground; the scene is lit by moonlight. Bradford calls out in his sleep to Astoreth and tries to embrace Plentiful, who shrinks from him in horror. He awakens, and tells her that in his dream he was crowned Emperor of Hell. In fear they hurry away together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak on, Baas," [...] {{said the}} dwarf; [...] "my ears are open;" [...] and he squatted {{down on the}} further <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern</b> like some great toad, {{watching}} his master's face with his black eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} 110 ft tall, made {{primarily}} of cut limestone brought from Inverhuron by barge, but a section {{near the top}} is made of granite for extra rigidity. There are 114 steps from the bottom to the lantern room. The 12 <b>sided</b> cast iron <b>lantern</b> was first lit on April 1, 1859 and is 87 ft {{from the base of}} the tower.|$|R
60|$|So saying, he {{suddenly}} turned on Alan Fairford the light <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern</b> he carried, who, by the transient gleam which it threw in {{passing on the}} man who bore it, saw a huge figure, upwards of six feet high, with a rough hairy cap on his head, {{and a set of}} features corresponding to his bulky frame. He thought also he observed pistols at his belt.|$|R
50|$|Permanent steel {{shutters}} {{were added}} to the landward <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern</b> room some time after 1897, when concussion from the 6-inch guns at newly built Fort Rodd Hill caused cracks to appear in the lantern windows. The last keeper to actually live full-time at Fisgard was George Johnson; Josiah Gosse, Fisgard's final keeper, had permission from the lighthouse authority to live ashore (nearby on Esquimalt Lagoon), and row out to Fisgard every evening.|$|R
5|$|Unsurprisingly, Ostapchuk {{was against}} Alliance Atlantis’s plans for Whyte Avenue, believing {{that it would}} put both the Garneau and the Princess out of business. The Old Strathcona Foundation <b>sided</b> with Magic <b>Lantern,</b> and fought the plans. The {{argument}} {{went all the way}} to Edmonton City Council, which was asked to waive Old Strathcona’s four-story height limit for the six-story multiplex. Council sided against Alliance Atlantis when Councillor Terry Cavanagh changed his vote at the last minute, defeating the motion 6-5.|$|R
60|$|Watchmen were hired, {{but refused}} to stay {{for more than one}} night, for they were so harassed and wearied out that they came to the {{conclusion}} that they were haunted. If they were on one side of the house a voice would be heard on the other. After the first few attempts, they no longer dared venture to run, for between each round strings were tied in every direction, and they had several heavy falls, while as they were carefully picking their way with their lanterns, stones struck them from all quarters. If one ventured for a moment from the other's <b>side</b> his <b>lantern</b> was knocked out, and his feet were struck from under him with a sharp and unexpected blow from a heavy cudgel; and they were once appalled by seeing a gigantic figure stalk across the grass, and vanish in a little bush.|$|R
25|$|Fresnels use a spherical {{reflector}}, {{with the}} lamp at the focus point. The lamp and reflector remain a fixed unit inside the housing, and are moved {{forward and back}} to focus the light. This is accomplished using a slider on the bottom or <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern,</b> or using a worm track. At very tight focus, the lanterns are the least efficient, as the least light can escape the housing. Therefore, Fresnels are not good for tight focus on small areas. They are most often used at medium distances from the stage for area lighting.|$|R
5000|$|The Bavarian track {{blocking}} signal (Gleissperrsignal) is [...] "the {{mother of all}} {{blocking signal}}s".The round signal lanterns displayed a round, white milk glass disc towards the train. This had a horizontal, black bar across it. Unlike the later Reichsbahn standard design, the black bar was not turned; instead the whole lantern was rotated through 90° on its pedestal, so that the <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern</b> {{was presented to the}} train. The side of the signal lantern had an almost square milk glass window. At night the lantern was lit internally.|$|R
50|$|The oval entablature to {{the dome}} has a 'crown' of foliage and frames {{a view of}} deep set {{interlocking}} coffering of octagons, crosses and hexagons which diminish in size the higher they rise. Light floods in from windows in the lower dome that are hidden by the oval opening and from windows in the <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern.</b> In a hierarchical structuring of light, the illuminated lantern with its symbol of the Holy Trinity is the most brightly lit, the coffering of the dome is thrown into sharp and deep relief and light gradually filters downwards to the darker lower body of the church.|$|R
5000|$|The Belltower itself faces {{out over}} the Quadrangle and is {{accessed}} by a ladder and trap door. Access to the tower begins in the passageway that connects Moors Hall #410 and #403. A first ladder leads through a ceiling trapdoor to the carpeted mezzanine level (the [...] "chill pad"). A second, longer ladder leads via a small hatch to the lantern of the tower called the [...] "crow's nest". Expansive windows on all four <b>sides</b> of the <b>lantern</b> allow for a majestic view of the greater Boston area. An access door located halfway between the mezzanine and the lantern provides access to an outdoor inter-level widow's walk.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "trotting horse lamp" [...] 走馬燈 {{has been}} known in China since before 1000 CE. It is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes {{attached}} to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The silhouettes are projected on the thin paper <b>sides</b> of the <b>lantern</b> and appear to chase each other. Some versions showed more motion with the heads, feet or hands of figures connected with fine iron wire to an extra inner layer and triggered by a transversely connected iron wire. The lamp would typically show images of horses and horse-riders.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} all that, Mr. Mulford, but it came too late. When I first went aloft, I {{came out on the}} north-west <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern,</b> and took my seat, to look out for the sloop-of-war, as you bade me, sir. Well, there I was sweepin' the horizon with the glass {{for the better part of}} an hour, {{sometimes}} fancyin' I saw her, and then givin' it up; for to this moment I am not sartain there is n't a sail off here to the westward, turning up toward the light on a bowline; but if there be, she's too far off to know anything partic'lar about her. Well, sir, there I sat, looking for the Poughkeepsie, for the better part of an hour, when I thought I would go round on t' other <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern</b> and take a look to windward. My heart was in my mouth, I can tell you, Miss Rose, when I saw the brig; and I felt both glad and sorry. Glad on my own account, and sorry on your'n. There she was, however, and no help for it, within two miles of this very spot, and coming down as if she despised touching the water at all. Now, what could I do? There was n't time, Mr. Mulford, to get the boat out, and the mast stepped, afore we should have been within reach of canister, and Stephen Spike would not have spared that, in order to get you again within his power." ...|$|R
60|$|An {{inclined}} plane of light comes accurately through each window, purple and yellow {{even in its}} most diffused dust, while, where it breaks upon stone, that stone is softly chalked red, yellow, and purple. Neither snow nor greenery, winter nor summer, has power over the old stained glass. As the <b>sides</b> of a <b>lantern</b> protect the flame so that it burns steady even in the wildest night--burns steady and gravely illumines the tree-trunks--so inside the Chapel all was orderly. Gravely sounded the voices; wisely the organ replied, as if buttressing human faith with the assent of the elements. The white-robed figures crossed from side to side; now mounted steps, now descended, all very orderly.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} of stone, with slate roofs, in the English Gothic style. Its plan {{consists of a}} four-bay nave with an octagonal crossing, around which the aisles and transepts lie. The lead roof over the crossing is pyramidal and has an octagonal wooden <b>lantern</b> with <b>side</b> tracery. The <b>lantern</b> itself has a pyramidal roof of copper. The church tower is to the west; it has four stages with angled buttresses and corner pinnacles, and buttressed aisles with clerestories. There are three-light windows in the aisles and four-light windows in the nave transepts. Stained glass in the nave windows was designed by Frances Barnett of Leith. The windows of the 1894 extension are larger than elsewhere and have reticulated tracery. The large east window has stained glass, possibly by William Wailes.|$|R
5000|$|Revolving {{lanterns}} {{have been}} known in China as [...] "trotting horse lamps" [...] 走馬燈 since before 1000 CE. A trotting horse lamp is a hexagonal, cubical or round lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The silhouettes are projected on the thin paper <b>sides</b> of the <b>lantern</b> and appear to chase each other. Some versions showed more motion with heads, feet or hands of figures connected with fine iron wire to an extra inner layer and triggered by a transversely connected iron wire. The lamp would typically show images of horses and horse-riders. Most modern electric versions use all kinds of colorful transparent cellophane figures which are projected across the walls, mostly in nurseries.|$|R
50|$|Fisher House is “a white-brick Georgian with a {{sprawling}} garden that borders the eighth fairway of the Franklin Hills Country Club.” The gracious and understated mansion is a fraternal twin to Keyes’s Goad House, from its clean white brick façade to its front pillars, layout and proportions. Over the Tuscan-colonnaded and entablatured front portico is Keyes’s central triangular pediment with ornate cornices. A tall, iron-railed transom window tops the front door. The house’s simple symmetry and proportions are broken up {{by a large}} garage to one <b>side.</b> Low <b>lanterned</b> walls of matching construction to the house frame {{the front of the}} property. It was built for Max M. Fisher (Forbes 400 member and “oil and real estate magnate”) as his main residence. (Fisher was a very close friend of fellow Keyes-client John Bugas.) The house contains another Keyes-signature “glass-walled garden room” where Fisher conducted his business at home, overlooking the pool and golf course to the south. Fisher was a major supporter of Israel (its “most successful fund raiser” and “the single most important lay person in the American Jewish community”) and close Middle East advisor to Republican Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, and G.W. Bush—and for many years the estate was guarded by a White House security detail. Fisher died in his house in 2005.|$|R
60|$|Having {{rattled off}} the {{familiar}} speech in Mr. Smithers's elegant manner, Ben begin to cut up such capers {{that even a}} party of dignified hens, going down the avenue to bed, paused to look on with clucks of astonishment, evidently fancying that salt had set him to fluttering and tumbling as it did them. Never had the old gate beheld such antics, though it had seen gay doings in its time; for of all the boys who had climbed over it, not one had ever stood on his head upon each of the big balls which ornamented the posts, hung by his heels from the arch, gone round and round like a wheel with the bar for an axis, played a tattoo with his toes while holding on by his chin, walked about the wall on his hands, or closed the entertainment by festooning himself in an airy posture over the <b>side</b> of the <b>lantern</b> frame, and kissing {{his hand to the}} audience as a well-bred Cupid is supposed to do on making his bow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} abbey {{church was}} built {{of wood and}} [...] "was probably" [...] two-stories high; it was, however, quickly replaced in stone. The church was damaged in {{the attack on the}} abbey in 1146 and was rebuilt, in a larger scale, on the same site. Building work was completed c.1170. This structure, completed around 1170, was 300 ft long and had 11 bays in the <b>side</b> aisles. A <b>lantern</b> tower was added at the crossing of the church in the late 12th century. The presbytery at the eastern end of the church was much altered in the 13th century. The church's greatly lengthened choir, commenced by Abbot John of York, 1203-11, and carried on by his successor terminates, like that of Durham Cathedral, in an eastern transept, the work of Abbot John of Kent, 1220-47. The 160 ft tower, which was added not long before the dissolution, by Abbot Huby, 1494-1526, is in an unusual position at the northern end of the north transept and bears Huby's motto ''''Soli Deo Honor et Gloria''''. The sacristry adjoined the south transept.|$|R
2500|$|Weston had a love {{of travel}} and {{encouraged}} this in his children. While in the US, between 1919 and 1921, Weston purchased a Detroit-manufactured Commerce one tonne truck with a Continental N engine. The truck was shipped to England where Weston converted it into a motor home which could sleep five. Weston painted the vehicle yellow with black trim and called it [...] "Suid Afrika". The Suid Afrika was essentially a large wooden structure on the rear chassis of the truck. Windows were placed {{at the front of}} the living quarters and in the <b>sides</b> of the <b>lantern</b> roof. The vehicle could be hoisted upright onto a ship's deck. A sign on the side read, [...] "Our mansion: 7 by 14 feet, Our field: the world, Our family: mankind." [...] and surrounding this, in a circle, [...] "Round the World." [...] Weston and his family took a tour of 18 weeks in the Suid Afrika from England to Greece. The Westons lived in Athens for two years then in May 1924, returned in the Suid Afrika to England and from there to South Africa. In 1925, Weston made extensive travels through southern Africa. In 1926, the family attempted to return to [...] England, overland. In 1927, Weston found the motor home was not suitable for the trip and returned to Cape Town. (The house in Brandfort was sold in April 1928.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Possibly {{the same}} device was {{referred}} to as [...] "umbrella lamp" [...] and mentioned as [...] "a variety of zoetrope" [...] which [...] "may well have originated in China" [...] by historian of Chinese technology Joseph Needham. It had pictures painted on thin panes of paper or mica on the sides of a light cylindrical canopy bearing vanes at the top. When placed over a lamp it would give an impression of movement of animals or men. Needham mentions several other descriptions of figures moving after the lighting of a candle or lamp, but some of these have a semi-fabulous context or can be compared to heat operated carousel toys. It is possible that all these early Chinese examples were actually the same as, or very similar to, the [...] "trotting horse lamp" [...] known in China since before 1000 CE. This is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes or painted figures attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The moving silhouettes are projected on the thin paper <b>sides</b> of the <b>lantern.</b> Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected iron wire. None of these lamps are known to have featured sequential substitution of images depicting motion and thus don't display animation {{in the way that the}} zoetrope does.|$|R
60|$|Each of {{its members}} {{appeared}} to be selected, as Fortunio, in the fairy-tale,[I-D] chose his followers, for his peculiar gifts. First on the list stood the MAN OF MEDICINE, Dr. Quentin Quackleben, who claimed right to regulate medical matters at the spring, upon the principle which, of old, assigned the property of a newly discovered country to the bucanier who committed the earliest piracy on its shores. The acknowledgment of the Doctor's merit as having been first to proclaim and vindicate the merits of these healing fountains, had occasioned his being universally installed First Physician and Man of Science, which last qualification he could apply to all purposes, from the boiling of an egg to the giving a lecture. He was, indeed, qualified, {{like many of his}} profession, to spread both the bane and antidote before a dyspeptic patient, being as knowing a gastronome as Dr. Redgill himself, or any other worthy physician who has written {{for the benefit of the}} cuisine, from Dr. Moncrieff of Tippermalloch, to the late Dr. Hunter of York, and the present Dr. Kitchiner of London. But pluralities are always invidious, and therefore the Doctor prudently relinquished the office of caterer and head-carver to the Man of Taste, who occupied regularly, and ex officio, the head of the table, reserving to himself the occasional privilege of criticising, and a principal share in consuming, the good things which the common entertainment afforded. We have only to sum up this brief account of the learned Doctor, by informing the reader that he was a tall, lean, beetle-browed man, with an ill-made black scratch-wig, that stared out on either <b>side</b> from his <b>lantern</b> jaws. He resided nine months out of the twelve at St. Ronan's, and was supposed to make an indifferent good thing of it,--especially as he played whist to admiration.|$|R
5000|$|According to a 4th-century Chinese {{historical}} text, the 1st-century BCE Chinese Han craftsman Ding Huan {{created a}} lamp with a circular band {{with images of}} birds and animals that moved [...] "quite naturally" [...] when {{the heat of the}} lamp caused the band to rotate. However, it is unclear whether this really created the illusion of motion or whether the account was an interpretation of the actual movement of the pictures of animals.Possibly the same device was referred to as [...] "umbrella lamp" [...] and called [...] "a variety of zoetrope" [...] which [...] "may well have originated in China" [...] by historian of Chinese technology Joseph Needham.

60|$|The {{pleasure}} {{of the day was}} dead. It could not rally from that stroke. They went on to Strà, as they had planned, but the glory of the Villa Pisani was eclipsed for Don Ippolito. He plainly {{did not know what to}} do. He did not address Florida again, whose savagery he would not probably have known how to resent if he had wished to resent it. Mrs. Vervain prattled away to him with unrelenting kindness; Ferris kept near him, and with affectionate zeal tried to make him talk of the villa, but neither the frescoes, nor the orangeries, nor the green- houses, nor the stables, nor the gardens could rouse him from the listless daze in which he moved, though Ferris found them all as wonderful as he had said. Amidst this heavy embarrassment no one seemed at ease but the author of it. She did not, to be sure, speak to Don Ippolito, but she followed her mother as usual with her assiduous cares, and she appeared tranquilly unconscious of the sarcastic civility with which Ferris rendered her any service. It was late in the afternoon when they got back to their boat and began to descend the canal towards Venice, and long before they reached Fusina the day had passed. A sunset of melancholy red, streaked with level lines of murky cloud, stretched across the flats behind them, and faintly tinged with its reflected light the eastern horizon which the towers and domes of Venice had not yet begun to break. The twilight came, and then through the overcast heavens the moon shone dim; a light blossomed here and there in the villas, distant voices called musically; a cow lowed, a dog barked; the rich, sweet breath of the vernal land mingled its odors with the sultry air of the neighboring lagoon. The wayfarers spoke little; the time hung heavy on all, no doubt; to Ferris it was a burden almost intolerable to hear the creak of the oars and the breathing of the gondoliers keeping time together. At last the boat stopped in front of the police-station in Fusina; a soldier with a sword at his <b>side</b> and a <b>lantern</b> in his hand came out and briefly parleyed with the gondoliers; they stepped ashore, and he marched them into the station before him.|$|R
6000|$|His eye {{and nose}} were {{impeccable}} in {{their sense of}} form; indeed, he was very English in that matter: People must be just so; things smell properly; and affairs {{go on in the}} one right way. He could tolerate neither creatures in ragged clothes, nor children on their hands and knees, nor postmen, because, with their bags, they swelled-up on one <b>side,</b> and carried <b>lanterns</b> on their stomachs. He would never let the harmless creatures pass without religious barks. Naturally a believer in authority and routine, and distrusting spiritual adventure, he yet had curious fads that seemed to have nested in him, quite outside of all principle. He would, for instance, follow neither carriages nor horses, and if we tried to make him, at once left for home, where he would sit with nose raised to Heaven, emitting through it a most lugubrious, shrill noise. Then again, one must not place a stick, a slipper, a glove, or anything with which he could play, upon one's head--since such an action reduced him at once to frenzy. For so conservative a dog, his environment was sadly anarchistic. He never complained in words of our shifting habits, but curled his head round over his left paw and pressed his chin very hard against the ground whenever he smelled packing. What necessity, he seemed continually to be saying, what real necessity is there for change of any kind whatever? Here we were all together, and one day was like another, so that I knew where I was--and now you only know what will happen next; and I--I can't tell you whether I shall be with you when it happens! What strange, grieving minutes a dog passes at such times in the underground of his subconsciousness, refusing realisation, yet all the time only too well divining. Some careless word, some unmuted compassion in voice, the stealthy wrapping of a pair of boots, the unaccustomed shutting of a door that ought to be open, the removal from a down-stair room of an object always there--one tiny thing, and he knows for certain that he is not going too. He fights against the knowledge just as we do against what we cannot bear; he gives up hope, but not effort, protesting in the only way he knows of, and now and then heaving a great sigh. Those sighs of a dog! They go to the heart so much more deeply than the sighs of our own kind, because they are utterly unintended, regardless of effect, emerging from one who, heaving them, knows not that they have escaped him! ...|$|R
