40|$|The recent paper {{entitled}} by K. C. Lee et al. (2011) establishes nonlocal macroscopic quantum correlations, {{which they}} term “entanglement”, under ambient conditions. Photon(s) -phonon entanglements are established within each interferometer arm. However, our analysis demonstrates, the phonon fields between arms become correlated {{as a result}} of single-photon wavepacket path indistinguishability, not true nonlocal entanglement. We also note that a coherence expansion (as opposed to decoherence) resulted from local entanglement which was not recognized. It occurred from nearly identical Raman scattering in each arm (importantly not meeting the Born and Markovian approximations). The ability to establish nonlocal macroscopic quantum correlations through path indistinguishability rather than entanglement offers the opportunity to greatly expand quantum macroscopic theory and application, even though it was not true nonlocal entanglement.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design of}} spatially varying porosity profiles in next-generation electrodes based on simultaneous optimization of a porous-electrode model. Model-based optimal design (not including the solid-phase intercalation mechanism) is applied to a porous positive electrode made of lithium cobalt oxide, which is commonly used in lithium-ion batteries for various applications. For a fixed amount of active material, optimal grading of the porosity across the electrode was found to decrease the ohmic resistance by 15 %– 33 %, which in turn increases the electrode capacity to hold and deliver energy. The optimal porosity grading was predicted to have 40 % lower variation in the ohmic resistance to variations in model parameters due to manufacturing imprecision or capacity fade.

By decoupling the formation of surface roughness from the doping process, we study the structural and electronic properties of fs-laser doped silicon. These experiments are a necessary step toward developing predictive models of the doping process. We use a single fs-laser pulse to dope silicon with sulfur, enabling quantitative secondary ion mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, and Hall effect measurements. These measurements indicate that at laser fluences at or above 4 [*]kJ[*]m[superscript − 2], a single laser pulse yields a sulfur dose >(3 [*]±[*] 1) [*]×[*] 10 [superscript 13][*]cm[superscript − 2] and results in a 45 -nm thick amorphous surface layer.

40|$|We {{performed}} OCT imaging {{of the rat}} retina at 70, 000 axial scans {{per second}} with ~ 3 μm axial resolution. Three-dimensional OCT (3 D-OCT) data sets of the rat retina were acquired. The high speed and high density data sets enable improved en face visualization by reducing eye motion artifacts and improve Doppler OCT measurements. Minimal motion artifacts were visible and the OCT fundus images offer more precise registration of individual OCT images to retinal fundus features. Projection OCT fundus images show features such as the nerve fiber layer, retinal capillary networks and choroidal vasculature. Doppler OCT images and quantitative measurements show pulsatility in retinal blood vessels. Doppler OCT provides noninvasive in vivo quantitative measurements of retinal blood flow properties and may benefit studies of diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Ultrahigh speed imaging using ultrahigh resolution spectral / Fourier domain OCT promises to enable novel protocols for measuring small animal retinal structure and retinal blood flow. This non-invasive imaging technology is a promising tool for monitoring disease progression in rat and mouse models to assess ocular disease pathogenesis and response to treatment.

40|$|Background: A {{structurally}} and functionally normal choroidal vasculature {{is essential}} for retinal function. Therefore, a precise clinical understanding of choroidal morphology should be important for understanding many retinal and choroidal diseases. Methods: PUBMED ([URL] was used {{for most of the}} literature search for this article. The criterion for inclusion of an article in the references for this review was that it included materials about both the clinical and the basic properties of choroidal imaging using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Results: Recent reports show successful examination and accurate measurement of choroidal thickness in normal and pathologic states using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography systems. This review focuses on the principles of the new technology that make choroidal imaging using optical coherence tomography possible and on the changes that subsequently have been documented to occur in the choroid in various diseases. Additionally, it outlines future directions in choroidal imaging. Conclusion: Optical coherence tomography is now proven to be an effective noninvasive tool to evaluate the choroid and to detect choroidal changes in pathologic states. Additionally, choroidal evaluation using optical coherence tomography {{can be used as a}} parameter for diagnosis and follow-up. Author Manuscript received 2012 June 22.

Methods Thirty-nine eyes (8 healthy, 19 glaucoma suspects and 12 glaucoma) from 49 subjects were scanned twice using swept-source (SS−) OCT in a 3. 5 × 3. 5 × 3. 64 mm (400 × 400 × 896 pixels) volume centered on the optic nerve head, with the focus readjusted after each scan. The LC was automatically segmented and analyzed for microarchitectural parameters, including pore diameter, pore diameter standard deviation (SD), pore aspect ratio, pore area, beam thickness, beam thickness SD, and beam thickness to pore diameter ratio. Reproducibility of the parameters was assessed by computing the imprecision of the parameters between the scans. Results The automated segmentation demonstrated excellent reproducibility. All LC microarchitecture parameters had an imprecision of less or equal to 4. 2 %. There was little variability in imprecision with respect to diagnostic category, although the method tends to show higher imprecision amongst healthy subjects. Conclusion The proposed automated segmentation of the LC demonstrated high reproducibility for 3 D LC parameters. This segmentation analysis tool will be useful for in-vivo studies of the LC.

40|$|Topology and {{percolation}} effects play {{an important}} role in heterogeneous materials, but have rarely been studied for higher-order tensor properties. We explore the effective elastic properties of random multiphase materials using a combination of continuum computational simulations and analytical theories. The effective shear and bulk moduli of a class of symmetric-cell random composites with high phase contrasts are determined, and reveal shortcomings of classical homogenization theories in predicting elastic properties of percolating systems. The effective shear modulus exhibits typical percolation behavior, but with its percolation threshold shifting with the contrast in phase bulk moduli. On the contrary, the effective bulk modulus does not exhibit intrinsic percolation but does show an apparent or extrinsic percolation transition due to cross effects between shear and bulk moduli. We also propose an empirical approach for bridging percolation and homogenization theories and predicting the effective shear and bulk moduli in a manner consistent with the simulations.

The gyro-TWT operates with 30 dB of small signal gain near 140 GHz in the HE 06 mode of a confocal waveguide. Picosecond pulses show broadening and transit time delay due to two distinct effects: the frequency dependence of the group velocity near cutoff and gain narrowing by the finite gain bandwidth of 1. 2 GHz. Experimental results taken {{over a wide range}} of parameters show good agreement with a theoretical model in the small signal gain regime. These results show that in order to limit the pulse broadening effect in gyrotron amplifiers, it is crucial to both choose an operating frequency at least several percent above the cutoff of the waveguide circuit and operate {{at the center of the}} gain spectrum with sufficient gain bandwidth.

Electrochimica Acta 2008, 53, 7599.), {{we show that}} the spinodal and miscibility gaps generally shrink as the host particle size decreases to the nanoscale. Our work is motivated by recent experiments on the high-rate Li-ion battery material LiFePO 4; this serves {{as the basis for}} our examples, but our analysis and conclusions apply to any intercalation material. We describe two general mechanisms for the suppression of phase separation in nanoparticles, (i) a classical bulk effect, predicted by the Cahn−Hilliard equation in which the diffuse phase boundary becomes confined by the particle geometry; and (ii) a novel surface effect, predicted by chemical-potential-dependent reaction kinetics, in which insertion/extraction reactions stabilize composition gradients near surfaces in equilibrium with the local environment. Composition-dependent surface energy and (especially) elastic strain can contribute to these effects but are not required to predict decreased spinodal and miscibility gaps at the nanoscale.

40|$|Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (EHEC O 157) is an {{important}} cause of food and waterborne illness in the developed countries. Cattle are a reservoir host of EHEC O 157 and {{a major source of}} human exposure through contaminated meat products. Shiga toxins (Stxs) are {{an important}} pathogenicity trait of EHEC O 157. The insertion sites of the Stx-encoding bacteriophages differentiate EHEC O 157 isolates into genogroups commonly isolated from cattle but rarely from sick humans (bovine-biased genotypes [BBG]) and those commonly isolated from both cattle and human patients (clinical genotypes [CG]). Since BBG and CG share the cardinal virulence factors of EHEC O 157 and are carried by cattle at similar prevalences, the infrequent occurrence of BBG among human disease isolates suggests that they may be less virulent than CG. We compared the virulence potentials of human and bovine isolates of CG and BBG in newborn conventional pig and weaned Dutch Belted rabbit models. CG-challenged piglets experienced severe disease accompanied by early and high mortality compared to BBG-challenged piglets. Similarly, CG-challenged rabbits were likely to develop lesions in kidney and intestine compared with the BBG-challenged rabbits. The CG strains used in this study carried stx 2 and produced significantly higher amounts of Stx, whereas the BBG strains carried the stx 2 c gene variant only. These results suggest that BBG are less virulent than CG and that this difference in virulence potential is associated with the Stx 2 subtype(s) carried and/or the amount of Stx produced.
