5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, {{and the right to}} tax local areas.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Army {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training.

5|$|Three {{hills in}} the region were the Parvati Hill, the Chaturshringi Hill, and the Khadki hill.

5|$|A {{few days}} {{after the end of the}} Battle of Vukovar, there were 2,000 detainees in the camp. Detainees usually spent several days in the camp, during which <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> interrogated, beaten and killed. Up to 10,000 detainees passed through the camp before it was closed in March 1992, when the United Nations Protection Force {{deployed}} to the area. Anywhere between 15 and 800 inmates may have been killed at the camp, though the latter figure includes approximately 700 people who are missing and presumed dead. The events in the camp formed part of three indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. , two of the trials are ongoing, while the trial of Slobodan Milošević was terminated following his death.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> already {{used by the}} IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E

5|$|Having first {{inhabited}} Pennsylvania between 16,000 and 10,000 BCE, nomadic Native Americans {{reached the}} {{area near the}} mouth of Fishing Creek by 8000 BCE. By 3000 to 2000 BCE, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> going into the Fishing Creek valley during the winter to hunt deer and bears and returning to the Susquehanna River in the summer, creating trade routes. There was no permanent habitation until 1000 BCE when some Native American villages were built at the mouth of Fishing Creek. The Native Americans who settled in this area included the Shawnee and Susquehannock Indians. A Native American path ran along the creek from Bloomsburg to Orangeville before turning away in the direction of Tunkhannock Creek. Since at least 1769, there has also been a path between the mouths of Huntington and Green Creeks.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) {{led to the}} death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis. Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war. Richard Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died or were killed, a total of 3.6million. Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion {{also took}} part in a similar {{operation}} in 1944 and formed 81 and 82 Columns. As in the first expedition in 1943 the Chindits again suffered heavy casualties and fought behind the Japanese lines at Kohima and Imphal. After Orde Wingate was killed in a crash in March 1944, it was decided to break up the remaining Chindit formations and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> to be converted into airborne infantry battalions.

5|$|The Anglo-French rivalry {{had led to}} the {{coalescence}} {{and strengthening}} of the Turkish National Movement {{under the leadership of}} Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Kemal had denounced the Allied occupation of Cilicia in November 1919 and the forces loyal to him were tenaciously preparing to launch a major insurrection against the thinly spread French units garrisoned in Marash, Antep and Urfa. Experienced officers, including the Kurdish captain Ali Kılıç, were sent by Mustafa Kemal to organize the tribal units and chete (irregular fighters) bands in the region. The Turkish forces in Marash numbered 2,500. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> armed with old hunting rifles and others with melee weapons. Before the battle, they obtained 850 rifles, 2 machine guns, 2 cannons (not used during the fighting), from the gendarmerie building in Marash.|$|E
5|$|The double {{election}} {{was a result}} of the growing tensions inside the College of Cardinals concerning the policy of the Holy See towards the Holy Roman Empire, initiated by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which ended the investiture controversy. Several, particularly older, cardinals considered the compromise achieved in Worms as desertion of the principles of the Gregorian Reform, and inclined to accept it only as a tactical move. They supported the traditional alliance of the Papacy with the Normans in southern Italy. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> connected to old monastic centers in Southern Italy such as Montecassino.

5|$|The {{settlements}} were small, forming family based communities, but <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> more sizable and functioned {{over many}} generations. They lacked artificial fortifications, but natural factors facilitating self-defense were often utilized. Such settlements could form small clusters separated by uninhabited areas. One rather large dwelling place, which functioned from the 2nd to the 4th century, was discovered and investigated in Osowo near Suwałki. The living quarters consisted of pillar supported houses, while the farming infrastructure area included eighty grain storage caves. Small fortified refuge areas were built {{to a limited}} extend beginning {{at the end of}} the 4th century, but on a larger scale fortified settlements were constructed by the Western Balts only during the Middle Ages.|$|E
