500|$|In an {{interview}} with Real Sound, Suzuki related her experiences working on her single [...] "Redo". She describes the title song as difficult but fun and exciting to sing live. Having watched Re:Zero, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> series' world view and the character Subaru, and sang the song to fit that worldview. She wanted to put [...] "50% of the anime's worldview" [...] and [...] "50% her own feelings" [...] into the song. She describes the single's coupling song [...] "Moebius" [...] as stemming from a policy where she was not to lie to anyone, and how she reflected on that four years after her debut. She mentioned how the song represents {{that she wants to}} establish a relationship of trust with her fans. In {{an interview}} with Eplus, she mentions that the name of her 20th birthday live, [...] "Cheers", is meant to convey a message of [...] "thank you" [...] to the people who had supported her career up to that point.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{days after}} this incident, Angela heard casually from Mr. Fraser that Sir John and Lady Bellamy {{were going on}} a short trip abroad {{for the benefit of}} the former's health. If <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter at all, it was to feel rather glad. Angela did not like Lady Bellamy, indeed she feared her. Of George she neither heard nor saw anything. He had also gone away.|$|E
60|$|Gradually {{the minutes}} passed by, {{and she became}} aware that she must face the major. Well! What had she done? She had stolen nothing. She had taken no person's property. She had, indeed, been wickedly robbed, and the police had done nothing to get back for her her property, as they were bound to have done. She would take care to tell the major what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{negligence}} of the police. The major should not have the talk all to himself.|$|E
60|$|Full of her discovery, Mrs Craw set {{the candle}} on the table, {{and sat down}} on the chair by the bedside to think <b>about</b> it; but <b>the</b> more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it <b>the</b> more puzzled she was.|$|R
60|$|Oh yes! <b>the</b> more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it all, <b>the</b> more {{sure was}} she that Percy {{was already in}} Boulogne, and that he knew of her capture and her danger.|$|R
50|$|The {{experiences}} {{that she and}} her husband had during the war altered her perception of her identification as a Jew. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> deeply <b>about</b> <b>the</b> questions aroused by the war and the Holocaust, dealing with them in fiction and essays. She converted to Catholicism, arousing controversy among her circle, because she believed that Christ was a persecuted Jew.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know if the}} {{difference}} is very marked," [...] said Grace, with a curious feeling of annoyance, for {{there was a note}} in Osborn's voice that jarred. He was, like Gerald, a gambler, greedy for money he had not earned, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> story Kit had told. Its hero had risked and lost his life, and Kit had paid in health and fortune, because they put honor before gain. For all that, she knew she had said enough when she saw Osborn's frown.|$|E
60|$|He left her, {{but she was}} not deceived by his {{careless}} tone. She {{thought he}} meant to bring Fuller back and did not see how she could prevent this, although she had refused to help. Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plans that Brandon had lost at their house in England. They had certainly been stolen, for she could not doubt what he had told her, but it was painful to admit that her father had taken them. She felt dejected and lonely, and while she struggled against the depression Lucille came to say that Jake was waiting below.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Port sat down, {{her elbows}} on the table, and her chin in her hands. [...] "It must be {{something}} serious," [...] she thought. [...] "The ladies of this town {{are not in the}} habit of staying out late unless it is to nurse bad cases, or to sit up with corpses." [...] And then the idea struck her that probably there might be something the matter that she had not thought of. She had caused lots of mischief in her day, and it might easily be that she had forgotten some of it. But the more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter, the more firmly she resolved not to go down and speak to the women. She would like to send for a constable and have them cleared out of the house, but she knew that none of the three constables in town would dare to use force with such ladies as Mrs. Faulkner {{and the members of the}} Dorcas Society.|$|E

She caught his thumb and, sighing, held it exactly as Hugh held hers when they went walking. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> Hugh. <b>The</b> current maid was in for the evening, but was it safe to leave the baby with her? The thought was distant and elusive.|$|R

25|$|In 2013, {{when asked}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> secret of her longevity, {{she said that}} she ate three eggs a day, drank a glass of {{homemade}} grappa, and enjoyed a chocolate sometimes, but, above all, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> positively <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future. <b>She</b> was still living alone in her home on her 115th birthday. In 2016 she credited her long life to her diet of raw eggs and cookies, and to staying single.|$|R
60|$|James Cushat-Prinkly was a {{young man}} who had always had a settled {{conviction}} that one of these days he would marry; up to the age of thirty-four he had done nothing to justify that conviction. He liked and admired a great many women collectively and dispassionately without singling out one for especial matrimonial consideration, just as one might admire the Alps without feeling that one wanted any particular peak as one’s own private property. His lack of initiative in this matter aroused a certain amount of impatience among the sentimentally-minded women-folk of his home circle; his mother, his sisters, an aunt-in-residence, and two or three intimate matronly friends regarded his dilatory approach to the married state with a disapproval that was far from being inarticulate. His most innocent flirtations were watched with the straining eagerness which a group of unexercised terriers concentrates on the slightest movements of a human being who may be reasonably considered likely to take them for a walk. No decent-souled mortal can long resist the pleading of several pairs of walk-beseeching dog-eyes; James Cushat-Prinkly was not sufficiently obstinate or indifferent to home influences to disregard the obviously expressed wish of his family that he should become enamoured of some nice marriageable girl, and when his Uncle Jules departed this life and bequeathed him a comfortable little legacy it really seemed the correct thing to do to set about discovering some one to share it with him. The process of discovery was carried on more by the force of suggestion and the weight of public opinion than by any initiative of his own; a clear working majority of his female relatives and the aforesaid matronly friends had pitched on Joan Sebastable as the most suitable young woman in his range of acquaintance to whom he might propose marriage, and James became gradually accustomed to the idea that he and Joan would go together through the prescribed stages of congratulations, present-receiving, Norwegian or Mediterranean hotels, and eventual domesticity. It was necessary, however to ask the lady what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter; the family had so far conducted and directed the flirtation with ability and discretion, but the actual proposal would have to be an individual effort.|$|E
5000|$|Blackmore {{tries to}} figure out what she was {{conscious}} of just beforehand. When she asks, she can remember many sensations—for instance, the wood floor and the cat's purr. It seems as though she had been aware of them for a while back in time, yet she only seemed to [...] "notice" [...] them when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> question. Likewise, Blackmore thinks about her breath, which [...] "is always there", but she's not sure if she was watching it prior to asking the question.|$|E
5000|$|The sun {{was still}} a {{manageable}} ball above the ringing hills as Lou went outside. She walked through this stiff landscape, carrying her cold and awkward hands. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cardboard aunt, Aunt Theodora Goodman, who was both a kindness and a darkness. Lou touched the sundial, on which the time had remained frozen. She was afraid, and sad, because there was some great intolerable pressure from which {{it is not possible}} to escape.

50|$|From 2007-2008 HeavyShield studied Blood beadwork in the {{collections}} of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, the Royal Ontario Museum and the Glenbow Museum. Studying the museums classification systems of these objects, she noticed they were stored in rows of drawers or on shelves and often with only small catalog tags. During this study <b>she</b> also <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people (mainly women) who created the objects, people whom {{she and her family}} are related to genetically and historically. One piece that came from this study is hours (2007); a book, with no text, consisting of twelve bound pages of woven white seed beads.|$|R

50|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} written and financed {{to be about}} a man who had abandoned his daughter. But then Armstrong went to see Wrong World at the cinema, which was about a male drifter, and the more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> more she felt there had been plenty of films about a man being reunited with their child such as Paper Moon and Paris Texas. Her husband suggested she change the character to a woman, which would not only be different but give the film a harder edge. Armstrong was reluctant as {{she did not want to}} make another film about a woman, but eventually changed her mind. Jones and Levy agreed with the choice.|$|E
5000|$|Writer-director Lee was {{attracted}} to the original short story, which he adapted, because of its emotional depth. Lee said casting for the film was difficult, as he had trouble finding an actress in her 30s who was both comfortable with horror and playing a mother. [...] Liu, who was cast as the mother, said the role was her [...] "most challenging to date", as she had to play a range of emotions without having been a mother. [...] To prepare for the emotional scenes, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss of her cats. [...] Liu cited {{a scene in which}} a disembodied hand fondles her as the most difficult in the film. After discussing it with Lee, he agreed to make it less intimate, and it was rewritten to involving kissing instead.|$|E
5000|$|Marie’s nephew, François de Cossé, 11th Duke of Brissac, {{brought a}} lawsuit {{on behalf of}} her family before the Tribunal de grande {{instance}} of the Seine {{to try to stop}} the wedding. [...] He claimed that his aunt was mentally incompetent. Marie claimed that <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> marriage twelve years ago, but had delayed on account of her grandchildren. The court determined that a nephew had no legal right to oppose the marriage of an aunt. It appointed a commission of three doctors to investigate Marie’s mental state and confirmed a judicial administrator appointed on July 7 to manage Marie’s estate.|$|R
60|$|As for the Water Sprite, {{she was in}} a truly disconsolate mood, {{because she}} had left so soon the Land of the Lovely Lakes, where she had been so happy. <b>The</b> more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, <b>the</b> more <b>she</b> grieved; and one morning, unable to bear her sorrow longer, she sprang into the great jet of the {{fountain}}. High into the bright air the fountain threw her, scattering her into a thousand drops of glittering water; but not one drop fell back into the basin. The great, warm sun drew them up; and, in a little white cloud, they floated away across the bright blue sky.|$|R
60|$|But <b>the</b> more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, <b>the</b> more bewildered she felt. Faster fell the snow, colder {{blew the}} wind, darker grew the night; and poor Effie {{made up her}} mind that she was quite {{forgotten}} and left to freeze alone. The tears were chilled on her cheeks, her feet felt like icicles, and her heart died within her, so hungry, frightened, and forlorn was she. Laying her head on her knees, she gave herself up for lost, and sat there with the great flakes fast turning her to a little white mound, when suddenly the sound of music reached her, and starting up, she looked and listened with all her eyes and ears.|$|R
50|$|Agnes is {{instructed}} {{to go into}} an isolated room and think about three things: times when she was happy, sad and scared. Through his brain-scanning technology, Coreman is able to tell in which order <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> three emotions. When Hector takes his turn, he thinks about Clara marrying someone else, about his time being kidnapped, and about Ying Li, but his emotions are strangely blocked. He receives a call from remorseful Clara, who tells him {{she wants to be}} a mother. Hector explains what he's learned, that the most unhappy thing he could imagine would be to lose her. Suddenly Hector's brain scan erupts with a flurry of activity, mimicking the colored flags from the monastery and revealing that true happiness isn't just one emotion; it's all of them. Having finally achieved his own happiness, Hector rushes home and marries Clara.|$|E

When she {{finally got to}} battle the Hulk, she filled his body with a S.H.I.E.L.D.-devised poison {{concoction}} specially designed to kill him, but the sole effect was to cause boils to erupt on his skin. The Hulk's healing factor returned him to normal {{after just a few}} minutes, after which he was prompted to a sudden rush of anger by Amadeus Cho. Cho reveals to her the relationship her mother and the Hulk had back when they were in college. Cho asks her if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> origins of her green hair. Carmilla attacks a S.H.I.E.L.D. truck transporting Bruce Banner to his underground prison, destroying the truck and knocking out both agents. Intending to get a DNA sample from Banner, she opens his casket, only to discover it was one of three decoys.|$|E

To tell the truth, Dolores could quite as easily have written in her own, and brought down the letter in her pocket, {{if she had been}} eager <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter; but she was not, except under the {{influence}} of making a grievance. She had never written to Uncle Alfred in her life, nor he to her; and his visits to her mother had always led to something uncomfortable. Nor would <b>she</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> subject at all {{if it had not been}} for the sore sense that she was cut off from him, as she fancied, because he belonged to her mother.|$|R

Getting there about a month after she had left, she had hoped to take a train to the west when they began running again. On 9 July, after living there for about a week under the alias [...] "Gerda Alt", she was arrested by two {{civilian}} members of the Soviet military administration and was kept in Berlin for interrogation. While in prison she heard harrowing tales from her Soviet guards <b>about</b> what <b>the</b> German military had done to members of their families in Russia and came to realise that much of what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> war in the east was only what the Nazi propaganda ministry had told the German people and that the treatment meted out to Germans by the Russians was a response to what the Germans had done in the Soviet Union.|$|R

But running her background down is hard. She said that her codename is Zarda, but at her power level the government did not push it. Later a liaison officer asks her to fill in some identification and non-disclosure forms, but Zarda lies to the officer, saying she can not remember details due to an [...] "accident". After General Richard Alexander asks why she calls herself Zarda, thinking it to be an old nickname, he informs her that focus groups came up with Power Princess. After he asked her what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> name, she said Princess of Power would be better, but the General said that it was already copyrighted (referring to She-Ra: Princess of Power, a cartoon related to He-Man and the Masters of the Universe).|$|E

When Robin fell into a coma shortly after Emma's birth, Anna {{was in the hospital}} to give her strength. Anna went to grab Chinese food for dinner with Patrick and Robin asked Anna to be her maid of honor at her wedding. Robert, Patrick, Robin, Anna, and Mac shared a meal and toasted family. Robin summed up the meaning of family as she told each of them how much they meant to her and how grateful she was to have family around her so that they could share Christmas together. On Robin and Patrick's wedding day, Anna danced with Patrick and told him that she would trust him with her daughter. Patrick thanked her for her trust and said that he would never stop loving Robin. As Robert watched, he flashed back to the time that he and Anna had told Robin that they were her parents and would love her forever. When Robert turned to Anna and asked if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time they had admitted being Robin's parents, they were both stunned to learn that they had both been recalling the same moment in time. Anna remarked to Robert that she was in awe that a young woman as lovely as Robin had been conceived out of their love for each other. Anna had tears in her eyes as she looked from Robert to her daughter.|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} in the “Experimental procedure” section, we asked the participants to provide us feedback about the identification of design problems. They answered a follow-up questionnaire, and we use their answers to conduct a qualitative analysis. The objective of the questionnaire was to gather participant’s opinion regarding (i) the (dis)advantages of using the agglomerations or code smells to identify design problems, (ii) whether the provided information could be easily understood, (iii) which types of information were fundamental to identify design problems, (iv) what she believes that {{should be done to}} improve the identification of design problems, (v) what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of the code smells for the identification of design problems, (vi) how the visualization mechanism provided by the Organic tool affected her performance, and (vii) which types of code smell and categories of agglomeration were the most useful for identifying design problems.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} examines {{aspects of}} phrase boundary production, perception and the structural properties of boundaries from a multifaceted experimental perspective. The term prosody {{refers to the}} accentual prominence and phrasal organization of speech, and the dissertation focuses on the later. An example of this aspect of phrasal organization is given below, where the two sentences differ in prosodic phrasing. a. <b>She</b> knew, Ann <b>thought,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> present. b. <b>She</b> knew Ann <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> present. In addition to intonational events, at their edges, prosodic phrase boundaries introduce systematic phonetic variation in the temporal properties of segments. Acoustic {{studies have shown that}} at boundaries segments increase in duration. Articulatory studies have shown that speech movements [...] gestures [...] become temporally longer in the vicinity of boundaries and that this articulatory lengthening increases with boundary strength. In this dissertation a series of experimental studies is presented examining a) the articulation of gestures near phrase junctures, b) the categoricity and gradiency in the production and in the perception of prosodic boundaries, c) the link between articulatory properties of boundaries and listeners' perception of boundaries, and d) the effect of prosodic structure on pause duration. Results from this research further our understanding of the linguistic representation of prosodic structure and its relation to processes involved in producing spoken language...|$|R
