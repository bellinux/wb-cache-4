We consider {{a class of}} production/inventory control problems that has a single product and a single stocking location, when a stochastic demand with a known non-stationary probability distribution is given. A control policy {{for this type of}} inventory system is the one where the objective is to find the optimal number of replenishments, their timings and their respective order-up-to-levels that meet customer demands to a required service level. Two different models have been presented so far to solve this problem to optimality: a MIP model and an efficient CP model. In both these models negative orders are not allowed, so that if the actual stock exceeds the order-up-to-level for that review, this excess <b>stock</b> is <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and not returned to the supply source. Since this event is assumed to be rare, in both the models its effect is ignored. We present a global constraint that lets us to compute exact buffer stock levels for the CP model by considering the effect that <b>carrying</b> excess <b>stock</b> has on the service level in each period of our planning horizon. An extended version of this paper hasn’t been submitted to the technical programme. ...|$|R

30|$|Recognizing the {{existence}} of loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and <b>carried</b> backward in the US corporate tax system, Mackie–Mason (1990) analysed {{the effects of the}} marginal tax rate on debt policy. He found that when a company has loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit (i.e., another tax shield), it is less likely to raise capital by new debt issue. Since both existing loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit are substitutes for new debt issue in terms of tax savings, this result is consistent with the trade-off theory.|$|R
