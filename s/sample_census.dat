50|$|The Luo are {{the fourth}} largest ethnic group (15%) in Kenya, after the Kikuyu (22%), the Kalenjin (18%) and the Luhya (16%). The Luo and the Kikuyu {{inherited}} the bulk of political power {{in the first years}} following Kenya's independence in 1963. The Luo population in Kenya was estimated to be 2,185,000 in 1994 and 3.4 million in 2010 according to Govt census. However the figure was disputed by many Luos as not scientific since a significant portion of people previously considered as Luo were now counted as Suba people (of Kenya and Tanzania). The Subas eventually numbered 300,000 but most are completely assimilated Luos by culture, name, language and political orientation and have {{more or less the same}} outlook of life. This is a result of heavy intermarriage and interaction. The Luos also feel that their overall population has always been downscaled by successive Kenyan regime census in an attempt to mute the strong Luo political voice. <b>Sample</b> <b>census</b> conducted by experts estimate the total Kenyan Luo population to be currently at around 5 million.

40|$|Abstract: Full {{enumeration}} agriculture censuses {{have become}} less feasible financially and operationally {{in many developing}} countries. They had not always lived up to their promise to serve as frame for the intercensal surveys and to provide reasonably accurate benchmark data for small areas. Observed large deviations between the survey and census results point to serious non-sampling errors especially in the latter. Some developing countries had resorted to replacing agriculture censuses with sample enumerations that differ from the intercensal surveys only {{in the choice of}} a smaller domain, hence a bigger sample. There is need for strategies that link the <b>sample</b> <b>census</b> and the intercensal surveys, in a manner appropriate to the limited technical and operational capabilities of the developing countries.

30|$|Mauritania’s {{attitudes to}} and {{enumeration}} of nomadic populations differ from everywhere else. In Mauritania, the dominant ethnic group with political power has a nomadic pastoralist tradition {{and this has}} resulted in census data collection methods {{that focused on the}} quality of data collection on nomads and broke with the traditional census link between place and enumeration to use the tribal social organisation instead. With the help of INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques) of France, there was a <b>sample</b> <b>census</b> in rural Mauritania in 1964 to 1965. There is considerable documentary detail about the census methodology built around the tribal structure and lineages, identifying those to interview and then interviewing them and everyone else found in the same place (République Islamique de Mauritanie 1972). It was estimated that 77 % of the population was nomadic (Figure  1). There were extremely clear and coherent definitions of nomad and sedentary, and all tables in the census report were broken down by sedentary/nomad. A further <b>sample</b> <b>census</b> (sample of nomads but complete enumeration for the sedentary) was undertaken in 1976 / 1977 which used a similar approach based on the tribal structure to identify respondents, whilst retaining interviews at household level (République Islamique de Mauritanie nd_a, nd_b). At this time, the nomadic proportion of the population was estimated to have declined to just over 30 %. A number of different theses have studied this process of sedentarisation of the Mauritanian nomadic population and provide extremely well-justified and plausible explanations (Traoré 1984; Toupet 1977). The decline here is not because of invisibility but is a genuine social transformation.|$|E
