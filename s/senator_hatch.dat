5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1987, President Ronald Reagan considered appointing Senator Orrin Hatch to fill his seat. But Congress had, during the term which he was still serving, enacted a salary increase for the judiciary. In July 1987, Bork was nominated instead, {{although it is not}} clear how important a role the Ineligibility Clause issue played in the selection. Two months later, Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the Saxbe fix in a written opinion, concluding that it did not resolve the Ineligibility Clause issue. (The Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate, and the seat ultimately went to Anthony Kennedy.) According to Jan Crawford Greenberg, the Justice Department had previously done the same to <b>Senator</b> <b>Hatch</b> the year prior when Hatch put forth his name as a replacement for retiring Chief Justice Warren Burger. According to Greenburg, Michael Carvin used the Ineligibility Clause as a pretext to allow the White House to quietly say no to Hatch.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Kennedy secured an {{increase}} in the minimum wage law, which was one of his favorite issues; there would not be another increase for ten years. [...] Following the failure of the Clinton health care plan, Kennedy went against his past strategy and sought incremental measures instead. Kennedy worked with Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum to create and pass the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records. The same year, Kennedy's Mental Health Parity Act forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached. In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s. [...] <b>Senator</b> <b>Hatch</b> and Hillary Clinton also played major roles in SCHIP passing.|$|E
500|$|As the 111th Congress began, Kennedy {{dropped his}} {{spot on the}} Senate Judiciary Committee to focus all his attentions on health care issues, which he {{regarded}} as [...] "the cause of my life". [...] He saw {{the characteristics of the}} Obama administration and the Democratic majorities in Congress as representing the third and best great chance for universal health care, following the lost 1971 Nixon and 1993 Clinton opportunities, and as his last big legislative battle. Kennedy made another surprise appearance in the Senate to break a Republican filibuster against the Obama stimulus package. As spring arrived, Kennedy appeared on Capitol Hill more frequently, although staffers often did not announce his attendance at committee meetings until they were sure Kennedy was well enough to appear. On March 4, 2009, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown announced that Kennedy had been granted an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his work in the Northern Ireland peace process, and for his contribution to UK–US relations, although the move caused some controversy in the UK due to his connections with Gerry Adams of the Irish republican political party Sinn Féin. Later in March, a bill reauthorizing and expanding the AmeriCorps program was renamed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by <b>Senator</b> <b>Hatch</b> in Kennedy's honor. Kennedy threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park before the Boston Red Sox season opener in April, echoing what his grandfather [...] "Honey Fitz"– a member of the Royal Rooters– had done to open the park in 1912. Even when his illness prevented him from being a major factor in health plan deliberations, his symbolic presence still {{made him one of the}} key senators involved.|$|E
50|$|In the 2002 midterm congressional elections, the Republicans regained {{control of}} the Senate. During the new 108th Congress, <b>Senator</b> Orrin <b>Hatch,</b> R-UT, the new Republican {{chairman}} of the Senate Judiciary Committee, began to process previously blocked judicial nominees. California's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, announced their opposition to Kuhl's nomination. Contrary to Feinstein's and Boxer's wishes, and the tradition of having {{the approval of the}} state's own <b>Senators,</b> <b>Hatch</b> gave Kuhl a committee hearing, and passed her out of committee.|$|R

2500|$|The Education for Economic Security Act of 1984 {{included}} a section, Section 20 U.S.C.A. 4059, which initially read: [...] "Grants under this subchapter [...] {{may not be}} used for consultants, for transportation or for any activity which does not augment academic improvement." [...] With no public notice, Senator Orrin Hatch tacked onto the proposed exclusionary subsection the words [...] "or for any course of instruction the substance of which is Secular Humanism". Implementation of this provision ran into practical problems because neither the Senator's staff, nor the Senate's Committee on Labor and Human Resources, nor the Department of Justice could propose a definition of what would constitute a [...] "course of instruction the substance of which is Secular Humanism". So, this determination was left up to local school boards. The provision provoked a storm of controversy which within a year led <b>Senator</b> <b>Hatch</b> to propose, and Congress to pass, an amendment to delete from the statute all reference to secular humanism. While this episode did not dissuade fundamentalists from continuing to object to what they regarded as the [...] "teaching of Secular Humanism", it did point out the vagueness of the claim.|$|E
2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from <b>Senator</b> <b>Hatch,</b> Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.|$|E
