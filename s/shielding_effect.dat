5|$|While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the coulomb {{force from}} the ambient {{electric}} field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to {{be attracted to}} the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called vacuum polarization. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron. This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator. Virtual particles cause a comparable <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> for {{the mass of the}} electron.|$|E
5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect,</b> when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
40|$|In 1992, E. E. Podkletnov and R. Nieminen find that, {{under certain}} conditions, ceramic {{superconductor}} with composite structure has revealed weak shielding properties against gravitational force. In classical Newton’s theory {{of gravity and}} even in Einstein’s general theory of gravity, there are no grounds of gravitational <b>shielding</b> <b>effects.</b> But in quantum gauge theory of gravity, the gravitational <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> can be explained in a simple and natural way. In quantum gauge theory of gravity, gravitational gauge interactions of complex scalar field can be formulated based on gauge principle. After spontaneous symmetry breaking, if the vacuum of the complex scalar field is not stable and uniform, {{there will be a}} mass term of gravitational gauge field. When gravitational gauge field propagates in this unstable vacuum of the complex scalar field, it will decays exponentially, which is the nature of gravitational <b>shielding</b> <b>effects.</b> The mechanism of gravitational <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> is studied in this paper, and some main properties of gravitational <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} numerical {{simulations of}} the lifting operation of an {{offshore wind turbine}} monopile foundation, considering both the <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> of the vessel and the spreading of the waves. A numerical model of the coupled monopile-vessel system is established. The disturbed wave field near the vessel is investigated and observed {{to be affected by}} the diffraction and radiation of the vessel. The <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> of the vessel during the lifting operation are accounted for in this study by interpolating the fluid kinematics between predefined wave points near the vessel using MARINTEK SIMO software and an external Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The effects of short-crested waves on the wave field and on the responses of the system are investigated by implementing the directional spreading function in the wave spectrum. On the basis of the time-domain simulations, the critical responses of the lifting system in various conditions are studied. The results indicate that the effects of the wave spreading are considerable in both incident and disturbed waves. The <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> are less significant in short-crested waves than in long-crested waves...|$|R
5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E

The samples were 150 manufacturing companies listed on Indonesian Stock Exchange. The sampling method utilized in this research was purposive sampling.

25|$|The {{electrons}} {{around a}} nucleus will circulate in {{a magnetic field}} and create a secondary induced magnetic field. This field opposes the applied field as stipulated by Lenz's law and atoms with higher induced fields (i.e., higher electron density) are therefore called shielded, relative to those with lower electron density. The chemical milieu of an atom can influence its electron density through the polar effect. Electron-donating alkyl groups, for example, lead to increased shielding while electron-withdrawing substituents such as nitro groups lead to deshielding of the nucleus. Not only substituents cause local induced fields. Bonding electrons {{can also lead to}} shielding and deshielding effects. A striking example of this are the pi bonds in benzene. Circular current through the hyperconjugated system causes a <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> at the molecule's center and a deshielding effect at its edges. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.|$|E
500|$|The {{melting point}} of a {{substance}} is {{the point where it}} changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling {{point of a}} substance (in liquid state) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group. This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons. As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points. (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect.)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Wireless network {{protocols}} {{are commonly}} evaluated through simulations. The achieved results may vary significantly with the modeled propagation environment. Protocols that use carrier sensing for collision avoidance may not operate properly {{in the presence}} of obstacles (e. g. buildings) that shield hosts from each other. These failures may not be recognized when using a long-term stochastic model (e. g. log-normal shadowing), leading to inadequate simulation results. Studying a simple carrier-sensing protocol, we find that when <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> are properly modeled, they increase collisions dramatically with increasing transmission power as opposed to the stochastic model. Thus, we formally introduce a model that describes <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> and which is still simple enough to be efficiently implemented. We discuss how such implementation looks like, using the Mobility Framework and the INET Framework for OMNeT++ as specific examples.

40|$|The huge {{absorption}} cross sections of' 55 Gd and 157 Gd cause strong spatial <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> in Gd-bearing pins. A high-order depletion method has been developed for CASMO- 5 {{to address the issue}} of the small depletion steps typically required for Gd-bearing fuel assemblies. In this method, the microscopic absorption reaction rates of gadolinium isotopes are assumed to be quadratic functions of the number density of' 55 Gd rather than the constant reaction rale assumption in the conventional predictor-corrector (PC) method. This quadratic function assumption models the variations of the spatial <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> over the depletion step and therefore improves the accuracy of depletion calculations with a negligible amount of calculation time increase. With this new method, a depletion step size four times larger than the step size used in a conventional PC method can be used for Gd-bearing assemblies without compromising accuracy. close 0...|$|R
2500|$|Unless {{the local}} {{symmetry}} of such molecular orbitals {{is very high}} (leading to [...] "isotropic" [...] shift), the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> {{will depend on the}} orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field (B0).

2500|$|The {{chemical}} shift provides {{information about the}} structure of the molecule. [...] The conversion of the raw data to this information is called assigning the spectrum. [...] For example, for the 1H-NMR spectrum for ethanol (CH3CH2OH), one would expect signals at each of three specific {{chemical shift}}s: one for the CH3 group, one for the CH2 group and one for the OH group. A typical CH3 group has a shift around 1 ppm, a CH2 attached to an OH has a shift of around 4 ppm and an OH has a shift anywhere from 2–6 ppm depending on the solvent used and the amount of hydrogen bonding. While the O atom does draw electron density away from the attached H through their mutual sigma bond, the electron lone pairs on the O bathe the H in their <b>shielding</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although {{matter is}} {{postulated}} {{to be very}} sparse in the Fatio-Le Sage theory, it cannot be perfectly transparent, because in that case no gravitational force would exist. However, the lack of perfect transparency leads to problems: with sufficient mass the amount of shading produced by two pieces of matter becomes less {{than the sum of}} the shading that each of them would produce separately, due to the overlap of their shadows (P10, above). This hypothetical effect, called gravitational shielding, implies that addition of matter does not result in a direct proportional increase in the gravitational mass. [...] Therefore, in order to be viable, Fatio and Le Sage postulated that the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> is so small as to be undetectable, which requires that the interaction cross-section of matter must be extremely small (P10, below). This places an extremely high lower-bound on the intensity of the flux required to produce the observed force of gravity. Any form of gravitational shielding would represent a violation of the equivalence principle, and would be inconsistent with the extremely precise null result observed in the Eötvös experiment and its successors — all of which have instead confirmed the precise equivalence of active and passive gravitational mass with inertial mass that was predicted by general relativity.

Flat samples of two materials (PMMA and Filofocon A) were ablated at four different air flow conditions. The shape and profile of the ablated surfaces were measured with a precise non-contact optical surface profilometer. Significant asymmetries in the measured profiles were found when the ablation was performed with the clinical air aspiration system, and also without air flow. Increasing air-flow produced deeper ablations, improved symmetry, and increased the repeatability of the ablation pattern. Shielding of the laser pulse by the plume of smoke during the ablation of plastic samples reduced the central ablation depth by more than 40 % with no-air flow, 30 % with clinical air aspiration, and 5 % with 1. 15 m/s air flow.
