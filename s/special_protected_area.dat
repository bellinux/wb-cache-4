30|$|As a {{reaction}} against this seemingly haphazard nature of societal direction, we find a second, more recent approach, that we here call “guided evolution” view to societal change. It is most evident in the transition management approach to innovation [e.g. 21] and present also in other frameworks under transition studies [22]. There, a much more significant role is given to humans as conscious agents shaping and directing technology development towards sustainability transitions. The key idea is that technology development paths and patterns can be affected by creating <b>special,</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> where novelties can develop without being exposed to the harsh forces of the marketplace before being fully matured.|$|R

It lies to the south of Lake Torey and consists of grass steppes and some wetlands. The smaller, southern area consists of the Ulz River basin and associated wetlands. This area is home to the rare white-naped crane (Grus vipio) and other species of crane. The core zone is designated as a <b>Special</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>area</b> and is managed for the conservation of the herds of Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa). The transition areas are used for sustainable tourism, and for grazing livestock, the culling of wildlife as necessary, forest maintenance, and the gathering of medicinal plants for household use by the pastoral population of about 11,800 residents.|$|E
