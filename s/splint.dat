5|$|Some Cryolophosaurus bones have pathologies {{that show}} {{evidence}} of scavenging. Broken teeth {{from at least}} two different theropods have also been found nearby. Another possible pathology {{is found in the}} astragalus (ankle bone) of Cryolophosaurus. This bone was preserved with a small <b>splint</b> from the fibula located just above the ankle. The <b>splint,</b> however, may also be just a unique morphological feature of Cryolophosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (<b>splint),</b> sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (<b>splint)</b> bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult. The health system {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a <b>splint</b> for a broken leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objective: To {{find out}} and compare peri implant strain {{developed}} in four {{different types of}} implant supported prostheses i. e., cement retained <b>splinted,</b> cement retained non <b>splinted,</b> screw retained <b>splinted,</b> screw retained non <b>splinted.</b> Methodology: Four implant analogues were placed in a polyurethane mandibular model at the position of left and right first and second molar. Abutments were fixed to the implant at a torque of 25 Ncm. Two such models were made. Four different prostheses were placed on abutment of each model i. e screw retained <b>splinted,</b> screw retained nonsplinted, cement retained <b>splinted,</b> cement retained non <b>splinted.</b> Four strain gauges were attached on the model, two on the buccal and two on the lingual aspect of each implant. Static load of 400 N was applied on the prosthesis using universal testing machine. Load application was done ten times for each model and peri implant strain was measured. Results: The mean peri implant strain (±SD) generated {{was found to be}} highest in non-splinted screw retained (1397. 70 ± 44. 47 microstrains and 1265. 90 ± 42. 76 microstrains) and least in <b>splinted</b> cement retained (630. 70 ± 31. 98 microstrains and 519. 60 ± 32. 48 microstrains) in both 1 st and 2 nd molars respectively. Conclusions: <b>Splinted</b> crowns produce less peri implant strain when compared to non <b>splinted</b> crowns. Cement retained prosthesis produce less peri implant strain when compared to screw retained prosthesis. Least strain was observed in cement retained <b>splinted</b> crowns...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as <b>splint</b> bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E
5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a <b>splint</b> on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E

25|$|Occlusal splints (also termed dental guards) are {{commonly}} prescribed, mainly by dentists and dental specialists, {{as a treatment}} for bruxism. Proponents of their use claim many benefits, however when the evidence is critically examined in systematic reviews of the topic, it is reported that there is insufficient evidence to show that occlusal splints are effective for sleep bruxism. Furthermore, occlusal splints are probably ineffective for awake bruxism, since they tend to be worn only during sleep. However, occlusal splints may be of some benefit in reducing the tooth wear that may accompany bruxism, but by mechanically protecting the teeth rather than reducing the bruxing activity itself. In a minority of cases, sleep bruxism may be made worse by an occlusal <b>splint.</b> Some patients will periodically return with splints with holes worn through them, either because the bruxism is aggravated, or unaffected by the presence of the <b>splint.</b> When tooth-to-tooth contact is possible through the holes in a <b>splint,</b> it is offering no protection against tooth wear and needs to be replaced.|$|E

25|$|Occlusal splints {{are divided}} into partial or full-coverage splints {{according}} to whether they fit over {{some or all of}} the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower splints are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. Another problem with wearing a <b>splint</b> can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the <b>splint</b> about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. As an added measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the <b>splint</b> so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal level of sensitivity from the teeth, although it should be remembered that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{therapeutic}} aims {{of static}} <b>splinting</b> in rheumatoid arthritis(RA) include; supporting inflammed joints; decreasing localised pain and joint swelling; improving wrist stability; maintaining hand function and dexterity and preventing/correcting joint deformity. However, the theoretical biological basis for intermittant <b>splinting</b> is weak and {{evidence to support}} the effectiveness of conservative <b>splinting</b> in RA remains anecdotal (Akil and Amos 1995, Scott et al 1998). Synovitis, capsular weakening and instability are the primary causes of rheumatoid hand deformity and dysfunction. Later biomechanical disruption of the wrist and hand can lead to structural deformity in up to 85 % of individuals with RA. Structural impairment can effect functional upper limb and hand perfomance in the later stages of the disease. This paper dicusses the effectiveness of different types of <b>splints,</b> commonly used in rheumatology practice, in preserving anatomical and functional ability. Methods: EMBASE,PUBMED, CINAHL and MEDLINE were used to search the <b>splinting</b> literature over the past 40 years. Evidence was sought for a variety of static <b>splints</b> meeting the stated therapeutic aims of <b>splinting.</b> Results: all studies reported hand functional ability in isolation without any reference to overall disease activity. A minority were conducted as unblinded RCTs, most were cross over or observational pre and post test designs. None had power calculations or estimated effect sizes included. Certain forms of static <b>splinting,</b> applied at varying stages of RA, have been demonstrated to: 1. Provide localised pain relief 2. Improve wrist stability when worn 3. Increase functional dexterity and grip force when worn 4. Re align deviated and lax joints when worn As yet there is no robust evidence that static <b>splinting</b> will prevent or delay deformity from occurring or maintain hand function in the long term. Evidence is also lacking as to the possible detrimental effects that <b>splints</b> may have. Conclusions: static <b>splints</b> are designed to maintain structural and functional ability in the rheumatoid wrist and hand. In some patients these may work. Further well designed, well powered clinical effectiveness and efficacy trials are required to establish which <b>splinting</b> protocols work, for whom and why...|$|R
