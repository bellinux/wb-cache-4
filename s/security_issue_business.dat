40|$|Many {{firms are}} now {{evaluating}} {{the possibility to}} outsource their IT functions in order to focus their efforts and capitals on core-competencies thus reducing costs and improving quality of their IT services. While the client‘s sourcing decisions and the client-service provider relationship have been investigated in literature, the service provider's perspective has rarely been studied. Since the outsourcing organization loses the direct control of information system, maintenance of adequate level of security is a fundamental problem in outsourcing. This study focus on various aspects of information security in IT outsourcing {{that must be addressed}} by Iranian service providers, but attention will be focused on importance of physical security, personnel related <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> and <b>business</b> continuity planning. There are several objectives for this study. This study firstly attempts to explore the IT outsourcing activities of Iranian service providers. Secondly, is to investigate the service provides‘ practices in terms of physical security, personnel related <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> and <b>business</b> continuity planning. This study further examines physical <b>security,</b> personnel related <b>issues,</b> <b>business</b> continuity planning and the relevancy of those factors with best practices of information security implementation. IT managers and IT executives of service provider companies are the targeted respondents. There are three phases {{in the design of the}} study. The initial phase is preliminary study where interviews are conducted. This is done to probe IT outsourcing practices in Iran from perspective of service provider. In the second phase, which is the main phase, questionnaires are distributed. Subsequently, interviews are conducted which involves purposeful sampling method. This is embarked in order to derive a more comprehensive conclusion...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{globalization}} of supply chain, logistics has become {{an important part in}} the supply chain. Many logistics service providers have acknowledged that if they want to operate more efficiently and responsively, they must adopt technologies that can help manufacturers, warehouses, and retailers {{to communicate with each other}} more effieiently. Among many logistics technologies, Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been identified as an important application in logistics operations and supply chain management, and thus is increasingly gaining both practitioners’ and researchers’ attention. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors affecting logistics service providers’ intention to use RFID technology from the perspectives of contexts in Davis (1989) ’s Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Rogers (1995) ’s Innovation Diffusion Theory, and DePietro, Wiarda, & Fleischer (1990) ’s Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework. This study first analyzes relevant researches on the intention to use such systems as the basis for the questionnaire design, then conducts questionnaire survey among the UK logistics companies. After the questionnaires are collected, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), a computer program for statistical analysis, is used to analyze the data. The analysis shows that four factors (i. e. perceived usefulness, perceived privacy issue regarding company’s willingness to share data, perceived privacy issue regarding company’s perceived importance to control access to their data, and observability of green characteristics) positively influence companies’ intention to use RFID. Other factors (i. e. perceived <b>security</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>business</b> pressure, government support, green characteristics, organization support, relative advantages, compatibility and observability of benefits) were found to be insignificant determinants of RFID adoption and thus they have no effect on the intention to use RFID...|$|R

Aided with their broad line of services, an IT system aims to support or even drive organizations towards desired paths. Trends of IT and information security awareness (ISA) in society today, particularly within the business environment is quite interesting phenomenon. The overviews of the role of IT in the modern world as well as the perception towards ISA are initially introduced. A series of scope are outlined, and also further examination on matter of IT and ISA in the business environment-emphasis on revolution of business with ISA, security threats such as identity thefts, hacking and web harassment, and the different mode of protections that are applied in different business environments.

Unfortunately, many laws and regulations are hard to formulate. As a result, several compliance concerns are realized on a per-case basis, leading to ad hoc, handcrafted solutions for each specific law, regulation, and standard that a system must comply with. This, in turn, leads {{in the long run}} to problems regarding complexity, understandability, and maintainability of compliance concerns in a SOA. In this book chapter, we present a case study in the field of compliance to regulatory provisions, in which we applied our view-based, model-driven approach for ensuring the compliance with ICT <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> in <b>business</b> processes of a large European company.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of an organization's security {{problem can be}} reduced by modelling <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> of <b>business</b> information systems. This facilitates analyzing and detecting security requirements and optimal operational alternatives (i. e. suitable security measures). DROPS (dimension-relational organization and problem oriented security model) is {{a model for the}} security of information systems enabling these issues. The approach DROPS is based on is holistic, integrative and scaleable. For example, security considerations concerning information systems are often limited to a technical perspective (IT-security). DROPS allows modelling a mere technical view as well as the integration of non-technical system components (e. g. personnell). Furthermore, non-technical security measures (e. g. organizational issues) can be included into the model. The composition of DROPS offers an organization the opportunity to integrate individual elements of a security problem and their relations. Essential characteristics of specific business processes can be considered this way. In practical application, first of all the choice of suitable security measures is facilitated. Second, DROPS can be used to model actual and/or aspired security requirements and the security system of an organization.

We refer to an execution of a Web service based automatic business process as a business session (multi-party session). A business session consists of multiple Web service instances which are called session partners. Here, we refer to a Web service instance as being a stateful execution of the Web service. In [8], we investigate the <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> related to <b>business</b> sessions, and demonstrate that security mechanisms are needed at the instance level to help session partners generate a reasonable trust relationship. To achieve this objective, an instance-level authentication mechanism is proposed. Experimental systems are integrated with both the GT 4 and CROWN Grid infrastructures, and comprehensive experimentation is conducted to evaluate our authentication mechanism. Additionally, we design a policy-based authorization mechanism based on our instance-level authentication mechanism to further support trustworthy and flexible collaboration among session partners involved in the same business session. This mechanism allows an instance invoker to dynamically assign fine-grained access control policies for the new invoked instance so as to grant other session partners the necessary permissions...|$|R

The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzan’s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs the water issue as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for civilisations.
