A full 3 D simulation has been developed to simulate heat flow from a laser <b>heated</b> <b>spot</b> in the proximity of a crack. The modelling provided an understanding of the ways that different parameters affect the thermal images of laser <b>heated</b> <b>spots.</b> It also assisted in the development of an efficient image processing strategy for extracting the scanned cracks.

At the end of tunnel-type geometries divergent heat flow occurs, which causes that area of the casting to cool faster than surrounding areas; {{this is called a}}n end effect. Large cavities do not cool as quickly as surrounding areas because there is less heat flow; this is called a riser effect. Also note that corners can create divergent or convergent (also known as hot <b>spots)</b> <b>heat</b> flow areas.|$|R

50|$|From {{the early}} 1970s onwards sales of cabinet heaters, {{and with them}} sales of butane in cylinders, {{escalated}} enormously, beginning with Super Ser which rapidly replaced the paraffin heater as the nation's number one choice for <b>spot</b> <b>heating.</b> In a decade, the market for cabinet heaters and the gas they burned grew from nothing to £100 million p.a. This led to increasing demand for storage space, which led to Calor investing in the two largest storage facilities. The first was purchased in 1976: a 30,000 tonne refrigerated storage tank at Felixstowe in Suffolk. The second was {{a joint venture with}} Conoco to excavate a vast underground cavern on South Humberside, capable of containing some 100,000 tonnes of gas supplied from an adjacent sea terminal. This facility, opened in 1985, gave Calor the ability to overcome short term supply difficulties and to cope with major changes in demand brought on by extremes of weather.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} ability of stellar X-rays to desorb {{molecules}} from grains in outer protoplanetary disks. In particular, we consider the possibility of <b>spot</b> <b>heating</b> by X-rays and examine its effectiveness, compared to whole grain heating by X-rays, in sustaining a gas phase abundance of CO. As found in previous studies, whole grain heating is effective only for small grains (< 500 ˚A). As a result, large grains are a permanent sink of CO and whole grain heating cannot sustain an equilibrium gas phase abundance of CO. <b>Spot</b> <b>heating,</b> in which the incident X-ray deposits energy in only a restricted region of the grain volume and which may occur {{as a consequence of}} the aggregate nature of grains, proves to be more promising. Assuming that grains are comprised of many thermal subunits that are poorly connected thermally, we find that <b>spot</b> <b>heating</b> is efficient at all grain sizes if large grains are effectively “coated ” with small grains � 100 ˚A in size. We discuss the implications of X-ray <b>spot</b> <b>heating</b> for the interpretation of millimeter emission line studies of outer protoplanetary disks...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of slider posture on the slider bearing in a heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording (HAMR) system with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In this HAMR system, the heat issues on the slider bearings {{are assumed to be}} caused by a <b>heated</b> <b>spot</b> on the disk and/or slider body itself at various pitch angles. The simulation results show that with a <b>heated</b> <b>spot</b> on the disk, the air bearing pressure and air bearing force that acted on the slider surface will increase when the pitch angle becomes larger. It is also found that the bearing force increases with the <b>heated</b> <b>spot</b> size and {{the effects of}} a <b>heated</b> <b>spot</b> become more obvious at a larger pitch angle. On the other hand, the slider body temperature is observed to have a noticeable effect on air bearing pressure and force. The smaller pitch angle enlarges the tendency of bearing force variations with the slider temperature and makes the slider more sensitive to its temperature changes...|$|R

40|$|Enhancing the {{critical}} heat flux (CHF) of industrial boilers by surface texturing can lead to substantial energy savings and global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but fundamentally this phenomenon is not well understood. Prior studies on boiling crisis indicate that CHF monotonically increases with increasing texture density. Here {{we report on the}} existence of maxima in CHF enhancement at intermediate texture density using measurements on parametrically designed plain and nano-textured micropillar surfaces. Using high-speed optical and infrared imaging, we study the dynamics of dry <b>spot</b> <b>heating</b> and rewetting phenomena and reveal that the dry <b>spot</b> <b>heating</b> timescale is of the same order as that of the gravity and liquid imbibition-induced dry spot rewetting timescale. Based on these insights, we develop a coupled thermal-hydraulic model that relates CHF enhancement to rewetting of a hot dry spot on the boiling surface, thereby revealing the mechanism governing the hitherto unknown CHF enhancement maxima.

A distinctive hot <b>spot</b> with highest <b>heat</b> flux was obtained near {{the foot of the}} protuberance due to heavy vortex activity in the recirculating region.

40|$|As an {{extension}} of the work of Kuo et al[1], we have developed a “Flying-Spot” lasersource/IR-detector camera in which the focal point of an unmodulated heating laser is moved at constant velocity across the sample while the image point of an IR detector is scanned at the same speed at a point just behind the laser beam. The detector is thus looking at the “thermal wake” of the <b>heated</b> <b>spot.</b> The time delay between heating and detection is determined by the speed of the laser spot and the distance between it and the detector image. Since this distance can be made arbitrarily small (Actually it can be made negative; the detector can lead the <b>heated</b> <b>spot.),</b> the camera is capable of making thermal wave images of phenomena which occur on a very short time scale. In addition, because the heat source is a very small <b>spot,</b> the <b>heat</b> flow is fully three-dimensional.
