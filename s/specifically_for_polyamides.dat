40|$|Poly(amide urethane) s were {{prepared}} from ε-caprolactam, amino alcohols, and diphenyl carbonate or ethylene carbonate in three steps. Polycondensation was performed either with α-hydroxy-ω-O-phenyl urethanes or with α-hydroxy-ω-O-hydroxyethyl urethanes; {{it was found}} that the reactivity at 90 °C of the first is much higher than that of the latter. For nearly equal reactivity, the temperature for the polycondensation of α-hydroxy-ω-O-hydroxyethyl urethanes had to be increased from 90 °C to 150 °C. The microstructure of the resulting poly(amide urethane) s differs by the content of urea groups in the polymer chains, which is 5 % <b>for</b> <b>poly(amide</b> urethane) s prepared from α-hydroxy-ω-O-phenyl urethanes and 15 % <b>for</b> <b>poly(amide</b> urethane) s prepared from α-hydroxy-ω-O-hydroxyethyl urethanes.

Melt viscosity and intrinsic viscosity {{are in good}} correlation in a log-log plot. Oxidation effect on molecular weight and amine chain end concentration could be well related to UV absorbance. The oxygen diffusion into the molten polyamide is a critical parameter. The oxygen concentration in the polyamide mixed under air is ca. 20 times higher than when mixed under nitrogen.

These (co) poly(2 -oxazoline) s can be crosslinked with di- and trifunctional mercapto compounds using the UV-induced thiol-ene reaction. The complex permittivity of the corresponding networks increases with the temperature and decreases with the network density. In a frequency range from 10 ? 2 to 106 Hz and at temperatures ranging from ? 20 to 40 °C, the changes of the real part of the complex permittivity as well as the loss factor can be explained by interfacial polarization within the material. At a temperature of 20 °C and a frequency of 50 Hz, the permittivity of the crosslinked (co) poly(2 -oxazoline) s covers a range from 4. 29 to 4. 97, and the loss factors are in the range from 0. 030 to 0. 093. The electrical conductivities of these polymer networks span a range from 5 × 10 ? 12 to 8 × 10 ? 9 S/m, classifying these materials as medium insulators. Notably, the values for the permittivity, loss factor and conductivity of these copoly(2 -oxazoline) s are in the same range as <b>for</b> <b>polyamides,</b> and, hence, these copoly(2 -oxazoline) -based networks may be referred to as “green” alternatives <b>for</b> <b>polyamides</b> as insulators in electronic applications.

This report analyzes the theoretical limits of DNA sequence discrimination by linked polyamides composed of two to four different types of heterocyclic rings, determining (i) the optimal choice of base-binding specificity for each ring and (ii) the optimal design <b>for</b> a <b>polyamide</b> composed of these rings to target a given DNA sequence and designed to maximize the {{fraction of the total}} polyamide binding to the specified target sequence relative to all other sequences. The results show that, fortuitously, polyamides composed of pyrrole, a naturally occurring G-excluding element, and imidazole, a rationally designed G-favoring element, have features similar to the theoretical optimum design <b>for</b> <b>polyamides</b> composed of two different rings. The results also show that, in polyamides composed of two or three types of heterocyclic rings, choosing a nonspecific “placeholder” ring, which binds equally strongly to each of the four bases, along with one or two base-specific rings will often enhance sequence specificity over a polyamide composed entirely of base-specific rings...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} UV-degradation mechanisms for polymers are photolysis and photo-oxidation. For polyolefins {{it is well}} known that photo-oxidation is the dominating mechanism. These polymers do not have an inherent absorption at wavelengths present in terrestrial sunlight (2 ̆ 6 gt; 290 nm) so photolysis cannot play an important role. In contrast to polyolefins, the majority of engineering plastics do have absorptions at these wavelengths. As a result, for these polymers, besides photo-oxidation, photolysis can play an important role. <b>For</b> <b>polyamide</b> 6, poly(butylene terephthalate), two different copolyetheresters and bisphenol-A polycarbonate, the importance of photolysis as well as that of photo-oxidation in polymer light-induced degradation is discussed...|$|R

In general, fluorescein conjugation is most tolerated at the C-terminal tail, resulting in a 5 - to 25 -fold decrease in affinity while retaining specificity. The effects of attachment off of the chiral turn residue and the N-terminal imidazole 4 -amino group were also probed.

In the present study, we scanned the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter <b>for</b> <b>polyamide</b> inhibition of TBP binding and transcription using a series of DNA constructs in which a polyamide binding site was placed at various distances from the TATA box. Polyamide interference with either TBP-DNA or TFIID-TFIIA-DNA contacts both upstream and downstream of the TATA element resulted in inhibition of transcription.
