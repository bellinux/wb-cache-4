The spider lies head down, and often <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> 20 to 30millimetres during moulting. Portias spin a similar temporary web for resting.|$|E
5|$|Tallstar's Revenge was {{released}} on 2 July 2013. It {{tells the story of}} Tallstar, whose father dies when he is an apprentice during a tunnel collapse. As a result, he attempts to avenge his father Sandgorse's death by killing the cat (a rogue named Sparrow) whom he believes did not help his father escape the tunnel and is therefore responsible. Tallstar leaves his Clan to track down Sparrow and briefly travels with a house cat named Jake, who is later revealed to be the father of Firestar (the main protagonist of the original six books). When he meets up with Sparrow, Tallstar discovers that his father actually sacrificed himself to allow the other cat to escape and does not carry through with his intended vengeance, instead saving Sparrow's life when Sparrow <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> a cliff and near a road.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E

A local {{attraction}} {{similar to}} a Slip and Slide, but using a mixture of oil and water, Slick Sheets is managed by one [...] "Slick" [...] Sheets and located on a hill just off the square. Kids can <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> {{the front of the}} hill, while moms <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> the back in a somewhat slower and more sexy fashion.

25|$|The yearly 'total return' {{from the}} bond is a) {{the sum of}} the coupon's yield plus b) the capital gain from the {{changing}} valuation as it <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the yield curve and c) any capital gain or loss from changing interest rates at that point in the yield curve.|$|E
25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially sitting up in bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward {{the foot of the}} bed. This may also be possible on a patient who <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|To {{convince}} Hitchcock {{that the}} scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting {{of the final}} shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh’s stand-in Marli Renfro to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor George Tomasini, he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray {{of blood on the}} chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.|$|E

25|$|The Cascades {{paint scheme}} was created {{specifically}} for Amtrak's Cascades trains, operated in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. On the locomotives, the Cascades scheme {{is very similar}} to the Pacific Surfliner paint scheme, though the colors themselves are different on the Cascades. Instead of the large blue streaks {{on the side of the}} engine, it is colored green. The black mask across the cab windows is colored brown. On the Cascades Talgo equipment, the green streak <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the baggage car & power car, and then runs down the bottom of the rest of the cars. This inverts the colors from the order on the locomotive making the middle part of the cars brown.|$|E
25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> and settles. The corium temperature is now just slightly different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, seeping into pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E
25|$|Traditional orb webs are not {{effective}} for capturing moths, because only their scales will stick, allowing the moth to escape. The ladder webs of Scoloderus species {{appear to be}} adaptations in web design to increase moth capture. These webs extend vertically about seven times their width. When a moth <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the web, it leaves a trail of scales until its body sticks to the web. However, these spiders {{do not seem to}} be closely related to bolas spiders. The nearest relatives seems to be the Cyrtarachneae (e.g. Pasilobus) of the Paleotropics. They also specialize on moths, and use threads that are beaded with sticky droplets. Celaenia and Taczanowskia species in South America seem to use chemical attractants to catch moths, too, and may also be closely related to bolas spiders.|$|E

25|$|Planer {{boards are}} trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate fishing line in a spring tension release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a spring tension clip that releases upon setting or tripping the planer board so it <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the fishing line to a swivel tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|E
500|$|The French naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre {{wrote that}} [...] "The Ant-lion makes a {{slanting}} funnel in the sand. Its victim, the Ant, <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the slant and is then stoned, {{from the bottom}} of the funnel, by the hunter, who turns his neck into a catapult." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{event to}} take place was the downhill, on 9 February. This {{consisted}} of a single run each; Guèye finished in last position {{with a time of}} 2:12.84, over 22 seconds behind Patrick Ortlieb of Austria who took the gold medal. Gomis was one of nine skiers who failed to complete their run, the first of several incomplete runs by the ski instructor {{during the course of the}} Games. This would later be referred to by The Washington Post as a [...] "world-class agony-of-defeat spill". His performances were referenced by The Record as [...] "Gomis was the one you may have seen on the highlights, doing unplanned cartwheels, nosedives, and <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the hill".|$|E
500|$|Like all arthropods, spiders moult and, after hatching, {{the life}} stage before each moult is called an [...] "instar". Specimens of P. fimbriata become mature at instar 7, 8 or 9. In an {{experiment}} using P. fimbriata spiderlings from Queensland, 64% of those fed only on spiders survived to maturity, 37% of those fed on {{a mixture of}} spiders and insects survived, and all those fed solely on insects died before reaching the 6th instar. For moulting, all Portia species spin a horizontal web whose diameter is about twice the spider's body length and is suspended only 1 to 4millimetres below a leaf. The spider lies head down, and often <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> 20 to 30millimetres during moulting. Portia species spin a similar temporary web for resting. P. fimbriata in Queensland can be very sedentary, in some cases remaining in the same web for over 48days during a series of moults.|$|E
500|$|One study {{reported}} a specimen found in Mexico with {{a length of}} [...] Typically, the spore case is [...] broad by [...] tall. The hollow stalk is pale brown to brown, woody, and has a fibrous, scaly, or even woolly surface. The mature gleba, which is eventually exposed when the peridial cap is shed, has a rust-brown color. The cap may persist after the spore mass is dispersed and form a disc-like unit that <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the stalk like a ring. The fragile sac-shaped volva is up to [...] broad, unattached to the stalk, and formed by two distinct, separated tissue layers. The inner layer resembles the scales of the stem, consisting of hyphae that are 3–18µm in diameter, closely arranged (nearly parallel), septate, sparsely branched, yellowish ochre, with clamps at some septa. The outer layer of fungal tissue is thicker, membranous, sometimes with a corky texture when dry, and dirty white. It consists of pale yellow intertwined hyphae {{that are difficult to}} distinguish individually, and without remains of a gelatinous matrix. Fruit bodies may persist for several months after they have dried.|$|E

500|$|Swift's vocals {{have been}} {{described}} by Sophie Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter as [...] "sweet, but soft". In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identified Swift's [...] "defining" [...] vocal gesture as [...] "the line that <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy". Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: [...] "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough." [...] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously [...] "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's {{learned how to make}} words sound like what they mean." [...] The Hollywood Reporter opines that her live vocals are [...] "fine", but they do not match those of her peers. In 2009, they were also described as [...] "flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt". However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.|$|E
500|$|On October 11, 2011, several {{publications}} {{announced that}} Gaga was seen {{during the filming}} of the video in Snug Harbor Cultural Center. She was wearing a custom-made double zip lambskin jumpsuit by New York City designer, Asher Levine which was said {{to go along with}} the video's [...] "grungy" [...] and [...] "bloody" [...] theme and with the [...] "nod to New York downtown refinement." [...] Dancers and extras were spotted dressed in multiple looks: some as ballerinas and others in leopard print while Gaga's mother was also seen on stage. Later, other photos of the filming were published on several websites and they showed Gaga with blue lipstick and a leather romper with several male dancers, in a long-sleeve red dress with padded shoulders, a big satellite dish and a big black hat. Footage of the video was posted online on October 14, 2011. Gaga is seen dancing on the roof of a car as she sings the bridge from the song. She then <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> the car and begins running around the hood as the chorus starts. She's dressed in black, with a blond bob wig and black heels while rain is visible in the background, but she appears unfazed by the weather. During an interview with NDTV on October 31, Gaga revealed that she directed the video. She also worked with the director of photography Darius Khondji and art director Gideon Ponte.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{has said}} he {{believes}} the underlying emotion of Hannibal is [...] "affection". [...] "In some instances, you might even wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time." [...] Scott openly admits to a [...] "romantic thematic" [...] running though the film. He told CNN that: [...] "Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well." [...] During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, [...] "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" [...] Lecter replies: [...] "Yes, I believe he could... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?" [...] This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people [...] "missed" [...] the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, [...] "toys" [...] with the idea of [...] "love that dare not speak its name". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be [...] "many" [...] messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, [...] "I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..." [...] Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear <b>slides</b> <b>down</b> Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of [...] "anguish", [...] "loneliness" [...] or [...] "disgust". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is [...] "metaphorical". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, [...] "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'." ...|$|E
