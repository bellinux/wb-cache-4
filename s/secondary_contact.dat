5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} {{has nine}} subspecies, although {{the differences are}} small and change gradually across the range. The subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in morphology, habitat usage, and vocalizations. These groups cover eastern North America, the Great Basin and central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions. The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern S. c. carolinensis has the palest back. The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. The calls {{of the three groups}} differ, as described above.

According to the marine sciences section of the DEP, the channel is swift, with water moving as fast as four knots, just as it does in the Hudson River on the other side of Manhattan. That speed can push casual swimmers out to sea. A few people drown in the waters around New York City each year.|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{and genetic}} {{data suggest that}} the red {{imported}} fire ant and the black imported fire ant (Solenopsis richteri) differ from each other, but they do share a close genetic relationship. Hybridisation between the two ants occurs in areas where they make contact, with the hybrid zone located in Mississippi. Such hybridisation has resulted from <b>secondary</b> <b>contact</b> between these two ants several decades ago, when they first encountered each other in southern Alabama. Based on mitochondrial DNA, examined haplotypes do not form a monophyletic clade. Some of the examined haplotypes form a closer relationship to S. megergates, S. quinquecuspis and S. richteri than they do with other S. invicta haplotypes. The occurrence of a possible paraphyletic grouping suggests that the red imported fire ant and S. quinquecuspis are possible cryptic species groups composed of several species that cannot be distinguished morphologically.|$|E
500|$|The {{quality of}} the {{effluent}} discharged into the Don was soon giving rise to concern, as the treatment process was unsatisfactory. An act of Parliament was obtained in 1900, which allowed Sheffield Corporation to buy an additional , on which contact beds would be built, so that the effluent could be better treated before discharge. The initial plan was costed at £367,355, which was reduced to £270,369 when <b>secondary</b> <b>contact</b> beds {{were removed from the}} scheme. The Local Government Board approved the plans on 13 May 1905, paving the way {{for the construction of a}} biological treatment system, instead of the system using lime. Logan and Hemmingway, who were contractors based at Nottingham, won the initial contract for excavations, and also the subsequent one for the construction of six settling tanks, 24 contact tanks, and Jordan bridge, which would carry the internal railway line over the River Don Navigation. The contract was worth £41,046, and further contracts followed, which included £36,500 for 36 more contact beds and three settling tanks, £5,000 for excavating [...] of earth, and £36,484 for storm beds and other work, which was subsequently raised to £39,184, so that they could pay their workers at the same rate as Sheffield Corporation paid their own workmen.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, {{the first}} whole genome {{sequencing}} data from two European bison bulls from the Bialowieza Forest {{revealed that the}} bison and bovine species diverged from about 1.7 to 0.85 Mya through a speciation process involving limited gene flow.These data further support the occurrence of more recent <b>secondary</b> <b>contacts,</b> posterior to the divergence between Bos primigenius primigenius and Bos p. namadicus (ca. 150,000 years ago), between the wisent and (European) taurine cattle lineages. An independent study of mitochondrial DNA and autosomal markers confirmed these <b>secondary</b> <b>contacts</b> (with an estimate of up to 10% of bovine ancestry in the modern wisent genome) leading the authors to go further in their conclusions by proposing the wisent to be a hybrid between steppe bison and aurochs with an hybridization event originating before 120,000 years ago.This {{is also consistent with}} the apparent Bos origin of the mitochondrial DNA.|$|R
50|$|A super-spreader is a host—an {{organism}} {{infected with}} a disease—that infects, disproportionally, more <b>secondary</b> <b>contacts</b> than other hosts who are, also, {{infected with the}} same disease. A sick human can be a super-spreader; {{they would be more}} likely to infect others than most people with the disease. Super-spreaders are thus of high concern in epidemiology (the study of the spread of diseases).|$|R
40|$|SummaryEarly {{studies that}} {{explored}} host–pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others. Subsequently, in {{what became known}} as the 20 / 80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more <b>secondary</b> <b>contacts,</b> as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, <b>secondary</b> <b>contacts.</b> The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans...|$|R
500|$|In {{regulations}} {{adopted in}} 1985 and amended in 2008, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) divides the river into four water-quality regions {{similar to those}} in the 1983 USGS study.

It is considered Saline Class B surface water, to be kept suitable for primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>contact</b> recreation such as swimming, boating and fishing, and capable of supporting [...] "fish, shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival." [...] The next section extends to the tailwater at the Yonkers sewage plant impoundment, and is Class C fresh water, with the same purposes, to the extent that [...] "other factors" [...] do not limit them. From there to the Woodlands Lake inlet is the third section, designated as Class A fresh water, to be kept clean enough for drinking. The remainder to the source is the fourth section, designated Class B, or fresh water kept to the same standards as the salt water above the river's mouth. Tributaries, named and unnamed, and subtributaries are generally held to the same standards as the section into which they drain.|$|E
500|$|The {{hooded crow}} (Corvus cornix) [...] and carrion crow (Corvus corone) are two {{closely related species}} whose {{geographical}} distribution across Europe is illustrated in the accompanying diagram. It is believed that this distribution might have resulted from the glaciation cycles during the Pleistocene, which caused the parent population to split into isolates which subsequently re-expanded their ranges when the climate warmed causing <b>secondary</b> <b>contact.</b> Poelstra and coworkers sequenced almost the entire genomes of both species in populations at varying distances from the contact zone {{to find that the}} two species were genetically identical, both in their DNA and in its expression (in the form of mRNA), except for the lack of expression of a small portion (<0.28%) of the genome (situated on avian chromosome 18) in the hooded crow, which imparts the lighter plumage colouration on its torso. Thus the two species can viably hybridize, and occasionally do so at the contact zone, but the all-black carrion crows on the one side of the contact zone mate almost exclusively with other all-black carrion crows, while the same occurs among the hooded crows {{on the other side of}} the contact zone. It is therefore clear that it is only the outward appearance of the two species that inhibits hybridization. The authors attribute this to assortative mating (rather than to ecological selection), the advantage of which is not clear, and it would lead to the rapid appearance of streams of new lineages, and possibly even species, through mutual attraction between mutants. Unnikrishnan and Akhila propose, instead, that koinophilia is a more parsimonious explanation for the resistance to hybridization across the contact zone, despite the absence of physiological, anatomical or genetic barriers to such hybridization.|$|E

50|$|Another {{argument}} in favor of a northern origin for the Albanian language is the relatively small number of words of Greek origin, mostly from Doric dialect, even though Southern Illyria neighbored the Classical Greek civilization and there was a number of Greek colonies along the Illyrian coastline. However, in view of the amount of Albanian-Greek isoglosses, which the scholar Vladimir Orel considers surprisingly high (in comparison with the Indo-Albanian and Armeno-Albanian ones), the author concludes that this particular proximity could be the result of intense <b>secondary</b> <b>contacts</b> of two proto-dialects.|$|R

50|$|In biology, {{two species}} or populations are {{considered}} sympatric when they {{exist in the}} same geographic area and thus frequently encounter one another. An initially interbreeding population that splits into two or more distinct species sharing a common range exemplifies sympatric speciation. Such speciation may be a product of reproductive isolation - which prevents hybrid offspring from being viable or able to reproduce, thereby reducing gene flow - that results in genetic divergence. Sympatric speciation does not imply <b>secondary</b> <b>contact,</b> which is speciation or divergence in allopatry followed by range expansions leading to an area of sympatry.

50|$|Hybrid zones can {{be either}} primary or secondary. Primary hybrid zones occur where {{divergence}} is taking place between adjacent populations of a previously homogeneous species, possibly leading to parapatric speciation. As a population spreads across a contiguous area it may spread into an abruptly different environment. Through adaptation to the new environment, the adjacent populations begin parapatric divergence. The point of contact between the older population and the newer population will ideally be a stepped cline, but due to dispersal across the line, hybridization will take place and a hybrid zone will arise. Secondary hybrid zones in turn arise from <b>secondary</b> <b>contact</b> between two populations that were previously allopatric.In practice it can be quite difficult to distinguish between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>contact</b> by observing an existing hybrid zone.

40|$|Abstract—We propose {{unilateral}} fixtures, a {{new class}} of fixtures for sheet metal parts with holes, where holding elements lie almost completely {{on one side of the}} part, maximizing access for welding, assembly, or inspection. Each primary jaw is cylindrical with a conical groove that provides the equivalent of four point contacts and facilitates part alignment. We present a two-phase algorithm for computing unilateral fixtures. Phase I is a geometric algorithm that assumes the part is rigid and applies 2 D and 3 D kinematic analysis of form-closure to identify all candidate locations for pairs of primary jaws. We prove three new grasp properties for 2 D and 3 D grips at concave vertices and define a scale-invariant quality metric based on the sensitivity of part orientation to infinitesimal relaxation of jaw position. Phase II uses a Finite Element Method (FEM) to compute part deformation and to arrange <b>secondary</b> <b>contacts</b> at part edges and interior surfaces. For a given sheet-metal part, given as a 2 D surface embedded in 3 D with e edges, n concavities and m mesh nodes, Phase I takes O (e + n 4 / 3 log 1 / 3 n + g log g) time to compute a list of g pairs of primary jaws ranked by quality.

5000|$|Several {{distinct}} {{types of}} killer whale (Orcinus orca), which {{are characterized by}} an array of morphological and behavioral differences, live in sympatry throughout the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Antarctic oceans. In the North Pacific, three whale populations - called [...] "transient", [...] "resident", and [...] "offshore" [...] - demonstrate partial sympatry, crossing paths with relative frequency. The results of recent genetic analyses using mtDNA indicate that {{this is due to}} <b>secondary</b> <b>contact,</b> in which the three types encountered one another following the bidirectional migration of [...] "offshore" [...] and [...] "resident" [...] whales between the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Partial sympatry in these whales is, therefore, not the result of speciation.
