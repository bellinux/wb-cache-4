5000|$|Predating the Independence of Namibia in 1990, the International Commission for South East Atlantic Fisheries (ICSEAF) was {{responsible}} for the management of the fisheries in the region both in the exclusive economic zones of Angola, Namibia and South Africa and in the adjacent water of the high seas. ICSEAF Convention came into force in 1971, with the [...] located in Madrid, Spain and was established mainly in response to increased levels of exploitation of newly discovered rich fishing grounds off the Namibian coast by the fleet of Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs). ICSEAF failed its mandate largely because Contracting Parties did not comply with the conservation and management measures they adopted and that the Commission lacked effective compliance and enforcement mechanisms. Fishing efforts increased rapidly during the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s on targeted species such as hake, horse mackerel and pilchards off Namibia and horse mackerels (Trachurus capensis and T. trecae) and <b>sardinellas</b> (Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis) in southern Angolan waters. For example, in 1965 about 193,000 tonnes of hake were caught mainly off Namibia and by 1972, a peak of 820,000 tonnes was recorded, followed by a declining trend to about 338,000 tonnes landed by 1988. At Independence in 1990, the new government of Namibia proclaimed through the Act of Parliament a 200 nmi km EEZ and the jurisdiction over the fisheries within the zone. The organisation became inoperative following Namibia's refusal to join it. Meanwhile, the high seas fisheries of the southeast Atlantic were left without a managing body. With new mandate and direction, SEAFO replaced ICSEAF.|$|E
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), <b>sardinellas</b> (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E

40|$|Several {{populations of}} <b>Sardinellas</b> (Sardinelia aurita and S. maderensis) {{probably}} exist along the West African Coast. At present they are discriminated mainly by their spawning grounds and nursery areas. Previous observations based on reproductive and growth characteristics {{have tended to}} show that there are five populations and perhaps some sub-populations. Although genetic analysis of individual samples from each population could provide an absolute reference for discriminating these populations, some of the new methods for analysing calcified structures (e. g. otoliths) could also give comparable or complementary results. Two types of methods are used in stock discrimination: (1) numerical analysis of scale or otolith morphometry, or (2) microchemical analysis of trace elements in otoliths. Microchemistry of otoliths is particularly promising because their elemental composition seems to be closely related to the fish environment.

30|$|The main {{marine species}} in {{worldwide}} capture over years were {{the families of}} Gardidae (Alaska Pollock, Atlantic Cod, Blue Whiting, Pacific Cod), Engraulidae (Anchoveta, Japaneese Anchovy), Scombridae (Skipjack Tuna, Chub Mackerel, Yellowfish Tuna, Atlantic Mackerel, Seerfishes Nei), Clupeidae (<b>Sardinellas</b> Nei, Atlantic Herring, European Pilchard, Araucanian Herring, European Sprat, Pacific Herring), Carangidae (Scads Nei), Trichiuridae (Largehead Hairtail), Ommastrephidae (Humboldt Squid, Argentine Shortfin Squid), Nemipteridae (Threadfin Breams Nei), Scomberesocidae (Pacific Saury), Portunidae (Gazami Crab), Akiami Paste Shrimp (FAO 2016). Worldwide, the most important fish families farmed in aquaculture are Cyprinidae (Carp), Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout), Serranidae (Seabass), Acipenseridae (Sturgeon), Scophthalmidae (Turbot), Sparidae (Sea Bream), Mytilidae (Mussels), Ostreidae (Oysters) and some families of clams (European Comission 2012). Thus, due to the abundance of aforeisaid species in worldwide fishing production, an attention must be paid on better utilization of a big amount of by-products rested after their processing.|$|E

40|$|Small {{pelagics}} are {{the main}} fish resource in North West Africa. In Senegal, these are mainly <b>sardinellas</b> (Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis) and bonga shad (Ethmalosa fimbriata). The fisheries, mainly encircling gillnets and purse seines, are predominantly performed by artisanal fishers and are of great importance for the Senegalese economy and for food security in the region. However, in recent years, the main conditions for these fisheries have changed and recent observations have shown strong declines in profit. An analysis over {{the last twenty years}} (1993 - 2013) show that the fisheries lost profit between 65 % and 100 % while operating costs increased by 25 % and 90 %, for encircling gillnet and purse seine, respectively.

40|$|In Northwest Africa, {{the small}} pelagic fish are in {{abundance}} {{and play a}} crucial role for the food safety of populations. The pelagic resources are exploited both by small-scale artisanal and industrial fleets. The landing structure of the countries in the region has been in perpetual change during the last years. The sardinella has been more and more landed by fishermen in Morocco, while the sardine has become a target by fishing vessels in Mauritania and Senegal. This indicates a modification in the distribution areas of pelagic resources. To verify this hypothesis, an outstanding database consisting in 14 acoustic surveys with a consistent and high sampling intensity (2263 trawl hauls) conducted by the RV Fridtjof Nansen from 1995 to 2015 was investigated in this study to identify trends in distribution shifts in pelagic fishes. A focus was made on <b>sardinellas</b> and the main species {{in the southern part of}} the region. Two strong spatial indicators are used in this study: the latitudinal extreme location and the barycentre of biomasses. Two clear trends can be observed from the data analysed. Firstly, in the southern and tropical part of this system the typical trend is that pelagic species show an increasing northward distribution. This applies to S. aurita, Trachurus trecae, Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Sphyraena guachancho and Brachydeuterus auritu. A second group is observed, those that do not show any clear trend in distributional shift, but where the distribution is stable over the period. The typical species observed here are S. maderensis and Decapterus rhonchus. Despite some variations in the upwelling intensity, we show that the sea surface temperature is by far the main parameter to explain this northern shift. We also discuss the likely - and largely unknown - influence of the under-estimation of the detections because of the absence of sampling in the shallow coastal zone. The impact of such displacements is also discussed in term of regional management of these shared stocks...|$|E
