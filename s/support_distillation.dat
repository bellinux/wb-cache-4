40|$|Testing of the Wiped-film Rotating-disk (WFRD) {{evaporator}} {{was conducted}} {{in support of the}} Exploration Life <b>Support</b> <b>Distillation</b> Down-Select Test. The WFRD was constructed at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and tested at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The WFRD was delivered to MSFC in September 2009, and testing of solution # 1 and solution # 2 immediately following. Solution # 1 was composed of humidity condensate and urine, including flush water and pretreatment chemicals. Solution # 2 was composed of hygiene water, humidity condensate, and urine, including flush water and pretreatment chemicals. During the testing, the operational parameters of the WFRD were recorded and samples of the feed, brine, and product were collected and analyzed. The steady-state results of processing 414 L of feed solution # 1 and 1283 L of feed solution # 2 demonstrated that running the WFRD at a brine temperature of 50 C gave an average production rate of 16. 7 L/hr. The specific energy consumption was 80. 5 W-hr/L. Data Analysis shows that the water recovery rates were 94 % and 91 %, respectively. The total mass of the WFRD as delivered to MSFC was 300 Kg. The volume of the tests stand rack was 1 m width x 0. 7 m depth x 1. 9 m height or 1. 5 cu m of which about half of the total volume is occupied by equipment. Chemical analysis of the distillate showed an average TOC of 20 ppm, a pH of 3. 5, and a conductivity of 98 mho/cm. The conductivity of the distillate, compared to the feed, decreased by 98. 9 %., the total ion concentration decreased by 99. 6 %, the total organics decreased 98. 6 %, and the metals were at or below detection limit...|$|E

40|$|In 2009, the Cascade Distillation Subsystem (CDS) {{wastewater}} processor (Honeywell International, Torrance, CA) {{was assessed}} in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Exploration Life <b>Support</b> (ELS) <b>distillation</b> comparison test. The {{purpose of the}} test was to collect data to support down-selection and development of a primary distillation technology for application in a lunar outpost water recovery system. The CDS portion of the comparison test was conducted between May 6 and August 19, 2009. The system was challenged with two pretreated test solutions, each intended to represent a feasible wastewater generated in a surface habitat. The 30 -day equivalent wastewater loading volume for a crew of four was processed for each wastewater solution. Test Solution 1 consisted of a mixed stream containing human-generated urine and humidity condensate. Test Solution 2 contained the addition of human-generated hygiene wastewater to the solution 1 waste stream components. Approximately 1500 kg of total wastewater was processed through the CDS during testing. Respective recoveries per solution were 93. 4 +/- 0. 7 and 90. 3 +/- 0. 5 %. The average specific energy of the system was calculated {{to be less than}} 130 W-hr/kg.

40|$|The Cascade Distillation System (CDS) is a rotary {{distillation}} {{system with}} potential for greater reliability and lower energy costs than existing distillation systems. Based upon {{the results of}} the 2009 distillation comparison test (DCT) and recommendations of the expert panel, the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Water Recovery Project (WRP) project advanced the technology by increasing reliability of the system through redesign of bearing assemblies and improved rotor dynamics. In addition, the project improved the CDS power efficiency by optimizing the thermoelectric heat pump (TeHP) and heat exchanger design. Testing at the NASA-JSC Advanced Exploration System Water Laboratory (AES Water Lab) using a prototype Cascade Distillation Subsystem (CDS) wastewater processor (Honeywell d International, Torrance, Calif.) with test support equipment and control system developed by Johnson Space Center was performed to evaluate performance of the system with the upgrades as compared to previous system performance. The system was challenged with Solution 1 from the NASA Exploration Life <b>Support</b> (ELS) <b>distillation</b> comparison testing performed in 2009. Solution 1 consisted of a mixed stream containing human-generated urine and humidity condensate. A secondary objective of this testing is to evaluate the performance of the CDS as compared to {{the state of the art}} Distillation Assembly (DA) used in the ISS Urine Processor Assembly (UPA).

40|$|Recovery of {{potable water}} from {{wastewater}} {{is essential for}} the success of long-duration manned missions to the Moon and Mars. Honeywell International and a team from NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) are developing a wastewater processing subsystem that is based on centrifugal vacuum distillation. The wastewater processor, referred to as the Cascade Distillation Subsystem (CDS), utilizes an innovative and efficient multistage thermodynamic process to produce purified water. The rotary centrifugal design of the system also provides gas/liquid phase separation and liquid transport under microgravity conditions. A five-stage subsystem unit has been designed, built, delivered and integrated into the NASA JSC Advanced Water Recovery Systems Development Facility for performance testing. A major test objective of the project is to demonstrate the advancement of the CDS technology from the breadboard level to a subsystem level unit. An initial round of CDS performance testing was completed in fiscal year (FY) 2008. Based on FY 08 testing, the system is now in development to support an Exploration Life <b>Support</b> (ELS) Project <b>distillation</b> comparison test expected to begin in early 2009. As part of the project objectives planned for FY 09, the system will be reconfigured to support the ELS comparison test. The CDS will then be challenged with a series of human-gene-rated waste streams representative of those anticipated for a lunar outpost. This paper provides a description of the CDS technology, a status of the current project activities, and data on the system s performance to date...|$|R
5000|$|In 1883, the Bath-based {{engineer}} Samuel Griffin was {{an established}} maker of steam and gas engines. He wished {{to produce an}} internal combustion engine, but without paying the licensing costs of the Otto patents. His solution {{was to develop a}} [...] "patent slide valve" [...] and a single-acting six-stroke engine using it.By 1886, Scottish steam locomotive maker Dick, Kerr & Co. saw a future in large oil engines and licensed the Griffin patents. These were double-acting, tandem engines and sold under the name [...] "Kilmarnock". A major market for the Griffin engine was in electricity generation, where they developed a reputation for happily running light for long periods, then suddenly being able to take up a large demand for power. Their large heavy construction didn't suit them to mobile use, but they were capable of burning heavier and cheaper grades of oil. The key principle of the [...] "Griffin Simplex" [...] was a heated exhaust-jacketed external vapouriser, into which the fuel was sprayed. The temperature was held around 550 F, sufficient to physically vapourise the oil but not to break it down chemically. This fractional <b>distillation</b> <b>supported</b> the use of heavy oil fuels, the unusable tars and asphalts separating out in the vapouriser.Hot-bulb ignition was used, which Griffin termed the [...] "catathermic igniter", a small isolated cavity connected to the combustion chamber. The spray injector had an adjustable inner nozzle for the air supply, surrounded by an annular casing for the oil, both oil and air entering at [...] pressure, and being regulated by a governor.Griffin went out of business in 1923.Only two known examples of a Griffin six-stroke engine survive. One is in the Anson Engine Museum. The other was built in 1885 and for some years was in the Birmingham Museum of Science and Technology, but in 2007 it returned to Bath and the Museum of Bath at Work.|$|R
40|$|The {{currently}} accepted {{model for}} subduction zone magmatism involves metasomatism of the mantle wedge by slab-derived components and then subsequent partial melting of this source. However, {{there is no}} consensus on whether the slab-derived component is transferred as a hydrous fluid, a silicate melt, or both. Whether these fluids or melts are derived from the altered oceanic crust, the subducted sediment, or both is also debated. Constraining the nature of the subduction component has important implications for solid-fluid-melt partitioning and slab dehydration depths, particularly elemental budgets and recycling of elements into the deep mantle. Vanuatu is an intra-oceanic subduction zone in the SW Pacific where recent scientific cruises have mapped and dredged submarine lavas that extend the sample coverage of the Vanuatu arc. Major and trace elements and radiogenic isotopes are used to identify the source and transfer mechanism of slab-derived components in the Vanuatu subduction zone. Mixing calculations estimate the mantle wedge, sediment and fluid contributions to Vanuatu arc and backarc lavas. New geochemical results are integrated with the large database of published results for Vanuatu, to investigate the along- and across-arc variation in the slab component and mantle domains. Lavas from the Vanuatu backarc have Indian-like Pb isotope ratios, similar to the Indian-type mantle signatures of central arc volcanoes, but distinct from adjacent southern arc volcanoes with Pacific-like Pb isotope ratios. The Pb isotopic anomaly (∆ 8 / 4) in the Vanuatu subduction zone decreases from the central arc segment to the southern backarc, implying trench-parallel flow of Indian-type mantle to the south. The spatial distribution of mantle domains implies that mantle flow patterns in southern Vanuatu are dominated by southward trench-parallel flow, rather than pure corner flow induced by viscous drag along the upper surface of the subducting plate. This southward flow appears to be related to pressure gradients developed during asymmetric rollback of the Australian plate. Despite these unusual mantle dynamics in southern Vanuatu, a subduction component is detectable in the across-arc and backarc lavas. In the southern Vanuatu backarc, the average amount of sediment addition decreases from ~ 1. 2 % in the north trough to ~ 0. 3 % in the central trough. The average amount of altered oceanic crust fluid addition also decreases from ~ 0. 3 % in the northern trough to ~ 0. 1 % in the central trough. The southern backarc trough lavas are not enriched in large ion lithophile elements and have light rare earth element depletions, suggesting that these lavas do not have a significant contribution from slab-derived components. In the across-arc volcanoes, the average amount of sediment addition decreases from ~ 2 % in the volcanic front to ~ 0. 5 % in the easternmost across-arc volcano. The average amount of altered oceanic crust fluid addition also decreases from ~ 0. 9 % in the volcanic front to ~ 0. 3 % in the easternmost across-arc volcano. For the backarc and across-arc lavas, sediment and fluid contributions progressively decrease with distance from the trench. Fluid-mobile/fluid-immobile trace element ratios, such as Ba/Yb and Ba/La ratios also decrease with distance from the trench and <b>support</b> progressive <b>distillation</b> of the subducting slab. Enrichment of fluid mobile elements in the southern across-arc volcanoes reflects the addition of hydrous fluids to slab depths of at least 200 km. These constraints on slab dehydration signify that not all fluid mobile elements are recycled at shallow depths. The degree of melting in the across-arc volcanoes progressively decreases with depth to the slab, demonstrating that the degree of melting is not solely controlled by the melt column height. Smaller degree melts from southern Vanuatu have a smaller contribution from slab-derived components. These constraints argue for fluid-fluxed melting, where the extent of melting progressively decreases as the amount of slab-derived fluid decreases. This positive wet melting function contrasts with that observed at mid ocean ridges, where increasing water content of the mantle source is associated with decreasing extents of melting...|$|R
