The total slew bridge weight was 354 LT, including the counterweight.

It was necessary for the swing bridge to be balanced about the centre of slew to give equal loading of the 4 main lifting jacks and the span was accurately weighed by 4 x 100 LT electronic load cells (certified to ±0.5%) February 1987, during the bridge's final installation and commissioning trials.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between a swing yarder and a tower yarder is that the upperworks is mounted on a large <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing.</b> This bearing permits the boom and cable system to be 'swung' across a setting without relocating the machine. An experienced operator uses timing and cable tension to swing the grapple to the desired location. In practice, however, the main benefit of a swinging machine is that once the logs are yarded up to the machine, they can be swung {{to the side and}} landed. This allows the machine to be positioned in a small area such as on a road, and to land (set down) the logs on the road behind (or in front of) the machine. By contrast a tower has no options on where to set the logs---so the tower has to be positioned back from the break of the hill so as to leave a landing area on the downhill side of the machine, the logs can only be pulled up to near the tower and then lowered to the ground making it necessary for a shovel (log loader) to also be present to remove the logs once landed. Implicitly a swing machine {{does not need to be}} as tall as a tower machine particularly in steep ground because the swing machine can be set right up to the 'edge' of the steep ground while the tower must be set back from the 'edge' to allow landing space.|$|E

Based on the results of the conducted analysis, actions limiting the occurrence of the damage to the pitch surfaces of the bearings, which lead to their premature exchange, have been proposed.

40|$|The working {{state of}} {{equipments}} such as wind turbines, cranes, and excavators is {{directly affected by}} the damage of the <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing.</b> Condition monitoring system is a good method to identify the defects; however, the measuring range and distribution of the sensors have important influence on the monitoring efficacy. Due to the thin-wall and cyclic structure characteristics of a <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing,</b> the defect characteristic response is unusual and unknown. To solve this problem, a finite element model for local defect on the raceway of a <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing</b> was established by ABAQUS, and the operating process of the <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing</b> was simulated based on the explicit dynamic finite element algorithm. The pulse waveforms of vibration responses under different defect sizes are obtained, and the influencing mechanism of the damage sizes on the <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing</b> was studied. The simulation {{results show that the}} increase in defect length is the dominant influence on the operation of a <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing</b> and the effect of height is negligible under the same conditions. Furthermore, the explicit dynamic finite element analysis model was reasonable by comparing the simulation results with the test results. Therefore, the localized defect on the raceway surface of a <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing</b> can be reflected by finite element simulation analysis, and the analytical results can help develop the raceway damage monitoring system of a <b>slewing</b> <b>bearing...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith {{the rising}} {{performance}} of wind turbines {{the requirements for}} large scale gears are growing. Due to the bigger loads based on the higher megawatt output per turbine gears especially at <b>slewing</b> <b>bearings</b> need to be hardened. Rising demands for better gear qualities and higher loads require a hard machining of these hardened gears. The development of special cutting materials for geometrically well-defined cutting edge processes enables the manufactures to mill these gears in hardened condition on standard milling machines. The process of milling hardened gears needs control of the surface integrity of the tooth flanks. The generation of white etching areas must be avoided and can be influenced by process parameters (e. g. cutting speed and feed rate). Preferably compressive residual stresses should be generated in the surface and sub-surface of the tooth flank. The paper describes the potentials of milling theses hardened gears instead of grinding and reveals the generated surface integrity state...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{procedure}} for bearing life calculation, {{as described in}} standard ISO 281 : 2008, was developed for standard, rather small axial or thrust rolling bearings. Since the geometry and manufacturing procedures of large rolling <b>slewing</b> <b>bearings</b> are considerably {{different from those of}} standard rolling bearings, different calculation procedures have to be used. The paper describes a computational procedure, where the geometry of the bearing is described with vectors, which enables modelling of irregular shapes of the bearing rings. These can be a result of the manufacturing procedure or of the deformations caused by the operating conditions. The calculation procedure consists of calculation of the maximum contact force on the rolling element, which is done by the in-house developed program, and detailed finite element analysis of the contact between the ball and the raceway. The finite element analysis also takes into account depth-dependent material parameters of a raceway.

30|$|The {{establishment}} of a suitable model under the limited monitoring data is the key problem to estimate RUL and an urgent need for industrial production. SVM is a machine-learning algorithm based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, {{which is used to}} solve the problems of classification and prediction when the sample size is small [123]. At present, SVM research mainly focuses on algorithm solution and model establishment. The purpose of algorithm solution is to address a constrained optimization problem by adopting the appropriate algorithm. The problem of model establishment includes optimization of model parameters, kernel function selection, feature vector extraction, and unbalanced sample. The aforementioned factors directly affect the model accuracy. Lu, et al [124], considered the difficulty of obtaining ideal prediction results under a small sample size. Thus, they proposed a least squares SVM (LSSVM) to estimate the degradation trend of <b>slewing</b> <b>bearings</b> and used PSO to optimize LSSVM parameters. Compared with the RBFN, the LSSVM model was demonstrated to be more accurate and effective. Dong, et al [125], used principal component analysis (PCA) to fuse the original features and reduce the dimension. Then, they used the LSSVM model to predict the bearing degradation process. Chen, et al [126], proposed an RUL prediction method based on relative feature and multivariate SVM (MSVM). In contrast to univariate SVM, MSVM overcame the shortcomings of insufficient condition monitoring information and mined potential, and useful information from small sample size. Caesarendra, et al [127], combined Cox proportional hazard model and SVM for failure degradation prediction of bearings. Widodo, et al [128], proposed a prediction method based on survival analysis and SVM. Kaplan-Meier and probability density function estimators were used to generate survival probability, and the kurtosis of measured data and survival probability were used as input and output of the SVM, respectively. The trained SVM successfully predicted machine failure time. Tran, et al [129], combined auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model, Cox proportional hazard model, and SVM for RUL prediction. Loutas, et al [130], used wavelet packet nodal energies and Wiener entropy as the feature vector, and proposed ε-support vector regression method in predicting the RUL of rolling bearings. He, et al [131], proposed a hidden Markov-SVM to predict surface roughness in hard turning. More published literature of applying SVM in RUL estimation of mechanical systems can be found in Refs. [132 – 137]. SVM has been successfully developed rapidly in recent years, with an increasing number of studies focusing on SVM. However, SVM still has some problems to be solved, such as feature selection and large-scale training sample problem.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most {{wind turbine}} {{gearboxes}} and pitch/yaw reducers consist of several planetary geartrains. Planetary geartrains allow gearboxes to be small, light, low noise, and efficient.
