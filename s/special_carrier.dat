5000|$|Lipid signaling, broadly defined, {{refers to}} any {{biological}} signaling event involving a lipid messenger that binds a protein target, {{such as a}} receptor, kinase or phosphatase, which in turn mediate {{the effects of these}} lipids on specific cellular responses. Lipid signaling is thought to be qualitatively different from other classical signaling paradigms (such as monoamine neurotransmission) because lipids can freely diffuse through membranes (see osmosis.) One consequence of this is that lipid messengers cannot be stored in vesicles prior to release and so are often biosynthesized [...] "on demand" [...] at their intended site of action. As such, many lipid signaling molecules cannot circulate freely in solution but, rather, exist bound to <b>special</b> <b>carrier</b> proteins in serum.|$|E

40|$|Fungal {{infections and}} {{leishmaniasis}} {{are an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in immunocompromised patients. The macrolide polyene antibiotic amphotericin B (AmB) has long been recognized as a powerful fungicidal and leishmanicidal drug. A conventional intravenous dosage form of AmB, AmB- deoxycholate (Fungizone or D-AmB), is the most effective clinically available for treating fungal and parasitic (leishmaniasis) infections. However, the clinical efficacy of AmB is limited by its adverse effects mainly nephrotoxicity. Efforts to lower the toxicity are based on synthesis of AmB analogues such as AmB esters or preparation of AmB-lipid associations in the forms of liposomal AmB (L-AmB or AmBisome), AmB lipid complex (Abelcet or ABLC), AmB colloidal dispersion (Amphocil or ABCD), and intralipid AmB. These newer formulations are substantially more expensive, but allow patients to receive higher doses {{for longer periods of time}} with decreased renal toxicity than conventional AmB. Modifications of liposomal surface in order to avoid RES uptake, thus increased targetability has been attempted.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the continuation of}} the research work started in 2004. The previous results have been published both in ASPRS and ISPRS conferences. Now we intend to emphasize the latest developments and extended application areas of the system. Due to the increasing demand of the transportation authorities for rapid, accurate data acquisition about the road pavement, a mobile mapping system has been developed primarily for road surface detection. Our system involves a data archiving and system control unit (notebook), an imaging unit (two industrial cameras), a positioning unit (combined GPS/IMU system with built-in Kalman filtering), a marker unit (point-projection by laser diode array) and the mobile platform (pickup with <b>special</b> <b>carrier</b> frame and specified power supply). The first reported results were about creating the digital road surface model and detecting the cracks on the pavement. The system is now in test-phase at the road maintenance company of Budapest city (Municipal Public Service); during the practical tests several new demands have been raised. For the complex transportation management (scheduling road construction works, reconstruction etc.) the roads have to be classified into coarse categories. Therefore the resulted digital surface model has to be transformed into basic numeric form. Internationally, the so-called IRI (International Roughness Index) is used to represent the road condition. Besides the digital surface model of the road pavement, the INS measurements can be used without the images to derive data that indicate the pavement condition. Our experiments showed that vertical acceleration and the roll/pitch values are strongly correlated with the road roughness and waviness. Based on the single INS measurements, the roads can be classified into categories, our tests and initial results are also discussed in the paper. 1...|$|E

The general assumption, however, is that liquid enzymes are generally less stable than solids although they may have greater activity than their solid counterparts. In general practice {{it is assumed that}} the loss in activity of liquid enzymes due to thermal and mechanical treatments can be substantially minimized once incorporated into the feed, as their hydric content is decreased. The feed acts therefore as a stabilizing agent.

40|$|SINCE Heilbrunn's work in 1926 {{most workers}} {{have agreed that}} the {{viscosity}} of protoplasm is low; all the recent observations, with one exception, have given figures which are not markedly different from each other. The exception, the work of Fetter (1926) on Paramecium, gives a viscosity value which {{is much higher than}} that found in other material. The present paper constitutes a re-examination of the viscosity values given by Fetter. MATERIAL AND METHOD The animals used were obtained from a stock culture of Paramecium sp. The experimental method was originally based on that of Fetter, but it required so much modification in detail, that in its final form little trace of the original method remained. When the animals were fed with particles of different kinds (iron, indian ink, and starch were among those tried), it was found that there was a very great variation in their degree of movement in a centrifugal field. It seemed probable that this was due to differences in the orientation of the animals in the centrifuge tube. Various attempts were made to control this factor, the final method being as follows. A few cubic centimetres of culture were put into a watch-glass and a small quantity of iron particles mixed with the water. The iron used was the so-called "dust iron " manufactured for use in high-frequency radio circuits. These particles are nearly spherical and between 3 and 4 /x in diameter. They were ingested very readily by the Paramecium; after 2 - 3 min. a majority of the animals had one or more vacuoles containing iron. An animal which had not ingested too much metal was selected under a dissecting microscope and was drawn into a capillary tube about 3 - 4 cm. long. The bore of the tube was very little greater that the cross-section of the animal; the capillary was sealed at both ends and cemented to a glass slide. The position of the Paramecium in the capillary was marked by a line drawn on the slide and the latter placed in a <b>special</b> <b>carrier</b> (Fig. 1). This carrier was rotated by an electric motor at a predetermined speed. At the end of the required time the motor was stopped and the slide examined under a microscope, and the position of a certain vacuole noted.

30|$|Another {{method for}} {{reducing}} OOB interference, called extended active interference cancellation (EAIC) [23], {{is based on}} the insertion of <b>special</b> <b>carriers</b> that are designed to negatively combine with high-power sidelobes caused by the data subcarriers. The AIC subcarriers can be placed inside the adjacent transmission spectrum, usually at frequency locations that are non-orthogonal to the SU data subcarriers. The main drawback of this method results from this lack of orthogonality and thus, data symbols distortion. A variant of the EAIC method was presented in [24], where the sidelobe suppression approach was improved by using a long time-domain cancellation signal spanning over a number of consecutive OFDM symbols. This method results in an increase of BER due to increased interference relative to the method presented in [23]. In [25], this method is improved by introducing the constraint on the self-interference power level.|$|R
