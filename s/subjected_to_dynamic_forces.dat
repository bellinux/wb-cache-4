40|$|Frequency {{response}} functions (FRFs) play {{an important}} role in the assessment of the structural response of linear systems <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces.</b> In this work a meta-model is presented to approximate the eigenfrequencies and mode shapes to describe the FRFs. The meta-model is supposed to provide a computationally fast solution for the eigenvalue problem, which needs to be solved for each set of random structural input parameters. The provided relations can be helpful in the design stage to control the dynamic response within certain frequency bands. Moreover, the meta-model can be used for optimization and reliability assessments based on Monte Carlo sampling procedures. Numerical examples show the application of the method focusing mainly on the variability of the FRFs w. r. t. the number of random variables involved to model the mechanical system. The accuracy of the meta-model to approximate FRFs is assessed by a comparison with the solution by Finite Element (FE) analyses...|$|E
40|$|Integral {{turbine wheels}} belong {{to one of}} the most {{stressed}} parts of jet aircraft engines. In addition to high rotational speeds and temperatures, they are also <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> from a non-uniform pressure field in the flow path. Dynamic forces even at a relatively small amplitude can cause failure by fatigue, which leads to fracture of blades and crash of the machine. These adverse conditions, called resonance, should be avoided already in the design stage when a suitable choice of stator vanes and the number of blades can move the critical speed of the blisk beyond the operating speed or at least reduce their influence. In the case of a small jet engine produced by the První brněnská strojírna (PBS) Velká Bíteš, the operating speed is of nearly half of the entire speed range of the machine. This makes the design of a proposed turbine wheel very complicated. A higher harmonic order of aerodynamic excitation is almost always present, its influence was therefore tested experimentally by vibration tests in the test station PBS Velká Bíteš...|$|E

40|$|In an {{accompanying}} paper, we presented {{an overview of}} a wide variety of modeling concepts, varying in complexity, used to describe evaporation from soil. Using theoretical analyses, we explained the simplifications and parameterizations in the different approaches. In this paper, we numerically evaluate the consequences of these simplifications and parameterizations. Two sets of simulations were performed. The first set investigates lateral variations in vertical fluxes, which emerge from both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media, and their importance to capturing evaporation behavior. When evaporation decreases from parts of the heterogeneous soil surface, lateral flow and transport processes in the free flow and in the porous medium generate feedbacks that enhance evaporation from wet surface areas. In the second set of simulations, we assume that the vertical fluxes do not vary considerably in the simulation domain and represent the system using one-dimensional models which also consider <b>dynamic</b> <b>forcing</b> of the evaporation process, for example, due to diurnal variations in net radiation. Simulated evaporation fluxes <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forcing</b> differed considerably between model concepts depending on how vapor transport in the air phase and the interaction at the interface between the free flow and porous medium were represented or parameterized. However, simulated cumulative evaporation losses from initially wet soil profiles were very similar between model concepts and mainly controlled by the desorptivity, Sevap, of the porous medium, which depends mainly on the liquid flow properties of the porous medium...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine design methods which may be used to study stresses which occur in transportation vehicles. The major area of uncertainty in this field occurs in relation to dynamic aspects and it was determined to apply the use of the moire fringe technique in conjunction with models to study impact and vibration effects in structura^l members. The basic geometry of the moire pattern is noted. The methods and principles employed by previous workers to study statically loaded structures are investigated to establish the techniques required for moire analysis. These principles are then applied to models <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces,</b> making use of high speed cameras. Vibration studies are undertaken over a range of forced steady cycles which prove the application of the technique to high speed deflection of members. The suitability of plastics for use in dynamic work is also examined. The principles are then applied to analysis of impact deflection by means of a drop weight on a cantilever beam. The results show excellent agreement of the deflection impulse obtained by the moire method as compared with deflection measured by a linear transducer. General techniques are established for the excitation and impacting of structural models and for recording of the moire fringe pattern. A list of references relating to analysis of structural members used in transportation vehicles and also to impact studies has been compiled and is included in Appendix 4 for possible future work...|$|E
40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the energy market {{in the recent years}} has lead to an increased willingness to operate hydro turbines over a larger operational range and with increased number of start and stops. This means that the turbine will be subject to a more frequent and larger load variation. Especially for high head turbines, the impact of dynamic forces has been of considerable interest. High head turbine runners are <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> originating from various sources. One significant source is the interaction between the runner and guide vanes, also called rotor - stator interaction (RSI). RSI creates periodic pressure fluctuations in the runner. Combined with stress concentration and material defects, the induced pressure fluctuations can give an increased risk of fatigue cracks. For Francis runners, the areas near the trailing edge of the runner blade towards the band and/or crown has been identified as critical areas for fatigue, and for high head runners there has been several examples where fatigue failure have been initiated near the trailing edge toward the band. The thesis presents an estimation of dynamic stresses in a high head Francis runner. The stresses were estimated by Finite Element analysis based on pressure variations obtained via unsteady CFD analysis. The dynamic stresses calculated by FEA were compared with dynamic stresses measured by strain gauge measurements carried out on a prototype runner. A CFD result for one operational condition was calculated. Since the pressure variations on the blades are periodic, only a pressure load for one whole cycle is needed for the FEA. Symmetry between the number of runner blades and guide vanes made it possible to reduce the computational model and thereby reduce computational time. The Finite Element model contained a portion of the crown and band and two runner blade channels. The FEA was carried out for time steps corresponding to a full periodic cycle for one operational condition, i. e one guide vane opening angles. The results were compared with site measurements.

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} are fabricated from tubes or circular hollow sections. Tubular joints which are created {{at the intersection}} of the circular members experience complicated structural problems such as stress concentration, ultimate strength, joint stiffness and fatigue life. Some aspects of tubular T-joints regarding joint stiffness and stress concentration are investigated in this thesis. The methods employed in these investigations are based on dynamic theoretical and experimental modelling techniques. Semi-rigidity of tubular joints leads to different results when compared with the common assumption of rigid joint analysis. However, {{due to the lack of}} an efficient modelling method, tubular joints are still assumed to be rigid in most analyses. A method based on the model of a beam with end springs is used in this study to derive the bending and axial stiffness of joints. This method can be distinguished from other techniques, as it employs the natural frequencies rather than static measurements. A n extensive Finite Element analysis is carried out to establish a series of stiffness equations for inplane bending, out of plane bending and axial deformation of brace in tubular T-joints. The proposed parametric equations include diameter to thickness ratio which is not presently considered in any other formulae. The analysis results show that including diameter to thickness ratio makes a significant difference in the stiffness of tubular T-joints. The validity of the Finite Element analyses is investigated by experimentally testing eleven steel T-joints. The effect of dynamic loading on strain or stress concentration factors in tubular joints are also investigated in this thesis. Stress concentration factors are used to calculate the maximum stress values at the tubular joints. The results show that strain or stress concentration factor is frequency dependent, when strains at tubular joints are <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces.</b> This parameter has not been considered in the other studies of stress concentration of tubular joints. Another aspect of tubular joints investigated herein is the effect of joint stiffness consideration on the fatigue life estimation of offshore towers. Results of the analyses of a 100 m tower in this study show an average difference of 30 % in fatigue life due to the flexibility consideration of tubular joints.

The location where the winding {{gets out of}} the groove is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces,</b> it resulting in microcracks. As a result, conducting bridges are formed on the frontal end of the winding. The amount of current flowing through the dust layer depends on the material and its thickness. Studies of this issue have not been conducted in modern literature. The task of timely detection and diagnosis of the natural aging of insulation, its becoming dusty and wet is relevant. As a result of physical phenomena simulation the relationship curves of the surface resistance dependence on different materials and thicknesses of the dust layers have been obtained.

40|$|Abstract — During subsea lifting {{operations}} in harsh sea conditions, the involved crane system is <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> extensive <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> due <b>to</b> vertical vessel motion. Thus, active heave compensation {{systems can be}} used to compensate for vertical vessel motion and to reduce forces acting on the crane structure. Furthermore, such systems allow an exact positioning of the load on the seabed. However, active heave compensation systems always require knowledge about the vertical position of the crane depending on the ship’s heave, roll, and pitch motion. Hence, an attitude estimation method for ships during subsea lifting operations is proposed. To estimate the roll and pitch motion of a vessel with high accuracy, rotation rate sensors are fused with accelerometers using an Extended Kalman Filter. Since an exact knowledge of the yaw motion is not required to determine the crane’s vertical motion, the yaw angle is stabilized around zero with an additional virtual sensor signal. The attitude estimation algorithm is evaluated with simulation and measurement results from an experimental setup. I...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{strengths}} specified in the Loadings Standard NZS 4203 : 1992 (Standards New Zealand 1992) to resist seismic actions are low when compared with major international design codes (Fenwick and Davidson 1994; Fenwick et al. 2002). Few modifications to these low strengths other than an increase in the minimum permissible base shear {{have been made in the}} draft revision of the Standard, NZS 1170. 5. Furthermore, the design procedure to allow for higher mode effects in multi-storey structures <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> was developed in the 70 's using a limited number of non-linear time-history analyses with a bilinear hysteretic rule and in most cases neglecting P-delta effects. In this work, a four storey, a six storey, and two twelve storey buildings, in which the resistance to lateral forces is provided by concrete moment resisting frame structures were designed and analysed. Through a senes of non-linear time-history analyses using a Takeda hysteretic rule and considering P-delta effects, three main objectives were studied. The first objective was to investigate if the strengths given to beams and columns met the objectives set by the Loadings Standard (Standards New Zealand 1992). The second objective was to examine how well the method of determining column actions from the NZS 3101 : 1995 (Standards New Zealand 1995) works when using the lateral loading specified in NZS 4203 : 1992 (Standards New Zealand 1992) and the draft provisions of the proposed Loadings Standard NZS 1170. 5 and the third objective was to compare the performance of multi-storey moment resisting frame buildings where columns are modelled as: Elastic responding columns except at the base; Columns designed to meet the minimum requirements as given in NZS 3101 : 1995 (Standards New Zealand 1995); and Columns designed to meet the minimum strength requirements as defined in the 2004 draft of NZS 1170. 5 where limited protection to plastic hinge formation is given. The influence of the choice of hysteretic rule was assessed and in general, the structures studied performed in a satisfactory manner due to the use of a more realistic hysteretic model. The individual results from the non-linear time-history analyses were very scattered making the structures reach critical performance levels with some of the selected ground acceleration records and poor performance was observed for structures analysed using a 2, 500 year return period earthquake. It was also shown that P-delta effects have a significant influence to the response even for the four and six storey structures and concluded that P-delta effects should always be included in the design and analysis of structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, a {{relatively}} simple method of discrete structural optimization with dynamic loads is presented. It {{is based on a}} tree graph, representing discrete values of the structural weight. In practical design, the number of such values may be very large. This is because they are equal to the combination numbers, arising from numbers of structural members and prefabricated elements. The starting point of the method is the weight obtained from continuous optimization, which is assumed to be the lower bound of all possible discrete weights. Applying the graph, it is possible to find a set of weights close to the continuous solution. The smallest of these values, fulfilling constraints, is assumed to be the discrete minimum weight solution. Constraints can be imposed on stresses, displacements and accelerations. The short outline of the method is presented in Sec. 2. The idea of discrete structural optimization by means of graphs. The knowledge needed to apply the method is limited to the FEM and graph representation. The paper is illustrated with two examples.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{scientists}} and engineers have tried to develop and improve various devices and control systems in order to mitigate and prevent civil structures against external <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> such as strong wind and earthquakes. Indeed, damping devices absorb and dissipate the energy input during an earthquake, for instance and thus make structures safer and stable. Many types of devices are currently used such as viscous, friction or tuned mass dampers; however, {{one of the most}} recent promising systems proposed is the Magnetorheological damper (MR damper). Because of their ability to be controlled and to adapt their mechanical properties by varying a magnetic field, their high damping force (200 kN), their low energy input required and their simple use and implementation in buildings, MR dampers seem to be suitable and realistic for civil engineering application. However, when they are <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> external <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces,</b> the temperature increase in the damper device may significantly alter their performances and behaviors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 sound premolars were randomly divided into three groups of standardized tunnel preparations with a remaining marginal ridge height of 1. 5 mm, 2. 5 mm and 3. 5 mm, respectively. In each tunnel group, 10 teeth were filled with all four newly developed adhesive materials that had not previously been used in tunnel preparation: Ketac Aplicap, Fuji IX, Fuji II LC and Beautifil Flow F 02. The control group comprised 10 sound teeth. All teeth were <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> incremental <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> testing. Remaining marginal ridge height and restoration material were the independent variables. The mean maximum energy (MEI) score was the dependent variable.

RESULTS: Both restorative material (P< 0. 0001) and remaining marginal ridge height (P< 0. 0001) had a statistically significant effect on the mean MEI score of tunnel-prepared teeth. At the 2. 5 mm of remaining marginal ridge height, no statistically significant difference in mean MEI score existed between Beautifil Flow F 02 -filled tunnel-prepared teeth and sound teeth.

Due to {{the motion of the}} FPSO in heavy sea and strong wind, the crane is <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> additional <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> as well as swinging loads. The present paper deals with numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the Norne offshore crane during lifting operation. The simulations are performed by FEDEM – a general nonlinear dynamic analysis program for flexible multibody systems. The pedestal, “king ” and boom are flexible links modelled by shell finite elements and connected together by different joints. The hoisting rope and the hydraulic cylinders are modelled by linear and nonlinear spring and damper elements. A control system is implemented in the model making it possible to control the movement of the boom and the winch to compensate for the relative motion between the ship and the supply vessel and keep the load in rest relative to the vessel. Examples are shown of calculated natural frequencies and mode shapes as function of hoisting rope length and boom angle. Furthermore, maximum dynamic stresses in different sections/details are presented as function of how the crane is operated. Besides giving necessary stress data for design verification against overload and fatigue, the presented model can be used to optimise the operation procedure, determine the maximum allowable load for various sea states and to calculate necessary power to control the motion of the load...|$|R

In the inverse analysis, a dynamic response sensitivity-based finite element model updating approach is used to identify local damage in the element level. The solution is obtained iteratively with the penalty function method with regularization from the measured structural dynamic responses. A single-span box-girder bridge is studied as a numerical example. The effects measurement noise and measurement time duration on the identification results are investigated.

In order to investigate the fatigue behavior of pipe joints, a resonant bending fatigue setup was designed, suitable for testing pipes within a diameter range from 6 in. to 20 in. In this setup, the pipe, filled with water, is <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> a <b>dynamic</b> excitation <b>force</b> with a frequency close to the natural frequency of the filled pipe.

The World Trade Center attack highlighted troublesome weakness in connections, which exhibited poor performance caused by brittle failure. Structural details played a very significant behavioural role when the structure is <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> impulsive loads [1]. Concerning the behaviour of steel joint, the literature presents several studies on steel connections under both static and cyclic loads [2, 3]; many results of these studies have contributed for improving the current standards, such as the Eurocode 3, part 1 - 8 [4]. However, only scarce information exists concerning the behaviour of these joints directly loaded by higher loading rates [5]. This paper is devoted to the report of an experimental programme on steel joints under impact loading, in particular to the assessment of T-stub response under tension. The T-stub is used to evaluate the behaviour of the tensile components that are responsible for the deformability of the joint, such as the end plate in bending. Firstly, the paper describes the features of an experimental system developed at the University of Coimbra, to apply high rates of loading; then, it presents the experimental campaign and the corresponding results. The test apparatus is defined by a rigid reaction frame fixed to a reaction slab and connected to a rigid “flying beam” (HEM 340, S 355 J 2); the impact force is applied in this beam through a pneumatic driven cylinder ( = 125 mm). This “flying beam” consists in a second class lever pivot located {{at the opposite end of}} the cylinder location, and the tested specimen is <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> at the middle of this beam. The pneumatic cylinder was designed to work with a maximum operating pressure of 30 MPa. During the impact tests, force, displacements, accelerations and strains are measured. Because this type of tests occurs in a very short time intervals (hundredths of a second), specific equipment with large sample rate are used. The experimental programme includes two impact tests on welded T-stubs: i) test T- 10 -D 120 - 160 - rapidly applied loading of 120 Bar [12 MPa], followed by 160 Bar [16 MPa]; and ii) test T- 10 -D 160 - rapidly applied loading of a single impact equal to 160 Bar [16 MPa]. The results of these tests are compared against reference quasi-static tests [6]. The T-stub geometry is defined by two plates, the flange and the web, both with 10 mm of thickness and welded by means of a continuous 45 º fillet. The flange is bolted through two bolts M 20, grade 8. 8 fully threaded...|$|R
40|$|The servo {{technology}} was implemented in screw presses to produce high press forces for stamping and forming applications. Instead {{of the usual}} flywheel, a powerful servo motor directly drives the screw {{which is used to}} transform the rotational into the linear movement of the press ram. Nowadays stamping and forming processes can be designed more dynamic and flexible because the drive system can be accelerated faster due to the lower moment of inertia. Nevertheless, new strategies must be developed to ensure an efficient projection process and to reach a high project quality. The static, dynamic and thermal behavior of the servo-press has a great importance as it may result in unwanted behavior during process. Apart from the static loads, machine tools are <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> constantly changing <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> and the machine tool structure will deform according to the amplitude and frequency of the dynamic excitation. Both the static and dynamic stiffness of the machine tool structure determine the machine's accuracy and productivity. At first, a previously studied FE model of the servo-screw-press is evaluated and analyzed in a static and dynamic analysis using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Then, an extraction of modal parameters from experimental results and correlation between the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and the Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) is performed. A numerical study of the uncertainty in stiffness and damping properties for the power train and guiding system of the servo-screw-press is performed with an addition of some other uncertainties in the model such as mass and stiffness distribution in the FE model. This is done by applying a statistical probability distribution to physical properties and randomly sample of many physical properties. Implementing the powerful tool of sensitivity analysis and model update is not yet to be performed on such a large FE model as the servo-screw-press, therefore, evaluation of this tool using the commercial software FEMtools v. 3. 6 is carried out. The second focus in this study is to define a FE model of the servo-screw-press for modeling of transient thermal analysis and structural analysis from the resulting new temperature distribution. Results from the thermal-stress analysis were validated experimentally relating the temperature distribution and the strains at the power train and guiding system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behavior}} of the particular building system that makes use of load-bearing walls of reinforced concrete cast into mineralized wood. This construction system has been studied under the action of pseudo-static forces (experimentally and numerically) and under <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> (only numerically). The activities carried out, in general, employed experimental equipment for the realization of tests on materials and on specimens that can be both portions and real scale walls. Additionally, a commercial software has been used for the numerical modeling of the elements composing the construction system in object. In particular, in the first chapters of the thesis, a complete analytical treatment based on experimental results obtained in the years before the Ph. D beginning and during the Ph. D is provided. The original aspects, from the experimental point of view, were the two experimental campaigns concerning portions of panel <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> direct shear and real scale walls <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> cyclic horizontal forces in a pseudo-static fashion. In addition, the experimental campaign was completed with the tests on wall-to-wall and wall-to-floor connections required by LL. GG. Min. of Public Works (2011) and aimed at the study of load-bearing walls cast within formwork blocks. The direct shear tests have shown an incongruity of the experimental results with the first analytical treatment developed in the years before 2012 and therefore it was necessary to revise it with new theoretical considerations. A new and original analytical treatment based on strut-and-tie mechanisms was developed. In the last chapters, the construction system has been treated numerically. In the numerical modeling of the structural system the analytical treatment exposed in the first chapters was employed using elements with lumped and distributed plasticity able to simulate the main failure mechanisms documented in the experimental tests. This modeling was first validated on the results of tests on full-scale walls and then used to simulate the behavior of multi-story buildings, regular and irregular, with bi-dimensional and spatial models. These buildings have been <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> typical of seismic action. The numerical results of the simulations coupled with the capacity curves enabled the estimate of the seismic response of the building system and, finally, the behavior factor which best synthesizes it. The estimate of this parameter is of fundamental importance in seismic design, {{it is one of the}} main research results. It is worth to notice that the Italian Guidelines prescriptions regarding the behavior factor are more conservative with respect to the results of this researc...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{case study}} on a {{low-cost}} service retail concept known as "Two for One" a pub-food chain owned by The Spirit Group. The thesis aims to explore the nature and characteristics of the product life cycle for low-cost service retailers with the objective to establish strategic options. The nature of low-cost propositions is that price is the main strategic driver to compete for growth and market share. However in maturing markets where competition is high and margins are low, retailers seek alternative sources of differentiation. This study is important for two reasons: firstly, {{the literature on the}} product life cycle spans over 50 years, yet it does not study service retail markets-focusing instead on manufacturing or fast moving consumer goods. Secondly, not only is service retail a key area of modern business studies, but that there is a growing emergence of the low-cost provider in sectors such as short-haul flights (Easyjet); Multiple Grocers (Tesco); on-line retailers (Amazon) and pub-companies (J D Wetherspoons and TWO FOR ONE). The concept of building superior customer value and growing customer loyalty are two themes for strategy that are explored in detail. These concepts are relatively new (being studying in the last 10 - 20 years) and there is a broad spectrum of opinion in the literature. However, the case study reviews the enablers of customer satisfaction and loyalty using four extensive customer surveys, from a sample base of over 6000 consumers. Strategic options are considered in light of both the product lifecycle of the case study and the customer value and loyalty findings. The main conclusions of the study are: 	Product life cycle {{can be used as a}} basic management tool, provided its used at all levels of market, product form, class and brand and if external forces are considered 	Retail market life cycles are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> complex and <b>dynamic</b> <b>forces</b> influenced by multi-site nature of retail. Low-cost service retail adds a further <b>dynamic</b> <b>to</b> life cycle performance. Strategy selection is therefore dependent on establishing the life cycle stages of multiple sites and considering factors as well as price to provide differential advantage. 	The pub-food market is now showing early signs of maturing which will result in pressure on margins and further market consolidation. 	Customer value can also be defined as a function of Ã�Â¢Ã¢Â�Â¬Ã�Â�price, quality, service and environment. 	There is evidence of links between customer satisfaction, operational competency, site investment and profits. 	Investment in customer loyalty strategies is low in pub retailing, providing low returns on investment. Customer loyalty strategies should focus instead on low-tech approaches to understanding customer needs, matching them with appropriate offers and communicating the offer to the target customer. 	Analysis of customer complaints show that service and quality of products are key dissatisfiers, suggesting that a zero defections policy is the first step to improving customer loyalty...|$|R
40|$|The {{multimodal}} {{friction ignition}} tester (MFIT) is a testbed for experiments on the thermal and mechanical effects of friction on material specimens in pressurized, oxygen-rich atmospheres. In simplest terms, a test involves recording sensory data while rubbing two specimens {{against each other}} at a controlled normal force, with either a random stroke or a sinusoidal stroke having controlled amplitude and frequency. The term multimodal in the full name of the apparatus refers to a capability for imposing any combination of widely ranging values of the atmospheric pressure, atmospheric oxygen content, stroke length, stroke frequency, and normal force. The MFIT was designed especially for studying the tendency toward heating and combustion of nonmetallic composite materials and the fretting of metals <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>dynamic</b> (vibrational) friction <b>forces</b> {{in the presence of}} liquid oxygen or pressurized gaseous oxygen test conditions approximating conditions expected to be encountered in proposed composite material oxygen tanks aboard aircraft and spacecraft in flight. The MFIT includes a stainless-steel pressure vessel capable of retaining the required test atmosphere. Mounted atop the vessel is a pneumatic cylinder containing a piston for exerting the specified normal force between the two specimens. Through a shaft seal, the piston shaft extends downward into the vessel. One of the specimens is mounted on a block, denoted the pressure block, {{at the lower end of}} the piston shaft. This specimen is pressed down against the other specimen, which is mounted in a recess in another block, denoted the slip block, that can be moved horizontally but not vertically. The slip block is driven in reciprocating horizontal motion by an electrodynamic vibration exciter outside the pressure vessel. The armature of the electrodynamic exciter is connected to the slip block via a horizontal shaft that extends into the pressure vessel via a second shaft seal. The reciprocating horizontal motion can be chosen to be random with a flat spectrum over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 kHz, or to be sinusoidal at any peak-to-peak amplitude up to 0. 8 in. (. 2 cm) and fixed or varying frequency up to 1 kHz. The temperatures of the specimen and of the vessel are measured by thermocouples. A digital video camera mounted outside the pressure vessel is aimed into the vessel through a sapphire window, with its focus fixed on the interface between the two specimens. A position transducer monitors the displacement of the pneumatic-cylinder shaft. The pressure in the vessel is also monitored. During a test, the output of the video camera, the temperatures, and the pneumatic-shaft displacement are monitored and recorded. The test is continued for a predetermined amount of time (typically, 10 minutes) or until either (1) the output of the position transducer shows a sudden change indicative of degradation of either or both specimens, (2) ignition or another significant reaction is observed, or (3) pressure in the vessel increases beyond a pre-set level that triggers an automatic shutdown...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} dynamic loading causes {{variations}} of pressure distribution between sleepers and ballast, hence {{it contributes to}} a wide range of bending moment. A train with a certain wheel load which runs at a certain speed imposes an external forces on the track. The means to withstand against this force is provided by the strength of track structure.
