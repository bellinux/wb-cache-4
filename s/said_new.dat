While in New York, Key suddenly fell ill, but recovered in time for meetings with representatives from other countries ahead of the General Assembly.|$|E

500|$|On August 24, 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million {{civil suit}} against Trump University alleging illegal {{business}} practices and false claims {{made by the}} company. Donald Trump denied the allegations, claiming the school had a 98% approval rating, and <b>said</b> <b>New</b> York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was [...] "a political hack looking to get publicity". Trump filed a complaint alleging that the state Attorney General's investigation {{was accompanied by a}} campaign donation shakedown; the complaint was investigated by a New York ethics board and dismissed in August 2015. Because of strict confidentiality laws, it is unknown whether the complaint was dismissed because Trump's claims were untrue, or because Schneiderman's alleged actions did not contravene any ethical rules.|$|E
500|$|Of all {{the songs}} {{performed}} in competition, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was given the most mixed reception. Chaney gave the song a [...] "C" [...] grade, and said that while it [...] "started strong" [...] the energy level was [...] "lacking", a word that Futterman {{used to describe the}} performance as a whole, to which she added [...] "emotionless and rushed". A diametric view of the song was evident in the [...] "A−" [...] grades given by both Slezak and Strecker, and the latter also complimented the [...] "different" [...] arrangement while both were enthusiastic about the entire set of three songs: Slezak <b>said</b> <b>New</b> Directions [...] "completely killed it", and Strecker said this song [...] "kicked off what was a truly an all-time great performance".|$|E
500|$|Other {{political}} {{thinkers and}} activists saw New Age politics less positively. [...] On the political right, author George Weigel argued that New Age politics {{was just a}} retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism. [...] Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham and Kemp, warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government. [...] On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has {{little or nothing to}} do with political change. [...] One political scientist <b>said</b> <b>New</b> Age politics fails to recognize the realitiy of economic and political power. [...] Another academic, Dana L. Cloud, wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology; she faulted it for not being opposed to the capitalist system, or to liberal individualism.|$|E

500|$|Haitian-American {{musician}} Wyclef Jean {{also serves}} as a producer. In addition, Wyclef Jean sings the first line of the second chorus in Haitian Creole. Richie <b>said</b> <b>new</b> artists were selected for the song so the song could be aimed at a new audience, commenting, [...] "We have a familiar song that kids learn in school. Why not bring in Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers and let them address the issues?" [...] adding that [...] "It was designed so that we wouldn't have any of the originals there, so that we could pass on the baton to the next generation". Phillips said that the producers received 80 percent of the people they wanted as recording artists for the song. In addition to Jean, Haitian actor Jimmy Jean-Louis, most famous for playing The Haitian on Heroes, appears in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|... 2007 saw {{the show}} undergo a revamp, which {{included}} a switch to recording in HDTV, {{the introduction of a}} new family, the departure of several existing characters and {{a new version of the}} show's familiar theme song and opening titles. In addition, episode titles were abandoned, having been in use for the previous three years. Daniel Bennett, the new head of drama at Network Ten, announced that the crux of the Ramsay Street story would go [...] "back to basics" [...] and follow a less sensational path than of late with the emphasis on family relations and suburban reality. Executive producer Ric Pellizzeri <b>said</b> <b>new</b> writers, actors and sets would bring the soap back to its glory days. He added [...] "We moved too far into event-driven stories rather than the character-driven stories that made Neighbours what it is". The relaunch failed to attract more viewers in Australia. Pellizzeri left the series at the end of 2007 and former Neighbours scriptwriter, Susan Bower, became the new executive producer. In 2008, Neighbours was branded [...] "too white" [...] by black and Asian viewers in Britain and in Australia there was talk of a [...] "White Australia policy" [...] when it came to casting actors for soaps. In response to the criticism, Bower made a decision to add more ethnically diverse extras, small walk on roles and speaking parts, as well as introducing the character of Sunny Lee (played by Hany Lee) an exchange student from South Korea.|$|E

2500|$|This {{announcement}} was reported internationally as New Zealand avoiding legally binding obligations {{and as a}} move that angered environmentalists.

The decision was also heavily criticised by the World Wildlife Fund. Prime Minister John Key <b>said</b> <b>New</b> Zealand should not lead the way on climate change, but instead be a [...] "fast follower". The Alliance of Small Island States voiced disappointment at New Zealand's decision.|$|E
2500|$|Several key {{themes of}} the novels, such as the {{rejection}} of religion and the abuse of power in a fictionalised version of the Church, were diluted in the adaptation. Director Weitz said that [...] "in the books the Magisterium is {{a version of the}} Catholic Church gone wildly astray from its roots", but that the organization portrayed in his film would not directly match that of Pullman's books. Instead, the Magisterium represents all dogmatic organizations. Weitz <b>said</b> <b>New</b> Line Cinema had feared the story's anti-religious themes would make the film financially unviable in the U.S., and so religion and God ("the Authority" [...] in the books) would not be referenced directly.|$|E
2500|$|This {{has been}} {{particularly}} problematic {{with the growth of}} the welfare state in Canada since the 1950s, resulting in the need to draw upon equalization payments to provide nationally mandated social services.

[...] Tolan once asked Horne why he {{spent so much time}} drawing and redrawing boxes in organizational charts. Horne replied, [...] "It isn't the drawing of the boxes that takes my time.

2500|$|While {{the first}} Judge Dredd story {{is set in}} [...] "New York 2099AD", prog 3 retconned that and <b>said</b> <b>New</b> York {{was just part of}} Mega-City One.

Prog 4 then established that Mega-City One was surrounded by wildernesses from the Atomic Wars. The 150 million population was later revised to 100 million in earlier strips and abruptly bumped to 800 million later on. The United States of the West concept was dropped entirely; a [...] "United Cities of North America" [...] of three megacities was mentioned in prog 42 and then itself dropped in favour of Mega-City One being an independent entity.|$|E
