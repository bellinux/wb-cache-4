40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experiment aimed at assessing {{the influence of}} auditory feedback on haptic estimation of size. Experimental subjects were instructed to explore a virtual 3 D object (a stair-step) with a haptic device, and to return a verbal estimate of the <b>step</b> <b>riser</b> height. Haptic exploration was accompanied with a real-time generated sinusoid whose pitch varied {{as a function of}} the interaction point's height within two different ranges. Experimental results show that the haptic estimation is robust and accurate regardless the frequency range of the accompanying sound...|$|E
40|$|Although {{acoustic}} frequency is not {{a spatial}} property of physical objects, in common language, pitch, i. e., the psychological correlated of frequency, is often labeled spatially (i. e., "high in pitch" or "low in pitch"). Pitch-height is known to modulate (and interact with) the response of participants when {{they are asked to}} judge spatial properties of non-auditory stimuli (e. g., visual) in a variety of behavioral tasks. In the current study we investigated whether the modulatory action of pitch-height extended to the haptic estimation of height of a virtual step. We implemented a HW/SW setup which is able to render virtual 3 D objects (stair-steps) haptically through a PHANTOM device, and to provide real-time continuous auditory feedback depending on the user interaction with the object. The haptic exploration was associated with a sinusoidal tone whose pitch varied {{as a function of the}} interaction point's height within (i) a narrower and (ii) a wider pitch range, or (iii) a random pitch variation acting as a control audio condition. Explorations were also performed with no sound (haptic only). Participants were instructed to explore the virtual step freely, and to communicate height estimation by opening their thumb and index finger to mimic the <b>step</b> <b>riser</b> height, or verbally by reporting the height in centimeters of the <b>step</b> <b>riser.</b> We analyzed the role of musical expertise by dividing participants into non-musicians and musicians. Results showed no effects of musical pitch on high-realistic haptic feedback. Overall there is no difference between the two groups in the proposed multimodal conditions. Additionally, we observed a different haptic response distribution between musicians and non-musicians when estimations of the auditory conditions are matched with estimations in the no sound condition...|$|E
40|$|Background: Falls on stairs are {{a common}} and {{dangerous}} problem for older people. This series of studies evaluated whether or not selected changes to the appearance of stairs could make them safer for older people to negotiate. Objectives: To {{determine the effect of}} (1) a step edge highlighter and its position and (2) an optimised horizontal–vertical (H–V) visual illusion placed on a <b>step</b> <b>riser</b> on gait safety during stair descent and ascent. Design: A series of studies using a repeated measures, laboratory-based design, investigating gait control and safety in independently mobile older people. Setting: The University of Bradford Vision and Mobility Laboratory. Participants: Fit and healthy older people aged 60 years of age or more, independently mobile, reasonably active and with normal healthy eyes and corrected vision. Interventions: A step edge highlighter in a variety of offsets from the stair edge and an optimised H–V visual illusion placed on the stair riser. The H–V illusion was provided on a staircase by horizontal step edge highlighters on the tread edges and vertical stripes on the step risers. Main outcome measures: Gait parameters that are important for safe stepping in ascent and descent, measured using three-dimensional lower limb segmental kinematic data...|$|E

40|$|Solifluction {{patterns}} on Lee Ridge, Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, were characterized {{through a combination}} of field transects, enhanced, digital aircraft data, and geostatistics. The objectives were to (i) assess the role of high spatial resolution digital imagery for mapping the areal extent and spatial pattern of solifluction <b>steps</b> and <b>risers</b> through digital enhancements [i. e., principal components analysis (PCA) and wavelet transforms (WTFs) ] of ADAR- 5500 aircraft imagery; (ii) describe the pattern of solifluction <b>steps</b> and <b>risers</b> through the placement of twelve 50 -m field transects oriented normal to the <b>steps</b> and <b>risers</b> and organized along an elevational gradient extending from highest to lowest positions along the ridge; (iii) define scale dependent relationships of the solifluction <b>steps</b> and <b>risers</b> mapped along one-dimensional field transects and two-dimensional remote sensing images using indicator semivariograms to define the structure of the spatial data across a range of sampled scales; and (iv) relate the solifluction patterns observed through the transects and the remote sensing interpretations to topographic trends associated with distance from the dominant peak, a proxy for elevation change along Lee Ridge. Findings suggest that the semivariance pattern of the transects changes with elevation, that is the semivariograms of the lower transects show smaller amplitudes and shorter wavelengths than those at higher elevations, and the pattern of <b>steps</b> and <b>risers</b> from the enhanced ADAR- 5500 images indicate less variation in the semivariance with elevation than represented in the field transects.

40|$|The step motions {{considered}} {{are those}} in which crystallization is controlled by a single diffusion process, either the substance diffusion for growth from solution or the flow of latent heat from the step for growth from melt. Quasi-static diffusion nearby two parallel steps and nearby a train of parallel steps is considered. Terraces and <b>step</b> <b>risers</b> are assumed flat with arbitrary angles between them. Flux of the crystallizing substance to the crystal or the heat sources on the crystal surface are nonvanishing on the <b>step</b> <b>risers</b> only. Kinematics of the steps under the diffusion interaction is investigated, when velocities of the steps are controlled by the supersaturation {{at the feet of}} the steps. For the solution growth it is shown that an equidistant train of steps is unstable against to doubling of period, i. e. neighbouring steps are attracted, when the angle of the riser is more than π/ 3. The diffusion interaction stabilizes the train of gently sloping steps. For the melt growth at equal thermal conductivities of the crystal and of the melt, the thermal interaction stabilizes the train of steps without overhanging when the riser angle is less than π/ 2. If the heat transfers through the crystals, then the equidistant train is stable at all riser angles. Comment: 15 pages, latex, 3 figures not include...|$|R

50|$|The Wave {{consists}} of intersecting U-shaped troughs {{that have been}} eroded into Navajo Sandstone of Jurassic age. The two major troughs which comprise this rock formation are 62 ft wide by 118 ft long and 7 ft wide by 52 ft long. Initially, infrequent runoff eroded these troughs along joints within the Navajo Sandstone. After their formation, the drainage basin, which fed rainwater to these troughs, shrank {{to the point that}} the runoff became insufficient to contribute to the cutting of these troughs. As a result, the troughs are now almost exclusively eroded by wind, as indicated by the orientation of erosional <b>steps</b> and <b>risers</b> cut into the sandstone along their steep walls. These erosional <b>steps</b> and <b>risers</b> are oriented relative to the predominant direction of the wind as it is now naturally funneled into and through these troughs.|$|R
50|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, maintains an excellent surface finish, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. The un-bonded sand of lost foam casting can be much simpler to maintain than green sand and resin bonded sand systems. Lost foam is generally more economical than investment casting because it involves fewer <b>steps.</b> <b>Risers</b> are not usually required {{due to the nature}} of the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification. Foam is easy to manipulate, carve and glue, due to its unique properties. The flexibility of LFC often allows for consolidating the parts into one integral component; other forming processes would require the production of one or more parts to be assembled.|$|R

40|$|Non-uniformity {{of steps}} within a flight {{is a major}} risk factor for falls. Guidelines and {{requirements}} for uniformity of <b>step</b> <b>risers</b> and tread depths assume the measurement system provides precise dimensional values. The state-of-the-art measurement system {{is a relatively new}} method, known as the nosing-to-nosing method. It involves measuring the distance between the noses of adjacent steps and the angle formed with the horizontal. From these measurements, the effective riser height and tread depth are calculated. This study was undertaken for the purpose of evaluating the measurement system to determine how much of total measurement variability comes from the step variations versus that due to repeatability and reproducibility (R 2 ̆ 6 R) associated with the measurers. Using an experimental design quality control professionals call a measurement system experiment, two measurers measured all steps in six randomly selected flights, and repeated the process on a subsequent day. After marking each step in a flight in three lateral places (left, center, and right), the measurers took their measurement. This process yielded 774 values of riser height and 672 values of tread depth. Results of applying the Gage R 2 ̆ 6 R ANOVA procedure in Minitab software indicated that the R 2 ̆ 6 R contribution to riser height variability was 1. 42...|$|R

40|$|The {{intercalated}} discs {{of working}} myocardium and Purkinje fibers of the monkey heart were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The NaOH/ultrasonication technique {{resulted in the}} digestion of connective tissue and a separation of the intercellular junctions of intercalated discs, such that these could be visualized three-dimensionally. The intercalated discs of ventricular myocytes, atrial myocytes and Purkinje fibers vary considerably in number and configuration, as do the intercalated discs of the three different layers of the ventricular myocardium. Myocytes in the subepicardial, middle and subendocardial layers of the ventricle have 1 - 3, 4 - 5 and 5 - 6 intercalated discs {{at the end of}} these cells, respectively, Those in the endocardial layer are characterized by the presence of small laterally-placed intercalated discs. Atrial myocytes and Purkinje fibers usually only have 1 - 2 intercalated discs, Individual intercalated discs in ventricular myocytes have complicated stairs with 10 - 30 <b>steps</b> and corresponding <b>risers,</b> while those of atrial myocytes and Purkinje fibers have simple stairs with 1 - 3 <b>steps</b> and <b>risers,</b> <b>Steps</b> equivalent to the plicate segments are characterized by densely-packed microplicae and finger-like microprojections which greatly increase surface area in vertricular myocytes, Microprojections in atrial myocytes and Purkinje fibers are sparse by comparison, Risers equivalent to the interplicate segments containing large gap junctional areas are most numerous in left ventricular myocytes, followed by right ventricular myocytes, Purkinje fibers and atrial myocytes in decreasing order. The geometric arrangement of the various types of myocytes may be related with impulse propagation. Large intercalated discs of cell trunks and series branches may participate in longitudinal propagation, while small laterally-placed ones may be the site of transverse propagation...|$|R

40|$|Shore {{platforms}} frequently exhibit <b>steps</b> or <b>risers</b> facing seaward, landwards or obliquely across-shore. A {{combination of}} soft copy photogrammetry, ortho-rectification, geo referencing and field measurement of step height are linked in a GIS environment to measure step retreat on chalk shore platforms at sample {{sites in the}} south of England over two periods, 19732001, 20012007. The methods used allow for the identification, delineation and measurement of historic change at high spatial resolution. The results suggest that while erosion of chalk shore platforms by step backwearing is highly variable, it appears to be of similar magnitude to surface downwearing of the same platforms measured by micro-erosion meters (MEMs) and laser scanning, in a range equivalent to 00006 00050 my- 1 of surface downwearing. This equates to annual chalk volume loss from the platforms, by the two erosion processes combined, of between 00012 m 3 m- 2 and 00100 m 3 m- 2. Results from the more recent years' data suggests that step retreat has variability in both space and time which does not relate solely to climatic variability. The results must be viewed with caution until much larger numbers of measurements have been made of both downwearing and step erosion at higher spatial and temporal resolution...|$|R

The <b>riser,</b> 28 mm in diameter, 13. 12 m long and with a mass ratio (mass/displaced mass) of 3. 0, was tested in conditions in which the lower 45 % of it was exposed to a uniform current at speeds up to 1 m/s, while the upper part was in still water. Its response in in-line and transverse directions was inferred from measurements of bending strains at 32 points along its length. Transverse vibrations were observed at modes up to the 8 th with individual modal amplitudes up to about 80 % of the riser’s diameter. However, {{in most cases the}} response included significant contributions from several modes, all at the same frequency. Some evidence was found of lock-in...|$|R
40|$|Turf-banked {{terraces}} in {{the alpine}} tundra of Glacier National Park, Montana, are typically characterized by alternating stripes of flat, stone-covered treads or <b>steps</b> and angled <b>risers</b> covered by alpine tundra vegetation. Previous research {{has suggested that}} the presence of turf-banked terraces is controlled by local environmental settings, particularly, topographic conditions. In this research, regression analysis is used to assess the correlations between turf-banked terrace characteristics and a set of hypothesized environmental controls. Measures of turf-banked terraces include the widths and standard deviations of treads, risers, and all stripes measured at 55 areally distributed 50 -m field transects; the ratio of riser width to tread width; and a set of four one-dimensional pattern metrics that assess the spatial structure of the tread/riser sequences. These measures were derived using a run-length approach for field transects distributed in basins located throughout {{the eastern side of the}} Continental Divide. The environmental variables, generated from a 10 -m spatial resolution digital elevation model (DEM), include elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, slope curvature, and soil moisture potential. Our results show that several turf-banked terrace characteristics are significantly correlated with individual environmental variables; stronger relationships are found when turf-banked terrace characteristics are related to transformed (i. e., principal components analysis) environmental variables using multiple regression analysis...|$|R
