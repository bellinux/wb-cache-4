While such lending has benefitted millions of borrowers, major lending institutions have acknowledged their limited impact among the very poor and have recently favored individual contracts. This paper attempts to understand these empirical patterns using a model {{in which there is}} a single investment project and access to credit is limited by weak repayment incentives. We show that in the absence of large <b>social</b> <b>sanctions,</b> the poorest borrowers are offered individual and not group contracts. When both types of contracts are feasible, the relative gains from group loans are shown to be decreasing in loan size. We compare the role of bank enforcement with <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> and find that bank enforcement is more effective in increasing outreach while <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> raise the welfare of infra-marginal borrowers. Finally, we explore the welfare effects of group size and find that those requiring small loans are better served by larger groups but group size effects are, in general, ambiguous. group lending; joint-liability; microcredit; repayment incentives; <b>social</b> <b>sanctions.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Another view distinguishes {{individual}} {{religious belief}} from collective religious belief. While the former {{does not require}} prior development of language, the latter does. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief.

50|$|Another view {{is based}} on the concept of the triune brain: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, {{proposed}} by Paul D. MacLean.

40|$|Abstract. The use of <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> against {{behaviour}} which contradicts a set {{of informal}} rules is often {{an important element in}} the functioning of informal institutions in traditional societies. In the <b>social</b> sciences, <b>sanctioning</b> behaviour has often been explained in terms of the internalisation of norms that prescribe the sanctions (e. g. Parsons 1951) or the threat of new sanctions against those who do not follow sanctioning behaviour (e. g. Akerlof 1976). We propose an alternative mechanism for maintaining a credible threat of <b>social</b> <b>sanctions,</b> showing that even in a population where individuals have not internalised {{a set of}} social norms, do not believe that others have internalised them, do not believe that others believe that others have internalised these norms, etc., up to a finite nth order, collective participation in <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> against behaviour which contradict the norms is an equilibrium if such beliefs exist at higher orders. The equilibrium can persist even if beliefs change over time, as long as the norms are believed to have been internalised at some finite nth order. The framework shows how precisely beliefs must change for the equilibrium to unravel and social norms to evolve...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of business entertainment in economic life, nearly all studies on the phenomenon have explored it from a social perspective by labeling it as a social vice. Although a few scholarly works have identified the role of business entertainment in facilitating exchange relationships; none of them has offered a systematic explanation of how business entertainment plays such a role. Meanwhile, despite some scholars’ recognition {{of the role of}} <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> in regulating economic activities, virtually none of them has explored the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> and business entertainment. This dissertation aims to bridge these gaps by arguing that business entertainment plays a governance role by reinforcing <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> to regulate economic transactions. Drawing on theories from the literatures on economics, business management, anthropology, sociology, and psychology, I start with the proposition that each society during its evolution forms a transaction governance structure (TGS) featuring a unique combination of market, <b>social,</b> and legal <b>sanctions</b> in regulating economic relationships. Depending on their social and cultural heritages, some societies rely more on <b>social</b> <b>sanctions,</b> and others more on legal sanctions, to compensate for the failure of market sanctions. I further argue that underdeveloped market and legal infrastructures are associated with prevalent practice of business entertainment because the latter plays a role in reinforcing <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> that supplement market sanctions. These arguments set up a theoretical framework for systematically explaining the social practice of entertainment in business settings from a perspective of economic transaction governance. To verify the above arguments, I derived two sets of hypotheses and conducted two empirical tests within the Chinese context: one to predict the pervasiveness of business entertainment at the firm level, using secondary data collected from firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in China; the other to test the effectiveness of business entertainment at the transaction level, with primary survey data collected from a sample of Chinese corporate client sales managers. Statistical results from both tests provide support for my transaction governance approach to business entertainment...|$|R
