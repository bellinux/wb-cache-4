5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} mind (ToM) {{impairment}} describes a difficulty <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> with perspective-taking. This is also {{sometimes referred to}} as mind-blindness. This means that individuals with a ToM impairment would have a difficult time seeing phenomena from any other perspective than their own. Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity. ToM deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders, people with schizophrenia, people with nonverbal learning disorder, people with attention deficit disorder, persons {{under the influence of alcohol}} and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.|$|E

500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them... {{but a lot of people}} just don't like it." [...] Carl Wilson reflected on the period: [...] "To get that album [...] out, <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's no wonder the project didn't get done." ...|$|E

[...] I did take the trouble to question my orthodox rabbi nephew to find what might be behind such tall tales. He had no clue. If orthodox Jews were actually taught such hateful things, surely <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> heard. Whom is Dr. Shahak kidding?.|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time as he was {{attending}} the Cambridge British Association meeting in 1862, instalments of Charles Kingsley's story for children The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby were being published in Macmillan's Magazine as a serial. Kingsley incorporated material modified from his skit about Dundreary's speech On the Great Hippocampus Question, as well as other references to the protagonists, the British Association, and notable scientists of the day. When the protagonist Tom is turned into a water-baby by the fairies, the question is raised that if there were water-babies, surely <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> caught one and [...] "put it into spirits, or into the Illustrated News, or perhaps cut it into two halves, poor dear little thing, and sent one to Professor Owen, and one to Professor Huxley, to see what they would each say about it."

2500|$|Eventually, {{however, the}} massive profits of drugs proved irresistible. According to Kevin Weeks, Jimmy, Stevie and I weren't in the import {{business}} and weren't {{bringing in the}} marijuana or the cocaine. We were in the shakedown business. We didn't bring drugs in; we took money off the people who did. We never dealt with the street dealers, but rather with a dozen large-scale drug distributors all over the State who were bringing in the coke and marijuana and paying hundreds of thousands to Jimmy. The dealers {{on the street corner}} sold eight-balls, ...grams, and half grams to customers for their personal use. They were supplied by the mid level drug dealer who was selling them multiple ounces. In other words, the big importers gave it to the major distributors, who sold it to the middlemen, who then sold it to the street dealers. In order to get to Jimmy, Stevie, and me, <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to go through those four layers of insulation.|$|E
2500|$|According to James Longuski (Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at Purdue University), the {{conspiracy}} theories are impossible {{because of their}} size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people {{who worked on the}} Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as Command Module pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon. Hundreds of thousands of people – including astronauts, scientists, engineers, technicians, and skilled laborers – would have had to keep the secret. Longuski argues {{that it would have been}} much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings. To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA who would have had a link to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. Penn Jillette made note of this in the [...] "Conspiracy Theories" [...] episode of his contrarian television show [...] in 2005. With the number of people involved, and noting the Watergate scandal, Jillette noted that <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> outed the hoax by now.|$|E

40|$|Conditional sentences, canonically of {{the form}} "if p, q", whisk us away to a {{scenario}} described by their antecedent and then make a claim {{about it in the}} consequent. There are two main kinds of conditionals, as illustrated in the well-known Oswald/Kennedy minimal pair (due to Adams 1970) : (1) If Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, somebody else did. (2) If Oswald hadn't killed Kennedy, <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> <b>have.</b> Clearly, the two conditionals differ in meaning. The conditional in (1) signals that it is an open possibility that Oswald didn't kill Kennedy and will be judged true by anyone who knows that Kennedy was in fact assassinated. The conditional in (2), in contrast, signals that it is taken for granted that Oswald did in fact kill Kennedy and makes the somewhat dubious claim that Kennedy's assassination was inevitable, perhaps based on a vast conspiracy. The same difference in meaning can be illustrated with a similar pair (due to Bennett or Stalnaker?), where it is even harder to hear the second conditional as making a plausible claim: (3) If Shakespeare didn't write Hamlet, someone else did. (4) If Shakespeare hadn't written Hamlet, <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> <b>have.</b> This chapter will be concerned with the meaning of conditionals of the second kind...|$|R
