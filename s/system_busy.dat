40|$|This paper {{provides}} an authoritative knowledge of through-router packet delays {{and therefore a}} better understanding of data network performance. Thanks to a unique experimental setup, we capture all packets crossing a router for 13 hours and present detailed statis-tics of their delays. These measurements allow us to build the fol-lowing physical model for router performance: each packet expe-riences a minimum router processing time before entering a fluid output queue. Although simple, this model reproduces the router behaviour with excellent accuracy and avoids two common pitfalls. First we show that in-router packet processing time accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} overall packet delay and should not be neglected. Second we point out that one should fully understand both link and physical layer characteristics to use the appropriate bandwidth value. Focusing directly on router performance, we provide insights into <b>system</b> <b>busy</b> periods and show precisely how queues build up inside a router. We explain why current practices for inferring de-lays based on average utilization have fundamental problems, and propose an alternative solution to directly report router delay infor-mation based on busy period statistics...|$|E
30|$|The {{information}} contained in the CST is used to estimate the PU traffic and the <b>system</b> <b>busy</b> time. Nevertheless, in OC-MAC there are some critical design flaws which make it inappropriate for CR nodes. First, the OC-MAC employs a dedicated control channel which is used for exchange of RTS/CTS and CRTS, but no description of the dedicated control channel is provided. Secondly, in OC-MAC length of the spectrum hole is predicted by the CR nodes, but this prediction is strongly criticized. Because in order to calculate the length of available spectrum hole, first the exact time interval during which the PU is not utilizing the spectrum needs to be found, which is very difficult {{in case of an}} opportunistic network. Lastly, the protocol claims that CR nodes co-exist with a WLAN, however, the justification for this is neither clearly presented in the paper nor do we believe it, because WLANs use the ISM band (e.g., 2.4  GHz) that is already freely available for any user. In ISM band {{there is no need to}} seize the opportunity to transmit, and nodes only need to contend.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel attack {{targeting}} anonymizing systems. The attack involves placing a malicious relay node inside an anonymizing system and keeping legitimate nodes “busy. ” We achieve this by creating circular circuits and injecting fraudulent packets, crafted {{in a way}} that will make them spin an arbitrary number of times inside our artificial loops. At the same time we inject a small number of malicious nodes that we control into the anonymizing system. By keeping a significant part of the anonymizing <b>system</b> <b>busy</b> spinning useless packets, we increase the probability of having our nodes selected in the creation of legitimate circuits, since we have more free capacity to route requests than the legitimate nodes. This technique may lead to the compromise of the anonymity of people using the system. To evaluate our novel attack, we used a real-world anonymizing system, TOR. We show that an anonymizing system that is composed of a series of relay nodes which perform cryptographic operations is vulnerable to our packet spinning attack. Our evaluation focuses on determining the cost we can introduce to the legitimate nodes by injecting the fraudulent packets, and the time required for a malicious client to create n-length TOR circuits. Furthermore we prove that routers that are involved in packet spinning do not have the capacity to process requests for the creation of new circuits and thus users are forced to select our malicious nodes for routing their data streams...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} a special discrete-time queuing system with two head-of-line (HOL) priority queues and {{a mix of}} correlated and uncor-related arrivals. The arrival process to the high priority queue is correlated and consists of a train of a fixed number of fixed-length packets, while the low pri-ority traffic consists of batch arrivals that are independent and identically dis-tributed from slot-to-slot. We derive an expression for the functional equation describing the transient evolution of this priority queuing system. This func-tional equation is then manipulated and transformed into a mathematical tracta-ble form. By applying the final-value theorem, the corresponding exact expres-sions for the steady-state marginal pgfs are derived. We also show how the tran-sient analysis provides insights into the derivation of the <b>system’s</b> <b>busy</b> period distribution. Finally, we illustrate our solution technique with some numerical examples, whereby we demonstrate the negative effect of correlation (in the high-priority queue) {{on the performance of}} the low-priority queue. ...|$|R
